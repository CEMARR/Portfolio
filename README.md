# Portfolio
Finalized* Projects

Hi, and thanks for spending some of your all-too-limited attention on my portfolio.

Here, you'll find samples of my coding and data science work - projects that were completed as part of General Assembly's Data Science Immersive course in Washington, D.C. The directories include final Jupyter Notebook files with code, the datasets the code was built on, and the presentations that accompanied each project.

There are TK projects here.
  1) Project 2
  2) Project 3
  3) Project 4
  4) Project 5 - Kaggle
  5) Capstone Project

  * Insofar as any project is really finalized
