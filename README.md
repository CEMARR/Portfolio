Data Science Immersive Projects

Here, you'll find samples of my coding and data science work - projects that were completed as part of General Assembly's Data Science Immersive course in Washington, D.C. The directories include final Jupyter Notebook files with code, the datasets the code was built on, and the presentations that accompanied each project.

There are five DSI projects here:
  * DSI - Iowa liquor sales revenue analysis
  * DSI - Credit default classification
  * DSI - Indeed.com Data Science scraping
  * DSI - Michelin Stars Challenge
  * DSI Capstone - Debunking Spurious Quotations
