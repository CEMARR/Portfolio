0,"[This book is a record of a pleasure trip., If it were a record of a solemn scientific expedition, it would have about it that gravity, that profundity, and that impressive incomprehensibility which are so proper to works of that kind, and withal so attractive., Yet notwithstanding it is only a record of a pic-nic, it has a purpose, which is to suggest to the reader how he would be likely to see Europe and the East if he looked at them with his own eyes instead of the eyes of those who traveled in those countries before him., I make small pretense of showing anyone how he ought to look at objects of interest beyond the sea--other books do that, and therefore, even if I were competent to do it, there is no need., I offer no apologies for any departures from the usual style of travel-writing that may be charged against me--for I think I have seen with impartial eyes, and I am sure I have written at least honestly, whether wisely or not., In this volume I have used portions of letters which I wrote for the Daily Alta California, of San Francisco, the proprietors of that journal having waived their rights and given me the necessary permission., I have also inserted portions of several letters written for the New York Tribune and the New York Herald., For months the great pleasure excursion to Europe and the Holy Land was chatted about in the newspapers everywhere in America and discussed at countless firesides., It was a novelty in the way of excursions--its like had not been thought of before, and it compelled that interest which attractive novelties always command., It was to be a picnic on a gigantic scale., The participants in it, instead of freighting an ungainly steam ferry--boat with youth and beauty and pies and doughnuts, and paddling up some obscure creek to disembark upon a grassy lawn and wear themselves out with a long summer day's laborious frolicking under the impression that it was fun, were to sail away in a great steamship with flags flying and cannon pealing, and take a royal holiday beyond the broad ocean in many a strange clime and in many a land renowned in history!, They were to sail for months over the breezy Atlantic and the sunny Mediterranean; they were to scamper about the decks by day, filling the ship with shouts and laughter--or read novels and poetry in the shade of the smokestacks, or watch for the jelly-fish and the nautilus over the side, and the shark, the whale, and other strange monsters of the deep; and at night they were to dance in the open air, on the upper deck, in the midst of a ballroom that stretched from horizon to horizon, and was domed by the bending heavens and lighted by no meaner lamps than the stars and the magnificent moon--dance, and promenade, and smoke, and sing, and make love, and search the skies for constellations that never associate with the ""Big Dipper"" they were so tired of; and they were to see the ships of twenty navies--the customs and costumes of twenty curious peoples--the great cities of half a world--they were to hob-nob with nobility and hold friendly converse with kings and princes, grand moguls, and the anointed lords of mighty empires!, It was a brave conception; it was the offspring of a most ingenious brain., It was well advertised, but it hardly needed it: the bold originality, the extraordinary character, the seductive nature, and the vastness of the enterprise provoked comment everywhere and advertised it in every household in the land., Who could read the program of the excursion without longing to make one of the party?, I will insert it here., It is almost as good as a map., As a text for this book, nothing could be better:  What was there lacking about that program to make it perfectly irresistible?, Nothing that any finite mind could discover., Paris, England, Scotland, Switzerland, Italy--Garibaldi!, The Grecian Archipelago!, Vesuvius!, Constantinople!, Smyrna!, The Holy Land!, Egypt and ""our friends the Bermudians""!, People in Europe desiring to join the excursion--contagious sickness to be avoided--boating at the expense of the ship--physician on board--the circuit of the globe to be made if the passengers unanimously desired it--the company to be rigidly selected by a pitiless ""Committee on Applications""--the vessel to be as rigidly selected by as pitiless a ""Committee on Selecting Steamer."", Human nature could not withstand these bewildering temptations., I hurried to the treasurer's office and deposited my ten percent., I rejoiced to know that a few vacant staterooms were still left., I did avoid a critical personal examination into my character by that bowelless committee, but I referred to all the people of high standing I could think of in the community who would be least likely to know anything about me., Shortly a supplementary program was issued which set forth that the Plymouth Collection of Hymns would be used on board the ship., I then paid the balance of my passage money., I was provided with a receipt and duly and officially accepted as an excursionist., There was happiness in that but it was tame compared to the novelty of being ""select."", This supplementary program also instructed the excursionists to provide themselves with light musical instruments for amusement in the ship, with saddles for Syrian travel, green spectacles and umbrellas, veils for Egypt, and substantial clothing to use in rough pilgrimizing in the Holy Land., Furthermore, it was suggested that although the ship's library would afford a fair amount of reading matter, it would still be well if each passenger would provide himself with a few guidebooks, a Bible, and some standard works of travel., A list was appended, which consisted chiefly of books relating to the Holy Land, since the Holy Land was part of the excursion and seemed to be its main feature., Reverend Henry Ward Beecher was to have accompanied the expedition, but urgent duties obliged him to give up the idea., There were other passengers who could have been spared better and would have been spared more willingly., Lieutenant General Sherman was to have been of the party also, but the Indian war compelled his presence on the plains., A popular actress had entered her name on the ship's books, but something interfered and she couldn't go., The ""Drummer Boy of the Potomac"" deserted, and lo, we had never a celebrity left!, However, we were to have a ""battery of guns"" from the Navy Department (as per advertisement) to be used in answering royal salutes; and the document furnished by the Secretary of the Navy, which was to make ""General Sherman and party"" welcome guests in the courts and camps of the old world, was still left to us, though both document and battery, I think, were shorn of somewhat of their original august proportions., However, had not we the seductive program still, with its Paris, its Constantinople, Smyrna, Jerusalem, Jericho, and ""our friends the Bermudians?"", What did we care?, Occasionally, during the following month, I dropped in at 117 Wall Street to inquire how the repairing and refurnishing of the vessel was coming on, how additions to the passenger list were averaging, how many people the committee were decreeing not ""select"" every day and banishing in sorrow and tribulation., I was glad to know that we were to have a little printing press on board and issue a daily newspaper of our own., I was glad to learn that our piano, our parlor organ, and our melodeon were to be the best instruments of the kind that could be had in the market., I was proud to observe that among our excursionists were three ministers of the gospel, eight doctors, sixteen or eighteen ladies, several military and naval chieftains with sounding titles, an ample crop of ""Professors"" of various kinds, and a gentleman who had ""COMMISSIONER OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA TO EUROPE, ASIA, AND AFRICA"" thundering after his name in one awful blast!, I had carefully prepared myself to take rather a back seat in that ship because of the uncommonly select material that would alone be permitted to pass through the camel's eye of that committee on credentials; I had schooled myself to expect an imposing array of military and naval heroes and to have to set that back seat still further back in consequence of it maybe; but I state frankly that I was all unprepared for this crusher., I fell under that titular avalanche a torn and blighted thing., I said that if that potentate must go over in our ship, why, I supposed he must --but that to my thinking, when the United States considered it necessary to send a dignitary of that tonnage across the ocean, it would be in better taste, and safer, to take him apart and cart him over in sections in several ships., Ah, if I had only known then that he was only a common mortal, and that his mission had nothing more overpowering about it than the collecting of seeds and uncommon yams and extraordinary cabbages and peculiar bullfrogs for that poor, useless, innocent, mildewed old fossil the Smithsonian Institute, I would have felt so much relieved., During that memorable month I basked in the happiness of being for once in my life drifting with the tide of a great popular movement., Everybody was going to Europe--I, too, was going to Europe., Everybody was going to the famous Paris Exposition--I, too, was going to the Paris Exposition., The steamship lines were carrying Americans out of the various ports of the country at the rate of four or five thousand a week in the aggregate., If I met a dozen individuals during that month who were not going to Europe shortly, I have no distinct remembrance of it now., I walked about the city a good deal with a young Mr.  Blucher, who was booked for the excursion., He was confiding, good-natured, unsophisticated, companionable; but he was not a man to set the river on fire., He had the most extraordinary notions about this European exodus and came at last to consider the whole nation as packing up for emigration to France., We stepped into a store on Broadway one day, where he bought a handkerchief, and when the man could not make change, Mr. B. said:  ""Never mind, I'll hand it to you in Paris."", ""But I am not going to Paris."", ""How is--what did I understand you to say?"", ""I said I am not going to Paris."", ""Not going to Paris!, Not g---- well, then, where in the nation are you going to?"", ""Nowhere at all."", ""Not anywhere whatsoever?--not any place on earth but this?"", ""Not any place at all but just this--stay here all summer."", My comrade took his purchase and walked out of the store without a word --walked out with an injured look upon his countenance., Up the street apiece he broke silence and said impressively: ""It was a lie--that is my opinion of it!"", In the fullness of time the ship was ready to receive her passengers., I was introduced to the young gentleman who was to be my roommate, and found him to be intelligent, cheerful of spirit, unselfish, full of generous impulses, patient, considerate, and wonderfully good-natured., Not any passenger that sailed in the Quaker City will withhold his endorsement of what I have just said., We selected a stateroom forward of the wheel, on the starboard side, ""below decks."", It bad two berths in it, a dismal dead-light, a sink with a washbowl in it, and a long, sumptuously cushioned locker, which was to do service as a sofa--partly --and partly as a hiding place for our things., Notwithstanding all this furniture, there was still room to turn around in, but not to swing a cat in, at least with entire security to the cat., However, the room was large, for a ship's stateroom, and was in every way satisfactory., The vessel was appointed to sail on a certain Saturday early in June., A little after noon on that distinguished Saturday I reached the ship and went on board., All was bustle and confusion., [I have seen that remark before somewhere.], The pier was crowded with carriages and men; passengers were arriving and hurrying on board; the vessel's decks were encumbered with trunks and valises; groups of excursionists, arrayed in unattractive traveling costumes, were moping about in a drizzling rain and looking as droopy and woebegone as so many molting chickens., The gallant flag was up, but it was under the spell, too, and hung limp and disheartened by the mast., Altogether, it was the bluest, bluest spectacle!, It was a pleasure excursion--there was no gainsaying that, because the program said so--it was so nominated in the bond--but it surely hadn't the general aspect of one., Finally, above the banging, and rumbling, and shouting, and hissing of steam rang the order to ""cast off!"", --a sudden rush to the gangways--a scampering ashore of visitors-a revolution of the wheels, and we were off--the pic-nic was begun!, Two very mild cheers went up from the dripping crowd on the pier; we answered them gently from the slippery decks; the flag made an effort to wave, and failed; the ""battery of guns"" spake not--the ammunition was out., We steamed down to the foot of the harbor and came to anchor., It was still raining., And not only raining, but storming., ""Outside"" we could see, ourselves, that there was a tremendous sea on., We must lie still, in the calm harbor, till the storm should abate., Our passengers hailed from fifteen states; only a few of them had ever been to sea before; manifestly it would not do to pit them against a full-blown tempest until they had got their sea-legs on., Toward evening the two steam tugs that had accompanied us with a rollicking champagne-party of young New Yorkers on board who wished to bid farewell to one of our number in due and ancient form departed, and we were alone on the deep., On deep five fathoms, and anchored fast to the bottom., And out in the solemn rain, at that., ...]",1
1,"[I discovered that if I were to stay there a month, I should still find myself looking at the people instead of the inanimate objects on exhibition., I got a little interested in some curious old tapestries of the thirteenth century, but a party of Arabs came by, and their dusky faces and quaint costumes called my attention away at once., I watched a silver swan, which had a living grace about his movements and a living intelligence in his eyes--watched him swimming about as comfortably and as unconcernedly as if he had been born in a morass instead of a jeweler's shop--watched him seize a silver fish from under the water and hold up his head and go through all the customary and elaborate motions of swallowing it--but the moment it disappeared down his throat some tattooed South Sea Islanders approached and I yielded to their attractions., Presently I found a revolving pistol several hundred years old which looked strangely like a modern Colt, but just then I heard that the Empress of the French was in another part of the building, and hastened away to see what she might look like., We heard martial music--we saw an unusual number of soldiers walking hurriedly about--there was a general movement among the people., We inquired what it was all about and learned that the Emperor of the French and the Sultan of Turkey were about to review twenty-five thousand troops at the Arc de l'Etoile., We immediately departed., I had a greater anxiety to see these men than I could have had to see twenty expositions., We drove away and took up a position in an open space opposite the American minister's house., A speculator bridged a couple of barrels with a board and we hired standing places on it., Presently there was a sound of distant music; in another minute a pillar of dust came moving slowly toward us; a moment more and then, with colors flying and a grand crash of military music, a gallant array of cavalrymen emerged from the dust and came down the street on a gentle trot., After them came a long line of artillery; then more cavalry, in splendid uniforms; and then their imperial majesties Napoleon III and Abdul Aziz., The vast concourse of people swung their hats and shouted--the windows and housetops in the wide vicinity burst into a snowstorm of waving handkerchiefs, and the wavers of the same mingled their cheers with those of the masses below., It was a stirring spectacle., But the two central figures claimed all my attention., Was ever such a contrast set up before a multitude till then?, Napoleon in military uniform--a long-bodied, short-legged man, fiercely moustached, old, wrinkled, with eyes half closed, and such a deep, crafty, scheming expression about them!--Napoleon, bowing ever so gently to the loud plaudits, and watching everything and everybody with his cat eyes from under his depressed hat brim, as if to discover any sign that those cheers were not heartfelt and cordial., Abdul Aziz, absolute lord of the Ottoman empire--clad in dark green European clothes, almost without ornament or insignia of rank; a red Turkish fez on his head; a short, stout, dark man, black-bearded, black-eyed, stupid, unprepossessing--a man whose whole appearance somehow suggested that if he only had a cleaver in his hand and a white apron on, one would not be at all surprised to hear him say: ""A mutton roast today, or will you have a nice porterhouse steak?"", Napoleon III, the representative of the highest modern civilization, progress, and refinement; Abdul-Aziz, the representative of a people by nature and training filthy, brutish, ignorant, unprogressive, superstitious--and a government whose Three Graces are Tyranny, Rapacity, Blood., Here in brilliant Paris, under this majestic Arch of Triumph, the First Century greets the Nineteenth!, NAPOLEON III., Emperor of France!, Surrounded by shouting thousands, by military pomp, by the splendors of his capital city, and companioned by kings and princes--this is the man who was sneered at and reviled and called Bastard--yet who was dreaming of a crown and an empire all the while; who was driven into exile--but carried his dreams with him; who associated with the common herd in America and ran foot races for a wager--but still sat upon a throne in fancy; who braved every danger to go to his dying mother--and grieved that she could not be spared to see him cast aside his plebeian vestments for the purple of royalty; who kept his faithful watch and walked his weary beat a common policeman of London--but dreamed the while of a coming night when he should tread the long-drawn corridors of the Tuileries; who made the miserable fiasco of Strasbourg; saw his poor, shabby eagle, forgetful of its lesson, refuse to perch upon his shoulder; delivered his carefully prepared, sententious burst of eloquence upon unsympathetic ears; found himself a prisoner, the butt of small wits, a mark for the pitiless ridicule of all the world --yet went on dreaming of coronations and splendid pageants as before; who lay a forgotten captive in the dungeons of Ham--and still schemed and planned and pondered over future glory and future power; President of France at last!, a coup d'etat, and surrounded by applauding armies, welcomed by the thunders of cannon, he mounts a throne and waves before an astounded world the sceptre of a mighty empire!, Who talks of the marvels of fiction?, Who speaks of the wonders of romance?, Who prates of the tame achievements of Aladdin and the Magii of Arabia?, ABDUL-AZIZ, Sultan of Turkey, Lord of the Ottoman Empire!, Born to a throne; weak, stupid, ignorant, almost, as his meanest slave; chief of a vast royalty, yet the puppet of his Premier and the obedient child of a tyrannical mother; a man who sits upon a throne--the beck of whose finger moves navies and armies--who holds in his hands the power of life and death over millions--yet who sleeps, sleeps, eats, eats, idles with his eight hundred concubines, and when he is surfeited with eating and sleeping and idling, and would rouse up and take the reins of government and threaten to be a sultan, is charmed from his purpose by wary Fuad Pacha with a pretty plan for a new palace or a new ship--charmed away with a new toy, like any other restless child; a man who sees his people robbed and oppressed by soulless tax-gatherers, but speaks no word to save them; who believes in gnomes and genii and the wild fables of The Arabian Nights, but has small regard for the mighty magicians of to-day, and is nervous in the presence of their mysterious railroads and steamboats and telegraphs; who would see undone in Egypt all that great Mehemet Ali achieved, and would prefer rather to forget than emulate him; a man who found his great empire a blot upon the earth--a degraded, poverty-stricken, miserable, infamous agglomeration of ignorance, crime, and brutality--and will idle away the allotted days of his trivial life and then pass to the dust and the worms and leave it so!, Napoleon has augmented the commercial prosperity of France in ten years to such a degree that figures can hardly compute it., He has rebuilt Paris and has partly rebuilt every city in the state., He condemns a whole street at a time, assesses the damages, pays them, and rebuilds superbly., Then speculators buy up the ground and sell, but the original owner is given the first choice by the government at a stated price before the speculator is permitted to purchase., But above all things, he has taken the sole control of the empire of France into his hands and made it a tolerably free land--for people who will not attempt to go too far in meddling with government affairs., No country offers greater security to life and property than France, and one has all the freedom he wants, but no license--no license to interfere with anybody or make anyone uncomfortable., As for the Sultan, one could set a trap any where and catch a dozen abler men in a night., The bands struck up, and the brilliant adventurer, Napoleon III., the genius of Energy, Persistence, Enterprise; and the feeble Abdul-Aziz, the genius of Ignorance, Bigotry, and Indolence, prepared for the Forward --March!, We saw the splendid review, we saw the white-moustached old Crimean soldier, Canrobert, Marshal of France, we saw--well, we saw every thing, and then we went home satisfied., We went to see the Cathedral of Notre Dame., We had heard of it before., It surprises me sometimes to think how much we do know and how intelligent we are., We recognized the brown old Gothic pile in a moment; it was like the pictures., We stood at a little distance and changed from one point of observation to another and gazed long at its lofty square towers and its rich front, clustered thick with stony, mutilated saints who had been looking calmly down from their perches for ages., The Patriarch of Jerusalem stood under them in the old days of chivalry and romance, and preached the third Crusade, more than six hundred years ago; and since that day they have stood there and looked quietly down upon the most thrilling scenes, the grandest pageants, the most extraordinary spectacles that have grieved or delighted Paris., These battered and broken-nosed old fellows saw many and many a cavalcade of mail-clad knights come marching home from Holy Land; they heard the bells above them toll the signal for the St. Bartholomew's Massacre, and they saw the slaughter that followed; later they saw the Reign of Terror, the carnage of the Revolution, the overthrow of a king, the coronation of two Napoleons, the christening of the young prince that lords it over a regiment of servants in the Tuileries to-day--and they may possibly continue to stand there until they see the Napoleon dynasty swept away and the banners of a great republic floating above its ruins., I wish these old parties could speak., They could tell a tale worth the listening to., They say that a pagan temple stood where Notre Dame now stands, in the old Roman days, eighteen or twenty centuries ago--remains of it are still preserved in Paris; and that a Christian church took its place about A.D. 300; another took the place of that in A.D. 500; and that the foundations of the present cathedral were laid about A.D. 1100., The ground ought to be measurably sacred by this time, one would think., One portion of this noble old edifice is suggestive of the quaint fashions of ancient times., It was built by Jean Sans-Peur, Duke of Burgundy, to set his conscience at rest--he had assassinated the Duke of Orleans., Alas!, Those good old times are gone when a murderer could wipe the stain from his name and soothe his troubles to sleep simply by getting out his bricks and mortar and building an addition to a church., The portals of the great western front are bisected by square pillars., They took the central one away in 1852, on the occasion of thanksgivings for the reinstitution of the presidential power--but precious soon they had occasion to reconsider that motion and put it back again!, And they did., We loitered through the grand aisles for an hour or two, staring up at the rich stained-glass windows embellished with blue and yellow and crimson saints and martyrs, and trying to admire the numberless great pictures in the chapels, and then we were admitted to the sacristy and shown the magnificent robes which the Pope wore when he crowned Napoleon I; a wagon-load of solid gold and silver utensils used in the great public processions and ceremonies of the church; some nails of the true cross, a fragment of the cross itself, a part of the crown of thorns., We had already seen a large piece of the true cross in a church in the Azores, but no nails., They showed us likewise the bloody robe which that archbishop of Paris wore who exposed his sacred person and braved the wrath of the insurgents of 1848, to mount the barricades and hold aloft the olive branch of peace in the hope of stopping the slaughter., His noble effort cost him his life., He was shot dead., They showed us a cast of his face taken after death, the bullet that killed him, and the two vertebrae in which it lodged., These people have a somewhat singular taste in the matter of relics., Ferguson told us that the silver cross which the good archbishop wore at his girdle was seized and thrown into the Seine, where it lay embedded in the mud for fifteen years, and then an angel appeared to a priest and told him where to dive for it; he did dive for it and got it, and now it is there on exhibition at Notre Dame, to be inspected by anybody who feels an interest in inanimate objects of miraculous intervention., Next we went to visit the Morgue, that horrible receptacle for the dead who die mysteriously and leave the manner of their taking off a dismal secret., We stood before a grating and looked through into a room which was hung all about with the clothing of dead men; coarse blouses, water-soaked; the delicate garments of women and children; patrician vestments, hacked and stabbed and stained with red; a hat that was crushed and bloody., On a slanting stone lay a drowned man, naked, swollen, purple; clasping the fragment of a broken bush with a grip which death had so petrified that human strength could not unloose it --mute witness of the last despairing effort to save the life that was doomed beyond all help., A stream of water trickled ceaselessly over the hideous face., We knew that the body and the clothing were there for identification by friends, but still we wondered if anybody could love that repulsive object or grieve for its loss., We grew meditative and wondered if, some forty years ago, when the mother of that ghastly thing was dandling it upon her knee, and kissing it and petting it and displaying it with satisfied pride to the passers-by, a prophetic vision of this dread ending ever flitted through her brain., I half feared that the mother, or the wife or a brother of the dead man might come while we stood there, but nothing of the kind occurred., Men and women came, and some looked eagerly in and pressed their faces against the bars; others glanced carelessly at the body and turned away with a disappointed look --people, I thought, who live upon strong excitements and who attend the exhibitions of the Morgue regularly, just as other people go to see theatrical spectacles every night., When one of these looked in and passed on, I could not help thinking--  ""Now this don't afford you any satisfaction--a party with his head shot off is what you need."", One night we went to the celebrated Jardin Mabille, but only staid a little while., We wanted to see some of this kind of Paris life, however, and therefore the next night we went to a similar place of entertainment in a great garden in the suburb of Asnieres., We went to the railroad depot, toward evening, and Ferguson got tickets for a second-class carriage., Such a perfect jam of people I have not often seen--but there was no noise, no disorder, no rowdyism., Some of the women and young girls that entered the train we knew to be of the demi-monde, but others we were not at all sure about., The girls and women in our carriage behaved themselves modestly and becomingly all the way out, except that they smoked., When we arrived at the garden in Asnieres, we paid a franc or two admission and entered a place which had flower beds in it, and grass plots, and long, curving rows of ornamental shrubbery, with here and there a secluded bower convenient for eating ice cream in., We moved along the sinuous gravel walks, with the great concourse of girls and young men, and suddenly a domed and filigreed white temple, starred over and over and over again with brilliant gas jets, burst upon us like a fallen sun., Nearby was a large, handsome house with its ample front illuminated in the same way, and above its roof floated the Star-Spangled Banner of America., ""Well!"", I said., ""How is this?"", It nearly took my breath away., Ferguson said an American--a New Yorker--kept the place, and was carrying on quite a stirring opposition to the Jardin Mabille., Crowds composed of both sexes and nearly all ages were frisking about the garden or sitting in the open air in front of the flagstaff and the temple, drinking wine and coffee or smoking., The dancing had not begun yet., Ferguson said there was to be an exhibition., The famous Blondin was going to perform on a tightrope in another part of the garden., We went thither., Here the light was dim, and the masses of people were pretty closely packed together., And now I made a mistake which any donkey might make, but a sensible man never., I committed an error which I find myself repeating every day of my life., Standing right before a young lady, I said:  ""Dan, just look at this girl, how beautiful she is!"", ""I thank you more for the evident sincerity of the compliment, sir, than for the extraordinary publicity you have given to it!"", This in good, pure English., We took a walk, but my spirits were very, very sadly dampened., I did not feel right comfortable for some time afterward., Why will people be so stupid as to suppose themselves the only foreigners among a crowd of ten thousand persons?, ...]",1
2,"[I speak now, of course, in the supposition that the gentle reader has not been abroad, and therefore is not already a consummate ass., If the case be otherwise, I beg his pardon and extend to him the cordial hand of fellowship and call him brother., I shall always delight to meet an ass after my own heart when I shall have finished my travels., On this subject let me remark that there are Americans abroad in Italy who have actually forgotten their mother tongue in three months--forgot it in France., They can not even write their address in English in a hotel register., I append these evidences, which I copied verbatim from the register of a hotel in a certain Italian city:  I love this sort of people., A lady passenger of ours tells of a fellow-citizen of hers who spent eight weeks in Paris and then returned home and addressed his dearest old bosom friend Herbert as Mr., ""Er-bare!"", He apologized, though, and said, ""'Pon my soul it is aggravating, but I cahn't help it--I have got so used to speaking nothing but French, my dear Erbare--damme there it goes again!--got so used to French pronunciation that I cahn't get rid of it--it is positively annoying, I assure you."", This entertaining idiot, whose name was Gordon, allowed himself to be hailed three times in the street before he paid any attention, and then begged a thousand pardons and said he had grown so accustomed to hearing himself addressed as ""M'sieu Gor-r-dong,"" with a roll to the r, that he had forgotten the legitimate sound of his name!, He wore a rose in his button-hole; he gave the French salutation--two flips of the hand in front of the face; he called Paris Pairree in ordinary English conversation; he carried envelopes bearing foreign postmarks protruding from his breast-pocket; he cultivated a moustache and imperial, and did what else he could to suggest to the beholder his pet fancy that he resembled Louis Napoleon--and in a spirit of thankfulness which is entirely unaccountable, considering the slim foundation there was for it, he praised his Maker that he was as he was, and went on enjoying his little life just the same as if he really had been deliberately designed and erected by the great Architect of the Universe., Think of our Whitcombs, and our Ainsworths and our Williamses writing themselves down in dilapidated French in foreign hotel registers!, We laugh at Englishmen, when we are at home, for sticking so sturdily to their national ways and customs, but we look back upon it from abroad very forgivingly., It is not pleasant to see an American thrusting his nationality forward obtrusively in a foreign land, but Oh, it is pitiable to see him making of himself a thing that is neither male nor female, neither fish, flesh, nor fowl--a poor, miserable, hermaphrodite Frenchman!, Among a long list of churches, art galleries, and such things, visited by us in Venice, I shall mention only one--the church of Santa Maria dei Frari., It is about five hundred years old, I believe, and stands on twelve hundred thousand piles., In it lie the body of Canova and the heart of Titian, under magnificent monuments., Titian died at the age of almost one hundred years., A plague which swept away fifty thousand lives was raging at the time, and there is notable evidence of the reverence in which the great painter was held, in the fact that to him alone the state permitted a public funeral in all that season of terror and death., In this church, also, is a monument to the doge Foscari, whose name a once resident of Venice, Lord Byron, has made permanently famous., The monument to the doge Giovanni Pesaro, in this church, is a curiosity in the way of mortuary adornment., It is eighty feet high and is fronted like some fantastic pagan temple., Against it stand four colossal Nubians, as black as night, dressed in white marble garments., The black legs are bare, and through rents in sleeves and breeches, the skin, of shiny black marble, shows., The artist was as ingenious as his funeral designs were absurd., There are two bronze skeletons bearing scrolls, and two great dragons uphold the sarcophagus., On high, amid all this grotesqueness, sits the departed doge., In the conventual buildings attached to this church are the state archives of Venice., We did not see them, but they are said to number millions of documents., ""They are the records of centuries of the most watchful, observant and suspicious government that ever existed--in which every thing was written down and nothing spoken out."", They fill nearly three hundred rooms., Among them are manuscripts from the archives of nearly two thousand families, monasteries and convents., The secret history of Venice for a thousand years is here--its plots, its hidden trials, its assassinations, its commissions of hireling spies and masked bravoes--food, ready to hand, for a world of dark and mysterious romances., Yes, I think we have seen all of Venice., We have seen, in these old churches, a profusion of costly and elaborate sepulchre ornamentation such as we never dreampt of before., We have stood in the dim religious light of these hoary sanctuaries, in the midst of long ranks of dusty monuments and effigies of the great dead of Venice, until we seemed drifting back, back, back, into the solemn past, and looking upon the scenes and mingling with the peoples of a remote antiquity., We have been in a half-waking sort of dream all the time., I do not know how else to describe the feeling., A part of our being has remained still in the nineteenth century, while another part of it has seemed in some unaccountable way walking among the phantoms of the tenth., We have seen famous pictures until our eyes are weary with looking at them and refuse to find interest in them any longer., And what wonder, when there are twelve hundred pictures by Palma the Younger in Venice and fifteen hundred by Tintoretto?, And behold there are Titians and the works of other artists in proportion., We have seen Titian's celebrated Cain and Abel, his David and Goliah, his Abraham's Sacrifice., We have seen Tintoretto's monster picture, which is seventy-four feet long and I do not know how many feet high, and thought it a very commodious picture., We have seen pictures of martyrs enough, and saints enough, to regenerate the world., I ought not to confess it, but still, since one has no opportunity in America to acquire a critical judgment in art, and since I could not hope to become educated in it in Europe in a few short weeks, I may therefore as well acknowledge with such apologies as may be due, that to me it seemed that when I had seen one of these martyrs I had seen them all., They all have a marked family resemblance to each other, they dress alike, in coarse monkish robes and sandals, they are all bald headed, they all stand in about the same attitude, and without exception they are gazing heavenward with countenances which the Ainsworths, the Mortons and the Williamses, et fils, inform me are full of ""expression."", To me there is nothing tangible about these imaginary portraits, nothing that I can grasp and take a living interest in., If great Titian had only been gifted with prophecy, and had skipped a martyr, and gone over to England and painted a portrait of Shakspeare, even as a youth, which we could all have confidence in now, the world down to the latest generations would have forgiven him the lost martyr in the rescued seer., I think posterity could have spared one more martyr for the sake of a great historical picture of Titian's time and painted by his brush--such as Columbus returning in chains from the discovery of a world, for instance., The old masters did paint some Venetian historical pictures, and these we did not tire of looking at, notwithstanding representations of the formal introduction of defunct doges to the Virgin Mary in regions beyond the clouds clashed rather harshly with the proprieties, it seemed to us., But humble as we are, and unpretending, in the matter of art, our researches among the painted monks and martyrs have not been wholly in vain., We have striven hard to learn., We have had some success., We have mastered some things, possibly of trifling import in the eyes of the learned, but to us they give pleasure, and we take as much pride in our little acquirements as do others who have learned far more, and we love to display them full as well., When we see a monk going about with a lion and looking tranquilly up to heaven, we know that that is St. Mark., When we see a monk with a book and a pen, looking tranquilly up to heaven, trying to think of a word, we know that that is St. Matthew., When we see a monk sitting on a rock, looking tranquilly up to heaven, with a human skull beside him, and without other baggage, we know that that is St. Jerome., Because we know that he always went flying light in the matter of baggage., When we see a party looking tranquilly up to heaven, unconscious that his body is shot through and through with arrows, we know that that is St. Sebastian., When we see other monks looking tranquilly up to heaven, but having no trade-mark, we always ask who those parties are., We do this because we humbly wish to learn., We have seen thirteen thousand St. Jeromes, and twenty-two thousand St. Marks, and sixteen thousand St. Matthews, and sixty thousand St. Sebastians, and four millions of assorted monks, undesignated, and we feel encouraged to believe that when we have seen some more of these various pictures, and had a larger experience, we shall begin to take an absorbing interest in them like our cultivated countrymen from Amerique., Now it does give me real pain to speak in this almost unappreciative way of the old masters and their martyrs, because good friends of mine in the ship--friends who do thoroughly and conscientiously appreciate them and are in every way competent to discriminate between good pictures and inferior ones--have urged me for my own sake not to make public the fact that I lack this appreciation and this critical discrimination myself., I believe that what I have written and may still write about pictures will give them pain, and I am honestly sorry for it., I even promised that I would hide my uncouth sentiments in my own breast., But alas!, I never could keep a promise., I do not blame myself for this weakness, because the fault must lie in my physical organization., It is likely that such a very liberal amount of space was given to the organ which enables me to make promises, that the organ which should enable me to keep them was crowded out., But I grieve not., I like no half-way things., I had rather have one faculty nobly developed than two faculties of mere ordinary capacity., I certainly meant to keep that promise, but I find I can not do it., It is impossible to travel through Italy without speaking of pictures, and can I see them through others' eyes?, If I did not so delight in the grand pictures that are spread before me every day of my life by that monarch of all the old masters, Nature, I should come to believe, sometimes, that I had in me no appreciation of the beautiful, whatsoever., It seems to me that whenever I glory to think that for once I have discovered an ancient painting that is beautiful and worthy of all praise, the pleasure it gives me is an infallible proof that it is not a beautiful picture and not in any wise worthy of commendation., This very thing has occurred more times than I can mention, in Venice., In every single instance the guide has crushed out my swelling enthusiasm with the remark:  ""It is nothing--it is of the Renaissance."", I did not know what in the mischief the Renaissance was, and so always I had to simply say,  ""Ah!, so it is--I had not observed it before."", I could not bear to be ignorant before a cultivated negro, the offspring of a South Carolina slave., But it occurred too often for even my self-complacency, did that exasperating ""It is nothing--it is of the Renaissance."", I said at last:  ""Who is this Renaissance?, Where did he come from?, Who gave him permission to cram the Republic with his execrable daubs?"", We learned, then, that Renaissance was not a man; that renaissance was a term used to signify what was at best but an imperfect rejuvenation of art., The guide said that after Titian's time and the time of the other great names we had grown so familiar with, high art declined; then it partially rose again--an inferior sort of painters sprang up, and these shabby pictures were the work of their hands., Then I said, in my heat, that I ""wished to goodness high art had declined five hundred years sooner."", The Renaissance pictures suit me very well, though sooth to say its school were too much given to painting real men and did not indulge enough in martyrs., The guide I have spoken of is the only one we have had yet who knew any thing., He was born in South Carolina, of slave parents., They came to Venice while he was an infant., He has grown up here., He is well educated., He reads, writes, and speaks English, Italian, Spanish, and French, with perfect facility; is a worshipper of art and thoroughly conversant with it; knows the history of Venice by heart and never tires of talking of her illustrious career., He dresses better than any of us, I think, and is daintily polite., Negroes are deemed as good as white people, in Venice, and so this man feels no desire to go back to his native land., His judgment is correct., I have had another shave., ...]",1
3,"[Close down the curtain., Put out the lights., And so I turned away and went through shop after shop and store after store, far down the long street of the merchants, and called for the wares of Rome and the East, but the tradesmen were gone, the marts were silent, and nothing was left but the broken jars all set in cement of cinders and ashes: the wine and the oil that once had filled them were gone with their owners., In a bake-shop was a mill for grinding the grain, and the furnaces for baking the bread: and they say that here, in the same furnaces, the exhumers of Pompeii found nice, well baked loaves which the baker had not found time to remove from the ovens the last time he left his shop, because circumstances compelled him to leave in such a hurry., In one house (the only building in Pompeii which no woman is now allowed to enter,) were the small rooms and short beds of solid masonry, just as they were in the old times, and on the walls were pictures which looked almost as fresh as if they were painted yesterday, but which no pen could have the hardihood to describe; and here and there were Latin inscriptions--obscene scintillations of wit, scratched by hands that possibly were uplifted to Heaven for succor in the midst of a driving storm of fire before the night was done., In one of the principal streets was a ponderous stone tank, and a water-spout that supplied it, and where the tired, heated toilers from the Campagna used to rest their right hands when they bent over to put their lips to the spout, the thick stone was worn down to a broad groove an inch or two deep., Think of the countless thousands of hands that had pressed that spot in the ages that are gone, to so reduce a stone that is as hard as iron!, They had a great public bulletin board in Pompeii--a place where announcements for gladiatorial combats, elections, and such things, were posted--not on perishable paper, but carved in enduring stone., One lady, who, I take it, was rich and well brought up, advertised a dwelling or so to rent, with baths and all the modern improvements, and several hundred shops, stipulating that the dwellings should not be put to immoral purposes., You can find out who lived in many a house in Pompeii by the carved stone door-plates affixed to them: and in the same way you can tell who they were that occupy the tombs., Every where around are things that reveal to you something of the customs and history of this forgotten people., But what would a volcano leave of an American city, if it once rained its cinders on it?, Hardly a sign or a symbol to tell its story., In one of these long Pompeiian halls the skeleton of a man was found, with ten pieces of gold in one hand and a large key in the other., He had seized his money and started toward the door, but the fiery tempest caught him at the very threshold, and he sank down and died., One more minute of precious time would have saved him., I saw the skeletons of a man, a woman, and two young girls., The woman had her hands spread wide apart, as if in mortal terror, and I imagined I could still trace upon her shapeless face something of the expression of wild despair that distorted it when the heavens rained fire in these streets, so many ages ago., The girls and the man lay with their faces upon their arms, as if they had tried to shield them from the enveloping cinders., In one apartment eighteen skeletons were found, all in sitting postures, and blackened places on the walls still mark their shapes and show their attitudes, like shadows., One of them, a woman, still wore upon her skeleton throat a necklace, with her name engraved upon it--JULIE DI DIOMEDE., But perhaps the most poetical thing Pompeii has yielded to modern research, was that grand figure of a Roman soldier, clad in complete armor; who, true to his duty, true to his proud name of a soldier of Rome, and full of the stern courage which had given to that name its glory, stood to his post by the city gate, erect and unflinching, till the hell that raged around him burned out the dauntless spirit it could not conquer., We never read of Pompeii but we think of that soldier; we can not write of Pompeii without the natural impulse to grant to him the mention he so well deserves., Let us remember that he was a soldier--not a policeman --and so, praise him., Being a soldier, he staid,--because the warrior instinct forbade him to fly., Had he been a policeman he would have staid, also--because he would have been asleep., There are not half a dozen flights of stairs in Pompeii, and no other evidences that the houses were more than one story high., The people did not live in the clouds, as do the Venetians, the Genoese and Neapolitans of to-day., We came out from under the solemn mysteries of this city of the Venerable Past--this city which perished, with all its old ways and its quaint old fashions about it, remote centuries ago, when the Disciples were preaching the new religion, which is as old as the hills to us now--and went dreaming among the trees that grow over acres and acres of its still buried streets and squares, till a shrill whistle and the cry of ""All aboard--last train for Naples!"", woke me up and reminded me that I belonged in the nineteenth century, and was not a dusty mummy, caked with ashes and cinders, eighteen hundred years old., The transition was startling., The idea of a railroad train actually running to old dead Pompeii, and whistling irreverently, and calling for passengers in the most bustling and business-like way, was as strange a thing as one could imagine, and as unpoetical and disagreeable as it was strange., Compare the cheerful life and the sunshine of this day with the horrors the younger Pliny saw here, the 9th of November, A.D. 79, when he was so bravely striving to remove his mother out of reach of harm, while she begged him, with all a mother's unselfishness, to leave her to perish and save himself., After browsing among the stately ruins of Rome, of Baiae, of Pompeii, and after glancing down the long marble ranks of battered and nameless imperial heads that stretch down the corridors of the Vatican, one thing strikes me with a force it never had before: the unsubstantial, unlasting character of fame., Men lived long lives, in the olden time, and struggled feverishly through them, toiling like slaves, in oratory, in generalship, or in literature, and then laid them down and died, happy in the possession of an enduring history and a deathless name., Well, twenty little centuries flutter away, and what is left of these things?, A crazy inscription on a block of stone, which snuffy antiquaries bother over and tangle up and make nothing out of but a bare name (which they spell wrong)--no history, no tradition, no poetry--nothing that can give it even a passing interest., What may be left of General Grant's great name forty centuries hence?, This--in the Encyclopedia for A. D. 5868, possibly:       ""URIAH S. (or Z.), GRAUNT--popular poet of ancient times in the Aztec      provinces of the United States of British America., Some authors say      flourished about A. D. 742; but the learned Ah-ah Foo-foo states      that he was a cotemporary of Scharkspyre, the English poet, and      flourished about A. D. 1328, some three centuries after the Trojan      war instead of before it., He wrote 'Rock me to Sleep, Mother.'"", These thoughts sadden me., I will to bed., Home, again!, For the first time, in many weeks, the ship's entire family met and shook hands on the quarter-deck., They had gathered from many points of the compass and from many lands, but not one was missing; there was no tale of sickness or death among the flock to dampen the pleasure of the reunion., Once more there was a full audience on deck to listen to the sailors' chorus as they got the anchor up, and to wave an adieu to the land as we sped away from Naples., The seats were full at dinner again, the domino parties were complete, and the life and bustle on the upper deck in the fine moonlight at night was like old times--old times that had been gone weeks only, but yet they were weeks so crowded with incident, adventure and excitement, that they seemed almost like years., There was no lack of cheerfulness on board the Quaker City., For once, her title was a misnomer., At seven in the evening, with the western horizon all golden from the sunken sun, and specked with distant ships, the full moon sailing high over head, the dark blue of the sea under foot, and a strange sort of twilight affected by all these different lights and colors around us and about us, we sighted superb Stromboli., With what majesty the monarch held his lonely state above the level sea!, Distance clothed him in a purple gloom, and added a veil of shimmering mist that so softened his rugged features that we seemed to see him through a web of silver gauze., His torch was out; his fires were smoldering; a tall column of smoke that rose up and lost itself in the growing moonlight was all the sign he gave that he was a living Autocrat of the Sea and not the spectre of a dead one., At two in the morning we swept through the Straits of Messina, and so bright was the moonlight that Italy on the one hand and Sicily on the other seemed almost as distinctly visible as though we looked at them from the middle of a street we were traversing., The city of Messina, milk-white, and starred and spangled all over with gaslights, was a fairy spectacle., A great party of us were on deck smoking and making a noise, and waiting to see famous Scylla and Charybdis., And presently the Oracle stepped out with his eternal spy-glass and squared himself on the deck like another Colossus of Rhodes., It was a surprise to see him abroad at such an hour., Nobody supposed he cared anything about an old fable like that of Scylla and Charybdis., One of the boys said:  ""Hello, doctor, what are you doing up here at this time of night?--What do you want to see this place for?"", ""What do I want to see this place for?, Young man, little do you know me, or you wouldn't ask such a question., I wish to see all the places that's mentioned in the Bible."", ""Stuff--this place isn't mentioned in the Bible."", ""It ain't mentioned in the Bible!--this place ain't--well now, what place is this, since you know so much about it?"", ""Why it's Scylla and Charybdis."", ""Scylla and Cha--confound it, I thought it was Sodom and Gomorrah!"", And he closed up his glass and went below., The above is the ship story., Its plausibility is marred a little by the fact that the Oracle was not a biblical student, and did not spend much of his time instructing himself about Scriptural localities.--They say the Oracle complains, in this hot weather, lately, that the only beverage in the ship that is passable, is the butter., He did not mean butter, of course, but inasmuch as that article remains in a melted state now since we are out of ice, it is fair to give him the credit of getting one long word in the right place, anyhow, for once in his life., He said, in Rome, that the Pope was a noble-looking old man, but he never did think much of his Iliad., We spent one pleasant day skirting along the Isles of Greece., They are very mountainous., Their prevailing tints are gray and brown, approaching to red., Little white villages surrounded by trees, nestle in the valleys or roost upon the lofty perpendicular sea-walls., We had one fine sunset--a rich carmine flush that suffused the western sky and cast a ruddy glow far over the sea.--Fine sunsets seem to be rare in this part of the world--or at least, striking ones., They are soft, sensuous, lovely--they are exquisite refined, effeminate, but we have seen no sunsets here yet like the gorgeous conflagrations that flame in the track of the sinking sun in our high northern latitudes., But what were sunsets to us, with the wild excitement upon us of approaching the most renowned of cities!, What cared we for outward visions, when Agamemnon, Achilles, and a thousand other heroes of the great Past were marching in ghostly procession through our fancies?, What were sunsets to us, who were about to live and breathe and walk in actual Athens; yea, and go far down into the dead centuries and bid in person for the slaves, Diogenes and Plato, in the public market-place, or gossip with the neighbors about the siege of Troy or the splendid deeds of Marathon?, We scorned to consider sunsets., We arrived, and entered the ancient harbor of the Piraeus at last., We dropped anchor within half a mile of the village., Away off, across the undulating Plain of Attica, could be seen a little square-topped hill with a something on it, which our glasses soon discovered to be the ruined edifices of the citadel of the Athenians, and most prominent among them loomed the venerable Parthenon., So exquisitely clear and pure is this wonderful atmosphere that every column of the noble structure was discernible through the telescope, and even the smaller ruins about it assumed some semblance of shape., This at a distance of five or six miles., In the valley, near the Acropolis, (the square-topped hill before spoken of,) Athens itself could be vaguely made out with an ordinary lorgnette., Every body was anxious to get ashore and visit these classic localities as quickly as possible., No land we had yet seen had aroused such universal interest among the passengers., But bad news came., The commandant of the Piraeus came in his boat, and said we must either depart or else get outside the harbor and remain imprisoned in our ship, under rigid quarantine, for eleven days!, So we took up the anchor and moved outside, to lie a dozen hours or so, taking in supplies, and then sail for Constantinople., It was the bitterest disappointment we had yet experienced., To lie a whole day in sight of the Acropolis, and yet be obliged to go away without visiting Athens!, Disappointment was hardly a strong enough word to describe the circumstances., All hands were on deck, all the afternoon, with books and maps and glasses, trying to determine which ""narrow rocky ridge"" was the Areopagus, which sloping hill the Pnyx, which elevation the Museum Hill, and so on., And we got things confused., ...]",1
4,"[I suppose it would be a real treat to a camel to have a keg of nails for supper., While I am speaking of animals, I will mention that I have a horse now by the name of ""Jericho."", He is a mare., I have seen remarkable horses before, but none so remarkable as this., I wanted a horse that could shy, and this one fills the bill., I had an idea that shying indicated spirit., If I was correct, I have got the most spirited horse on earth., He shies at every thing he comes across, with the utmost impartiality., He appears to have a mortal dread of telegraph poles, especially; and it is fortunate that these are on both sides of the road, because as it is now, I never fall off twice in succession on the same side., If I fell on the same side always, it would get to be monotonous after a while., This creature has scared at every thing he has seen to-day, except a haystack., He walked up to that with an intrepidity and a recklessness that were astonishing., And it would fill any one with admiration to see how he preserves his self-possession in the presence of a barley sack., This dare-devil bravery will be the death of this horse some day., He is not particularly fast, but I think he will get me through the Holy Land., He has only one fault., His tail has been chopped off or else he has sat down on it too hard, some time or other, and he has to fight the flies with his heels., This is all very well, but when he tries to kick a fly off the top of his head with his hind foot, it is too much variety., He is going to get himself into trouble that way some day., He reaches around and bites my legs too., I do not care particularly about that, only I do not like to see a horse too sociable., I think the owner of this prize had a wrong opinion about him., He had an idea that he was one of those fiery, untamed steeds, but he is not of that character., I know the Arab had this idea, because when he brought the horse out for inspection in Beirout, he kept jerking at the bridle and shouting in Arabic, ""Ho!, will you?, Do you want to run away, you ferocious beast, and break your neck?"", when all the time the horse was not doing anything in the world, and only looked like he wanted to lean up against something and think., Whenever he is not shying at things, or reaching after a fly, he wants to do that yet., How it would surprise his owner to know this., We have been in a historical section of country all day., At noon we camped three hours and took luncheon at Mekseh, near the junction of the Lebanon Mountains and the Jebel el Kuneiyiseh, and looked down into the immense, level, garden-like Valley of Lebanon., To-night we are camping near the same valley, and have a very wide sweep of it in view., We can see the long, whale-backed ridge of Mount Hermon projecting above the eastern hills., The ""dews of Hermon"" are falling upon us now, and the tents are almost soaked with them., Over the way from us, and higher up the valley, we can discern, through the glasses, the faint outlines of the wonderful ruins of Baalbec, the supposed Baal-Gad of Scripture., Joshua, and another person, were the two spies who were sent into this land of Canaan by the children of Israel to report upon its character--I mean they were the spies who reported favorably., They took back with them some specimens of the grapes of this country, and in the children's picture-books they are always represented as bearing one monstrous bunch swung to a pole between them, a respectable load for a pack-train., The Sunday-school books exaggerated it a little., The grapes are most excellent to this day, but the bunches are not as large as those in the pictures., I was surprised and hurt when I saw them, because those colossal bunches of grapes were one of my most cherished juvenile traditions., Joshua reported favorably, and the children of Israel journeyed on, with Moses at the head of the general government, and Joshua in command of the army of six hundred thousand fighting men., Of women and children and civilians there was a countless swarm., Of all that mighty host, none but the two faithful spies ever lived to set their feet in the Promised Land., They and their descendants wandered forty years in the desert, and then Moses, the gifted warrior, poet, statesman and philosopher, went up into Pisgah and met his mysterious fate., Where he was buried no man knows --for  Then Joshua began his terrible raid, and from Jericho clear to this Baal-Gad, he swept the land like the Genius of Destruction., He slaughtered the people, laid waste their soil, and razed their cities to the ground., He wasted thirty-one kings also., One may call it that, though really it can hardly be called wasting them, because there were always plenty of kings in those days, and to spare., At any rate, he destroyed thirty-one kings, and divided up their realms among his Israelites., He divided up this valley stretched out here before us, and so it was once Jewish territory., The Jews have long since disappeared from it, however., Back yonder, an hour's journey from here, we passed through an Arab village of stone dry-goods boxes (they look like that,) where Noah's tomb lies under lock and key., [Noah built the ark.], Over these old hills and valleys the ark that contained all that was left of a vanished world once floated., I make no apology for detailing the above information., It will be news to some of my readers, at any rate., Noah's tomb is built of stone, and is covered with a long stone building., Bucksheesh let us in., The building had to be long, because the grave of the honored old navigator is two hundred and ten feet long itself!, It is only about four feet high, though., He must have cast a shadow like a lightning-rod., The proof that this is the genuine spot where Noah was buried can only be doubted by uncommonly incredulous people., The evidence is pretty straight., Shem, the son of Noah, was present at the burial, and showed the place to his descendants, who transmitted the knowledge to their descendants, and the lineal descendants of these introduced themselves to us to-day., It was pleasant to make the acquaintance of members of so respectable a family., It was a thing to be proud of., It was the next thing to being acquainted with Noah himself., Noah's memorable voyage will always possess a living interest for me, henceforward., If ever an oppressed race existed, it is this one we see fettered around us under the inhuman tyranny of the Ottoman Empire., I wish Europe would let Russia annihilate Turkey a little--not much, but enough to make it difficult to find the place again without a divining-rod or a diving-bell., The Syrians are very poor, and yet they are ground down by a system of taxation that would drive any other nation frantic., Last year their taxes were heavy enough, in all conscience--but this year they have been increased by the addition of taxes that were forgiven them in times of famine in former years., On top of this the Government has levied a tax of one-tenth of the whole proceeds of the land., This is only half the story., The Pacha of a Pachalic does not trouble himself with appointing tax-collectors., He figures up what all these taxes ought to amount to in a certain district., Then he farms the collection out., He calls the rich men together, the highest bidder gets the speculation, pays the Pacha on the spot, and then sells out to smaller fry, who sell in turn to a piratical horde of still smaller fry., These latter compel the peasant to bring his little trifle of grain to the village, at his own cost., It must be weighed, the various taxes set apart, and the remainder returned to the producer., But the collector delays this duty day after day, while the producer's family are perishing for bread; at last the poor wretch, who can not but understand the game, says, ""Take a quarter--take half--take two-thirds if you will, and let me go!"", It is a most outrageous state of things., These people are naturally good-hearted and intelligent, and with education and liberty, would be a happy and contented race., They often appeal to the stranger to know if the great world will not some day come to their relief and save them., The Sultan has been lavishing money like water in England and Paris, but his subjects are suffering for it now., This fashion of camping out bewilders me., We have boot-jacks and a bath-tub, now, and yet all the mysteries the pack-mules carry are not revealed., What next?, We had a tedious ride of about five hours, in the sun, across the Valley of Lebanon., It proved to be not quite so much of a garden as it had seemed from the hill-sides., It was a desert, weed-grown waste, littered thickly with stones the size of a man's fist., Here and there the natives had scratched the ground and reared a sickly crop of grain, but for the most part the valley was given up to a handful of shepherds, whose flocks were doing what they honestly could to get a living, but the chances were against them., We saw rude piles of stones standing near the roadside, at intervals, and recognized the custom of marking boundaries which obtained in Jacob's time., There were no walls, no fences, no hedges--nothing to secure a man's possessions but these random heaps of stones., The Israelites held them sacred in the old patriarchal times, and these other Arabs, their lineal descendants, do so likewise., An American, of ordinary intelligence, would soon widely extend his property, at an outlay of mere manual labor, performed at night, under so loose a system of fencing as this., The plows these people use are simply a sharpened stick, such as Abraham plowed with, and they still winnow their wheat as he did--they pile it on the house-top, and then toss it by shovel-fulls into the air until the wind has blown all the chaff away., They never invent any thing, never learn any thing., We had a fine race, of a mile, with an Arab perched on a camel., Some of the horses were fast, and made very good time, but the camel scampered by them without any very great effort., ...]",1
5,"[Ahab, the late King, had left a helpless family behind him, and Jehu killed seventy of the orphan sons., Then he killed all the relatives, and teachers, and servants and friends of the family, and rested from his labors, until he was come near to Samaria, where he met forty-two persons and asked them who they were; they said they were brothers of the King of Judah., He killed them., When he got to Samaria, he said he would show his zeal for the Lord; so he gathered all the priests and people together that worshiped Baal, pretending that he was going to adopt that worship and offer up a great sacrifice; and when they were all shut up where they could not defend themselves, he caused every person of them to be killed., Then Jehu, the good missionary, rested from his labors once more., We went back to the valley, and rode to the Fountain of Ain Jelud., They call it the Fountain of Jezreel, usually., It is a pond about one hundred feet square and four feet deep, with a stream of water trickling into it from under an overhanging ledge of rocks., It is in the midst of a great solitude., Here Gideon pitched his camp in the old times; behind Shunem lay the ""Midianites, the Amalekites, and the Children of the East,"" who were ""as grasshoppers for multitude; both they and their camels were without number, as the sand by the sea-side for multitude."", Which means that there were one hundred and thirty-five thousand men, and that they had transportation service accordingly., Gideon, with only three hundred men, surprised them in the night, and stood by and looked on while they butchered each other until a hundred and twenty thousand lay dead on the field., We camped at Jenin before night, and got up and started again at one o'clock in the morning., Somewhere towards daylight we passed the locality where the best authenticated tradition locates the pit into which Joseph's brethren threw him, and about noon, after passing over a succession of mountain tops, clad with groves of fig and olive trees, with the Mediterranean in sight some forty miles away, and going by many ancient Biblical cities whose inhabitants glowered savagely upon our Christian procession, and were seemingly inclined to practice on it with stones, we came to the singularly terraced and unlovely hills that betrayed that we were out of Galilee and into Samaria at last., We climbed a high hill to visit the city of Samaria, where the woman may have hailed from who conversed with Christ at Jacob's Well, and from whence, no doubt, came also the celebrated Good Samaritan., Herod the Great is said to have made a magnificent city of this place, and a great number of coarse limestone columns, twenty feet high and two feet through, that are almost guiltless of architectural grace of shape and ornament, are pointed out by many authors as evidence of the fact., They would not have been considered handsome in ancient Greece, however., The inhabitants of this camp are particularly vicious, and stoned two parties of our pilgrims a day or two ago who brought about the difficulty by showing their revolvers when they did not intend to use them--a thing which is deemed bad judgment in the Far West, and ought certainly to be so considered any where., In the new Territories, when a man puts his hand on a weapon, he knows that he must use it; he must use it instantly or expect to be shot down where he stands., Those pilgrims had been reading Grimes., There was nothing for us to do in Samaria but buy handfuls of old Roman coins at a franc a dozen, and look at a dilapidated church of the Crusaders and a vault in it which once contained the body of John the Baptist., This relic was long ago carried away to Genoa., Samaria stood a disastrous siege, once, in the days of Elisha, at the hands of the King of Syria., Provisions reached such a figure that ""an ass' head was sold for eighty pieces of silver and the fourth part of a cab of dove's dung for five pieces of silver."", An incident recorded of that heavy time will give one a very good idea of the distress that prevailed within these crumbling walls., As the King was walking upon the battlements one day, ""a woman cried out, saying, Help, my lord, O King!, And the King said, What aileth thee?, and she answered, This woman said unto me, Give thy son, that we may eat him to-day, and we will eat my son to-morrow., So we boiled my son, and did eat him; and I said unto her on the next day, Give thy son that we may eat him; and she hath hid her son."", The prophet Elisha declared that within four and twenty hours the prices of food should go down to nothing, almost, and it was so., The Syrian army broke camp and fled, for some cause or other, the famine was relieved from without, and many a shoddy speculator in dove's dung and ass's meat was ruined., We were glad to leave this hot and dusty old village and hurry on., At two o'clock we stopped to lunch and rest at ancient Shechem, between the historic Mounts of Gerizim and Ebal, where in the old times the books of the law, the curses and the blessings, were read from the heights to the Jewish multitudes below., The narrow canon in which Nablous, or Shechem, is situated, is under high cultivation, and the soil is exceedingly black and fertile., It is well watered, and its affluent vegetation gains effect by contrast with the barren hills that tower on either side., One of these hills is the ancient Mount of Blessings and the other the Mount of Curses and wise men who seek for fulfillments of prophecy think they find here a wonder of this kind--to wit, that the Mount of Blessings is strangely fertile and its mate as strangely unproductive., We could not see that there was really much difference between them in this respect, however., Shechem is distinguished as one of the residences of the patriarch Jacob, and as the seat of those tribes that cut themselves loose from their brethren of Israel and propagated doctrines not in conformity with those of the original Jewish creed., For thousands of years this clan have dwelt in Shechem under strict tabu, and having little commerce or fellowship with their fellow men of any religion or nationality., For generations they have not numbered more than one or two hundred, but they still adhere to their ancient faith and maintain their ancient rites and ceremonies., Talk of family and old descent!, Princes and nobles pride themselves upon lineages they can trace back some hundreds of years., What is this trifle to this handful of old first families of Shechem who can name their fathers straight back without a flaw for thousands --straight back to a period so remote that men reared in a country where the days of two hundred years ago are called ""ancient"" times grow dazed and bewildered when they try to comprehend it!, Here is respectability for you--here is ""family""--here is high descent worth talking about., This sad, proud remnant of a once mighty community still hold themselves aloof from all the world; they still live as their fathers lived, labor as their fathers labored, think as they did, feel as they did, worship in the same place, in sight of the same landmarks, and in the same quaint, patriarchal way their ancestors did more than thirty centuries ago., I found myself gazing at any straggling scion of this strange race with a riveted fascination, just as one would stare at a living mastodon, or a megatherium that had moved in the grey dawn of creation and seen the wonders of that mysterious world that was before the flood., Carefully preserved among the sacred archives of this curious community is a MSS., copy of the ancient Jewish law, which is said to be the oldest document on earth., It is written on vellum, and is some four or five thousand years old., Nothing but bucksheesh can purchase a sight., Its fame is somewhat dimmed in these latter days, because of the doubts so many authors of Palestine travels have felt themselves privileged to cast upon it., Speaking of this MSS., reminds me that I procured from the high-priest of this ancient Samaritan community, at great expense, a secret document of still higher antiquity and far more extraordinary interest, which I propose to publish as soon as I have finished translating it., Joshua gave his dying injunction to the children of Israel at Shechem, and buried a valuable treasure secretly under an oak tree there about the same time., The superstitious Samaritans have always been afraid to hunt for it., They believe it is guarded by fierce spirits invisible to men., About a mile and a half from Shechem we halted at the base of Mount Ebal before a little square area, inclosed by a high stone wall, neatly whitewashed., Across one end of this inclosure is a tomb built after the manner of the Moslems., It is the tomb of Joseph., No truth is better authenticated than this., When Joseph was dying he prophesied that exodus of the Israelites from Egypt which occurred four hundred years afterwards., At the same time he exacted of his people an oath that when they journeyed to the land of Canaan they would bear his bones with them and bury them in the ancient inheritance of his fathers., The oath was kept., ""And the bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel brought up out of Egypt, buried they in Shechem, in a parcel of ground which Jacob bought of the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for a hundred pieces of silver."", Few tombs on earth command the veneration of so many races and men of divers creeds as this of Joseph., ""Samaritan and Jew, Moslem and Christian alike, revere it, and honor it with their visits., The tomb of Joseph, the dutiful son, the affectionate, forgiving brother, the virtuous man, the wise Prince and ruler., Egypt felt his influence--the world knows his history."", In this same ""parcel of ground"" which Jacob bought of the sons of Hamor for a hundred pieces of silver, is Jacob's celebrated well., It is cut in the solid rock, and is nine feet square and ninety feet deep., The name of this unpretending hole in the ground, which one might pass by and take no notice of, is as familiar as household words to even the children and the peasants of many a far-off country., It is more famous than the Parthenon; it is older than the Pyramids., It was by this well that Jesus sat and talked with a woman of that strange, antiquated Samaritan community I have been speaking of, and told her of the mysterious water of life., As descendants of old English nobles still cherish in the traditions of their houses how that this king or that king tarried a day with some favored ancestor three hundred years ago, no doubt the descendants of the woman of Samaria, living there in Shechem, still refer with pardonable vanity to this conversation of their ancestor, held some little time gone by, with the Messiah of the Christians., It is not likely that they undervalue a distinction such as this., Samaritan nature is human nature, and human nature remembers contact with the illustrious, always., For an offense done to the family honor, the sons of Jacob exterminated all Shechem once., We left Jacob's Well and traveled till eight in the evening, but rather slowly, for we had been in the saddle nineteen hours, and the horses were cruelly tired., We got so far ahead of the tents that we had to camp in an Arab village, and sleep on the ground., We could have slept in the largest of the houses; but there were some little drawbacks: it was populous with vermin, it had a dirt floor, it was in no respect cleanly, and there was a family of goats in the only bedroom, and two donkeys in the parlor., Outside there were no inconveniences, except that the dusky, ragged, earnest-eyed villagers of both sexes and all ages grouped themselves on their haunches all around us, and discussed us and criticised us with noisy tongues till midnight., We did not mind the noise, being tired, but, doubtless, the reader is aware that it is almost an impossible thing to go to sleep when you know that people are looking at you., We went to bed at ten, and got up again at two and started once more., Thus are people persecuted by dragomen, whose sole ambition in life is to get ahead of each other., About daylight we passed Shiloh, where the Ark of the Covenant rested three hundred years, and at whose gates good old Eli fell down and ""brake his neck"" when the messenger, riding hard from the battle, told him of the defeat of his people, the death of his sons, and, more than all, the capture of Israel's pride, her hope, her refuge, the ancient Ark her forefathers brought with them out of Egypt., It is little wonder that under circumstances like these he fell down and brake his neck., But Shiloh had no charms for us., We were so cold that there was no comfort but in motion, and so drowsy we could hardly sit upon the horses., After a while we came to a shapeless mass of ruins, which still bears the name of Bethel., It was here that Jacob lay down and had that superb vision of angels flitting up and down a ladder that reached from the clouds to earth, and caught glimpses of their blessed home through the open gates of Heaven., The pilgrims took what was left of the hallowed ruin, and we pressed on toward the goal of our crusade, renowned Jerusalem., The further we went the hotter the sun got, and the more rocky and bare, repulsive and dreary the landscape became., There could not have been more fragments of stone strewn broadcast over this part of the world, if every ten square feet of the land had been occupied by a separate and distinct stonecutter's establishment for an age., There was hardly a tree or a shrub any where., Even the olive and the cactus, those fast friends of a worthless soil, had almost deserted the country., No landscape exists that is more tiresome to the eye than that which bounds the approaches to Jerusalem., The only difference between the roads and the surrounding country, perhaps, is that there are rather more rocks in the roads than in the surrounding country., We passed Ramah, and Beroth, and on the right saw the tomb of the prophet Samuel, perched high upon a commanding eminence., Still no Jerusalem came in sight., We hurried on impatiently., ...]",1
6,"[Amen., In this place I will print an article which I wrote for the New York Herald the night we arrived., I do it partly because my contract with my publishers makes it compulsory; partly because it is a proper, tolerably accurate, and exhaustive summing up of the cruise of the ship and the performances of the pilgrims in foreign lands; and partly because some of the passengers have abused me for writing it, and I wish the public to see how thankless a task it is to put one's self to trouble to glorify unappreciative people., I was charged with ""rushing into print"" with these compliments., I did not rush., I had written news letters to the Herald sometimes, but yet when I visited the office that day I did not say any thing about writing a valedictory., I did go to the Tribune office to see if such an article was wanted, because I belonged on the regular staff of that paper and it was simply a duty to do it., The managing editor was absent, and so I thought no more about it., At night when the Herald's request came for an article, I did not ""rush."", In fact, I demurred for a while, because I did not feel like writing compliments then, and therefore was afraid to speak of the cruise lest I might be betrayed into using other than complimentary language., However, I reflected that it would be a just and righteous thing to go down and write a kind word for the Hadjis--Hadjis are people who have made the pilgrimage--because parties not interested could not do it so feelingly as I, a fellow-Hadji, and so I penned the valedictory., I have read it, and read it again; and if there is a sentence in it that is not fulsomely complimentary to captain, ship and passengers, I can not find it., If it is not a chapter that any company might be proud to have a body write about them, my judgment is fit for nothing., With these remarks I confidently submit it to the unprejudiced judgment of the reader:       RETURN OF THE HOLY LAND EXCURSIONISTS--THE STORY OF THE CRUISE., TO THE EDITOR OF THE HERALD:       The steamer Quaker City has accomplished at last her extraordinary      voyage and returned to her old pier at the foot of Wall street., The expedition was a success in some respects, in some it was not., Originally it was advertised as a ""pleasure excursion."", Well,      perhaps, it was a pleasure excursion, but certainly it did not look      like one; certainly it did not act like one., Any body's and every      body's notion of a pleasure excursion is that the parties to it will      of a necessity be young and giddy and somewhat boisterous., They      will dance a good deal, sing a good deal, make love, but sermonize      very little., Any body's and every body's notion of a well conducted      funeral is that there must be a hearse and a corpse, and chief      mourners and mourners by courtesy, many old people, much solemnity,      no levity, and a prayer and a sermon withal., Three-fourths of the      Quaker City's passengers were between forty and seventy years of      age!, There was a picnic crowd for you!, It may be supposed that the      other fourth was composed of young girls., But it was not., It was      chiefly composed of rusty old bachelors and a child of six years., Let us average the ages of the Quaker City's pilgrims and set the      figure down as fifty years., Is any man insane enough to imagine      that this picnic of patriarchs sang, made love, danced, laughed,      told anecdotes, dealt in ungodly levity?, In my experience they      sinned little in these matters., No doubt it was presumed here at      home that these frolicsome veterans laughed and sang and romped all      day, and day after day, and kept up a noisy excitement from one end      of the ship to the other; and that they played blind-man's buff or      danced quadrilles and waltzes on moonlight evenings on the      quarter-deck; and that at odd moments of unoccupied time they jotted      a laconic item or two in the journals they opened on such an      elaborate plan when they left home, and then skurried off to their      whist and euchre labors under the cabin lamps., If these things were      presumed, the presumption was at fault., The venerable excursionists      were not gay and frisky., They played no blind-man's buff; they      dealt not in whist; they shirked not the irksome journal, for alas!, most of them were even writing books., They never romped, they      talked but little, they never sang, save in the nightly      prayer-meeting., The pleasure ship was a synagogue, and the pleasure      trip was a funeral excursion without a corpse., (There is nothing      exhilarating about a funeral excursion without a corpse.), A free,      hearty laugh was a sound that was not heard oftener than once in      seven days about those decks or in those cabins, and when it was      heard it met with precious little sympathy., The excursionists      danced, on three separate evenings, long, long ago, (it seems an      age.), quadrilles, of a single set, made up of three ladies and five      gentlemen, (the latter with handkerchiefs around their arms to      signify their sex.), who timed their feet to the solemn wheezing of a      melodeon; but even this melancholy orgie was voted to be sinful, and      dancing was discontinued., The pilgrims played dominoes when too much Josephus or Robinson's      Holy Land Researches, or book-writing, made recreation necessary --     for dominoes is about as mild and sinless a game as any in the      world, perhaps, excepting always the ineffably insipid diversion      they call croquet, which is a game where you don't pocket any balls      and don't carom on any thing of any consequence, and when you are      done nobody has to pay, and there are no refreshments to saw off,      and, consequently, there isn't any satisfaction whatever about it --     they played dominoes till they were rested, and then they      blackguarded each other privately till prayer-time., When they were      not seasick they were uncommonly prompt when the dinner-gong      sounded., Such was our daily life on board the ship--solemnity,      decorum, dinner, dominoes, devotions, slander., It was not lively      enough for a pleasure trip; but if we had only had a corpse it would      have made a noble funeral excursion., It is all over now; but when I      look back, the idea of these venerable fossils skipping forth on a      six months' picnic, seems exquisitely refreshing., The advertised      title of the expedition--""The Grand Holy Land Pleasure Excursion"" --     was a misnomer., ""The Grand Holy Land Funeral Procession"" would have      been better--much better., Wherever we went, in Europe, Asia, or Africa, we made a sensation,      and, I suppose I may add, created a famine., None of us had ever      been any where before; we all hailed from the interior; travel was a      wild novelty to us, and we conducted ourselves in accordance with      the natural instincts that were in us, and trammeled ourselves with      no ceremonies, no conventionalities., We always took care to make it      understood that we were Americans--Americans!, When we found that a      good many foreigners had hardly ever heard of America, and that a      good many more knew it only as a barbarous province away off      somewhere, that had lately been at war with somebody, we pitied the      ignorance of the Old World, but abated no jot of our importance., Many and many a simple community in the Eastern hemisphere will      remember for years the incursion of the strange horde in the year of      our Lord 1867, that called themselves Americans, and seemed to      imagine in some unaccountable way that they had a right to be proud      of it., We generally created a famine, partly because the coffee on      the Quaker City was unendurable, and sometimes the more substantial      fare was not strictly first class; and partly because one naturally      tires of sitting long at the same board and eating from the same      dishes., The people of those foreign countries are very, very ignorant., They      looked curiously at the costumes we had brought from the wilds of      America., They observed that we talked loudly at table sometimes., They noticed that we looked out for expenses, and got what we      conveniently could out of a franc, and wondered where in the      mischief we came from., In Paris they just simply opened their eyes      and stared when we spoke to them in French!, We never did succeed in      making those idiots understand their own language., One of our      passengers said to a shopkeeper, in reference to a proposed return      to buy a pair of gloves, ""Allong restay trankeel--may be ve coom      Moonday;"" and would you believe it, that shopkeeper, a born      Frenchman, had to ask what it was that had been said., Sometimes it      seems to me, somehow, that there must be a difference between      Parisian French and Quaker City French., The people stared at us every where, and we stared at them., We      generally made them feel rather small, too, before we got done with      them, because we bore down on them with America's greatness until we      crushed them., And yet we took kindly to the manners and customs,      and especially to the fashions of the various people we visited., When we left the Azores, we wore awful capotes and used fine tooth      combs--successfully., When we came back from Tangier, in Africa, we      were topped with fezzes of the bloodiest hue, hung with tassels like      an Indian's scalp-lock., In France and Spain we attracted some      attention in these costumes., In Italy they naturally took us for      distempered Garibaldians, and set a gunboat to look for any thing      significant in our changes of uniform., We made Rome howl., We could      have made any place howl when we had all our clothes on., We got no      fresh raiment in Greece--they had but little there of any kind., But      at Constantinople, how we turned out!, Turbans, scimetars, fezzes,      horse-pistols, tunics, sashes, baggy trowsers, yellow slippers--Oh,      we were gorgeous!, The illustrious dogs of Constantinople barked      their under jaws off, and even then failed to do us justice., They      are all dead by this time., They could not go through such a run of      business as we gave them and survive., And then we went to see the Emperor of Russia., We just called on      him as comfortably as if we had known him a century or so, and when      we had finished our visit we variegated ourselves with selections      from Russian costumes and sailed away again more picturesque than      ever., In Smyrna we picked up camel's hair shawls and other dressy      things from Persia; but in Palestine--ah, in Palestine--our splendid      career ended., They didn't wear any clothes there to speak of., We      were satisfied, and stopped., We made no experiments., We did not      try their costume., But we astonished the natives of that country., We astonished them with such eccentricities of dress as we could      muster., We prowled through the Holy Land, from Cesarea Philippi to      Jerusalem and the Dead Sea, a weird procession of pilgrims, gotten      up regardless of expense, solemn, gorgeous, green-spectacled,      drowsing under blue umbrellas, and astride of a sorrier lot of      horses, camels and asses than those that came out of Noah's ark,      after eleven months of seasickness and short rations., If ever those      children of Israel in Palestine forget when Gideon's Band went      through there from America, they ought to be cursed once more and      finished., It was the rarest spectacle that ever astounded mortal      eyes, perhaps., Well, we were at home in Palestine., It was easy to see that that      was the grand feature of the expedition., We had cared nothing much      about Europe., We galloped through the Louvre, the Pitti, the      Ufizzi, the Vatican--all the galleries--and through the pictured and      frescoed churches of Venice, Naples, and the cathedrals of Spain;      some of us said that certain of the great works of the old masters      were glorious creations of genius, (we found it out in the      guide-book, though we got hold of the wrong picture sometimes,) and      the others said they were disgraceful old daubs., We examined modern      and ancient statuary with a critical eye in Florence, Rome, or any      where we found it, and praised it if we saw fit, and if we didn't we      said we preferred the wooden Indians in front of the cigar stores of      America., But the Holy Land brought out all our enthusiasm., We fell      into raptures by the barren shores of Galilee; we pondered at Tabor      and at Nazareth; we exploded into poetry over the questionable      loveliness of Esdraelon; we meditated at Jezreel and Samaria over      the missionary zeal of Jehu; we rioted--fairly rioted among the holy      places of Jerusalem; we bathed in Jordan and the Dead Sea, reckless      whether our accident-insurance policies were extra-hazardous or not,      and brought away so many jugs of precious water from both places      that all the country from Jericho to the mountains of Moab will      suffer from drouth this year, I think., Yet, the pilgrimage part of      the excursion was its pet feature--there is no question about that., After dismal, smileless Palestine, beautiful Egypt had few charms      for us., We merely glanced at it and were ready for home., They wouldn't let us land at Malta--quarantine; they would not let      us land in Sardinia; nor at Algiers, Africa; nor at Malaga, Spain,      nor Cadiz, nor at the Madeira islands., ...]",1
7,"[I thought some of the things I said were rather fine., But he merely looked around at me, at distant intervals, something as I have seen a benignant old cat look around to see which kitten was meddling with her tail., By and by I subsided into an indignant silence, and so sat until the end, hot and flushed, and execrating him in my heart for an ignorant savage., But he was calm., His conversation with those gentlemen flowed on as sweetly and peacefully and musically as any summer brook., When the audience was ended and we were retiring from the presence, he put his hand on my head, beamed down on me in an admiring way and said to my brother:  ""Ah--your child, I presume?, Boy, or girl?"", Mr. Street was very busy with his telegraphic matters--and considering that he had eight or nine hundred miles of rugged, snowy, uninhabited mountains, and waterless, treeless, melancholy deserts to traverse with his wire, it was natural and needful that he should be as busy as possible., He could not go comfortably along and cut his poles by the road-side, either, but they had to be hauled by ox teams across those exhausting deserts--and it was two days' journey from water to water, in one or two of them., Mr. Street's contract was a vast work, every way one looked at it; and yet to comprehend what the vague words ""eight hundred miles of rugged mountains and dismal deserts"" mean, one must go over the ground in person--pen and ink descriptions cannot convey the dreary reality to the reader., And after all, Mr. S.'s mightiest difficulty turned out to be one which he had never taken into the account at all., Unto Mormons he had sub-let the hardest and heaviest half of his great undertaking, and all of a sudden they concluded that they were going to make little or nothing, and so they tranquilly threw their poles overboard in mountain or desert, just as it happened when they took the notion, and drove home and went about their customary business!, They were under written contract to Mr. Street, but they did not care anything for that., They said they would ""admire"" to see a ""Gentile"" force a Mormon to fulfil a losing contract in Utah!, And they made themselves very merry over the matter., Street said--for it was he that told us these things:  ""I was in dismay., I was under heavy bonds to complete my contract in a given time, and this disaster looked very much like ruin., It was an astounding thing; it was such a wholly unlooked-for difficulty, that I was entirely nonplussed., I am a business man--have always been a business man--do not know anything but business--and so you can imagine how like being struck by lightning it was to find myself in a country where written contracts were worthless!--that main security, that sheet-anchor, that absolute necessity, of business., My confidence left me., There was no use in making new contracts--that was plain., I talked with first one prominent citizen and then another., They all sympathized with me, first rate, but they did not know how to help me., But at last a Gentile said, 'Go to Brigham Young!--these small fry cannot do you any good.', I did not think much of the idea, for if the law could not help me, what could an individual do who had not even anything to do with either making the laws or executing them?, He might be a very good patriarch of a church and preacher in its tabernacle, but something sterner than religion and moral suasion was needed to handle a hundred refractory, half-civilized sub-contractors., But what was a man to do?, I thought if Mr. Young could not do anything else, he might probably be able to give me some advice and a valuable hint or two, and so I went straight to him and laid the whole case before him., He said very little, but he showed strong interest all the way through., He examined all the papers in detail, and whenever there seemed anything like a hitch, either in the papers or my statement, he would go back and take up the thread and follow it patiently out to an intelligent and satisfactory result., Then he made a list of the contractors' names., Finally he said:  ""'Mr., Street, this is all perfectly plain., These contracts are strictly and legally drawn, and are duly signed and certified., These men manifestly entered into them with their eyes open., I see no fault or flaw anywhere.', ""Then Mr. Young turned to a man waiting at the other end of the room and said: 'Take this list of names to So-and-so, and tell him to have these men here at such-and-such an hour.', ""They were there, to the minute., So was I.  Mr. Young asked them a number of questions, and their answers made my statement good., Then he said to them:  ""'You signed these contracts and assumed these obligations of your own free will and accord?', ""'Yes.', ""'Then carry them out to the letter, if it makes paupers of you!, Go!', ""And they did go, too!, They are strung across the deserts now, working like bees., And I never hear a word out of them., ""There is a batch of governors, and judges, and other officials here, shipped from Washington, and they maintain the semblance of a republican form of government--but the petrified truth is that Utah is an absolute monarchy and Brigham Young is king!"", Mr. Street was a fine man, and I believe his story., I knew him well during several years afterward in San Francisco., Our stay in Salt Lake City amounted to only two days, and therefore we had no time to make the customary inquisition into the workings of polygamy and get up the usual statistics and deductions preparatory to calling the attention of the nation at large once more to the matter., I had the will to do it., With the gushing self-sufficiency of youth I was feverish to plunge in headlong and achieve a great reform here--until I saw the Mormon women., Then I was touched., My heart was wiser than my head., It warmed toward these poor, ungainly and pathetically ""homely"" creatures, and as I turned to hide the generous moisture in my eyes, I said, ""No--the man that marries one of them has done an act of Christian charity which entitles him to the kindly applause of mankind, not their harsh censure--and the man that marries sixty of them has done a deed of open-handed generosity so sublime that the nations should stand uncovered in his presence and worship in silence."", It is a luscious country for thrilling evening stories about assassinations of intractable Gentiles., I cannot easily conceive of anything more cosy than the night in Salt Lake which we spent in a Gentile den, smoking pipes and listening to tales of how Burton galloped in among the pleading and defenceless ""Morisites"" and shot them down, men and women, like so many dogs., And how Bill Hickman, a Destroying Angel, shot Drown and Arnold dead for bringing suit against him for a debt., And how Porter Rockwell did this and that dreadful thing., And how heedless people often come to Utah and make remarks about Brigham, or polygamy, or some other sacred matter, and the very next morning at daylight such parties are sure to be found lying up some back alley, contentedly waiting for the hearse., And the next most interesting thing is to sit and listen to these Gentiles talk about polygamy; and how some portly old frog of an elder, or a bishop, marries a girl--likes her, marries her sister--likes her, marries another sister--likes her, takes another--likes her, marries her mother--likes her, marries her father, grandfather, great grandfather, and then comes back hungry and asks for more., And how the pert young thing of eleven will chance to be the favorite wife and her own venerable grandmother have to rank away down toward D 4 in their mutual husband's esteem, and have to sleep in the kitchen, as like as not., And how this dreadful sort of thing, this hiving together in one foul nest of mother and daughters, and the making a young daughter superior to her own mother in rank and authority, are things which Mormon women submit to because their religion teaches them that the more wives a man has on earth, and the more children he rears, the higher the place they will all have in the world to come--and the warmer, maybe, though they do not seem to say anything about that., According to these Gentile friends of ours, Brigham Young's harem contains twenty or thirty wives., They said that some of them had grown old and gone out of active service, but were comfortably housed and cared for in the henery--or the Lion House, as it is strangely named., Along with each wife were her children--fifty altogether., The house was perfectly quiet and orderly, when the children were still., They all took their meals in one room, and a happy and home-like sight it was pronounced to be., None of our party got an opportunity to take dinner with Mr. Young, but a Gentile by the name of Johnson professed to have enjoyed a sociable breakfast in the Lion House., He gave a preposterous account of the ""calling of the roll,"" and other preliminaries, and the carnage that ensued when the buckwheat cakes came in., But he embellished rather too much., He said that Mr. Young told him several smart sayings of certain of his ""two-year-olds,"" observing with some pride that for many years he had been the heaviest contributor in that line to one of the Eastern magazines; and then he wanted to show Mr. Johnson one of the pets that had said the last good thing, but he could not find the child., He searched the faces of the children in detail, but could not decide which one it was., Finally he gave it up with a sigh and said:  ""I thought I would know the little cub again but I don't."", Mr. Johnson said further, that Mr. Young observed that life was a sad, sad thing --""because the joy of every new marriage a man contracted was so apt to be blighted by the inopportune funeral of a less recent bride."", And Mr. Johnson said that while he and Mr. Young were pleasantly conversing in private, one of the Mrs. Youngs came in and demanded a breast-pin, remarking that she had found out that he had been giving a breast-pin to No., 6, and she, for one, did not propose to let this partiality go on without making a satisfactory amount of trouble about it., Mr. Young reminded her that there was a stranger present., Mrs. Young said that if the state of things inside the house was not agreeable to the stranger, he could find room outside., Mr. Young promised the breast-pin, and she went away., But in a minute or two another Mrs. Young came in and demanded a breast-pin., Mr. Young began a remonstrance, but Mrs. Young cut him short., She said No., 6 had got one, and No., 11 was promised one, and it was ""no use for him to try to impose on her--she hoped she knew her rights."", He gave his promise, and she went., And presently three Mrs. Youngs entered in a body and opened on their husband a tempest of tears, abuse, and entreaty., They had heard all about No., 6, No., 11, and No., 14., Three more breast-pins were promised., They were hardly gone when nine more Mrs. Youngs filed into the presence, and a new tempest burst forth and raged round about the prophet and his guest., Nine breast-pins were promised, and the weird sisters filed out again., And in came eleven more, weeping and wailing and gnashing their teeth., Eleven promised breast-pins purchased peace once more., ""That is a specimen,"" said Mr. Young., ""You see how it is., You see what a life I lead., A man can't be wise all the time., ...]",1
8,"[There was a sudden leap and stir of blood that had been asleep for an hour, and as sudden a rousing of all the drowsing activities in our minds and bodies., We were alive and awake at once--and shaking and quaking with consternation, too., There was an instant halting and dismounting, a bending low and an anxious scanning of the road-bed., Useless, of course; for if a faint depression could not be discerned from an altitude of four or five feet above it, it certainly could not with one's nose nearly against it., We seemed to be in a road, but that was no proof., We tested this by walking off in various directions--the regular snow-mounds and the regular avenues between them convinced each man that he had found the true road, and that the others had found only false ones., Plainly the situation was desperate., We were cold and stiff and the horses were tired., We decided to build a sage-brush fire and camp out till morning., This was wise, because if we were wandering from the right road and the snow-storm continued another day our case would be the next thing to hopeless if we kept on., All agreed that a camp fire was what would come nearest to saving us, now, and so we set about building it., We could find no matches, and so we tried to make shift with the pistols., Not a man in the party had ever tried to do such a thing before, but not a man in the party doubted that it could be done, and without any trouble--because every man in the party had read about it in books many a time and had naturally come to believe it, with trusting simplicity, just as he had long ago accepted and believed that other common book-fraud about Indians and lost hunters making a fire by rubbing two dry sticks together., We huddled together on our knees in the deep snow, and the horses put their noses together and bowed their patient heads over us; and while the feathery flakes eddied down and turned us into a group of white statuary, we proceeded with the momentous experiment., We broke twigs from a sage bush and piled them on a little cleared place in the shelter of our bodies., In the course of ten or fifteen minutes all was ready, and then, while conversation ceased and our pulses beat low with anxious suspense, Ollendorff applied his revolver, pulled the trigger and blew the pile clear out of the county!, It was the flattest failure that ever was., This was distressing, but it paled before a greater horror--the horses were gone!, I had been appointed to hold the bridles, but in my absorbing anxiety over the pistol experiment I had unconsciously dropped them and the released animals had walked off in the storm., It was useless to try to follow them, for their footfalls could make no sound, and one could pass within two yards of the creatures and never see them., We gave them up without an effort at recovering them, and cursed the lying books that said horses would stay by their masters for protection and companionship in a distressful time like ours., We were miserable enough, before; we felt still more forlorn, now., Patiently, but with blighted hope, we broke more sticks and piled them, and once more the Prussian shot them into annihilation., Plainly, to light a fire with a pistol was an art requiring practice and experience, and the middle of a desert at midnight in a snow-storm was not a good place or time for the acquiring of the accomplishment., We gave it up and tried the other., Each man took a couple of sticks and fell to chafing them together., At the end of half an hour we were thoroughly chilled, and so were the sticks., We bitterly execrated the Indians, the hunters and the books that had betrayed us with the silly device, and wondered dismally what was next to be done., At this critical moment Mr. Ballou fished out four matches from the rubbish of an overlooked pocket., To have found four gold bars would have seemed poor and cheap good luck compared to this., One cannot think how good a match looks under such circumstances--or how lovable and precious, and sacredly beautiful to the eye., This time we gathered sticks with high hopes; and when Mr. Ballou prepared to light the first match, there was an amount of interest centred upon him that pages of writing could not describe., The match burned hopefully a moment, and then went out., It could not have carried more regret with it if it had been a human life., The next match simply flashed and died., The wind puffed the third one out just as it was on the imminent verge of success., We gathered together closer than ever, and developed a solicitude that was rapt and painful, as Mr. Ballou scratched our last hope on his leg., It lit, burned blue and sickly, and then budded into a robust flame., Shading it with his hands, the old gentleman bent gradually down and every heart went with him--everybody, too, for that matter--and blood and breath stood still., The flame touched the sticks at last, took gradual hold upon them--hesitated--took a stronger hold --hesitated again--held its breath five heart-breaking seconds, then gave a sort of human gasp and went out., Nobody said a word for several minutes., It was a solemn sort of silence; even the wind put on a stealthy, sinister quiet, and made no more noise than the falling flakes of snow., Finally a sad-voiced conversation began, and it was soon apparent that in each of our hearts lay the conviction that this was our last night with the living., I had so hoped that I was the only one who felt so., When the others calmly acknowledged their conviction, it sounded like the summons itself., Ollendorff said:  ""Brothers, let us die together., And let us go without one hard feeling towards each other., Let us forget and forgive bygones., I know that you have felt hard towards me for turning over the canoe, and for knowing too much and leading you round and round in the snow--but I meant well; forgive me., I acknowledge freely that I have had hard feelings against Mr. Ballou for abusing me and calling me a logarythm, which is a thing I do not know what, but no doubt a thing considered disgraceful and unbecoming in America, and it has scarcely been out of my mind and has hurt me a great deal--but let it go; I forgive Mr. Ballou with all my heart, and--""  Poor Ollendorff broke down and the tears came., He was not alone, for I was crying too, and so was Mr. Ballou., Ollendorff got his voice again and forgave me for things I had done and said., Then he got out his bottle of whisky and said that whether he lived or died he would never touch another drop., He said he had given up all hope of life, and although ill-prepared, was ready to submit humbly to his fate; that he wished he could be spared a little longer, not for any selfish reason, but to make a thorough reform in his character, and by devoting himself to helping the poor, nursing the sick, and pleading with the people to guard themselves against the evils of intemperance, make his life a beneficent example to the young, and lay it down at last with the precious reflection that it had not been lived in vain., He ended by saying that his reform should begin at this moment, even here in the presence of death, since no longer time was to be vouchsafed wherein to prosecute it to men's help and benefit--and with that he threw away the bottle of whisky., Mr. Ballou made remarks of similar purport, and began the reform he could not live to continue, by throwing away the ancient pack of cards that had solaced our captivity during the flood and made it bearable., He said he never gambled, but still was satisfied that the meddling with cards in any way was immoral and injurious, and no man could be wholly pure and blemishless without eschewing them., ""And therefore,"" continued he, ""in doing this act I already feel more in sympathy with that spiritual saturnalia necessary to entire and obsolete reform."", These rolling syllables touched him as no intelligible eloquence could have done, and the old man sobbed with a mournfulness not unmingled with satisfaction., My own remarks were of the same tenor as those of my comrades, and I know that the feelings that prompted them were heartfelt and sincere., We were all sincere, and all deeply moved and earnest, for we were in the presence of death and without hope., I threw away my pipe, and in doing it felt that at last I was free of a hated vice and one that had ridden me like a tyrant all my days., While I yet talked, the thought of the good I might have done in the world and the still greater good I might now do, with these new incentives and higher and better aims to guide me if I could only be spared a few years longer, overcame me and the tears came again., We put our arms about each other's necks and awaited the warning drowsiness that precedes death by freezing., It came stealing over us presently, and then we bade each other a last farewell., A delicious dreaminess wrought its web about my yielding senses, while the snow-flakes wove a winding sheet about my conquered body., Oblivion came., The battle of life was done., I do not know how long I was in a state of forgetfulness, but it seemed an age., A vague consciousness grew upon me by degrees, and then came a gathering anguish of pain in my limbs and through all my body., I shuddered., The thought flitted through my brain, ""this is death--this is the hereafter."", Then came a white upheaval at my side, and a voice said, with bitterness:  ""Will some gentleman be so good as to kick me behind?"", It was Ballou--at least it was a towzled snow image in a sitting posture, with Ballou's voice., I rose up, and there in the gray dawn, not fifteen steps from us, were the frame buildings of a stage station, and under a shed stood our still saddled and bridled horses!, An arched snow-drift broke up, now, and Ollendorff emerged from it, and the three of us sat and stared at the houses without speaking a word., We really had nothing to say., We were like the profane man who could not ""do the subject justice,"" the whole situation was so painfully ridiculous and humiliating that words were tame and we did not know where to commence anyhow., The joy in our hearts at our deliverance was poisoned; well-nigh dissipated, indeed., We presently began to grow pettish by degrees, and sullen; and then, angry at each other, angry at ourselves, angry at everything in general, we moodily dusted the snow from our clothing and in unsociable single file plowed our way to the horses, unsaddled them, and sought shelter in the station., I have scarcely exaggerated a detail of this curious and absurd adventure., It occurred almost exactly as I have stated it., We actually went into camp in a snow-drift in a desert, at midnight in a storm, forlorn and hopeless, within fifteen steps of a comfortable inn., For two hours we sat apart in the station and ruminated in disgust., The mystery was gone, now, and it was plain enough why the horses had deserted us., Without a doubt they were under that shed a quarter of a minute after they had left us, and they must have overheard and enjoyed all our confessions and lamentations., After breakfast we felt better, and the zest of life soon came back., The world looked bright again, and existence was as dear to us as ever., Presently an uneasiness came over me--grew upon me--assailed me without ceasing., Alas, my regeneration was not complete--I wanted to smoke!, I resisted with all my strength, but the flesh was weak., I wandered away alone and wrestled with myself an hour., I recalled my promises of reform and preached to myself persuasively, upbraidingly, exhaustively., But it was all vain, I shortly found myself sneaking among the snow-drifts hunting for my pipe., I discovered it after a considerable search, and crept away to hide myself and enjoy it., I remained behind the barn a good while, asking myself how I would feel if my braver, stronger, truer comrades should catch me in my degradation., At last I lit the pipe, and no human being can feel meaner and baser than I did then., I was ashamed of being in my own pitiful company., Still dreading discovery, I felt that perhaps the further side of the barn would be somewhat safer, and so I turned the corner., As I turned the one corner, smoking, Ollendorff turned the other with his bottle to his lips, and between us sat unconscious Ballou deep in a game of ""solitaire"" with the old greasy cards!, ...]",1
9,"[And he cleaned 'em, too!, I was there, pard, and I seen it myself."", ""That was very well indeed--at least the impulse was--whether the act was strictly defensible or not., Had deceased any religious convictions?, That is to say, did he feel a dependence upon, or acknowledge allegiance to a higher power?"", More reflection., ""I reckon you've stumped me again, pard., Could you say it over once more, and say it slow?"", ""Well, to simplify it somewhat, was he, or rather had he ever been connected with any organization sequestered from secular concerns and devoted to self-sacrifice in the interests of morality?"", ""All down but nine--set 'em up on the other alley, pard."", ""What did I understand you to say?"", ""Why, you're most too many for me, you know., When you get in with your left I hunt grass every time., Every time you draw, you fill; but I don't seem to have any luck., Lets have a new deal."", ""How?, Begin again?"", ""That's it."", ""Very well., Was he a good man, and--""  ""There--I see that; don't put up another chip till I look at my hand., A good man, says you?, Pard, it ain't no name for it., He was the best man that ever--pard, you would have doted on that man., He could lam any galoot of his inches in America., It was him that put down the riot last election before it got a start; and everybody said he was the only man that could have done it., He waltzed in with a spanner in one hand and a trumpet in the other, and sent fourteen men home on a shutter in less than three minutes., He had that riot all broke up and prevented nice before anybody ever got a chance to strike a blow., He was always for peace, and he would have peace--he could not stand disturbances., Pard, he was a great loss to this town., It would please the boys if you could chip in something like that and do him justice., Here once when the Micks got to throwing stones through the Methodis' Sunday school windows, Buck Fanshaw, all of his own notion, shut up his saloon and took a couple of six-shooters and mounted guard over the Sunday school., Says he, 'No Irish need apply!', And they didn't., He was the bulliest man in the mountains, pard!, He could run faster, jump higher, hit harder, and hold more tangle-foot whisky without spilling it than any man in seventeen counties., Put that in, pard--it'll please the boys more than anything you could say., And you can say, pard, that he never shook his mother."", ""Never shook his mother?"", ""That's it--any of the boys will tell you so."", ""Well, but why should he shake her?"", ""That's what I say--but some people does."", ""Not people of any repute?"", ""Well, some that averages pretty so-so."", ""In my opinion the man that would offer personal violence to his own mother, ought to--""  ""Cheese it, pard; you've banked your ball clean outside the string., What I was a drivin' at, was, that he never throwed off on his mother --don't you see?, No indeedy., He give her a house to live in, and town lots, and plenty of money; and he looked after her and took care of her all the time; and when she was down with the small-pox I'm d---d if he didn't set up nights and nuss her himself!, Beg your pardon for saying it, but it hopped out too quick for yours truly., ""You've treated me like a gentleman, pard, and I ain't the man to hurt your feelings intentional., I think you're white., I think you're a square man, pard., I like you, and I'll lick any man that don't., I'll lick him till he can't tell himself from a last year's corpse!, Put it there!"", [Another fraternal hand-shake--and exit.], The obsequies were all that ""the boys"" could desire., Such a marvel of funeral pomp had never been seen in Virginia., The plumed hearse, the dirge-breathing brass bands, the closed marts of business, the flags drooping at half mast, the long, plodding procession of uniformed secret societies, military battalions and fire companies, draped engines, carriages of officials, and citizens in vehicles and on foot, attracted multitudes of spectators to the sidewalks, roofs and windows; and for years afterward, the degree of grandeur attained by any civic display in Virginia was determined by comparison with Buck Fanshaw's funeral., Scotty Briggs, as a pall-bearer and a mourner, occupied a prominent place at the funeral, and when the sermon was finished and the last sentence of the prayer for the dead man's soul ascended, he responded, in a low voice, but with feelings:  ""AMEN., No Irish need apply."", As the bulk of the response was without apparent relevancy, it was probably nothing more than a humble tribute to the memory of the friend that was gone; for, as Scotty had once said, it was ""his word."", Scotty Briggs, in after days, achieved the distinction of becoming the only convert to religion that was ever gathered from the Virginia roughs; and it transpired that the man who had it in him to espouse the quarrel of the weak out of inborn nobility of spirit was no mean timber whereof to construct a Christian., The making him one did not warp his generosity or diminish his courage; on the contrary it gave intelligent direction to the one and a broader field to the other., If his Sunday-school class progressed faster than the other classes, was it matter for wonder?, I think not., He talked to his pioneer small-fry in a language they understood!, It was my large privilege, a month before he died, to hear him tell the beautiful story of Joseph and his brethren to his class ""without looking at the book."", I leave it to the reader to fancy what it was like, as it fell, riddled with slang, from the lips of that grave, earnest teacher, and was listened to by his little learners with a consuming interest that showed that they were as unconscious as he was that any violence was being done to the sacred proprieties!, The first twenty-six graves in the Virginia cemetery were occupied by murdered men., So everybody said, so everybody believed, and so they will always say and believe., The reason why there was so much slaughtering done, was, that in a new mining district the rough element predominates, and a person is not respected until he has ""killed his man."", That was the very expression used., If an unknown individual arrived, they did not inquire if he was capable, honest, industrious, but--had he killed his man?, If he had not, he gravitated to his natural and proper position, that of a man of small consequence; if he had, the cordiality of his reception was graduated according to the number of his dead., It was tedious work struggling up to a position of influence with bloodless hands; but when a man came with the blood of half a dozen men on his soul, his worth was recognized at once and his acquaintance sought., In Nevada, for a time, the lawyer, the editor, the banker, the chief desperado, the chief gambler, and the saloon keeper, occupied the same level in society, and it was the highest., The cheapest and easiest way to become an influential man and be looked up to by the community at large, was to stand behind a bar, wear a cluster-diamond pin, and sell whisky., I am not sure but that the saloon-keeper held a shade higher rank than any other member of society., His opinion had weight., It was his privilege to say how the elections should go., No great movement could succeed without the countenance and direction of the saloon-keepers., It was a high favor when the chief saloon-keeper consented to serve in the legislature or the board of aldermen., Youthful ambition hardly aspired so much to the honors of the law, or the army and navy as to the dignity of proprietorship in a saloon., To be a saloon-keeper and kill a man was to be illustrious., Hence the reader will not be surprised to learn that more than one man was killed in Nevada under hardly the pretext of provocation, so impatient was the slayer to achieve reputation and throw off the galling sense of being held in indifferent repute by his associates., I knew two youths who tried to ""kill their men"" for no other reason--and got killed themselves for their pains., ""There goes the man that killed Bill Adams"" was higher praise and a sweeter sound in the ears of this sort of people than any other speech that admiring lips could utter., The men who murdered Virginia's original twenty-six cemetery-occupants were never punished., Why?, Because Alfred the Great, when he invented trial by jury and knew that he had admirably framed it to secure justice in his age of the world, was not aware that in the nineteenth century the condition of things would be so entirely changed that unless he rose from the grave and altered the jury plan to meet the emergency, it would prove the most ingenious and infallible agency for defeating justice that human wisdom could contrive., For how could he imagine that we simpletons would go on using his jury plan after circumstances had stripped it of its usefulness, any more than he could imagine that we would go on using his candle-clock after we had invented chronometers?, In his day news could not travel fast, and hence he could easily find a jury of honest, intelligent men who had not heard of the case they were called to try --but in our day of telegraphs and newspapers his plan compels us to swear in juries composed of fools and rascals, because the system rigidly excludes honest men and men of brains., I remember one of those sorrowful farces, in Virginia, which we call a jury trial., A noted desperado killed Mr. B., a good citizen, in the most wanton and cold-blooded way., Of course the papers were full of it, and all men capable of reading, read about it., And of course all men not deaf and dumb and idiotic, talked about it., A jury-list was made out, and Mr. B. L., a prominent banker and a valued citizen, was questioned precisely as he would have been questioned in any court in America:  ""Have you heard of this homicide?"", ""Yes."", ""Have you held conversations upon the subject?"", ""Yes."", ...]",1
10,"[The main part of his daily life was occupied in looking after ""Fan,"" in a motherly way, and doctoring her for a hundred ailments which existed only in his imagination., The Admiral seldom read newspapers; and when he did he never believed anything they said., He read nothing, and believed in nothing, but ""The Old Guard,"" a secession periodical published in New York., He carried a dozen copies of it with him, always, and referred to them for all required information., If it was not there, he supplied it himself, out of a bountiful fancy, inventing history, names, dates, and every thing else necessary to make his point good in an argument., Consequently he was a formidable antagonist in a dispute., Whenever he swung clear of the record and began to create history, the enemy was helpless and had to surrender., Indeed, the enemy could not keep from betraying some little spark of indignation at his manufactured history--and when it came to indignation, that was the Admiral's very ""best hold."", He was always ready for a political argument, and if nobody started one he would do it himself., With his third retort his temper would begin to rise, and within five minutes he would be blowing a gale, and within fifteen his smoking-room audience would be utterly stormed away and the old man left solitary and alone, banging the table with his fist, kicking the chairs, and roaring a hurricane of profanity., It got so, after a while, that whenever the Admiral approached, with politics in his eye, the passengers would drop out with quiet accord, afraid to meet him; and he would camp on a deserted field., But he found his match at last, and before a full company., At one time or another, everybody had entered the lists against him and been routed, except the quiet passenger Williams., He had never been able to get an expression of opinion out of him on politics., But now, just as the Admiral drew near the door and the company were about to slip out, Williams said:  ""Admiral, are you certain about that circumstance concerning the clergymen you mentioned the other day?"", --referring to a piece of the Admiral's manufactured history., Every one was amazed at the man's rashness., The idea of deliberately inviting annihilation was a thing incomprehensible., The retreat came to a halt; then everybody sat down again wondering, to await the upshot of it., The Admiral himself was as surprised as any one., He paused in the door, with his red handkerchief half raised to his sweating face, and contemplated the daring reptile in the corner., ""Certain of it?, Am I certain of it?, Do you think I've been lying about it?, What do you take me for?, Anybody that don't know that circumstance, don't know anything; a child ought to know it., Read up your history!, Read it up-----, and don't come asking a man if he's certain about a bit of ABC stuff that the very southern niggers know all about."", Here the Admiral's fires began to wax hot, the atmosphere thickened, the coming earthquake rumbled, he began to thunder and lighten., Within three minutes his volcano was in full irruption and he was discharging flames and ashes of indignation, belching black volumes of foul history aloft, and vomiting red-hot torrents of profanity from his crater., Meantime Williams sat silent, and apparently deeply and earnestly interested in what the old man was saying., By and by, when the lull came, he said in the most deferential way, and with the gratified air of a man who has had a mystery cleared up which had been puzzling him uncomfortably:  ""Now I understand it., I always thought I knew that piece of history well enough, but was still afraid to trust it, because there was not that convincing particularity about it that one likes to have in history; but when you mentioned every name, the other day, and every date, and every little circumstance, in their just order and sequence, I said to myself, this sounds something like--this is history--this is putting it in a shape that gives a man confidence; and I said to myself afterward, I will just ask the Admiral if he is perfectly certain about the details, and if he is I will come out and thank him for clearing this matter up for me., And that is what I want to do now--for until you set that matter right it was nothing but just a confusion in my mind, without head or tail to it."", Nobody ever saw the Admiral look so mollified before, and so pleased., Nobody had ever received his bogus history as gospel before; its genuineness had always been called in question either by words or looks; but here was a man that not only swallowed it all down, but was grateful for the dose., He was taken a back; he hardly knew what to say; even his profanity failed him., Now, Williams continued, modestly and earnestly:  ""But Admiral, in saying that this was the first stone thrown, and that this precipitated the war, you have overlooked a circumstance which you are perfectly familiar with, but which has escaped your memory., Now I grant you that what you have stated is correct in every detail--to wit: that on the 16th of October, 1860, two Massachusetts clergymen, named Waite and Granger, went in disguise to the house of John Moody, in Rockport, at dead of night, and dragged forth two southern women and their two little children, and after tarring and feathering them conveyed them to Boston and burned them alive in the State House square; and I also grant your proposition that this deed is what led to the secession of South Carolina on the 20th of December following., Very well."", [Here the company were pleasantly surprised to hear Williams proceed to come back at the Admiral with his own invincible weapon--clean, pure, manufactured history, without a word of truth in it.], ""Very well, I say., But Admiral, why overlook the Willis and Morgan case in South Carolina?, You are too well informed a man not to know all about that circumstance., Your arguments and your conversations have shown you to be intimately conversant with every detail of this national quarrel., You develop matters of history every day that show plainly that you are no smatterer in it, content to nibble about the surface, but a man who has searched the depths and possessed yourself of everything that has a bearing upon the great question., Therefore, let me just recall to your mind that Willis and Morgan case--though I see by your face that the whole thing is already passing through your memory at this moment., On the 12th of August, 1860, two months before the Waite and Granger affair, two South Carolina clergymen, named John H. Morgan and Winthrop L.  Willis, one a Methodist and the other an Old School Baptist, disguised themselves, and went at midnight to the house of a planter named Thompson--Archibald F. Thompson, Vice President under Thomas Jefferson,--and took thence, at midnight, his widowed aunt, (a Northern woman,) and her adopted child, an orphan--named Mortimer Highie, afflicted with epilepsy and suffering at the time from white swelling on one of his legs, and compelled to walk on crutches in consequence; and the two ministers, in spite of the pleadings of the victims, dragged them to the bush, tarred and feathered them, and afterward burned them at the stake in the city of Charleston., You remember perfectly well what a stir it made; you remember perfectly well that even the Charleston Courier stigmatized the act as being unpleasant, of questionable propriety, and scarcely justifiable, and likewise that it would not be matter of surprise if retaliation ensued., And you remember also, that this thing was the cause of the Massachusetts outrage., Who, indeed, were the two Massachusetts ministers?, and who were the two Southern women they burned?, I do not need to remind you, Admiral, with your intimate knowledge of history, that Waite was the nephew of the woman burned in Charleston; that Granger was her cousin in the second degree, and that the woman they burned in Boston was the wife of John H. Morgan, and the still loved but divorced wife of Winthrop L. Willis., Now, Admiral, it is only fair that you should acknowledge that the first provocation came from the Southern preachers and that the Northern ones were justified in retaliating., In your arguments you never yet have shown the least disposition to withhold a just verdict or be in anywise unfair, when authoritative history condemned your position, and therefore I have no hesitation in asking you to take the original blame from the Massachusetts ministers, in this matter, and transfer it to the South Carolina clergymen where it justly belongs."", The Admiral was conquered., This sweet spoken creature who swallowed his fraudulent history as if it were the bread of life; basked in his furious blasphemy as if it were generous sunshine; found only calm, even-handed justice in his rampart partisanship; and flooded him with invented history so sugarcoated with flattery and deference that there was no rejecting it, was ""too many"" for him., He stammered some awkward, profane sentences about the-----Willis and Morgan business having escaped his memory, but that he ""remembered it now,"" and then, under pretence of giving Fan some medicine for an imaginary cough, drew out of the battle and went away, a vanquished man., Then cheers and laughter went up, and Williams, the ship's benefactor was a hero., The news went about the vessel, champagne was ordered, and enthusiastic reception instituted in the smoking room, and everybody flocked thither to shake hands with the conqueror., The wheelman said afterward, that the Admiral stood up behind the pilot house and ""ripped and cursed all to himself"" till he loosened the smokestack guys and becalmed the mainsail., The Admiral's power was broken., After that, if he began argument, somebody would bring Williams, and the old man would grow weak and begin to quiet down at once., And as soon as he was done, Williams in his dulcet, insinuating way, would invent some history (referring for proof, to the old man's own excellent memory and to copies of ""The Old Guard"" known not to be in his possession) that would turn the tables completely and leave the Admiral all abroad and helpless., By and by he came to so dread Williams and his gilded tongue that he would stop talking when he saw him approach, and finally ceased to mention politics altogether, and from that time forward there was entire peace and serenity in the ship., On a certain bright morning the Islands hove in sight, lying low on the lonely sea, and everybody climbed to the upper deck to look., After two thousand miles of watery solitude the vision was a welcome one., As we approached, the imposing promontory of Diamond Head rose up out of the ocean its rugged front softened by the hazy distance, and presently the details of the land began to make themselves manifest: first the line of beach; then the plumed coacoanut trees of the tropics; then cabins of the natives; then the white town of Honolulu, said to contain between twelve and fifteen thousand inhabitants spread over a dead level; with streets from twenty to thirty feet wide, solid and level as a floor, most of them straight as a line and few as crooked as a corkscrew., The further I traveled through the town the better I liked it., Every step revealed a new contrast--disclosed something I was unaccustomed to., In place of the grand mud-colored brown fronts of San Francisco, I saw dwellings built of straw, adobies, and cream-colored pebble-and-shell-conglomerated coral, cut into oblong blocks and laid in cement; also a great number of neat white cottages, with green window-shutters; in place of front yards like billiard-tables with iron fences around them, I saw these homes surrounded by ample yards, thickly clad with green grass, and shaded by tall trees, through whose dense foliage the sun could scarcely penetrate; in place of the customary geranium, calla lily, etc., languishing in dust and general debility, I saw luxurious banks and thickets of flowers, fresh as a meadow after a rain, and glowing with the richest dyes; in place of the dingy horrors of San Francisco's pleasure grove, the ""Willows,"" I saw huge-bodied, wide-spreading forest trees, with strange names and stranger appearance --trees that cast a shadow like a thunder-cloud, and were able to stand alone without being tied to green poles; in place of gold fish, wiggling around in glass globes, assuming countless shades and degrees of distortion through the magnifying and diminishing qualities of their transparent prison houses, I saw cats--Tom-cats, Mary Ann cats, long-tailed cats, bob-tailed cats, blind cats, one-eyed cats, wall-eyed cats, cross-eyed cats, gray cats, black cats, white cats, yellow cats, striped cats, spotted cats, tame cats, wild cats, singed cats, individual cats, groups of cats, platoons of cats, companies of cats, regiments of cats, armies of cats, multitudes of cats, millions of cats, and all of them sleek, fat, lazy and sound asleep., I looked on a multitude of people, some white, in white coats, vests, pantaloons, even white cloth shoes, made snowy with chalk duly laid on every morning; but the majority of the people were almost as dark as negroes--women with comely features, fine black eyes, rounded forms, inclining to the voluptuous, clad in a single bright red or white garment that fell free and unconfined from shoulder to heel, long black hair falling loose, gypsy hats, encircled with wreaths of natural flowers of a brilliant carmine tint; plenty of dark men in various costumes, and some with nothing on but a battered stove-pipe hat tilted on the nose, and a very scant breech-clout; --certain smoke-dried children were clothed in nothing but sunshine --a very neat fitting and picturesque apparel indeed., In place of roughs and rowdies staring and blackguarding on the corners, I saw long-haired, saddle-colored Sandwich Island maidens sitting on the ground in the shade of corner houses, gazing indolently at whatever or whoever happened along; instead of wretched cobble-stone pavements, I walked on a firm foundation of coral, built up from the bottom of the sea by the absurd but persevering insect of that name, with a light layer of lava and cinders overlying the coral, belched up out of fathomless perdition long ago through the seared and blackened crater that stands dead and harmless in the distance now; instead of cramped and crowded street-cars, I met dusky native women sweeping by, free as the wind, on fleet horses and astride, with gaudy riding-sashes, streaming like banners behind them; instead of the combined stenches of Chinadom and Brannan street slaughter-houses, I breathed the balmy fragrance of jessamine, oleander, and the Pride of India; in place of the hurry and bustle and noisy confusion of San Francisco, I moved in the midst of a Summer calm as tranquil as dawn in the Garden of Eden; in place of the Golden City's skirting sand hills and the placid bay, I saw on the one side a frame-work of tall, precipitous mountains close at hand, clad in refreshing green, and cleft by deep, cool, chasm-like valleys--and in front the grand sweep of the ocean; a brilliant, transparent green near the shore, bound and bordered by a long white line of foamy spray dashing against the reef, and further out the dead blue water of the deep sea, flecked with ""white caps,"" and in the far horizon a single, lonely sail --a mere accent-mark to emphasize a slumberous calm and a solitude that were without sound or limit., When the sun sunk down--the one intruder from other realms and persistent in suggestions of them--it was tranced luxury to sit in the perfumed air and forget that there was any world but these enchanted islands., It was such ecstacy to dream, and dream--till you got a bite., A scorpion bite., Then the first duty was to get up out of the grass and kill the scorpion; and the next to bathe the bitten place with alcohol or brandy; and the next to resolve to keep out of the grass in future., Then came an adjournment to the bed-chamber and the pastime of writing up the day's journal with one hand and the destruction of mosquitoes with the other--a whole community of them at a slap., Then, observing an enemy approaching,--a hairy tarantula on stilts--why not set the spittoon on him?, It is done, and the projecting ends of his paws give a luminous idea of the magnitude of his reach., Then to bed and become a promenade for a centipede with forty-two legs on a side and every foot hot enough to burn a hole through a raw-hide., More soaking with alcohol, and a resolution to examine the bed before entering it, in future., Then wait, and suffer, till all the mosquitoes in the neighborhood have crawled in under the bar, then slip out quickly, shut them in and sleep peacefully on the floor till morning., Meantime it is comforting to curse the tropics in occasional wakeful intervals., We had an abundance of fruit in Honolulu, of course., Oranges, pine-apples, bananas, strawberries, lemons, limes, mangoes, guavas, melons, and a rare and curious luxury called the chirimoya, which is deliciousness itself., Then there is the tamarind., I thought tamarinds were made to eat, but that was probably not the idea., I ate several, and it seemed to me that they were rather sour that year., They pursed up my lips, till they resembled the stem-end of a tomato, and I had to take my sustenance through a quill for twenty-four hours., They sharpened my teeth till I could have shaved with them, and gave them a ""wire edge"" that I was afraid would stay; but a citizen said ""no, it will come off when the enamel does""--which was comforting, at any rate., I found, afterward, that only strangers eat tamarinds--but they only eat them once., In my diary of our third day in Honolulu, I find this:  I am probably the most sensitive man in Hawaii to-night--especially about sitting down in the presence of my betters., I have ridden fifteen or twenty miles on horse-back since 5 P.M.  and to tell the honest truth, I have a delicacy about sitting down at all., An excursion to Diamond Head and the King's Coacoanut Grove was planned to-day--time, 4:30 P.M.--the party to consist of half a dozen gentlemen and three ladies., They all started at the appointed hour except myself., I was at the Government prison, (with Captain Fish and another whaleship-skipper, Captain Phillips,) and got so interested in its examination that I did not notice how quickly the time was passing., Somebody remarked that it was twenty minutes past five o'clock, and that woke me up., It was a fortunate circumstance that Captain Phillips was along with his ""turn out,"" as he calls a top-buggy that Captain Cook brought here in 1778, and a horse that was here when Captain Cook came., Captain Phillips takes a just pride in his driving and in the speed of his horse, and to his passion for displaying them I owe it that we were only sixteen minutes coming from the prison to the American Hotel--a distance which has been estimated to be over half a mile., ...]",1
11,"[He recognized that it was better to move to the wilderness than be moved., By his command the people gathered together their meagre effects, turned their backs upon their homes, and their faces toward the wilderness, and on a bitter night in February filed in sorrowful procession across the frozen Mississippi, lighted on their way by the glare from their burning temple, whose sacred furniture their own hands had fired!, They camped, several days afterward, on the western verge of Iowa, and poverty, want, hunger, cold, sickness, grief and persecution did their work, and many succumbed and died--martyrs, fair and true, whatever else they might have been., Two years the remnant remained there, while Brigham and a small party crossed the country and founded Great Salt Lake City, purposely choosing a land which was outside the ownership and jurisdiction of the hated American nation., Note that., This was in 1847., Brigham moved his people there and got them settled just in time to see disaster fall again., For the war closed and Mexico ceded Brigham's refuge to the enemy--the United States!, In 1849 the Mormons organized a ""free and independent"" government and erected the ""State of Deseret,"" with Brigham Young as its head., But the very next year Congress deliberately snubbed it and created the ""Territory of Utah"" out of the same accumulation of mountains, sage-brush, alkali and general desolation,--but made Brigham Governor of it., Then for years the enormous migration across the plains to California poured through the land of the Mormons and yet the church remained staunch and true to its lord and master., Neither hunger, thirst, poverty, grief, hatred, contempt, nor persecution could drive the Mormons from their faith or their allegiance; and even the thirst for gold, which gleaned the flower of the youth and strength of many nations was not able to entice them!, That was the final test., An experiment that could survive that was an experiment with some substance to it somewhere., Great Salt Lake City throve finely, and so did Utah., One of the last things which Brigham Young had done before leaving Iowa, was to appear in the pulpit dressed to personate the worshipped and lamented prophet Smith, and confer the prophetic succession, with all its dignities, emoluments and authorities, upon ""President Brigham Young!"", The people accepted the pious fraud with the maddest enthusiasm, and Brigham's power was sealed and secured for all time., Within five years afterward he openly added polygamy to the tenets of the church by authority of a ""revelation"" which he pretended had been received nine years before by Joseph Smith, albeit Joseph is amply on record as denouncing polygamy to the day of his death., Now was Brigham become a second Andrew Johnson in the small beginning and steady progress of his official grandeur., He had served successively as a disciple in the ranks; home missionary; foreign missionary; editor and publisher; Apostle; President of the Board of Apostles; President of all Mormondom, civil and ecclesiastical; successor to the great Joseph by the will of heaven; ""prophet,"" ""seer,"" ""revelator."", There was but one dignity higher which he could aspire to, and he reached out modestly and took that--he proclaimed himself a God!, He claims that he is to have a heaven of his own hereafter, and that he will be its God, and his wives and children its goddesses, princes and princesses., Into it all faithful Mormons will be admitted, with their families, and will take rank and consequence according to the number of their wives and children., If a disciple dies before he has had time to accumulate enough wives and children to enable him to be respectable in the next world any friend can marry a few wives and raise a few children for him after he is dead, and they are duly credited to his account and his heavenly status advanced accordingly., Let it be borne in mind that the majority of the Mormons have always been ignorant, simple, of an inferior order of intellect, unacquainted with the world and its ways; and let it be borne in mind that the wives of these Mormons are necessarily after the same pattern and their children likely to be fit representatives of such a conjunction; and then let it be remembered that for forty years these creatures have been driven, driven, driven, relentlessly!, and mobbed, beaten, and shot down; cursed, despised, expatriated; banished to a remote desert, whither they journeyed gaunt with famine and disease, disturbing the ancient solitudes with their lamentations and marking the long way with graves of their dead--and all because they were simply trying to live and worship God in the way which they believed with all their hearts and souls to be the true one., Let all these things be borne in mind, and then it will not be hard to account for the deathless hatred which the Mormons bear our people and our government., That hatred has ""fed fat its ancient grudge"" ever since Mormon Utah developed into a self-supporting realm and the church waxed rich and strong., Brigham as Territorial Governor made it plain that Mormondom was for the Mormons., The United States tried to rectify all that by appointing territorial officers from New England and other anti-Mormon localities, but Brigham prepared to make their entrance into his dominions difficult., Three thousand United States troops had to go across the plains and put these gentlemen in office., And after they were in office they were as helpless as so many stone images., They made laws which nobody minded and which could not be executed., The federal judges opened court in a land filled with crime and violence and sat as holiday spectacles for insolent crowds to gape at--for there was nothing to try, nothing to do nothing on the dockets!, And if a Gentile brought a suit, the Mormon jury would do just as it pleased about bringing in a verdict, and when the judgment of the court was rendered no Mormon cared for it and no officer could execute it., Our Presidents shipped one cargo of officials after another to Utah, but the result was always the same--they sat in a blight for awhile they fairly feasted on scowls and insults day by day, they saw every attempt to do their official duties find its reward in darker and darker looks, and in secret threats and warnings of a more and more dismal nature--and at last they either succumbed and became despised tools and toys of the Mormons, or got scared and discomforted beyond all endurance and left the Territory., If a brave officer kept on courageously till his pluck was proven, some pliant Buchanan or Pierce would remove him and appoint a stick in his place., In 1857 General Harney came very near being appointed Governor of Utah., And so it came very near being Harney governor and Cradlebaugh judge!, --two men who never had any idea of fear further than the sort of murky comprehension of it which they were enabled to gather from the dictionary., Simply (if for nothing else) for the variety they would have made in a rather monotonous history of Federal servility and helplessness, it is a pity they were not fated to hold office together in Utah., Up to the date of our visit to Utah, such had been the Territorial record., The Territorial government established there had been a hopeless failure, and Brigham Young was the only real power in the land., He was an absolute monarch--a monarch who defied our President--a monarch who laughed at our armies when they camped about his capital--a monarch who received without emotion the news that the august Congress of the United States had enacted a solemn law against polygamy, and then went forth calmly and married twenty-five or thirty more wives., B., THE MOUNTAIN MEADOWS MASSACRE., The persecutions which the Mormons suffered so long--and which they consider they still suffer in not being allowed to govern themselves --they have endeavored and are still endeavoring to repay., The now almost forgotten ""Mountain Meadows massacre"" was their work., It was very famous in its day., The whole United States rang with its horrors., A few items will refresh the reader's memory., A great emigrant train from Missouri and Arkansas passed through Salt Lake City and a few disaffected Mormons joined it for the sake of the strong protection it afforded for their escape., In that matter lay sufficient cause for hot retaliation by the Mormon chiefs., Besides, these one hundred and forty-five or one hundred and fifty unsuspecting emigrants being in part from Arkansas, where a noted Mormon missionary had lately been killed, and in part from Missouri, a State remembered with execrations as a bitter persecutor of the saints when they were few and poor and friendless, here were substantial additional grounds for lack of love for these wayfarers., And finally, this train was rich, very rich in cattle, horses, mules and other property--and how could the Mormons consistently keep up their coveted resemblance to the Israelitish tribes and not seize the ""spoil"" of an enemy when the Lord had so manifestly ""delivered it into their hand?"", Wherefore, according to Mrs. C. V. Waite's entertaining book, ""The Mormon Prophet,"" it transpired that--  ""A 'revelation' from Brigham Young, as Great Grand Archee or God, was dispatched to President J. C. Haight, Bishop Higbee and J. D. Lee (adopted son of Brigham), commanding them to raise all the forces they could muster and trust, follow those cursed Gentiles (so read the revelation), attack them disguised as Indians, and with the arrows of the Almighty make a clean sweep of them, and leave none to tell the tale; and if they needed any assistance they were commanded to hire the Indians as their allies, promising them a share of the booty., They were to be neither slothful nor negligent in their duty, and to be punctual in sending the teams back to him before winter set in, for this was the mandate of Almighty God."", The command of the ""revelation"" was faithfully obeyed., A large party of Mormons, painted and tricked out as Indians, overtook the train of emigrant wagons some three hundred miles south of Salt Lake City, and made an attack., But the emigrants threw up earthworks, made fortresses of their wagons and defended themselves gallantly and successfully for five days!, Your Missouri or Arkansas gentleman is not much afraid of the sort of scurvy apologies for ""Indians"" which the southern part of Utah affords., He would stand up and fight five hundred of them., At the end of the five days the Mormons tried military strategy., They retired to the upper end of the ""Meadows,"" resumed civilized apparel, washed off their paint, and then, heavily armed, drove down in wagons to the beleaguered emigrants, bearing a flag of truce!, When the emigrants saw white men coming they threw down their guns and welcomed them with cheer after cheer!, And, all unconscious of the poetry of it, no doubt, they lifted a little child aloft, dressed in white, in answer to the flag of truce!, The leaders of the timely white ""deliverers"" were President Haight and Bishop John D. Lee, of the Mormon Church., Mr. Cradlebaugh, who served a term as a Federal Judge in Utah and afterward was sent to Congress from Nevada, tells in a speech delivered in Congress how these leaders next proceeded:  ""They professed to be on good terms with the Indians, and represented them as being very mad., They also proposed to intercede and settle the matter with the Indians., After several hours parley they, having (apparently) visited the Indians, gave the ultimatum of the savages; which was, that the emigrants should march out of their camp, leaving everything behind them, even their guns., It was promised by the Mormon bishops that they would bring a force and guard the emigrants back to the settlements., The terms were agreed to, the emigrants being desirous of saving the lives of their families., The Mormons retired, and subsequently appeared with thirty or forty armed men., The emigrants were marched out, the women and children in front and the men behind, the Mormon guard being in the rear., When they had marched in this way about a mile, at a given signal the slaughter commenced., The men were almost all shot down at the first fire from the guard., Two only escaped, who fled to the desert, and were followed one hundred and fifty miles before they were overtaken and slaughtered., The women and children ran on, two or three hundred yards further, when they were overtaken and with the aid of the Indians they were slaughtered., Seventeen individuals only, of all the emigrant party, were spared, and they were little children, the eldest of them being only seven years old., Thus, on the 10th day of September, 1857, was consummated one of the most cruel, cowardly and bloody murders known in our history."", The number of persons butchered by the Mormons on this occasion was one hundred and twenty., With unheard-of temerity Judge Cradlebaugh opened his court and proceeded to make Mormondom answer for the massacre., And what a spectacle it must have been to see this grim veteran, solitary and alone in his pride and his pluck, glowering down on his Mormon jury and Mormon auditory, deriding them by turns, and by turns ""breathing threatenings and slaughter!"", An editorial in the Territorial Enterprise of that day says of him and of the occasion:  ""He spoke and acted with the fearlessness and resolution of a Jackson; but the jury failed to indict, or even report on the charges, while threats of violence were heard in every quarter, and an attack on the U.S. troops intimated, if he persisted in his course., ""Finding that nothing could be done with the juries, they were discharged with a scathing rebuke from the judge., And then, sitting as a committing magistrate, he commenced his task alone., He examined witnesses, made arrests in every quarter, and created a consternation in the camps of the saints greater than any they had ever witnessed before, since Mormondom was born., At last accounts terrified elders and bishops were decamping to save their necks; and developments of the most starling character were being made, implicating the highest Church dignitaries in the many murders and robberies committed upon the Gentiles during the past eight years."", Had Harney been Governor, Cradlebaugh would have been supported in his work, and the absolute proofs adduced by him of Mormon guilt in this massacre and in a number of previous murders, would have conferred gratuitous coffins upon certain citizens, together with occasion to use them., But Cumming was the Federal Governor, and he, under a curious pretense of impartiality, sought to screen the Mormons from the demands of justice., On one occasion he even went so far as to publish his protest against the use of the U.S. troops in aid of Cradlebaugh's proceedings., Mrs. C. V. Waite closes her interesting detail of the great massacre with the following remark and accompanying summary of the testimony--and the summary is concise, accurate and reliable:  ""For the benefit of those who may still be disposed to doubt the guilt of Young and his Mormons in this transaction, the testimony is here collated and circumstances given which go not merely to implicate but to fasten conviction upon them by 'confirmations strong as proofs of Holy Writ:'  ""1., The evidence of Mormons themselves, engaged in the affair, as shown by the statements of Judge Cradlebaugh and Deputy U.S.  Marshall Rodgers., ""2., The failure of Brigham Young to embody any account of it in his Report as Superintendent of Indian Affairs., Also his failure to make any allusion to it whatever from the pulpit, until several years after the occurrence  ""3., The flight to the mountains of men high in authority in the Mormon Church and State, when this affair was brought to the ordeal of a judicial investigation., ""4., The failure of the Deseret News, the Church organ, and the only paper then published in the Territory, to notice the massacre until several months afterward, and then only to deny that Mormons were engaged in it., ""5., ...]",1
12,"[But there's a bigger thing than that, yes bigger----""  ""Why Colonel, you can't want anything bigger!"", said Washington, his eyes blazing., ""Oh, I wish I could go into either of those speculations--I only wish I had money--I wish I wasn't cramped and kept down and fettered with poverty, and such prodigious chances lying right here in sight!, Oh, it is a fearful thing to be poor., But don't throw away those things --they are so splendid and I can see how sure they are., Don't throw them away for something still better and maybe fail in it!, I wouldn't, Colonel., I would stick to these., I wish father were here and were his old self again--Oh, he never in his life had such chances as these are., Colonel; you can't improve on these--no man can improve on them!"", A sweet, compassionate smile played about the Colonel's features, and he leaned over the table with the air of a man who is ""going to show you"" and do it without the least trouble:  ""Why Washington, my boy, these things are nothing., They look large of course--they look large to a novice, but to a man who has been all his life accustomed to large operations--shaw!, They're well enough to while away an idle hour with, or furnish a bit of employment that will give a trifle of idle capital a chance to earn its bread while it is waiting for something to do, but--now just listen a moment--just let me give you an idea of what we old veterans of commerce call 'business.', Here's the Rothschild's proposition--this is between you and me, you understand----""  Washington nodded three or four times impatiently, and his glowing eyes said, ""Yes, yes--hurry--I understand----""  ----""for I wouldn't have it get out for a fortune., They want me to go in with them on the sly--agent was here two weeks ago about it--go in on the sly"" [voice down to an impressive whisper, now,] ""and buy up a hundred and thirteen wild cat banks in Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky, Illinois and Missouri--notes of these banks are at all sorts of discount now--average discount of the hundred and thirteen is forty-four per cent--buy them all up, you see, and then all of a sudden let the cat out of the bag!, Whiz!, the stock of every one of those wildcats would spin up to a tremendous premium before you could turn a handspring--profit on the speculation not a dollar less than forty millions!"", [An eloquent pause, while the marvelous vision settled into W.'s focus.], ""Where's your hogs now?, Why my dear innocent boy, we would just sit down on the front door-steps and peddle banks like lucifer matches!"", Washington finally got his breath and said:  ""Oh, it is perfectly wonderful!, Why couldn't these things have happened in father's day?, And I--it's of no use--they simply lie before my face and mock me., There is nothing for me but to stand helpless and see other people reap the astonishing harvest."", ""Never mind, Washington, don't you worry., I'll fix you., There's plenty of chances., How much money have you got?"", In the presence of so many millions, Washington could not keep from blushing when he had to confess that he had but eighteen dollars in the world., ""Well, all right--don't despair., Other people have been obliged to begin with less., I have a small idea that may develop into something for us both, all in good time., Keep your money close and add to it., I'll make it breed., I've been experimenting (to pass away the time), on a little preparation for curing sore eyes--a kind of decoction nine-tenths water and the other tenth drugs that don't cost more than a dollar a barrel; I'm still experimenting; there's one ingredient wanted yet to perfect the thing, and somehow I can't just manage to hit upon the thing that's necessary, and I don't dare talk with a chemist, of course., But I'm progressing, and before many weeks I wager the country will ring with the fame of Beriah Sellers' Infallible Imperial Oriental Optic Liniment and Salvation for Sore Eyes--the Medical Wonder of the Age!, Small bottles fifty cents, large ones a dollar., Average cost, five and seven cents for the two sizes., ""The first year sell, say, ten thousand bottles in Missouri, seven thousand in Iowa, three thousand in Arkansas, four thousand in Kentucky, six thousand in Illinois, and say twenty-five thousand in the rest of the country., Total, fifty five thousand bottles; profit clear of all expenses, twenty thousand dollars at the very lowest calculation., All the capital needed is to manufacture the first two thousand bottles --say a hundred and fifty dollars--then the money would begin to flow in., The second year, sales would reach 200,000 bottles--clear profit, say, $75,000--and in the meantime the great factory would be building in St. Louis, to cost, say, $100,000., The third year we could, easily sell 1,000,000 bottles in the United States and----""  ""O, splendid!"", said Washington., ""Let's commence right away--let's----""  ""----1,000,000 bottles in the United States--profit at least $350,000 --and then it would begin to be time to turn our attention toward the real idea of the business."", ""The real idea of it!, Ain't $350,000 a year a pretty real----""  ""Stuff!, Why what an infant you are, Washington--what a guileless, short-sighted, easily-contented innocent you, are, my poor little country-bred know-nothing!, Would I go to all that trouble and bother for the poor crumbs a body might pick up in this country?, Now do I look like a man who----does my history suggest that I am a man who deals in trifles, contents himself with the narrow horizon that hems in the common herd, sees no further than the end of his nose?, Now you know that that is not me--couldn't be me., You ought to know that if I throw my time and abilities into a patent medicine, it's a patent medicine whose field of operations is the solid earth!, its clients the swarming nations that inhabit it!, Why what is the republic of America for an eye-water country?, Lord bless you, it is nothing but a barren highway that you've got to cross to get to the true eye-water market!, Why, Washington, in the Oriental countries people swarm like the sands of the desert; every square mile of ground upholds its thousands upon thousands of struggling human creatures--and every separate and individual devil of them's got the ophthalmia!, It's as natural to them as noses are--and sin., It's born with them, it stays with them, it's all that some of them have left when they die., Three years of introductory trade in the orient and what will be the result?, Why, our headquarters would be in Constantinople and our hindquarters in Further India!, Factories and warehouses in Cairo, Ispahan, Bagdad, Damascus, Jerusalem, Yedo, Peking, Bangkok, Delhi, Bombay--and Calcutta!, Annual income--well, God only knows how many millions and millions apiece!"", Washington was so dazed, so bewildered--his heart and his eyes had wandered so far away among the strange lands beyond the seas, and such avalanches of coin and currency had fluttered and jingled confusedly down before him, that he was now as one who has been whirling round and round for a time, and, stopping all at once, finds his surroundings still whirling and all objects a dancing chaos., However, little by little the Sellers family cooled down and crystalized into shape, and the poor room lost its glitter and resumed its poverty., Then the youth found his voice and begged Sellers to drop everything and hurry up the eye-water; and he got his eighteen dollars and tried to force it upon the Colonel--pleaded with him to take it--implored him to do it., But the Colonel would not; said he would not need the capital (in his native magnificent way he called that eighteen dollars Capital) till the eye-water was an accomplished fact., He made Washington easy in his mind, though, by promising that he would call for it just as soon as the invention was finished, and he added the glad tidings that nobody but just they two should be admitted to a share in the speculation., When Washington left the breakfast table he could have worshiped that man., Washington was one of that kind of people whose hopes are in the very, clouds one day and in the gutter the next., He walked on air, now., The Colonel was ready to take him around and introduce him to the employment he had found for him, but Washington begged for a few moments in which to write home; with his kind of people, to ride to-day's new interest to death and put off yesterday's till another time, is nature itself., He ran up stairs and wrote glowingly, enthusiastically, to his mother about the hogs and the corn, the banks and the eye-water--and added a few inconsequential millions to each project., And he said that people little dreamed what a man Col., Sellers was, and that the world would open its eyes when it found out., And he closed his letter thus:  ""So make yourself perfectly easy, mother-in a little while you shall have everything you want, and more., I am not likely to stint you in anything, I fancy., This money will not be for me, alone, but for all of us., I want all to share alike; and there is going to be far more for each than one person can spend., Break it to father cautiously--you understand the need of that--break it to him cautiously, for he has had such cruel hard fortune, and is so stricken by it that great good news might prostrate him more surely than even bad, for he is used to the bad but is grown sadly unaccustomed to the other., Tell Laura--tell all the children., And write to Clay about it if he is not with you yet., You may tell Clay that whatever I get he can freely share in-freely., He knows that that is true--there will be no need that I should swear to that to make him believe it., Good-bye--and mind what I say: Rest perfectly easy, one and all of you, for our troubles are nearly at an end."", Poor lad, he could not know that his mother would cry some loving, compassionate tears over his letter and put off the family with a synopsis of its contents which conveyed a deal of love to then but not much idea of his prospects or projects., And he never dreamed that such a joyful letter could sadden her and fill her night with sighs, and troubled thoughts, and bodings of the future, instead of filling it with peace and blessing it with restful sleep., When the letter was done, Washington and the Colonel sallied forth, and as they walked along Washington learned what he was to be., He was to be a clerk in a real estate office., Instantly the fickle youth's dreams forsook the magic eye-water and flew back to the Tennessee Land., And the gorgeous possibilities of that great domain straightway began to occupy his imagination to such a degree that he could scarcely manage to keep even enough of his attention upon the Colonel's talk to retain the general run of what he was saying., He was glad it was a real estate office--he was a made man now, sure., The Colonel said that General Boswell was a rich man and had a good and growing business; and that Washington's work world be light and he would get forty dollars a month and be boarded and lodged in the General's family--which was as good as ten dollars more; and even better, for he could not live as well even at the ""City Hotel"" as he would there, and yet the hotel charged fifteen dollars a month where a man had a good room., General Boswell was in his office; a comfortable looking place, with plenty of outline maps hanging about the walls and in the windows, and a spectacled man was marking out another one on a long table., The office was in the principal street., The General received Washington with a kindly but reserved politeness., Washington rather liked his looks., He was about fifty years old, dignified, well preserved and well dressed., After the Colonel took his leave, the General talked a while with Washington--his talk consisting chiefly of instructions about the clerical duties of the place., He seemed satisfied as to Washington's ability to take care of the books, he was evidently a pretty fair theoretical bookkeeper, and experience would soon harden theory into practice., By and by dinner-time came, and the two walked to the General's house; and now Washington noticed an instinct in himself that moved him to keep not in the General's rear, exactly, but yet not at his side--somehow the old gentleman's dignity and reserve did not inspire familiarity., ...]",1
13,"[Money or beauty will open any door., If I were a handsome woman, I shouldn't want any better place than the capital to pick up a prince or a fortune."", ""Thank you,"" replied Laura., ""But I prefer the quiet of home, and the love of those I know;"" and her face wore a look of sweet contentment and unworldliness that finished Mr. Harry Brierly for the day., Nevertheless, the hint that Harry had dropped fell upon good ground, and bore fruit an hundred fold; it worked in her mind until she had built up a plan on it, and almost a career for herself., Why not, she said, why shouldn't I do as other women have done?, She took the first opportunity to see Col., Sellers, and to sound him about the Washington visit., How was he getting on with his navigation scheme, would it be likely to take him from home to Jefferson City; or to Washington, perhaps?, ""Well, maybe., If the people of Napoleon want me to go to Washington, and look after that matter, I might tear myself from my home., It's been suggested to me, but--not a word of it to Mrs., Sellers and the children., Maybe they wouldn't like to think of their father in Washington., But Dilworthy, Senator Dilworthy, says to me, 'Colonel, you are the man, you could influence more votes than any one else on such a measure, an old settler, a man of the people, you know the wants of Missouri; you've a respect for religion too, says he, and know how the cause of the gospel goes with improvements: Which is true enough, Miss Laura, and hasn't been enough thought of in connection with Napoleon., He's an able man, Dilworthy, and a good man., A man has got to be good to succeed as he has., He's only been in Congress a few years, and he must be worth a million., First thing in the morning when he stayed with me he asked about family prayers, whether we had 'em before or after breakfast., I hated to disappoint the Senator, but I had to out with it, tell him we didn't have 'em, not steady., He said he understood, business interruptions and all that, some men were well enough without, but as for him he never neglected the ordinances of religion., He doubted if the Columbus River appropriation would succeed if we did not invoke the Divine Blessing on it."", Perhaps it is unnecessary to say to the reader that Senator Dilworthy had not stayed with Col., Sellers while he was in Hawkeye; this visit to his house being only one of the Colonel's hallucinations--one of those instant creations of his fertile fancy, which were always flashing into his brain and out of his mouth in the course of any conversation and without interrupting the flow of it., During the summer Philip rode across the country and made a short visit in Hawkeye, giving Harry an opportunity to show him the progress that he and the Colonel had made in their operation at Stone's Landing, to introduce him also to Laura, and to borrow a little money when he departed., Harry bragged about his conquest, as was his habit, and took Philip round to see his western prize., Laura received Mr. Philip with a courtesy and a slight hauteur that rather surprised and not a little interested him., He saw at once that she was older than Harry, and soon made up his mind that she was leading his friend a country dance to which he was unaccustomed., At least he thought he saw that, and half hinted as much to Harry, who flared up at once; but on a second visit Philip was not so sure, the young lady was certainly kind and friendly and almost confiding with Harry, and treated Philip with the greatest consideration., She deferred to his opinions, and listened attentively when he talked, and in time met his frank manner with an equal frankness, so that he was quite convinced that whatever she might feel towards Harry, she was sincere with him., Perhaps his manly way did win her liking., Perhaps in her mind, she compared him with Harry, and recognized in him a man to whom a woman might give her whole soul, recklessly and with little care if she lost it., Philip was not invincible to her beauty nor to the intellectual charm of her presence., The week seemed very short that he passed in Hawkeye, and when he bade Laura good by, he seemed to have known her a year., ""We shall see you again, Mr. Sterling,"" she said as she gave him her hand, with just a shade of sadness in her handsome eyes., And when he turned away she followed him with a look that might have disturbed his serenity, if he had not at the moment had a little square letter in his breast pocket, dated at Philadelphia, and signed ""Ruth."", The visit of Senator Abner Dilworthy was an event in Hawkeye., When a Senator, whose place is in Washington moving among the Great and guiding the destinies of the nation, condescends to mingle among the people and accept the hospitalities of such a place as Hawkeye, the honor is not considered a light one., All, parties are flattered by it and politics are forgotten in the presence of one so distinguished among his fellows., Senator Dilworthy, who was from a neighboring state, had been a Unionist in the darkest days of his country, and had thriven by it, but was that any reason why Col., Sellers, who had been a confederate and had not thriven by it, should give him the cold shoulder?, The Senator was the guest of his old friend Gen. Boswell, but it almost appeared that he was indebted to Col., Sellers for the unreserved hospitalities of the town., It was the large hearted Colonel who, in a manner, gave him the freedom of the city., ""You are known here, sir,"" said the Colonel, ""and Hawkeye is proud of you., You will find every door open, and a welcome at every hearthstone., I should insist upon your going to my house, if you were not claimed by your older friend Gen. Boswell., But you will mingle with our people, and you will see here developments that will surprise you."", The Colonel was so profuse in his hospitality that he must have made the impression upon himself that he had entertained the Senator at his own mansion during his stay; at any rate, he afterwards always spoke of him as his guest, and not seldom referred to the Senator's relish of certain viands on his table., He did, in fact, press him to dine upon the morning of the day the Senator was going away., Senator Dilworthy was large and portly, though not tall--a pleasant spoken man, a popular man with the people., He took a lively interest in the town and all the surrounding country, and made many inquiries as to the progress of agriculture, of education, and of religion, and especially as to the condition of the emancipated race., ""Providence,"" he said, ""has placed them in our hands, and although you and I, General, might have chosen a different destiny for them, under the Constitution, yet Providence knows best."", ""You can't do much with 'em,"" interrupted Col., Sellers., ""They are a speculating race, sir, disinclined to work for white folks without security, planning how to live by only working for themselves., Idle, sir, there's my garden just a ruin of weeds., Nothing practical in 'em."", ""There is some truth in your observation, Colonel, but you must educate them."", ""You educate the niggro and you make him more speculating than he was before., If he won't stick to any industry except for himself now, what will he do then?"", ""But, Colonel, the negro when educated will be more able to make his speculations fruitful."", ""Never, sir, never., He would only have a wider scope to injure himself., A niggro has no grasp, sir., Now, a white man can conceive great operations, and carry them out; a niggro can't."", ""Still,"" replied the Senator, ""granting that he might injure himself in a worldly point of view, his elevation through education would multiply his chances for the hereafter--which is the important thing after all, Colonel., And no matter what the result is, we must fulfill our duty by this being."", ""I'd elevate his soul,"" promptly responded the Colonel; ""that's just it; you can't make his soul too immortal, but I wouldn't touch him, himself., Yes, sir!, make his soul immortal, but don't disturb the niggro as he is."", Of course one of the entertainments offered the Senator was a public reception, held in the court house, at which he made a speech to his fellow citizens., Col., Sellers was master of ceremonies., He escorted the band from the city hotel to Gen. Boswell's; he marshalled the procession of Masons, of Odd Fellows, and of Firemen, the Good Templars, the Sons of Temperance, the Cadets of Temperance, the Daughters of Rebecca, the Sunday School children, and citizens generally, which followed the Senator to the court house; he bustled about the room long after every one else was seated, and loudly cried ""Order!"", in the dead silence which preceded the introduction of the Senator by Gen. Boswell., The occasion was one to call out his finest powers of personal appearance, and one he long dwelt on with pleasure., This not being an edition of the Congressional Globe it is impossible to give Senator Dilworthy's speech in full., He began somewhat as follows:  ""Fellow citizens: It gives me great pleasure to thus meet and mingle with you, to lay aside for a moment the heavy duties of an official and burdensome station, and confer in familiar converse with my friends in your great state., The good opinion of my fellow citizens of all sections is the sweetest solace in all my anxieties., I look forward with longing to the time when I can lay aside the cares of office--"" [""dam sight,"" shouted a tipsy fellow near the door., Cries of ""put him out.""], ""My friends, do not remove him., Let the misguided man stay., I see that he is a victim of that evil which is swallowing up public virtue and sapping the foundation of society., As I was saying, when I can lay down the cares of office and retire to the sweets of private life in some such sweet, peaceful, intelligent, wide-awake and patriotic place as Hawkeye (applause)., I have traveled much, I have seen all parts of our glorious union, but I have never seen a lovelier village than yours, or one that has more signs of commercial and industrial and religious prosperity --(more applause)."", The Senator then launched into a sketch of our great country, and dwelt for an hour or more upon its prosperity and the dangers which threatened it., He then touched reverently upon the institutions of religion, and upon the necessity of private purity, if we were to have any public morality., ""I trust,"" he said, ""that there are children within the sound of my voice,"" and after some remarks to them, the Senator closed with an apostrophe to ""the genius of American Liberty, walking with the Sunday School in one hand and Temperance in the other up the glorified steps of the National Capitol."", Col., Sellers did not of course lose the opportunity to impress upon so influential a person as the Senator the desirability of improving the navigation of Columbus river., He and Mr. Brierly took the Senator over to Napoleon and opened to him their plan., It was a plan that the Senator could understand without a great deal of explanation, for he seemed to be familiar with the like improvements elsewhere., When, however, they reached Stone's Landing the Senator looked about him and inquired,  ""Is this Napoleon?"", ""This is the nucleus, the nucleus,"" said the Colonel, unrolling his map., ""Here is the deepo, the church, the City Hall and so on."", ""Ah, I see., How far from here is Columbus River?, Does that stream empty----""  ""That, why, that's Goose Run., ...]",1
14,"[A second's thought would have convinced every one that getting out was impossible, and that the only effect of a rush would be to crash people to death., But a second's thought was not given., A few cried:  ""Sit down, sit down,"" but the mass was turned towards the door., Women were down and trampled on in the aisles, and stout men, utterly lost to self-control, were mounting the benches, as if to run a race over the mass to the entrance., Philip who had forced the girls to keep their seats saw, in a flash, the new danger, and sprang to avert it., In a second more those infuriated men would be over the benches and crushing Ruth and Alice under their boots., He leaped upon the bench in front of them and struck out before him with all his might, felling one man who was rushing on him, and checking for an instant the movement, or rather parting it, and causing it to flow on either side of him., But it was only for an instant; the pressure behind was too great, and, the next Philip was  dashed backwards over the seat., And yet that instant of arrest had probably saved the girls, for as Philip fell, the orchestra struck up ""Yankee Doodle"" in the liveliest manner., The familiar tune caught the ear of the mass, which paused in wonder, and gave the conductor's voice a chance to be heard--""It's a false alarm!"", The tumult was over in a minute, and the next, laughter was heard, and not a few said, ""I knew it wasn't anything."", ""What fools people are at such a time."", The concert was over, however., A good many people were hurt, some of them seriously, and among them Philip Sterling was found bent across the seat, insensible, with his left arm hanging limp and a bleeding wound on his head., When he was carried into the air he revived, and said it was nothing., A surgeon was called, and it was thought best to drive at once to the Bolton's, the surgeon supporting Philip, who did not speak the whole way., His arm was set and his head dressed, and the surgeon said he would come round all right in his mind by morning; he was very weak., Alice who was not much frightened while the panic lasted in the hall, was very much unnerved by seeing Philip so pale and bloody., Ruth assisted the surgeon with the utmost coolness and with skillful hands helped to dress Philip's wounds., And there was a certain intentness and fierce energy in what she did that might have revealed something to Philip if he had been in his senses., But he was not, or he would not have murmured ""Let Alice do it, she is not too tall."", It was Ruth's first case., Washington's delight in his beautiful sister was measureless., He said that she had always been the queenliest creature in the land, but that she was only commonplace before, compared to what she was now, so extraordinary was the improvement wrought by rich fashionable attire., ""But your criticisms are too full of brotherly partiality to be depended on, Washington., Other people will judge differently."", ""Indeed they won't., You'll see., There will never be a woman in Washington that can compare with you., You'll be famous within a fortnight, Laura., Everybody will want to know you., You wait--you'll see."", Laura wished in her heart that the prophecy might come true; and privately she even believed it might--for she had brought all the women whom she had seen since she left home under sharp inspection, and the result had not been unsatisfactory to her., During a week or two Washington drove about the city every day with her and familiarized her with all of its salient features., She was beginning to feel very much at home with the town itself, and she was also fast acquiring ease with the distinguished people she met at the Dilworthy table, and losing what little of country timidity she had brought with her from Hawkeye., She noticed with secret pleasure the little start of admiration that always manifested itself in the faces of the guests when she entered the drawing-room arrayed in evening costume: she took comforting note of the fact that these guests directed a very liberal share of their conversation toward her; she observed with surprise, that famous statesmen and soldiers did not talk like gods, as a general thing, but said rather commonplace things for the most part; and she was filled with gratification to discover that she, on the contrary, was making a good many shrewd speeches and now and then a really brilliant one, and furthermore, that they were beginning to be repeated in social circles about the town., Congress began its sittings, and every day or two Washington escorted her to the galleries set apart for lady members of the households of Senators and Representatives., Here was a larger field and a wider competition, but still she saw that many eyes were uplifted toward her face, and that first one person and then another called a neighbor's attention to her; she was not too dull to perceive that the speeches of some of the younger statesmen were delivered about as much and perhaps more at her than to the presiding officer; and she was not sorry to see that the dapper young Senator from Iowa came at once and stood in the open space before the president's desk to exhibit his feet as soon as she entered the gallery, whereas she had early learned from common report that his usual custom was to prop them on his desk and enjoy them himself with a selfish disregard of other people's longings., Invitations began to flow in upon her and soon she was fairly ""in society."", ""The season"" was now in full bloom, and the first select reception was at hand that is to say, a reception confined to invited guests., Senator Dilworthy had become well convinced; by this time, that his judgment of the country-bred Missouri girl had not deceived him--it was plain that she was going to be a peerless missionary in the field of labor he designed her for, and therefore it would be perfectly safe and likewise judicious to send her forth well panoplied for her work.--So he had added new and still richer costumes to her wardrobe, and assisted their attractions with costly jewelry-loans on the future land sale., This first select reception took place at a cabinet minister's--or rather a cabinet secretary's mansion., When Laura and the Senator arrived, about half past nine or ten in the evening, the place was already pretty well crowded, and the white-gloved negro servant at the door was still receiving streams of guests.--The drawing-rooms were brilliant with gaslight, and as hot as ovens., The host and hostess stood just within the door of entrance; Laura was presented, and then she passed on into the maelstrom of be-jeweled and richly attired low-necked ladies and white-kid-gloved and steel pen-coated gentlemen and wherever she moved she was followed by a buzz of admiration that was grateful to all her senses--so grateful, indeed, that her white face was tinged and its beauty heightened by a perceptible suffusion of color., She caught such remarks as, ""Who is she?"", ""Superb woman!"", ""That is the new beauty from the west,"" etc., etc., Whenever she halted, she was presently surrounded by Ministers, Generals, Congressmen, and all manner of aristocratic, people., Introductions followed, and then the usual original question, ""How do you like Washington, Miss Hawkins?"", supplemented by that other usual original question, ""Is this your first visit?"", These two exciting topics being exhausted, conversation generally drifted into calmer channels, only to be interrupted at frequent intervals by new introductions and new inquiries as to how Laura liked the capital and whether it was her first visit or not., And thus for an hour or more the Duchess moved through the crush in a rapture of happiness, for her doubts were dead and gone, now she knew she could conquer here., A familiar face appeared in the midst of the multitude and Harry Brierly fought his difficult way to her side, his eyes shouting their gratification, so to speak:  ""Oh, this is a happiness!, Tell me, my dear Miss Hawkins--""  ""Sh!, I know what you are going to ask., I do like Washington--I like it ever so much!"", ""No, but I was going to ask--""  ""Yes, I am coming to it, coming to it as fast as I can., It is my first visit., I think you should know that yourself."", And straightway a wave of the crowd swept her beyond his reach., ""Now what can the girl mean?, Of course she likes Washington--I'm not such a dummy as to have to ask her that., And as to its being her first visit, why bang it, she knows that I knew it was., Does she think I have turned idiot?, Curious girl, anyway., But how they do swarm about her!, She is the reigning belle of Washington after this night., She'll know five hundred of the heaviest guns in the town before this night's nonsense is over., And this isn't even the beginning., Just as I used to say--she'll be a card in the matter of--yes sir!, She shall turn the men's heads and I'll turn the women's!, What a team that will be in politics here., I wouldn't take a quarter of a million for what I can do in this present session--no indeed I wouldn't., Now, here--I don't altogether like this., That insignificant secretary of legation is--why, she's smiling on him as if he--and now on the Admiral!, Now she's illuminating that, stuffy Congressman from Massachusetts--vulgar ungrammatcal shovel-maker--greasy knave of spades., I don't like this sort of thing., She doesn't appear to be much distressed about me--she hasn't looked this way once., All right, my bird of Paradise, if it suits you, go on., But I think I know your sex., I'll go to smiling around a little, too, and see what effect that will have on you""  And he did ""smile around a little,"" and got as near to her as he could to watch the effect, but the scheme was a failure--he could not get her attention., She seemed wholly unconscious of him, and so he could not flirt with any spirit; he could only talk disjointedly; he could not keep his eyes on the charmers he talked to; he grew irritable, jealous, and very, unhappy., He gave up his enterprise, leaned his shoulder against a fluted pilaster and pouted while he kept watch upon Laura's every movement., His other shoulder stole the bloom from many a lovely cheek that brushed him in the surging crush, but he noted it not., He was too busy cursing himself inwardly for being an egotistical imbecile., An hour ago he had thought to take this country lass under his protection and show her ""life"" and enjoy her wonder and delight--and here she was, immersed in the marvel up to her eyes, and just a trifle more at home in it than he was himself., And now his angry comments ran on again:  ""Now she's sweetening old Brother Balaam; and he--well he is inviting her to the Congressional prayer-meeting, no doubt--better let old Dilworthy alone to see that she doesn't overlook that., And now its Splurge, of New York; and now its Batters of New Hampshire--and now the Vice President!, Well I may as well adjourn., I've got enough."", But he hadn't., He got as far as the door--and then struggled back to take one more look, hating himself all the while for his weakness., Toward midnight, when supper was announced, the crowd thronged to the supper room where a long table was decked out with what seemed a rare repast, but which consisted of things better calculated to feast the eye than the appetite., The ladies were soon seated in files along the wall, and in groups here and there, and the colored waiters filled the plates and glasses and the, male guests moved hither and thither conveying them to the privileged sex., Harry took an ice and stood up by the table with other gentlemen, and listened to the buzz of conversation while he ate., From these remarks he learned a good deal about Laura that was news to him., For instance, that she was of a distinguished western family; that she was highly educated; that she was very rich and a great landed heiress; that she was not a professor of religion, and yet was a Christian in the truest and best sense of the word, for her whole heart was devoted to the accomplishment of a great and noble enterprise--none other than the sacrificing of her landed estates to the uplifting of the down-trodden negro and the turning of his erring feet into the way of light and righteousness., Harry observed that as soon as one listener had absorbed the story, he turned about and delivered it to his next neighbor and the latter individual straightway passed it on., And thus he saw it travel the round of the gentlemen and overflow rearward among the ladies., He could not trace it backward to its fountain head, and so he could not tell who it was that started it., ...]",1
15,"[That's my notion., Boutwell's got the right notion about the value of paper, but he lacks courage., I should like to run the treasury department about six months., I'd make things plenty, and business look up.'"", The Colonel had access to the departments., He knew all the senators and representatives, and especially, the lobby., He was consequently a great favorite in Newspaper Row, and was often lounging in the offices there, dropping bits of private, official information, which were immediately, caught up and telegraphed all over the country., But it need to surprise even the Colonel when he read it, it was embellished to that degree that he hardly recognized it, and the hint was not lost on him., He began to exaggerate his heretofore simple conversation to suit the newspaper demand., People used to wonder in the winters of 187- and 187-, where the ""Specials"" got that remarkable information with which they every morning surprised the country, revealing the most secret intentions of the President and his cabinet, the private thoughts of political leaders, the hidden meaning of every movement., This information was furnished by Col., Sellers., When he was asked, afterwards, about the stolen copy of the Alabama Treaty which got into the ""New York Tribune,"" he only looked mysterious, and said that neither he nor Senator Dilworthy knew anything about it., But those whom he was in the habit of meeting occasionally felt almost certain that he did know., It must not be supposed that the Colonel in his general patriotic labors neglected his own affairs., The Columbus River Navigation Scheme absorbed only a part of his time, so he was enabled to throw quite a strong reserve force of energy into the Tennessee Land plan, a vast enterprise commensurate with his abilities, and in the prosecution of which he was greatly aided by Mr. Henry Brierly, who was buzzing about the capitol and the hotels day and night, and making capital for it in some mysterious way., ""We must create, a public opinion,"" said Senator Dilworthy., ""My only interest in it is a public one, and if the country wants the institution, Congress will have to yield."", It may have been after a conversation between the Colonel and Senator Dilworthy that the following special despatch was sent to a New York newspaper:       ""We understand that a philanthropic plan is on foot in relation to      the colored race that will, if successful, revolutionize the whole      character of southern industry., An experimental institution is in      contemplation in Tennessee which will do for that state what the      Industrial School at Zurich did for Switzerland., We learn that      approaches have been made to the heirs of the late Hon., Silas      Hawkins of Missouri, in reference to a lease of a portion of their      valuable property in East Tennessee., Senator Dilworthy, it is      understood, is inflexibly opposed to any arrangement that will not      give the government absolute control., Private interests must give      way to the public good., It is to be hoped that Col., Sellers, who      represents the heirs, will be led to see the matter in this light."", When Washington Hawkins read this despatch, he went to the Colonel in some anxiety., He was for a lease, he didn't want to surrender anything., What did he think the government would offer?, Two millions?, ""May be three, may be four,"" said the Colonel, ""it's worth more than the bank of England."", ""If they will not lease,"" said Washington, ""let 'em make it two millions for an undivided half., I'm not going to throw it away, not the whole of it."", Harry told the Colonel that they must drive the thing through, he couldn't be dallying round Washington when Spring opened., Phil wanted him, Phil had a great thing on hand up in Pennsylvania., ""What is that?"", inquired the Colonel, always ready to interest himself in anything large., ""A mountain of coal; that's all., He's going to run a tunnel into it in the Spring."", ""Does he want any capital?, "", asked the Colonel, in the tone of a man who is given to calculating carefully before he makes an investment., ""No., Old man Bolton's behind him., He has capital, but I judged that he wanted my experience in starting."", ""If he wants me, tell him I'll come, after Congress adjourns., I should like to give him a little lift., He lacks enterprise--now, about that Columbus River., He doesn't see his chances., But he's a good fellow, and you can tell him that Sellers won't go back on him."", ""By the way,"" asked Harry, ""who is that rather handsome party that's hanging 'round Laura?, I see him with her everywhere, at the Capitol, in the horse cars, and he comes to Dilworthy's., If he weren't lame, I should think he was going to run off with her."", ""Oh, that's nothing., Laura knows her business., He has a cotton claim., Used to be at Hawkeye during the war., ""Selby's his name, was a Colonel., Got a wife and family., Very respectable people, the Selby's."", ""Well, that's all right,"" said Harry, ""if it's business., But if a woman looked at me as I've seen her at Selby, I should understand it., And it's talked about, I can tell you."", Jealousy had no doubt sharpened this young gentleman's observation., Laura could not have treated him with more lofty condescension if she had been the Queen of Sheba, on a royal visit to the great republic., And he resented it, and was ""huffy"" when he was with her, and ran her errands, and brought her gossip, and bragged of his intimacy with the lovely creature among the fellows at Newspaper Row., Laura's life was rushing on now in the full stream of intrigue and fashionable dissipation., She was conspicuous at the balls of the fastest set, and was suspected of being present at those doubtful suppers that began late and ended early., If Senator Dilworthy remonstrated about appearances, she had a way of silencing him., Perhaps she had some hold on him, perhaps she was necessary to his plan for ameliorating the condition the tube colored race., She saw Col. Selby, when the public knew and when it did not know., She would see him, whatever excuses he made, and however he avoided her., She was urged on by a fever of love and hatred and jealousy, which alternately possessed her., Sometimes she petted him, and coaxed him and tried all her fascinations., And again she threatened him and reproached him., What was he doing?, Why had he taken no steps to free himself?, Why didn't he send his wife home?, She should have money soon., They could go to Europe--anywhere., What did she care for talk?, And he promised, and lied, and invented fresh excuses for delay, like a cowardly gambler and roue as he was, fearing to break with her, and half the time unwilling to give her up., ""That woman doesn't know what fear is,"" he said to himself, ""and she watches me like a hawk."", He told his wife that this woman was a lobbyist, whom he had to tolerate and use in getting through his claims, and that he should pay her and have done with her, when he succeeded., Henry Brierly was at the Dilworthy's constantly and on such terms of intimacy that he came and went without question., The Senator was not an inhospitable man, he liked to have guests in his house, and Harry's gay humor and rattling way entertained him; for even the most devout men and busy statesmen must have hours of relaxation., Harry himself believed that he was of great service in the University business, and that the success of the scheme depended upon him to a great degree., He spent many hours in talking it over with the Senator after dinner., He went so far as to consider whether it would be worth his while to take the professorship of civil engineering in the new institution., But it was not the Senator's society nor his dinners--at which this scapegrace remarked that there was too much grace and too little wine --which attracted him to the horse., The fact was the poor fellow hung around there day after day for the chance of seeing Laura for five minutes at a time., For her presence at dinner he would endure the long bore of the Senator's talk afterwards, while Laura was off at some assembly, or excused herself on the plea of fatigue., Now and then he accompanied her to some reception, and rarely, on off nights, he was blessed with her company in the parlor, when he sang, and was chatty and vivacious and performed a hundred little tricks of imitation and ventriloquism, and made himself as entertaining as a man could be., It puzzled him not a little that all his fascinations seemed to go for so little with Laura; it was beyond his experience with women., Sometimes Laura was exceedingly kind and petted him a little, and took the trouble to exert her powers of pleasing, and to entangle him deeper and deeper., But this, it angered him afterwards to think, was in private; in public she was beyond his reach, and never gave occasion to the suspicion that she had any affair with him., He was never permitted to achieve the dignity of a serious flirtation with her in public., ""Why do you treat me so?"", he once said, reproachfully., ""Treat you how?"", asked Laura in a sweet voice, lifting her eyebrows., ...]",1
16,"[If Mr. Bolton had been on his way to market to buy a dinner for his family with the only dollar he had in the world in his pocket, he would have given it to a chance beggar who asked him for it., Mrs. Bolton only asked (and the question showed that she was no mere provident than her husband where her heart was interested),  ""But has thee provided money for Philip to use in opening the coal mine?"", ""Yes, I have set apart as much as it ought to cost to open the mine, as much as we can afford to lose if no coal is found., Philip has the control of it, as equal partner in the venture, deducting the capital invested., He has great confidence in his success, and I hope for his sake he won't be disappointed."", Philip could not but feel that he was treated very much like one of the Bolton-family--by all except Ruth., His mother, when he went home after his recovery from his accident, had affected to be very jealous of Mrs. Bolton, about whom and Ruth she asked a thousand questions --an affectation of jealousy which no doubt concealed a real heartache, which comes to every mother when her son goes out into the world and forms new ties., And to Mrs. Sterling; a widow, living on a small income in a remote Massachusetts village, Philadelphia was a city of many splendors., All its inhabitants seemed highly favored, dwelling in ease and surrounded by superior advantages., Some of her neighbors had relations living in Philadelphia, and it seemed to them somehow a guarantee of respectability to have relations in Philadelphia., Mrs. Sterling was not sorry to have Philip make his way among such well-to-do people, and she was sure that no good fortune could be too good for his deserts., ""So, sir,"" said Ruth, when Philip came from New York, ""you have been assisting in a pretty tragedy., I saw your name in the papers., Is this woman a specimen of your western friends?"", ""My only assistance,"" replied Philip, a little annoyed, was in trying to keep Harry out of a bad scrape, and I failed after all., He walked into her trap, and he has been punished for it., I'm going to take him up to Ilium to see if he won't work steadily at one thing, and quit his nonsense."", ""Is she as beautiful as the newspapers say she is?"", ""I don't know, she has a kind of beauty--she is not like--'  ""Not like Alice?"", ""Well, she is brilliant; she was called the handsomest woman in Washington--dashing, you know, and sarcastic and witty., Ruth, do you believe a woman ever becomes a devil?"", ""Men do, and I don't know why women shouldn't., But I never saw one."", ""Well, Laura Hawkins comes very near it., But it is dreadful to think of her fate."", ""Why, do you suppose they will hang a woman?, Do you suppose they will be so barbarous as that?"", ""I wasn't thinking of that--it's doubtful if a New York jury would find a woman guilty of any such crime., But to think of her life if she is acquitted."", ""It is dreadful,"" said Ruth, thoughtfully, ""but the worst of it is that you men do not want women educated to do anything, to be able to earn an honest living by their own exertions., They are educated as if they were always to be petted and supported, and there was never to be any such thing as misfortune., I suppose, now, that you would all choose to have me stay idly at home, and give up my profession."", ""Oh, no,"" said Philip, earnestly, ""I  respect your resolution., But, Ruth, do you think you would be happier or do more good in following your profession than in having a home of your own?"", ""What is to hinder having a home of my, own?"", ""Nothing, perhaps, only you never would be in it--you would be away day and night, if you had any practice; and what sort of a home would that make for your husband?"", ""What sort of a home is it for the wife whose husband is always away riding about in his doctor's gig?"", ""Ah, you know that is not fair., The woman makes the home."", Philip and Ruth often had this sort of discussion, to which Philip was always trying to give a personal turn., He was now about to go to Ilium for the season, and he did not like to go without some assurance from Ruth that she might perhaps love him some day; when he was worthy of it, and when he could offer her something better than a partnership in his poverty., ""I should work with a great deal better heart, Ruth,"" he said the morning he was taking leave, ""if I knew you cared for me a little."", Ruth was looking down; the color came faintly to her cheeks, and she hesitated., She needn't be looking down, he thought, for she was ever so much shorter than tall Philip., ""It's not much of a place, Ilium,"" Philip went on, as if a little geographical remark would fit in here as well as anything else, ""and I shall have plenty of time to think over the responsibility I have taken, and--"" his observation did not seem to be coming out any where., But Ruth looked up, and there was a light in her eyes that quickened Phil's pulse., She took his hand, and said with serious sweetness:  ""Thee mustn't lose heart, Philip."", And then she added, in another mood, ""Thee knows I graduate in the summer and shall have my diploma., And if any thing happens--mines explode sometimes--thee can send for me., Farewell."", The opening of the Ilium coal mine was begun with energy, but without many omens of success., Philip was running a tunnel into the breast of the mountain, in faith that the coal stratum ran there as it ought to., How far he must go in he believed he knew, but no one could tell exactly., Some of the miners said that they should probably go through the mountain, and that the hole could be used for a railway tunnel., The mining camp was a busy place at any rate., Quite a settlement of board and log shanties had gone up, with a blacksmith shop, a small machine shop, and a temporary store for supplying the wants of the workmen., Philip and Harry pitched a commodious tent, and lived in the full enjoyment of the free life., There is no difficulty in digging a bole in the ground, if you have money enough to pay for the digging, but those who try this sort of work are always surprised at the large amount of money necessary to make a small hole., The earth is never willing to yield one product, hidden in her bosom, without an equivalent for it., And when a person asks of her coal, she is quite apt to require gold in exchange., It was exciting work for all concerned in it., As the tunnel advanced into the rock every day promised to be the golden day., This very blast might disclose the treasure., The work went on week after week, and at length during the night as well as the daytime., Gangs relieved each other, and the tunnel was every hour, inch by inch and foot by foot, crawling into the mountain., Philip was on the stretch of hope and excitement., Every pay day he saw his funds melting away, and still there was only the faintest show of what the miners call ""signs."", The life suited Harry, whose buoyant hopefulness was never disturbed., He made endless calculations, which nobody could understand, of the probable position of the vein., He stood about among the workmen with the busiest air., When he was down at Ilium he called himself the engineer of the works, and he used to spend hours smoking his pipe with the Dutch landlord on the hotel porch, and astonishing the idlers there with the stories of his railroad operations in Missouri., He talked with the landlord, too, about enlarging his hotel, and about buying some village lots, in the prospect of a rise, when the mine was opened., He taught the Dutchman how to mix a great many cooling drinks for the summer time, and had a bill at the hotel, the growing length of which Mr. Dusenheimer contemplated with pleasant anticipations., Mr. Brierly was a very useful and cheering person wherever he went., Midsummer arrived: Philip could report to Mr. Bolton only progress, and this was not a cheerful message for him to send to Philadelphia in reply to inquiries that he thought became more and more anxious., Philip himself was a prey to the constant fear that the money would give out before the coal was struck., At this time Harry was summoned to New York, to attend the trial of Laura Hawkins., It was possible that Philip would have to go also, her lawyer wrote, but they hoped for a postponement., There was important evidence that they could not yet obtain, and he hoped the judge would not force them to a trial unprepared., There were many reasons for a delay, reasons which of course are never mentioned, but which it would seem that a New York judge sometimes must understand, when he grants a postponement upon a motion that seems to the public altogether inadequate., Harry went, but he soon came back., The trial was put off., Every week we can gain, said the learned counsel, Braham, improves our chances., The popular rage never lasts long., ""We've struck it!"", This was the announcement at the tent door that woke Philip out of a sound sleep at dead of night, and shook all the sleepiness out of him in a trice., ""What!, Where is it?, When?, Coal?, Let me see it., What quality is it?"", were some of the rapid questions that Philip poured out as he hurriedly dressed., ""Harry, wake up, my boy, the coal train is coming., Struck it, eh?, Let's see?"", The foreman put down his lantern, and handed Philip a black lump., There was no mistake about it, it was the hard, shining anthracite, and its freshly fractured surface, glistened in the light like polished steel., Diamond never shone with such lustre in the eyes of Philip., Harry was exuberant, but Philip's natural caution found expression in his next remark., ...]",1
17,"[The servant maid knocked at the door and passed in a telegram, saying it had come while they were gone., The Colonel tore it open and read with the voice of a man-of-war's broadside:  ""VERDICT OF JURY, NOT GUILTY AND LAURA IS FREE!"", The court room was packed on the morning on which the verdict of the jury was expected, as it had been every day of the trial, and by the same spectators, who had followed its progress with such intense interest., There is a delicious moment of excitement which the frequenter of trials well knows, and which he would not miss for the world., It is that instant when the foreman of the jury stands up to give the verdict, and before he has opened his fateful lips., The court assembled and waited., It was an obstinate jury., It even had another question--this intelligent jury--to ask the judge this morning., The question was this: ""Were the doctors clear that the deceased had no disease which might soon have carried him off, if he had not been shot?"", There was evidently one jury man who didn't want to waste life, and was willing to stake a general average, as the jury always does in a civil case, deciding not according to the evidence but reaching the verdict by some occult mental process., During the delay the spectators exhibited unexampled patience, finding amusement and relief in the slightest movements of the court, the prisoner and the lawyers., Mr. Braham divided with Laura the attention of the house., Bets were made by the Sheriff's deputies on the verdict, with large odds in favor of a disagreement., It was afternoon when it was announced that the jury was coming in., The reporters took their places and were all attention; the judge and lawyers were in their seats; the crowd swayed and pushed in eager expectancy, as the jury walked in and stood up in silence., Judge., ""Gentlemen, have you agreed upon your verdict?"", Foreman., ""We have."", Judge., ""What is it?"", Foreman., ""NOT GUILTY."", A shout went up from the entire room and a tumult of cheering which the court in vain attempted to quell., For a few moments all order was lost., The spectators crowded within the bar and surrounded Laura who, calmer than anyone else, was supporting her aged mother, who had almost fainted from excess of joy., And now occurred one of those beautiful incidents which no fiction-writer would dare to imagine, a scene of touching pathos, creditable to our fallen humanity., In the eyes of the women of the audience Mr. Braham was the hero of the occasion; he had saved the life of the prisoner; and besides he was such a handsome man., The women could not restrain their long pent-up emotions., They threw themselves upon Mr. Braham in a transport of gratitude; they kissed him again and again, the young as well as the advanced in years, the married as well as the ardent single women; they improved the opportunity with a touching self-sacrifice; in the words of a newspaper of the day they ""lavished him with kisses."", It was something sweet to do; and it would be sweet for a woman to remember in after years, that she had kissed Braham!, Mr. Braham himself received these fond assaults with the gallantry of his nation, enduring the ugly, and heartily paying back beauty in its own coin., This beautiful scene is still known in New York as ""the kissing of Braham."", When the tumult of congratulation had a little spent itself, and order was restored, Judge O'Shaunnessy said that it now became his duty to provide for the proper custody and treatment of the acquitted., The verdict of the jury having left no doubt that the woman was of an unsound mind, with a kind of insanity dangerous to the safety of the community, she could not be permitted to go at large., ""In accordance with the directions of the law in such cases,"" said the Judge, ""and in obedience to the dictates of a wise humanity, I hereby commit Laura Hawkins to the care of the Superintendent of the State Hospital for Insane Criminals, to be held in confinement until the State Commissioners on Insanity shall order her discharge., Mr. Sheriff, you will attend at once to the execution of this decree."", Laura was overwhelmed and terror-stricken., She had expected to walk forth in freedom in a few moments., The revulsion was terrible., Her mother appeared like one shaken with an ague fit., Laura insane!, And about to be locked up with madmen!, She had never contemplated this., Mr. Graham said he should move at once for a writ of 'habeas corpus'., But the judge could not do less than his duty, the law must have its way., As in the stupor of a sudden calamity, and not fully comprehending it, Mrs. Hawkins saw Laura led away by the officer., With little space for thought she was, rapidly driven to the railway station, and conveyed to the Hospital for Lunatic Criminals., It was only when she was within this vast and grim abode of madness that she realized the horror of her situation., It was only when she was received by the kind physician and read pity in his eyes, and saw his look of hopeless incredulity when she attempted to tell him that she was not insane; it was only when she passed through the ward to which she was consigned and saw the horrible creatures, the victims of a double calamity, whose dreadful faces she was hereafter to see daily, and was locked into the small, bare room that was to be her home, that all her fortitude forsook her., She sank upon the bed, as soon as she was left alone--she had been searched by the matron--and tried to think., But her brain was in a whirl., She recalled Braham's speech, she recalled the testimony regarding her lunacy., She wondered if she were not mad; she felt that she soon should be among these loathsome creatures., Better almost to have died, than to slowly go mad in this confinement., --We beg the reader's pardon., This is not history, which has just been written., It is really what would have occurred if this were a novel., If this were a work of fiction, we should not dare to dispose of Laura otherwise., True art and any attention to dramatic proprieties required it., The novelist who would turn loose upon society an insane murderess could not escape condemnation., Besides, the safety of society, the decencies of criminal procedure, what we call our modern civilization, all would demand that Laura should be disposed of in the manner we have described., Foreigners, who read this sad story, will be unable to understand any other termination of it., But this is history and not fiction., There is no such law or custom as that to which his Honor is supposed to have referred; Judge O'Shaunnessy would not probably pay any attention to it if there were., There is no Hospital for Insane Criminals; there is no State commission of lunacy., What actually occurred when the tumult in the court room had subsided the sagacious reader will now learn., Laura left the court room, accompanied by her mother and other friends, amid the congratulations of those assembled, and was cheered as she entered a carriage, and drove away., How sweet was the sunlight, how exhilarating the sense of freedom!, Were not these following cheers the expression of popular approval and affection?, Was she not the heroine of the hour?, It was with a feeling of triumph that Laura reached her hotel, a scornful feeling of victory over society with its own weapons., Mrs. Hawkins shared not at all in this feeling; she was broken with the disgrace and the long anxiety., ""Thank God, Laura,"" she said, ""it is over., Now we will go away from this hateful city., Let us go home at once."", ""Mother,"" replied Laura, speaking with some tenderness, ""I cannot go with you., There, don't cry, I cannot go back to that life."", Mrs. Hawkins was sobbing., This was more cruel than anything else, for she had a dim notion of what it would be to leave Laura to herself., ""No, mother, you have been everything to me., You know how dearly I love you., But I cannot go back."", A boy brought in a telegraphic despatch., Laura took it and read:  ""The bill is lost., Dilworthy ruined., (Signed) WASHINGTON."", For a moment the words swam before her eyes., The next her eyes flashed fire as she handed the dispatch to her m other and bitterly said,  ""The world is against me., Well, let it be, let it., I am against it."", ""This is a cruel disappointment,"" said Mrs. Hawkins, to whom one grief more or less did not much matter now, ""to you and, Washington; but we must humbly bear it."", ""Bear it;""  replied Laura scornfully, ""I've all my life borne it, and fate has thwarted me at every step."", A servant came to the door to say that there was a gentleman below who wished to speak with Miss Hawkins., ""J. Adolphe Griller"" was the name Laura read on the card., ""I do not know such a person., He probably comes from Washington., Send him up."", Mr. Griller entered., He was a small man, slovenly in dress, his tone confidential, his manner wholly void of animation, all his features below the forehead protruding--particularly the apple of his throat--hair without a kink in it, a hand with no grip, a meek, hang-dog countenance., ...]",1
18,"[Here I followed instructions, and divested myself of all my clothing, and put on a waterproof jacket and overalls., This costume is picturesque, but not beautiful., A guide, similarly dressed, led the way down a flight of winding stairs, which wound and wound, and still kept on winding long after the thing ceased to be a novelty, and then terminated long before it had begun to be a pleasure., We were then well down under the precipice, but still considerably above the level of the river., We now began to creep along flimsy bridges of a single plank, our persons shielded from destruction by a crazy wooden railing, to which I clung with both hands--not because I was afraid, but because I wanted to., Presently the descent became steeper and the bridge flimsier, and sprays from the American Fall began to rain down on us in fast increasing sheets that soon became blinding, and after that our progress was mostly in the nature of groping., Nova a furious wind began to rush out from behind the waterfall, which seemed determined to sweep us from the bridge, and scatter us on the rocks and among the torrents below., I remarked that I wanted to go home; but it was too late., We were almost under the monstrous wall of water thundering down from above, and speech was in vain in the midst of such a pitiless crash of sound., In another moment the guide disappeared behind the deluge, and bewildered by the thunder, driven helplessly by the wind, and smitten by the arrowy tempest of rain, I followed., All was darkness., Such a mad storming, roaring, and bellowing of warring wind and water never crazed my ears before., I bent my head, and seemed to receive the Atlantic on my back., The world seemed going to destruction., I could not see anything, the flood poured down savagely., I raised my head, with open mouth, and the most of the American cataract went down my throat., If I had sprung a leak now I had been lost., And at this moment I discovered that the bridge had ceased, and we must trust for a foothold to the slippery and precipitous rocks., I never was so scared before and survived it., But we got through at last, and emerged into the open day, where we could stand in front of the laced and frothy and seething world of descending water, and look at it., When I saw how much of it there was, and how fearfully in earnest it was, I was sorry I had gone behind it., The noble Red Man has always been a friend and darling of mine., I love to read about him in tales and legends and romances., I love to read of his inspired sagacity, and his love of the wild free life of mountain and forest, and his general nobility of character, and his stately metaphorical manner of speech, and his chivalrous love for the dusky maiden, and the picturesque pomp of his dress and accoutrements., Especially the picturesque pomp of his dress and accoutrements., When I found the shops at Niagara Falls full of dainty Indian beadwork, and stunning moccasins, and equally stunning toy figures representing human beings who carried their weapons in holes bored through their arms and bodies, and had feet shaped like a pie, I was filled with emotion., I knew that now, at last, I was going to come face to face with the noble Red Man., A lady clerk in a shop told me, indeed, that all her grand array of curiosities were made by the Indians, and that they were plenty about the Falls, and that they were friendly, and it would not be dangerous to speak to them., And sure enough, as I approached the bridge leading over to Luna Island, I came upon a noble Son of the Forest sitting under a tree, diligently at work on a bead reticule., He wore a slouch hat and brogans, and had a short black pipe in his mouth., Thus does the baneful contact with our effeminate civilization dilute the picturesque pomp which is so natural to the Indian when far removed from us in his native haunts., I addressed the relic as follows:  ""Is the Wawhoo-Wang-Wang of the Whack-a-Whack happy?, Does the great Speckled Thunder sigh for the war-path, or is his heart contented with dreaming of the dusky maiden, the Pride of the Forest?, Does the mighty Sachem yearn to drink the blood of his enemies, or is he satisfied to make bead reticules for the pappooses of the paleface?, Speak, sublime relic of bygone grandeur--venerable ruin, speak!"", The relic said:  ""An' is it mesilf, Dennis Hooligan, that ye'd be takon' for a dirty Injin, ye drawlin', lantern-jawed, spider-legged divil!, By the piper that played before Moses, I'll ate ye!"", I went away from there., By and by, in the neighborhood of the Terrapin Tower, I came upon a gentle daughter of the aborigines in fringed and beaded buckskin moccasins and leggins, seated on a bench with her pretty wares about her., She had just carved out a wooden chief that had a strong family resemblance to a clothes-pin, and was now boring a hole through his abdomen to put his bow through., I hesitated a moment, and then addressed her:  ""Is the heart of the forest maiden heavy?, Is the Laughing Tadpole lonely?, Does she mourn over the extinguished council-fires of her race, and the vanished glory of her ancestors?, Or does her sad spirit wander afar toward the hunting-grounds whither her brave Gobbler-of-the- Lightnings is gone?, Why is my daughter silent?, Has she ought against the paleface stranger?"", The maiden said:  ""Faix, an' is it Biddy Malone ye dare to be callin' names?, Lave this, or I'll shy your lean carcass over the cataract, ye sniveling blaggard!"", I adjourned from there also., ""Confound these Indians!"", I said., ""They told me they were tame; but, if appearances go for anything, I should say they were all on the warpath."", I made one more attempt to fraternize with them, and only one., I came upon a camp of them gathered in the shade of a great tree, making wampum and moccasins, and addressed them in the language of friendship:  ""Noble Red Men, Braves, Grand Sachems, War Chiefs, Squaws, and High Muck-a-Mucks, the paleface from the land of the setting sun greets you!, You, Beneficent Polecat--you, Devourer of Mountains--you, Roaring Thundergust --you, Bully Boy with a Glass eye--the paleface from beyond the great waters greets you all!, War and pestilence have thinned your ranks and destroyed your once proud nation., Poker and seven-up, and a vain modern expense for soap, unknown to your glorious ancestors, have depleted your purses., Appropriating, in your simplicity, the property of others has gotten you into trouble., Misrepresenting facts, in your simple innocence, has damaged your reputation with the soulless usurper., Trading for forty-rod whisky, to enable you to get drunk and happy and tomahawk your families, has played the everlasting mischief with the picturesque pomp of your dress, and here you are, in the broad light of the nineteenth century, gotten up like the ragtag and bobtail of the purlieus of New York., For shame!, Remember your ancestors!, Recall their mighty deeds!, Remember Uncas!--and Red jacket!, and Hole in the Day!--and Whoopdedoodledo!, Emulate their achievements!, Unfurl yourselves under my banner, noble savages, illustrious guttersnipes--""  ""Down wid him!"", ""Scoop the blaggard!"", ""Burn him!"", ""Bang him!"", ""Dhround him!"", It was the quickest operation that ever was., I simply saw a sudden flash in the air of clubs, brickbats, fists, bead-baskets, and moccasins--a single flash, and they all appeared to hit me at once, and no two of them in the same place., In the next instant the entire tribe was upon me., They tore half the clothes off me; they broke my arms and legs; they gave me a thump that dented the top of my head till it would hold coffee like a saucer; and, to crown their disgraceful proceedings and add insult to injury, they threw me over the Niagara Falls, and I got wet., About ninety or a hundred feet from the top, the remains of my vest caught on a projecting rock, and I was almost drowned before I could get loose., I finally fell, and brought up in a world of white foam at the foot of the Fall, whose celled and bubbly masses towered up several inches above my head., Of course I got into the eddy., I sailed round and round in it forty-four times--chasing a chip and gaining on it--each round trip a half-mile--reaching for the same bush on the bank forty-four times, and just exactly missing it by a hair's-breadth every time., At last a man walked down and sat down close to that bush, and put a pipe in his mouth, and lit a match, and followed me with one eye and kept the other on the match, while he sheltered it in his hands from the wind., Presently a puff of wind blew it out., The next time I swept around he said:  ""Got a match?"", ""Yes; in my other vest., Help me out, please."", ""Not for Joe."", When I came round again, I said:  ""Excuse the seemingly impertinent curiosity of a drowning man, but will you explain this singular conduct of yours?"", ""With pleasure., I am the coroner., Don't hurry on my account., I can wait for you., But I wish I had a match."", I said: ""Take my place, and I'll go and get you one."", He declined., This lack of confidence on his part created a coldness between us, and from that time forward I avoided him., It was my idea, in case anything happened to me, to so time the occurrence as to throw my custom into the hands of the opposition coroner on the American side., At last a policeman came along, and arrested me for disturbing the peace by yelling at people on shore for help., The judge fined me, but had the advantage of him., My money was with my pantaloons, and my pantaloons were with the Indians., Thus I escaped., I am now lying in a very critical condition., ...]",1

C.  She wore a pink satin dress, plain in front but with a good deal of rake to it--to the train, I mean; it was said to be two or three yards long., One could see it creeping along the floor some little time after the woman was gone., Mrs. C. wore also a white bodice, cut bias, with Pompadour sleeves, flounced with ruches; low neck, with the inside handkerchief not visible, with white kid gloves., She had on a pearl necklace, which glinted lonely, high up the midst of that barren waste of neck and shoulders., Her hair was frizzled into a tangled chaparral, forward of her ears, aft it was drawn together, and compactly bound and plaited into a stump like a pony's tail, and furthermore was canted upward at a sharp angle, and ingeniously supported by a red velvet crupper, whose forward extremity was made fast with a half-hitch around a hairpin on the top of her head., Her whole top hamper was neat and becoming., She had a beautiful complexion when she first came, but it faded out by degrees in an unaccountable way., However, it is not lost for good., I found the most of it on my shoulder afterward., (I stood near the door when she squeezed out with the throng.), There were other ladies present, but I only took notes of one as a specimen., I would gladly enlarge upon the subject were I able to do it justice., RILEY-NEWSPAPER CORRESPONDENT  One of the best men in Washington--or elsewhere--is RILEY, correspondent of one of the great San Francisco dailies., Riley is full of humor, and has an unfailing vein of irony, which makes his conversation to the last degree entertaining (as long as the remarks are about somebody else)., But notwithstanding the possession of these qualities, which should enable a man to write a happy and an appetizing letter, Riley's newspaper letters often display a more than earthly solemnity, and likewise an unimaginative devotion to petrified facts, which surprise and distress all men who know him in his unofficial character., He explains this curious thing by saying that his employers sent him to Washington to write facts, not fancy, and that several times he has come near losing his situation by inserting humorous remarks which, not being looked for at headquarters, and consequently not understood, were thought to be dark and bloody speeches intended to convey signals and warnings to murderous secret societies, or something of that kind, and so were scratched out with a shiver and a prayer and cast into the stove., Riley says that sometimes he is so afflicted with a yearning to write a sparkling and absorbingly readable letter that he simply cannot resist it, and so he goes to his den and revels in the delight of untrammeled scribbling; and then, with suffering such as only a mother can know, he destroys the pretty children of his fancy and reduces his letter to the required dismal accuracy., Having seen Riley do this very thing more than once, I know whereof I speak., Often I have laughed with him over a happy passage, and grieved to see him plow his pen through it., He would say, ""I had to write that or die; and I've got to scratch it out or starve., They wouldn't stand it, you know."", I think Riley is about the most entertaining company I ever saw., We lodged together in many places in Washington during the winter of '67-8, moving comfortably from place to place, and attracting attention by paying our board--a course which cannot fail to make a person conspicuous in Washington., Riley would tell all about his trip to California in the early days, by way of the Isthmus and the San Juan River; and about his baking bread in San Francisco to gain a living, and setting up tenpins, and practising law, and opening oysters, and delivering lectures, and teaching French, and tending bar, and reporting for the newspapers, and keeping dancing-schools, and interpreting Chinese in the courts--which latter was lucrative, and Riley was doing handsomely and laying up a little money when people began to find fault because his translations were too ""free,"" a thing for which Riley considered he ought not to be held responsible, since he did not know a word of the Chinese tongue, and only adopted interpreting as a means of gaining an honest livelihood., Through the machinations of enemies he was removed from the position of official interpreter, and a man put in his place who was familiar with the Chinese language, but did not know any English., And Riley used to tell about publishing a newspaper up in what is Alaska now, but was only an iceberg then, with a population composed of bears, walruses, Indians, and other animals; and how the iceberg got adrift at last, and left all his paying subscribers behind, and as soon as the commonwealth floated out of the jurisdiction of Russia the people rose and threw off their allegiance and ran up the English flag, calculating to hook on and become an English colony as they drifted along down the British Possessions; but a land breeze and a crooked current carried them by, and they ran up the Stars and Stripes and steered for California, missed the connection again and swore allegiance to Mexico, but it wasn't any use; the anchors came home every time, and away they went with the northeast trades drifting off sideways toward the Sandwich Islands, whereupon they ran up the Cannibal flag and had a grand human barbecue in honor of it, in which it was noticed that the better a man liked a friend the better he enjoyed him; and as soon as they got fairly within the tropics the weather got so fearfully hot that the iceberg began to melt, and it got so sloppy under foot that it was almost impossible for ladies to get about at all; and at last, just as they came in sight of the islands, the melancholy remnant of the once majestic iceberg canted first to one side and then to the other, and then plunged under forever, carrying the national archives along with it--and not only the archives and the populace, but some eligible town lots which had increased in value as fast as they diminished in size in the tropics, and which Riley could have sold at thirty cents a pound and made himself rich if he could have kept the province afloat ten hours longer and got her into port., Riley is very methodical, untiringly accommodating, never forgets anything that is to be attended to, is a good son, a stanch friend, and a permanent reliable enemy., He will put himself to any amount of trouble to oblige a body, and therefore always has his hands full of things to be done for the helpless and the shiftless., And he knows how to do nearly everything, too., He is a man whose native benevolence is a well-spring that never goes dry., He stands always ready to help whoever needs help, as far as he is able--and not simply with his money, for that is a cheap and common charity, but with hand and brain, and fatigue of limb and sacrifice of time., This sort of men is rare., Riley has a ready wit, a quickness and aptness at selecting and applying quotations, and a countenance that is as solemn and as blank as the back side of a tombstone when he is delivering a particularly exasperating joke., One night a negro woman was burned to death in a house next door to us, and Riley said that our landlady would be oppressively emotional at breakfast, because she generally made use of such opportunities as offered, being of a morbidly sentimental turn, and so we should find it best to let her talk along and say nothing back--it was the only way to keep her tears out of the gravy., Riley said there never was a funeral in the neighborhood but that the gravy was watery for a week., And, sure enough, at breakfast the landlady was down in the very sloughs of woe--entirely brokenhearted., Everything she looked at reminded her of that poor old negro woman, and so the buckwheat cakes made her sob, the coffee forced a groan, and when the beefsteak came on she fetched a wail that made our hair rise., Then she got to talking about deceased, and kept up a steady drizzle till both of us were soaked through and through., Presently she took a fresh breath and said, with a world of sobs:  ""Ah, to think of it, only to think of it!--the poor old faithful creature., For she was so faithful., Would you believe it, she had been a servant in that selfsame house and that selfsame family for twenty seven years come Christmas, and never a cross word and never a lick!, And, oh, to think she should meet such a death at last!--a-sitting over the red hot stove at three o'clock in the morning and went to sleep and fell on it and was actually roasted!, Not just frizzled up a bit, but literally roasted to a crisp!, Poor faithful creature, how she was cooked!, I am but a poor woman, but even if I have to scrimp to do it, I will put up a tombstone over that lone sufferer's grave--and Mr. Riley if you would have the goodness to think up a little epitaph to put on it which would sort of describe the awful way in which she met her--""  ""Put it, 'Well done, good and faithful servant,'"" said Riley, and never smiled., A FINE OLD MAN  John Wagner, the oldest man in Buffalo--one hundred and four years old --recently walked a mile and a half in two weeks., He is as cheerful and bright as any of these other old men that charge around so persistently and tiresomely in the newspapers, and in every way as remarkable., Last November he walked five blocks in a rainstorm, without any shelter but an umbrella, and cast his vote for Grant, remarking that he had voted for forty-seven presidents--which was a lie., His ""second crop"" of rich brown hair arrived from New York yesterday, and he has a new set of teeth coming from Philadelphia., He is to be married next week to a girl one hundred and two years old, who still takes in washing., They have been engaged eighty years, but their parents persistently refused their consent until three days ago., John Wagner is two years older than the Rhode Island veteran, and yet has never tasted a drop of liquor in his life--unless-unless you count whisky., SCIENCE V.S., LUCK  At that time, in Kentucky (said the Hon., Mr. K-----); the law was very strict against what is termed ""games of chance."", About a dozen of the boys were detected playing ""seven up"" or ""old sledge"" for money, and the grand jury found a true bill against them., Jim Sturgis was retained to defend them when the case came up, of course., The more he studied over the matter, and looked into the evidence, the plainer it was that he must lose a case at last--there was no getting around that painful fact., Those boys had certainly been betting money on a game of chance., Even public sympathy was roused in behalf of Sturgis., People said it was a pity to see him mar his successful career with a big prominent case like this, which must go against him., But after several restless nights an inspired idea flashed upon Sturgis, and he sprang out of bed delighted., He thought he saw his way through., The next day he whispered around a little among his clients and a few friends, and then when the case came up in court he acknowledged the seven-up and the betting, and, as his sole defense, had the astounding effrontery to put in the plea that old sledge was not a game of chance!, There was the broadest sort of a smile all over the faces of that sophisticated audience., The judge smiled with the rest., But Sturgis maintained a countenance whose earnestness was even severe., The opposite counsel tried to ridicule him out of his position, and did not succeed., The judge jested in a ponderous judicial way about the thing, but did not move him., The matter was becoming grave., The judge lost a little of his patience, and said the joke had gone far enough., Jim Sturgis said he knew of no joke in the matter--his clients could not be punished for indulging in what some people chose to consider a game of chance until it was proven that it was a game of chance., Judge and counsel said that would be an easy matter, and forthwith called Deacons Job, Peters, Burke, and Johnson, and Dominies Wirt and Miggles, to testify; and they unanimously and with strong feeling put down the legal quibble of Sturgis by pronouncing that old sledge was a game of chance., ""What do you call it now?"", said the judge., ""I call it a game of science!"", retorted Sturgis; ""and I'll prove it, too!"", They saw his little game., He brought in a cloud of witnesses, and produced an overwhelming mass of testimony, to show that old sledge was not a game of chance but a game of science., Instead of being the simplest case in the world, it had somehow turned out to be an excessively knotty one., The judge scratched his head over it awhile, and said there was no way of coming to a determination, because just as many men could be brought into court who would testify on one side as could be found to testify on the other., But he said he was willing to do the fair thing by all parties, and would act upon any suggestion Mr. Sturgis would make for the solution of the difficulty., Mr. Sturgis was on his feet in a second., ""Impanel a jury of six of each, Luck versus Science., Give them candles and a couple of decks of cards., ...]",1

we all have our benignant, fatherly moods at one time or another, I suppose., I chose to kill the petrifaction mania with a delicate, a very delicate satire., But maybe it was altogether too delicate, for nobody ever perceived the satire part of it at all., I put my scheme in the shape of the discovery of a remarkably petrified man., I had had a temporary falling out with Mr.----, the new coroner and justice of the peace of Humboldt, and thought I might as well touch him up a little at the same time and make him ridiculous, and thus combine pleasure with business., So I told, in patient, belief-compelling detail, all about the finding of a petrified-man at Gravelly Ford (exactly a hundred and twenty miles, over a breakneck mountain trail from where ---- lived); how all the savants of the immediate neighborhood had been to examine it (it was notorious that there was not a living creature within fifty miles of there, except a few starving Indians; some crippled grasshoppers, and four or five buzzards out of meat and too feeble to get away); how those savants all pronounced the petrified man to have been in a state of complete petrifaction for over ten generations; and then, with a seriousness that I ought to have been ashamed to assume, I stated that as soon as Mr.----heard the news he summoned a jury, mounted his mule, and posted off, with noble reverence for official duty, on that awful five days' journey, through alkali, sage brush, peril of body, and imminent starvation, to hold an inquest on this man that had been dead and turned to everlasting stone for more than three hundred years!, And then, my hand being ""in,"" so to speak, I went on, with the same unflinching gravity, to state that the jury returned a verdict that deceased came to his death from protracted exposure., This only moved me to higher flights of imagination, and I said that the jury, with that charity so characteristic of pioneers, then dug a grave, and were about to give the petrified man Christian burial, when they found that for ages a limestone sediment had been trickling down the face of the stone against which he was sitting, and this stuff had run under him and cemented him fast to the ""bed-rock""; that the jury (they were all silver-miners) canvassed the difficulty a moment, and then got out their powder and fuse, and proceeded to drill a hole under him, in order to blast him from his position, when Mr.----, ""with that delicacy so characteristic of him, forbade them, observing that it would be little less than sacrilege to do such a thing."", From beginning to end the ""Petrified Man"" squib was a string of roaring absurdities, albeit they were told with an unfair pretense of truth that even imposed upon me to some extent, and I was in some danger of believing in my own fraud., But I really had no desire to deceive anybody, and no expectation of doing it., I depended on the way the petrified man was sitting to explain to the public that he was a swindle., Yet I purposely mixed that up with other things, hoping to make it obscure--and I did., I would describe the position of one foot, and then say his right thumb was against the side of his nose; then talk about his other foot, and presently come back and say the fingers of his right hand were spread apart; then talk about the back of his head a little, and return and say the left thumb was hooked into the right little finger; then ramble off about something else, and by and by drift back again and remark that the fingers of the left hand were spread like those of the right., But I was too ingenious., I mixed it up rather too much; and so all that description of the attitude, as a key to the humbuggery of the article, was entirely lost, for nobody but me ever discovered and comprehended the peculiar and suggestive position of the petrified man's hands., As a satire on the petrifaction mania, or anything else, my petrified Man was a disheartening failure; for everybody received him in innocent good faith, and I was stunned to see the creature I had begotten to pull down the wonder-business with, and bring derision upon it, calmly exalted to the grand chief place in the list of the genuine marvels our Nevada had produced., I was so disappointed at the curious miscarriage of my scheme, that at first I was angry, and did not like to think about it; but by and by, when the exchanges began to come in with the Petrified Man copied and guilelessly glorified, I began to feel a soothing secret satisfaction; and as my gentleman's field of travels broadened, and by the exchanges I saw that he steadily and implacably penetrated territory after territory, state after state, and land after land, till he swept the great globe and culminated in sublime and unimpeached legitimacy in the august London Lancet, my cup was full, and I said I was glad I had done it., I think that for about eleven months, as nearly as I can remember, Mr.----'s daily mail-bag continued to be swollen by the addition of half a bushel of newspapers hailing from many climes with the Petrified Man in them, marked around with a prominent belt of ink., I sent them to him., I did it for spite, not for fun., He used to shovel them into his back yard and curse., And every day during all those months the miners, his constituents (for miners never quit joking a person when they get started), would call on him and ask if he could tell them where they could get hold of a paper with the Petrified Man in it., He could have accommodated a continent with them., I hated-----in those days, and these things pacified me and pleased me., I could not have gotten more real comfort out of him without killing him., MY BLOODY MASSACRE  The other burlesque I have referred to was my fine satire upon the financial expedients of ""cooking dividends,"" a thing which became shamefully frequent on the Pacific coast for a while., Once more, in my self-complacent simplicity I felt that the time had arrived for me to rise up and be a reformer., I put this reformatory satire, in the shape of a fearful ""Massacre at Empire City."", The San Francisco papers were making a great outcry about the iniquity of the Daney Silver-Mining Company, whose directors had declared a ""cooked"" or false dividend, for the purpose of increasing the value of their stock, so that they could sell out at a comfortable figure, and then scramble from under the tumbling concern., And while abusing the Daney, those papers did not forget to urge the public to get rid of all their silver stocks and invest in, sound and safe San Francisco stocks, such as the Spring Valley Water Company, etc., But right at this unfortunate juncture, behold the Spring Valley cooked a dividend too!, And so, under the insidious mask of an invented ""bloody massacre,"" I stole upon the public unawares with my scathing satire upon the dividend cooking system., In about half a column of imaginary human carnage I told how a citizen hard murdered his wife and nine children, and then committed suicide., And I said slyly, at the bottom, that the sudden madness of which this melancholy massacre was the result had been brought about by his having allowed himself to be persuaded by the California papers to sell his sound and lucrative Nevada silver stocks, and buy into Spring Valley just in time to get cooked along with that company's fancy dividend, and sink every cent he had in the world., Ah, it was a deep, deep satire, and most ingeniously contrived., But I made the horrible details so carefully and conscientiously interesting that the public devoured them greedily, and wholly overlooked the following distinctly stated facts, to wit: The murderer was perfectly well known to every creature in the land as a bachelor, and consequently he could not murder his wife and nine children; he murdered them ""in his splendid dressed-stone mansion just in the edge of the great pine forest between Empire City and Dutch Nick's,"" when even the very pickled oysters that came on our tables knew that there was not a ""dressed-stone mansion"" in all Nevada Territory; also that, so far from there being a ""great pine forest between Empire City and Dutch Nick's,"" there wasn't a solitary tree within fifteen miles of either place; and, finally, it was patent and notorious that Empire City and Dutch Nick's were one and the same place, and contained only six houses anyhow, and consequently there could be no forest between them; and on top of all these absurdities I stated that this diabolical murderer, after inflicting a wound upon himself that the reader ought to have seen would kill an elephant in the twinkling of an eye, jumped on his horse and rode four miles, waving his wife's reeking scalp in the air, and thus performing entered Carson City with tremendous eclat, and dropped dead in front of the chief saloon, the envy and admiration of all beholders., Well, in all my life I never saw anything like the sensation that little satire created., It was the talk of the town, it was the talk of the territory., Most of the citizens dropped gently into it at breakfast, and they never finished their meal., There was something about those minutely faithful details that was a sufficing substitute for food., Few people that were able to read took food that morning., Dan and I (Dan was my reportorial associate) took our seats on either side of our customary table in the ""Eagle Restaurant,"" and, as I unfolded the shred they used to call a napkin in that establishment, I saw at the next table two stalwart innocents with that sort of vegetable dandruff sprinkled about their clothing which was the sign and evidence that they were in from the Truckee with a load of hay., The one facing me had the morning paper folded to a long, narrow strip, and I knew, without any telling, that that strip represented the column that contained my pleasant financial satire., From the way he was excitedly mumbling, I saw that the heedless son of a hay-mow was skipping with all his might, in order to get to the bloody details as quickly as possible; and so he was missing the guide-boards I had set up to warn him that the whole thing was a fraud., Presently his eyes spread wide open, just as his jaws swung asunder to take in a potato approaching it on a fork; the potato halted, the face lit up redly, and the whole man was on fire with excitement., Then he broke into a disjointed checking off of the particulars--his potato cooling in mid-air meantime, and his mouth making a reach for it occasionally; but always bringing up suddenly against a new and still more direful performance of my hero., At last he looked his stunned and rigid comrade impressively in the face, and said, with an expression of concentrated awe:  ""Jim, he b'iled his baby, and he took the old 'oman's skelp., Cuss'd if I want any breakfast!"", And he laid his lingering potato reverently down, and he and his friend departed from the restaurant empty but satisfied., He never got down to where the satire part of it began., ...]",1
21,"[I have chosen the general title of MEMORANDA for this department because it is plain and simple, and makes no fraudulent promises., I can print under it statistics, hotel arrivals, or anything that comes handy, without violating faith with the reader., 4., Puns cannot be allowed a place in this department., Inoffensive ignorance, benignant stupidity, and unostentatious imbecility will always be welcomed and cheerfully accorded a corner, and even the feeblest humour will be admitted, when we can do no better; but no circumstances, however dismal, will ever be considered a sufficient excuse for the admission of that last--and saddest evidence of intellectual poverty, the Pun., ABOUT SMELLS  In a recent issue of the ""Independent,"" the Rev., T. De Witt Talmage, of Brooklyn, has the following utterance on the subject of ""Smells"":       I have a good Christian friend who, if he sat in the front pew in      church, and a working man should enter the door at the other end,      would smell him instantly., My friend is not to blame for the      sensitiveness of his nose, any more than you would flog a pointer      for being keener on the scent than a stupid watch dog., The fact is,      if you, had all the churches free, by reason of the mixing up of the      common people with the uncommon, you would keep one-half of      Christendom sick at their stomach., If you are going to kill the      church thus with bad smells, I will have nothing to do with this      work of evangelization., We have reason to believe that there will be labouring men in heaven; and also a number of negroes, and Esquimaux, and Terra del Fuegans, and Arabs, and a few Indians, and possibly even some Spaniards and Portuguese., All things are possible with God., We shall have all these sorts of people in heaven; but, alas!, in getting them we shall lose the society of Dr. Talmage., Which is to say, we shall lose the company of one who could give more real ""tone"" to celestial society than any other contribution Brooklyn could furnish., And what would eternal happiness be without the Doctor?, Blissful, unquestionably--we know that well enough but would it be 'distingue,' would it be 'recherche' without him?, St. Matthew without stockings or sandals; St. Jerome bare headed, and with a coarse brown blanket robe dragging the ground; St. Sebastian with scarcely any raiment at all--these we should see, and should enjoy seeing them; but would we not miss a spike-tailed coat and kids, and turn away regretfully, and say to parties from the Orient: ""These are well enough, but you ought to see Talmage of Brooklyn."", I fear me that in the better world we shall not even have Dr. Talmage's ""good Christian friend."", For if he were sitting under the glory of the Throne, and the keeper of the keys admitted a Benjamin Franklin or other labouring man, that ""friend,"" with his fine natural powers infinitely augmented by emancipation from hampering flesh, would detect him with a single sniff, and immediately take his hat and ask to be excused., To all outward seeming, the Rev., T. De Witt Talmage is of the same material as that used in the construction of his early predecessors in the ministry; and yet one feels that there must be a difference somewhere between him and the Saviour's first disciples., It may be because here, in the nineteenth century, Dr. T.  has had advantages which Paul and Peter and the others could not and did not have., There was a lack of polish about them, and a looseness of etiquette, and a want of exclusiveness, which one cannot help noticing., They healed the very beggars, and held intercourse with people of a villainous odour every day., If the subject of these remarks had been chosen among the original Twelve Apostles, he would not have associated with the rest, because he could not have stood the fishy smell of some of his comrades who came from around the Sea of Galilee., He would have resigned his commission with some such remark as he makes in the extract quoted above: ""Master, if thou art going to kill the church thus with bad smells, I will have nothing to do with this work of evangelization."", He is a disciple, and makes that remark to the Master; the only difference is, that he makes it in the nineteenth instead of the first century., Is there a choir in Mr. T.'s church?, And does it ever occur that they have no better manners than to sing that hymn which is so suggestive of labourers and mechanics:            ""Son of the Carpenter!, receive           This humble work of mine?"", Now, can it be possible that in a handful of centuries the Christian character has fallen away from an imposing heroism that scorned even the stake, the cross, and the axe, to a poor little effeminacy that withers and wilts under an unsavoury smell?, We are not prepared to believe so, the reverend Doctor and his friend to the contrary notwithstanding., A COUPLE OF SAD EXPERIENCES  When I published a squib recently in which I said I was going to edit an Agricultural Department in this magazine, I certainly did not desire to deceive anybody., I had not the remotest desire to play upon any one's confidence with a practical joke, for he is a pitiful creature indeed who will degrade the dignity of his humanity to the contriving of the witless inventions that go by that name., I purposely wrote the thing as absurdly and as extravagantly as it could be written, in order to be sure and not mislead hurried or heedless readers: for I spoke of launching a triumphal barge upon a desert, and planting a tree of prosperity in a mine--a tree whose fragrance should slake the thirst of the naked, and whose branches should spread abroad till they washed the chorea of, etc., etc., I thought that manifest lunacy like that would protect the reader., But to make assurance absolute, and show that I did not and could not seriously mean to attempt an Agricultural Department, I stated distinctly in my postscript that I did not know anything about Agriculture., But alas!, right there is where I made my worst mistake--for that remark seems to have recommended my proposed Agriculture more than anything else., It lets a little light in on me, and I fancy I perceive that the farmers feel a little bored, sometimes, by the oracular profundity of agricultural editors who ""know it all."", In fact, one of my correspondents suggests this (for that unhappy squib has deluged me with letters about potatoes, and cabbages, and hominy, and vermicelli, and maccaroni, and all the other fruits, cereals, and vegetables that ever grew on earth; and if I get done answering questions about the best way of raising these things before I go raving crazy, I shall be thankful, and shall never write obscurely for fun any more)., Shall I tell the real reason why I have unintentionally succeeded in fooling so many people?, It is because some of them only read a little of the squib I wrote and jumped to the conclusion that it was serious, and the rest did not read it at all, but heard of my agricultural venture at second-hand., Those cases I could not guard against, of course., To write a burlesque so wild that its pretended facts will not be accepted in perfect good faith by somebody, is, very nearly an impossible thing to do., It is because, in some instances, the reader is a person who never tries to deceive anybody himself, and therefore is not expecting any one to wantonly practise a deception upon him; and in this case the only person dishonoured is the man who wrote the burlesque., In other instances the ""nub"" or moral of the burlesque--if its object be to enforce a truth--escapes notice in the superior glare of something in the body of the burlesque itself., And very often this ""moral"" is tagged on at the bottom, and the reader, not knowing that it is the key of the whole thing and the only important paragraph in the article, tranquilly turns up his nose at it and leaves it unread., One can deliver a satire with telling force through the insidious medium of a travesty, if he is careful not to overwhelm the satire with the extraneous interest of the travesty, and so bury it from the reader's sight and leave him a joked and defrauded victim, when the honest intent was to add to either his knowledge or his wisdom., I have had a deal of experience in burlesques and their unfortunate aptness to deceive the public, and this is why I tried hard to make that agricultural one so broad and so perfectly palpable that even a one-eyed potato could see it; and yet, as I speak the solemn truth, it fooled one of the ablest agricultural editors in America!, DAN MURPHY  One of the saddest things that ever came under my notice (said the banker's clerk) was there in Corning, during the war., Dan Murphy enlisted as a private, and fought very bravely., The boys all liked him, and when a wound by and by weakened him down till carrying a musket was too heavy work for him, they clubbed together and fixed him up as a sutler., He made money then, and sent it always to his wife to bank for him., She was a washer and ironer, and knew enough by hard experience to keep money when she got it., She didn't waste a penny., On the contrary, she began to get miserly as her bank account grew., She grieved to part with a cent, poor creature, for twice in her hard-working life she had known what it was to be hungry, cold, friendless, sick, and without a dollar in the world, and she had a haunting dread of suffering so again., Well, at last Dan died; and the boys, in testimony of their esteem and respect for him, telegraphed to Mrs.  Murphy to know if she would like to have him embalmed and sent home, when you know the usual custom was to dump a poor devil like him into a shallow hole, and then inform his friends what had become of him., Mrs.  Murphy jumped to the conclusion that it would only cost two or three dollars to embalm her dead husband, and so she telegraphed ""Yes."", It was at the ""wake"" that the bill for embalming arrived and was presented to the widow., She uttered a wild, sad wail, that pierced every heart, and said: ""Sivinty-foive dollars for stoofhn' Dan, blister their sowls!, Did thim divils suppose I was goin' to stairt a Museim, that I'd be dalin' in such expinsive curiassities!"", The banker's clerk said there was not a dry eye in the house., THE ""TOURNAMENT"" IN A. D. 1870  Lately there appeared an item to this effect, and the same went the customary universal round of the press:       A telegraph station has just been established upon the traditional      site of the Garden of Eden., As a companion to that, nothing fits so aptly and so perfectly as this:       Brooklyn has revived the knightly tournament of the Middle Ages., It is hard to tell which is the most startling, the idea of that highest achievement of human genius and intelligence, the telegraph, prating away about the practical concerns of the world's daily life in the heart and home of ancient indolence, ignorance, and savagery, or the idea of that happiest expression of the brag, vanity, and mock-heroics of our ancestors, the ""tournament,"" coming out of its grave to flaunt its tinsel trumpery and perform its ""chivalrous"" absurdities in the high noon of the nineteenth century, and under the patronage of a great, broad-awake city and an advanced civilisation., A ""tournament"" in Lynchburg is a thing easily within the comprehension of the average mind; but no commonly gifted person can conceive of such a spectacle in Brooklyn without straining his powers., Brooklyn is part and parcel of the city of New York, and there is hardly romance enough in the entire metropolis to re-supply a Virginia ""knight"" with ""chivalry,"" in case he happened to run out of it., Let the reader calmly and dispassionately picture to himself ""lists"" in Brooklyn; heralds, pursuivants, pages, garter king-at-arms--in Brooklyn; the marshalling of the fantastic hosts of ""chivalry"" in slashed doublets, velvet trunks, ruffles, and plumes--in Brooklyn; mounted on omnibus and livery-stable patriarchs, promoted, and referred to in cold blood as ""steeds,"" ""destriers,"" and ""chargers,"" and divested of their friendly, humble names these meek old ""Jims"" and ""Bobs"" and ""Charleys,"" and renamed ""Mohammed,"" ""Bucephalus,"" and ""Saladin""--in Brooklyn; mounted thus, and armed with swords and shields and wooden lances, and cased in paste board hauberks, morions, greaves, and gauntlets, and addressed as ""Sir"" Smith, and ""Sir"" Jones, and bearing such titled grandeurs as ""The Disinherited Knight,"" the ""Knight of Shenandoah,"" the ""Knight of the Blue Ridge,"" the ""Knight of Maryland,"" and the ""Knight of the Secret Sorrow""--in Brooklyn; and at the toot of the horn charging fiercely upon a helpless ring hung on a post, and prodding at it in trepidly with their wooden sticks, and by and by skewering it and cavorting back to the judges' stand covered with glory this in Brooklyn; and each noble success like this duly and promptly announced by an applauding toot from the herald's horn, and ""the band playing three bars of an old circus tune""--all in Brooklyn, in broad daylight., And let the reader remember, and also add to his picture, as follows, to wit: when the show was all over, the party who had shed the most blood and overturned and hacked to pieces the most knights, or at least had prodded the most muffin-rings, was accorded the ancient privilege of naming and crowning the Queen of Love and Beauty--which naming had in reality been done for, him by the ""cut-and-dried"" process, and long in advance, by a committee of ladies, but the crowning he did in person, though suffering from loss of blood, and then was taken to the county hospital on a shutter to have his wounds dressed--these curious things all occurring in Brooklyn, and no longer ago than one or two yesterdays., It seems impossible, and yet it is true., This was doubtless the first appearance of the ""tournament"" up here among the rolling-mills and factories, and will probably be the last., It will be well to let it retire permanently to the rural districts of Virginia, where, it is said, the fine mailed and plumed, noble-natured, maiden-rescuing, wrong-redressing, adventure-seeking knight of romance is accepted and believed in by the peasantry with pleasing simplicity, while they reject with scorn the plain, unpolished verdict whereby history exposes him as a braggart, a ruffian, a fantastic vagabond; and an ignoramus., All romance aside, what shape would our admiration of the heroes of Ashby de la Zouch be likely to take, in this practical age, if those worthies were to rise up and come here and perform again the chivalrous deeds of that famous passage of arms?, Nothing but a New York jury and the insanity plea could save them from hanging, from the amiable Bois-Guilbert and the pleasant Front-de-Boeuf clear down to the nameless ruffians that entered the riot with unpictured shields and did their first murder and acquired their first claim to respect that day., The doings of the so-called ""chivalry"" of the Middle Ages were absurd enough, even when they were brutally and bloodily in earnest, and when their surroundings of castles and donjons, savage landscapes and half-savage peoples, were in keeping; but those doings gravely reproduced with tinsel decorations and mock pageantry, by bucolic gentlemen with broomstick lances, and with muffin-rings to represent the foe, and all in the midst of the refinement and dignity of a carefully-developed modern civilisation, is absurdity gone crazy., Now, for next exhibition, let us have a fine representation of one of those chivalrous wholesale butcheries and burnings of Jewish women and children, which the crusading heroes of romance used to indulge in in their European homes, just before starting to the Holy Land, to seize and take to their protection the Sepulchre and defend it from ""pollution."", CURIOUS RELIC FOR SALE       ""For sale, for the benefit of the Fund for the Relief of the Widows      and Orphans of Deceased Firemen, a Curious Ancient Bedouin Pipe,      procured at the city of Endor in Palestine, and believed to have      once belonged to the justly-renowned Witch of Endor., Parties      desiring to examine this singular relic with a view to purchasing,      can do so by calling upon Daniel S.. 119 and 121 William street, New      York""  As per advertisement in the ""Herald."", A curious old relic indeed, as I had a good personal right to know., In a single instant of time, a long drawn panorama of sights and scenes in the Holy Land flashed through my memory--town and grove, desert, camp, and caravan clattering after each other and disappearing, leaping me with a little of the surprised and dizzy feeling which I have experienced at sundry times when a long express train has overtaken me at some quiet curve and gone whizzing, car by car, around the corner and out of sight., In that prolific instant I saw again all the country from the Sea of Galilee and Nazareth clear to Jerusalem, and thence over the hills of Judea and through the Vale of Sharon to Joppa, down by the ocean., Leaving out unimportant stretches of country and details of incident, I saw and experienced the following described matters and things., Immediately three years fell away from my age, and a vanished time was restored to me September, 1867., It was a flaming Oriental day--this one that had come up out of the past and brought along its actors, its stage-properties, and scenic effects--and our party had just ridden through the squalid hive of human vermin which still holds the ancient Biblical name of Endor; I was bringing up the rear on my grave four-dollar steed, who was about beginning to compose himself for his usual noon nap., My!, only fifteen minutes before how the black, mangy, nine-tenths naked, ten-tenths filthy, ignorant, bigoted, besotted, hungry, lazy, malignant, screeching, crowding, struggling, wailing, begging, cursing, hateful spawn of the original Witch had swarmed out of the caves in the rocks and the holes and crevices in the earth, and blocked our horses' way, besieged us, threw themselves in the animals' path, clung to their manes, saddle-furniture, and tails, asking, beseeching, demanding ""bucksheesh!, bucksheesh!, BUCKSHEESH!"", We had rained small copper Turkish coins among them, as fugitives fling coats and hats to pursuing wolves, and then had spurred our way through as they stopped to scramble for the largess., I was fervently thankful when we had gotten well up on the desolate hillside and outstripped them and left them jawing and gesticulating in the rear., What a tempest had seemingly gone roaring and crashing by me and left its dull thunders pulsing in my ears!, I was in the rear, as I was saying., Our pack-mules and Arabs were far ahead, and Dan, Jack, Moult, Davis, Denny, Church, and Birch (these names will do as well as any to represent the boys) were following close after them., As my horse nodded to rest, I heard a sort of panting behind me, and turned and saw that a tawny youth from the village had overtaken me --a true remnant and representative of his ancestress the Witch--a galvanised scurvy, wrought into the human shape and garnished with ophthalmia and leprous scars--an airy creature with an invisible shirt-front that reached below the pit of his stomach, and no other clothing to speak of except a tobacco-pouch, an ammunition-pocket, and a venerable gun, which was long enough to club any game with that came within shooting distance, but far from efficient as an article of dress., I thought to myself, ""Now this disease with a human heart in it is going to shoot me."", I smiled in derision at the idea of a Bedouin daring to touch off his great-grandfather's rusty gun and getting his head blown off for his pains., But then it occurred to me, in simple school-boy language, ""Suppose he should take deliberate aim and 'haul off' and fetch me with the butt-end of it?"", ...]",1
22,"[""Oh yes--I've seen whole families in the same fix."", ""Smarty!, You think you're SOME, now, DON'T you?, Oh, what a hat!"", ""You can lump that hat if you don't like it., I dare you to knock it off--and anybody that'll take a dare will suck eggs."", ""You're a liar!"", ""You're another."", ""You're a fighting liar and dasn't take it up."", ""Aw--take a walk!"", ""Say--if you give me much more of your sass I'll take and bounce a rock off'n your head."", ""Oh, of COURSE you will."", ""Well I WILL."", ""Well why don't you DO it then?, What do you keep SAYING you will for?, Why don't you DO it?, It's because you're afraid."", ""I AIN'T afraid."", ""You are."", ""I ain't."", ""You are."", Another pause, and more eying and sidling around each other., Presently they were shoulder to shoulder., Tom said:  ""Get away from here!"", ""Go away yourself!"", ""I won't."", ""I won't either."", So they stood, each with a foot placed at an angle as a brace, and both shoving with might and main, and glowering at each other with hate., But neither could get an advantage., After struggling till both were hot and flushed, each relaxed his strain with watchful caution, and Tom said:  ""You're a coward and a pup., I'll tell my big brother on you, and he can thrash you with his little finger, and I'll make him do it, too."", ""What do I care for your big brother?, I've got a brother that's bigger than he is--and what's more, he can throw him over that fence, too."", [Both brothers were imaginary.], ""That's a lie."", ""YOUR saying so don't make it so."", Tom drew a line in the dust with his big toe, and said:  ""I dare you to step over that, and I'll lick you till you can't stand up., Anybody that'll take a dare will steal sheep."", The new boy stepped over promptly, and said:  ""Now you said you'd do it, now let's see you do it."", ""Don't you crowd me now; you better look out."", ""Well, you SAID you'd do it--why don't you do it?"", ""By jingo!, for two cents I WILL do it."", The new boy took two broad coppers out of his pocket and held them out with derision., Tom struck them to the ground., In an instant both boys were rolling and tumbling in the dirt, gripped together like cats; and for the space of a minute they tugged and tore at each other's hair and clothes, punched and scratched each other's nose, and covered themselves with dust and glory., Presently the confusion took form, and through the fog of battle Tom appeared, seated astride the new boy, and pounding him with his fists., ""Holler 'nuff!"", said he., The boy only struggled to free himself., He was crying--mainly from rage., ""Holler 'nuff!"", --and the pounding went on., At last the stranger got out a smothered ""'Nuff!"", and Tom let him up and said:  ""Now that'll learn you., Better look out who you're fooling with next time."", The new boy went off brushing the dust from his clothes, sobbing, snuffling, and occasionally looking back and shaking his head and threatening what he would do to Tom the ""next time he caught him out."", To which Tom responded with jeers, and started off in high feather, and as soon as his back was turned the new boy snatched up a stone, threw it and hit him between the shoulders and then turned tail and ran like an antelope., Tom chased the traitor home, and thus found out where he lived., He then held a position at the gate for some time, daring the enemy to come outside, but the enemy only made faces at him through the window and declined., At last the enemy's mother appeared, and called Tom a bad, vicious, vulgar child, and ordered him away., So he went away; but he said he ""'lowed"" to ""lay"" for that boy., He got home pretty late that night, and when he climbed cautiously in at the window, he uncovered an ambuscade, in the person of his aunt; and when she saw the state his clothes were in her resolution to turn his Saturday holiday into captivity at hard labor became adamantine in its firmness., SATURDAY morning was come, and all the summer world was bright and fresh, and brimming with life., There was a song in every heart; and if the heart was young the music issued at the lips., There was cheer in every face and a spring in every step., The locust-trees were in bloom and the fragrance of the blossoms filled the air., Cardiff Hill, beyond the village and above it, was green with vegetation and it lay just far enough away to seem a Delectable Land, dreamy, reposeful, and inviting., Tom appeared on the sidewalk with a bucket of whitewash and a long-handled brush., He surveyed the fence, and all gladness left him and a deep melancholy settled down upon his spirit., Thirty yards of board fence nine feet high., Life to him seemed hollow, and existence but a burden., Sighing, he dipped his brush and passed it along the topmost plank; repeated the operation; did it again; compared the insignificant whitewashed streak with the far-reaching continent of unwhitewashed fence, and sat down on a tree-box discouraged., Jim came skipping out at the gate with a tin pail, and singing Buffalo Gals., Bringing water from the town pump had always been hateful work in Tom's eyes, before, but now it did not strike him so., He remembered that there was company at the pump., White, mulatto, and negro boys and girls were always there waiting their turns, resting, trading playthings, quarrelling, fighting, skylarking., And he remembered that although the pump was only a hundred and fifty yards off, Jim never got back with a bucket of water under an hour--and even then somebody generally had to go after him., Tom said:  ""Say, Jim, I'll fetch the water if you'll whitewash some."", Jim shook his head and said:  ""Can't, Mars Tom., Ole missis, she tole me I got to go an' git dis water an' not stop foolin' roun' wid anybody., She say she spec' Mars Tom gwine to ax me to whitewash, an' so she tole me go 'long an' 'tend to my own business--she 'lowed SHE'D 'tend to de whitewashin'."", ""Oh, never you mind what she said, Jim., That's the way she always talks., Gimme the bucket--I won't be gone only a a minute., SHE won't ever know."", ""Oh, I dasn't, Mars Tom., Ole missis she'd take an' tar de head off'n me., 'Deed she would."", ""SHE!, She never licks anybody--whacks 'em over the head with her thimble--and who cares for that, I'd like to know., She talks awful, but talk don't hurt--anyways it don't if she don't cry., Jim, I'll give you a marvel., I'll give you a white alley!"", Jim began to waver., ""White alley, Jim!, And it's a bully taw."", ""My!, Dat's a mighty gay marvel, I tell you!, But Mars Tom I's powerful 'fraid ole missis--""  ""And besides, if you will I'll show you my sore toe."", ...]",1
23,"[So it's the same with Muff Potter, of course., But if a man was dead sober, I reckon maybe that whack might fetch him; I dono."", After another reflective silence, Tom said:  ""Hucky, you sure you can keep mum?"", ""Tom, we GOT to keep mum., You know that., That Injun devil wouldn't make any more of drownding us than a couple of cats, if we was to squeak 'bout this and they didn't hang him., Now, look-a-here, Tom, less take and swear to one another--that's what we got to do--swear to keep mum."", ""I'm agreed., It's the best thing., Would you just hold hands and swear that we--""  ""Oh no, that wouldn't do for this., That's good enough for little rubbishy common things--specially with gals, cuz THEY go back on you anyway, and blab if they get in a huff--but there orter be writing 'bout a big thing like this., And blood."", Tom's whole being applauded this idea., It was deep, and dark, and awful; the hour, the circumstances, the surroundings, were in keeping with it., He picked up a clean pine shingle that lay in the moonlight, took a little fragment of ""red keel"" out of his pocket, got the moon on his work, and painfully scrawled these lines, emphasizing each slow down-stroke by clamping his tongue between his teeth, and letting up the pressure on the up-strokes., [See next page.], ""Huck Finn and     Tom Sawyer swears     they will keep mum     about This and They     wish They may Drop     down dead in Their     Tracks if They ever     Tell and Rot."", Huckleberry was filled with admiration of Tom's facility in writing, and the sublimity of his language., He at once took a pin from his lapel and was going to prick his flesh, but Tom said:  ""Hold on!, Don't do that., A pin's brass., It might have verdigrease on it."", ""What's verdigrease?"", ""It's p'ison., That's what it is., You just swaller some of it once --you'll see."", So Tom unwound the thread from one of his needles, and each boy pricked the ball of his thumb and squeezed out a drop of blood., In time, after many squeezes, Tom managed to sign his initials, using the ball of his little finger for a pen., Then he showed Huckleberry how to make an H and an F, and the oath was complete., They buried the shingle close to the wall, with some dismal ceremonies and incantations, and the fetters that bound their tongues were considered to be locked and the key thrown away., A figure crept stealthily through a break in the other end of the ruined building, now, but they did not notice it., ""Tom,"" whispered Huckleberry, ""does this keep us from EVER telling --ALWAYS?"", ""Of course it does., It don't make any difference WHAT happens, we got to keep mum., We'd drop down dead--don't YOU know that?"", ""Yes, I reckon that's so."", They continued to whisper for some little time., Presently a dog set up a long, lugubrious howl just outside--within ten feet of them., The boys clasped each other suddenly, in an agony of fright., ""Which of us does he mean?"", gasped Huckleberry., ""I dono--peep through the crack., Quick!"", ""No, YOU, Tom!"", ""I can't--I can't DO it, Huck!"", ""Please, Tom., There 'tis again!"", ""Oh, lordy, I'm thankful!"", whispered Tom., ""I know his voice., It's Bull Harbison."", *  [* If Mr. Harbison owned a slave named Bull, Tom would have spoken of him as ""Harbison's Bull,"" but a son or a dog of that name was ""Bull Harbison.""], ""Oh, that's good--I tell you, Tom, I was most scared to death; I'd a bet anything it was a STRAY dog."", The dog howled again., The boys' hearts sank once more., ""Oh, my!, that ain't no Bull Harbison!"", whispered Huckleberry., ""DO, Tom!"", Tom, quaking with fear, yielded, and put his eye to the crack., His whisper was hardly audible when he said:  ""Oh, Huck, IT S A STRAY DOG!"", ""Quick, Tom, quick!, Who does he mean?"", ""Huck, he must mean us both--we're right together."", ""Oh, Tom, I reckon we're goners., I reckon there ain't no mistake 'bout where I'LL go to., I been so wicked."", ""Dad fetch it!, This comes of playing hookey and doing everything a feller's told NOT to do., I might a been good, like Sid, if I'd a tried --but no, I wouldn't, of course., But if ever I get off this time, I lay I'll just WALLER in Sunday-schools!"", And Tom began to snuffle a little., ""YOU bad!"", and Huckleberry began to snuffle too., ""Consound it, Tom Sawyer, you're just old pie, 'longside o' what I am., Oh, LORDY, lordy, lordy, I wisht I only had half your chance."", Tom choked off and whispered:  ""Look, Hucky, look!, He's got his BACK to us!"", Hucky looked, with joy in his heart., ""Well, he has, by jingoes!, Did he before?"", ""Yes, he did., But I, like a fool, never thought., Oh, this is bully, you know., NOW who can he mean?"", The howling stopped., Tom pricked up his ears., ""Sh!, What's that?"", he whispered., ""Sounds like--like hogs grunting., No--it's somebody snoring, Tom."", ""That IS it!, Where 'bouts is it, Huck?"", ""I bleeve it's down at 'tother end., Sounds so, anyway., Pap used to sleep there, sometimes, 'long with the hogs, but laws bless you, he just lifts things when HE snores., Besides, I reckon he ain't ever coming back to this town any more."", The spirit of adventure rose in the boys' souls once more., ""Hucky, do you das't to go if I lead?"", ...]",1
24,"[Tom stood a moment, to gather his dismembered faculties; and when he stepped forward to go to his punishment the surprise, the gratitude, the adoration that shone upon him out of poor Becky's eyes seemed pay enough for a hundred floggings., Inspired by the splendor of his own act, he took without an outcry the most merciless flaying that even Mr. Dobbins had ever administered; and also received with indifference the added cruelty of a command to remain two hours after school should be dismissed--for he knew who would wait for him outside till his captivity was done, and not count the tedious time as loss, either., Tom went to bed that night planning vengeance against Alfred Temple; for with shame and repentance Becky had told him all, not forgetting her own treachery; but even the longing for vengeance had to give way, soon, to pleasanter musings, and he fell asleep at last with Becky's latest words lingering dreamily in his ear--  ""Tom, how COULD you be so noble!"", VACATION was approaching., The schoolmaster, always severe, grew severer and more exacting than ever, for he wanted the school to make a good showing on ""Examination"" day., His rod and his ferule were seldom idle now--at least among the smaller pupils., Only the biggest boys, and young ladies of eighteen and twenty, escaped lashing., Mr. Dobbins' lashings were very vigorous ones, too; for although he carried, under his wig, a perfectly bald and shiny head, he had only reached middle age, and there was no sign of feebleness in his muscle., As the great day approached, all the tyranny that was in him came to the surface; he seemed to take a vindictive pleasure in punishing the least shortcomings., The consequence was, that the smaller boys spent their days in terror and suffering and their nights in plotting revenge., They threw away no opportunity to do the master a mischief., But he kept ahead all the time., The retribution that followed every vengeful success was so sweeping and majestic that the boys always retired from the field badly worsted., At last they conspired together and hit upon a plan that promised a dazzling victory., They swore in the sign-painter's boy, told him the scheme, and asked his help., He had his own reasons for being delighted, for the master boarded in his father's family and had given the boy ample cause to hate him., The master's wife would go on a visit to the country in a few days, and there would be nothing to interfere with the plan; the master always prepared himself for great occasions by getting pretty well fuddled, and the sign-painter's boy said that when the dominie had reached the proper condition on Examination Evening he would ""manage the thing"" while he napped in his chair; then he would have him awakened at the right time and hurried away to school., In the fulness of time the interesting occasion arrived., At eight in the evening the schoolhouse was brilliantly lighted, and adorned with wreaths and festoons of foliage and flowers., The master sat throned in his great chair upon a raised platform, with his blackboard behind him., He was looking tolerably mellow., Three rows of benches on each side and six rows in front of him were occupied by the dignitaries of the town and by the parents of the pupils., To his left, back of the rows of citizens, was a spacious temporary platform upon which were seated the scholars who were to take part in the exercises of the evening; rows of small boys, washed and dressed to an intolerable state of discomfort; rows of gawky big boys; snowbanks of girls and young ladies clad in lawn and muslin and conspicuously conscious of their bare arms, their grandmothers' ancient trinkets, their bits of pink and blue ribbon and the flowers in their hair., All the rest of the house was filled with non-participating scholars., The exercises began., A very little boy stood up and sheepishly recited, ""You'd scarce expect one of my age to speak in public on the stage,"" etc.--accompanying himself with the painfully exact and spasmodic gestures which a machine might have used--supposing the machine to be a trifle out of order., But he got through safely, though cruelly scared, and got a fine round of applause when he made his manufactured bow and retired., A little shamefaced girl lisped, ""Mary had a little lamb,"" etc., performed a compassion-inspiring curtsy, got her meed of applause, and sat down flushed and happy., Tom Sawyer stepped forward with conceited confidence and soared into the unquenchable and indestructible ""Give me liberty or give me death"" speech, with fine fury and frantic gesticulation, and broke down in the middle of it., A ghastly stage-fright seized him, his legs quaked under him and he was like to choke., True, he had the manifest sympathy of the house but he had the house's silence, too, which was even worse than its sympathy., The master frowned, and this completed the disaster., Tom struggled awhile and then retired, utterly defeated., There was a weak attempt at applause, but it died early., ""The Boy Stood on the Burning Deck"" followed; also ""The Assyrian Came Down,"" and other declamatory gems., Then there were reading exercises, and a spelling fight., The meagre Latin class recited with honor., The prime feature of the evening was in order, now--original ""compositions"" by the young ladies., Each in her turn stepped forward to the edge of the platform, cleared her throat, held up her manuscript (tied with dainty ribbon), and proceeded to read, with labored attention to ""expression"" and punctuation., The themes were the same that had been illuminated upon similar occasions by their mothers before them, their grandmothers, and doubtless all their ancestors in the female line clear back to the Crusades., ""Friendship"" was one; ""Memories of Other Days""; ""Religion in History""; ""Dream Land""; ""The Advantages of Culture""; ""Forms of Political Government Compared and Contrasted""; ""Melancholy""; ""Filial Love""; ""Heart Longings,"" etc., etc., A prevalent feature in these compositions was a nursed and petted melancholy; another was a wasteful and opulent gush of ""fine language""; another was a tendency to lug in by the ears particularly prized words and phrases until they were worn entirely out; and a peculiarity that conspicuously marked and marred them was the inveterate and intolerable sermon that wagged its crippled tail at the end of each and every one of them., No matter what the subject might be, a brain-racking effort was made to squirm it into some aspect or other that the moral and religious mind could contemplate with edification., The glaring insincerity of these sermons was not sufficient to compass the banishment of the fashion from the schools, and it is not sufficient to-day; it never will be sufficient while the world stands, perhaps., There is no school in all our land where the young ladies do not feel obliged to close their compositions with a sermon; and you will find that the sermon of the most frivolous and the least religious girl in the school is always the longest and the most relentlessly pious., But enough of this., Homely truth is unpalatable., Let us return to the ""Examination."", The first composition that was read was one entitled ""Is this, then, Life?"", Perhaps the reader can endure an extract from it:    ""In the common walks of life, with what delightful    emotions does the youthful mind look forward to some    anticipated scene of festivity!, Imagination is busy    sketching rose-tinted pictures of joy., In fancy, the    voluptuous votary of fashion sees herself amid the    festive throng, 'the observed of all observers.', Her    graceful form, arrayed in snowy robes, is whirling    through the mazes of the joyous dance; her eye is    brightest, her step is lightest in the gay assembly., ""In such delicious fancies time quickly glides by,    and the welcome hour arrives for her entrance into    the Elysian world, of which she has had such bright    dreams., How fairy-like does everything appear to    her enchanted vision!, Each new scene is more charming    than the last., But after a while she finds that    beneath this goodly exterior, all is vanity, the    flattery which once charmed her soul, now grates    harshly upon her ear; the ball-room has lost its    charms; and with wasted health and imbittered heart,    she turns away with the conviction that earthly    pleasures cannot satisfy the longings of the soul!"", And so forth and so on., There was a buzz of gratification from time to time during the reading, accompanied by whispered ejaculations of ""How sweet!"", ""How eloquent!"", ""So true!"", etc., and after the thing had closed with a peculiarly afflicting sermon the applause was enthusiastic., Then arose a slim, melancholy girl, whose face had the ""interesting"" paleness that comes of pills and indigestion, and read a ""poem."", Two stanzas of it will do:     ""A MISSOURI MAIDEN'S FAREWELL TO ALABAMA     ""Alabama, good-bye!, I love thee well!, But yet for a while do I leave thee now!, Sad, yes, sad thoughts of thee my heart doth swell,       And burning recollections throng my brow!, For I have wandered through thy flowery woods;       Have roamed and read near Tallapoosa's stream;     Have listened to Tallassee's warring floods,       And wooed on Coosa's side Aurora's beam., ""Yet shame I not to bear an o'er-full heart,       Nor blush to turn behind my tearful eyes;     'Tis from no stranger land I now must part,       'Tis to no strangers left I yield these sighs., Welcome and home were mine within this State,       Whose vales I leave--whose spires fade fast from me     And cold must be mine eyes, and heart, and tete,       When, dear Alabama!, they turn cold on thee!"", There were very few there who knew what ""tete"" meant, but the poem was very satisfactory, nevertheless., Next appeared a dark-complexioned, black-eyed, black-haired young lady, who paused an impressive moment, assumed a tragic expression, and began to read in a measured, solemn tone:    ""A VISION     ""Dark and tempestuous was night., Around the    throne on high not a single star quivered; but    the deep intonations of the heavy thunder    constantly vibrated upon the ear; whilst the    terrific lightning revelled in angry mood    through the cloudy chambers of heaven, seeming    to scorn the power exerted over its terror by    the illustrious Franklin!, Even the boisterous    winds unanimously came forth from their mystic    homes, and blustered about as if to enhance by    their aid the wildness of the scene., ""At such a time, so dark, so dreary, for human    sympathy my very spirit sighed; but instead thereof,     ""'My dearest friend, my counsellor, my comforter    and guide--My joy in grief, my second bliss    in joy,' came to my side., She moved like one of    those bright beings pictured in the sunny walks    of fancy's Eden by the romantic and young, a    queen of beauty unadorned save by her own    transcendent loveliness., So soft was her step, it    failed to make even a sound, and but for the    magical thrill imparted by her genial touch, as    other unobtrusive beauties, she would have glided    away un-perceived--unsought., A strange sadness    rested upon her features, like icy tears upon    the robe of December, as she pointed to the    contending elements without, and bade me contemplate    the two beings presented."", This nightmare occupied some ten pages of manuscript and wound up with a sermon so destructive of all hope to non-Presbyterians that it took the first prize., This composition was considered to be the very finest effort of the evening., The mayor of the village, in delivering the prize to the author of it, made a warm speech in which he said that it was by far the most ""eloquent"" thing he had ever listened to, and that Daniel Webster himself might well be proud of it., It may be remarked, in passing, that the number of compositions in which the word ""beauteous"" was over-fondled, and human experience referred to as ""life's page,"" was up to the usual average., Now the master, mellow almost to the verge of geniality, put his chair aside, turned his back to the audience, and began to draw a map of America on the blackboard, to exercise the geography class upon., But he made a sad business of it with his unsteady hand, and a smothered titter rippled over the house., He knew what the matter was, and set himself to right it., He sponged out lines and remade them; but he only distorted them more than ever, and the tittering was more pronounced., He threw his entire attention upon his work, now, as if determined not to be put down by the mirth., He felt that all eyes were fastened upon him; he imagined he was succeeding, and yet the tittering continued; it even manifestly increased., And well it might., There was a garret above, pierced with a scuttle over his head; and down through this scuttle came a cat, suspended around the haunches by a string; she had a rag tied about her head and jaws to keep her from mewing; as she slowly descended she curved upward and clawed at the string, she swung downward and clawed at the intangible air., The tittering rose higher and higher--the cat was within six inches of the absorbed teacher's head--down, down, a little lower, and she grabbed his wig with her desperate claws, clung to it, and was snatched up into the garret in an instant with her trophy still in her possession!, And how the light did blaze abroad from the master's bald pate--for the sign-painter's boy had GILDED it!, That broke up the meeting., The boys were avenged., Vacation had come., NOTE:--The pretended ""compositions"" quoted in    this chapter are taken without alteration from a    volume entitled ""Prose and Poetry, by a Western    Lady""--but they are exactly and precisely after    the schoolgirl pattern, and hence are much    happier than any mere imitations could be., TOM joined the new order of Cadets of Temperance, being attracted by the showy character of their ""regalia."", He promised to abstain from smoking, chewing, and profanity as long as he remained a member., Now he found out a new thing--namely, that to promise not to do a thing is the surest way in the world to make a body want to go and do that very thing., ...]",1
25,"[But I hope we won't get lost., It would be so awful!"", and the girl shuddered at the thought of the dreadful possibilities., They started through a corridor, and traversed it in silence a long way, glancing at each new opening, to see if there was anything familiar about the look of it; but they were all strange., Every time Tom made an examination, Becky would watch his face for an encouraging sign, and he would say cheerily:  ""Oh, it's all right., This ain't the one, but we'll come to it right away!"", But he felt less and less hopeful with each failure, and presently began to turn off into diverging avenues at sheer random, in desperate hope of finding the one that was wanted., He still said it was ""all right,"" but there was such a leaden dread at his heart that the words had lost their ring and sounded just as if he had said, ""All is lost!"", Becky clung to his side in an anguish of fear, and tried hard to keep back the tears, but they would come., At last she said:  ""Oh, Tom, never mind the bats, let's go back that way!, We seem to get worse and worse off all the time."", ""Listen!"", said he., Profound silence; silence so deep that even their breathings were conspicuous in the hush., Tom shouted., The call went echoing down the empty aisles and died out in the distance in a faint sound that resembled a ripple of mocking laughter., ""Oh, don't do it again, Tom, it is too horrid,"" said Becky., ""It is horrid, but I better, Becky; they might hear us, you know,"" and he shouted again., The ""might"" was even a chillier horror than the ghostly laughter, it so confessed a perishing hope., The children stood still and listened; but there was no result., Tom turned upon the back track at once, and hurried his steps., It was but a little while before a certain indecision in his manner revealed another fearful fact to Becky--he could not find his way back!, ""Oh, Tom, you didn't make any marks!"", ""Becky, I was such a fool!, Such a fool!, I never thought we might want to come back!, No--I can't find the way., It's all mixed up."", ""Tom, Tom, we're lost!, we're lost!, We never can get out of this awful place!, Oh, why DID we ever leave the others!"", She sank to the ground and burst into such a frenzy of crying that Tom was appalled with the idea that she might die, or lose her reason., He sat down by her and put his arms around her; she buried her face in his bosom, she clung to him, she poured out her terrors, her unavailing regrets, and the far echoes turned them all to jeering laughter., Tom begged her to pluck up hope again, and she said she could not., He fell to blaming and abusing himself for getting her into this miserable situation; this had a better effect., She said she would try to hope again, she would get up and follow wherever he might lead if only he would not talk like that any more., For he was no more to blame than she, she said., So they moved on again--aimlessly--simply at random--all they could do was to move, keep moving., For a little while, hope made a show of reviving--not with any reason to back it, but only because it is its nature to revive when the spring has not been taken out of it by age and familiarity with failure., By-and-by Tom took Becky's candle and blew it out., This economy meant so much!, Words were not needed., Becky understood, and her hope died again., She knew that Tom had a whole candle and three or four pieces in his pockets--yet he must economize., By-and-by, fatigue began to assert its claims; the children tried to pay attention, for it was dreadful to think of sitting down when time was grown to be so precious, moving, in some direction, in any direction, was at least progress and might bear fruit; but to sit down was to invite death and shorten its pursuit., At last Becky's frail limbs refused to carry her farther., She sat down., Tom rested with her, and they talked of home, and the friends there, and the comfortable beds and, above all, the light!, Becky cried, and Tom tried to think of some way of comforting her, but all his encouragements were grown threadbare with use, and sounded like sarcasms., Fatigue bore so heavily upon Becky that she drowsed off to sleep., Tom was grateful., He sat looking into her drawn face and saw it grow smooth and natural under the influence of pleasant dreams; and by-and-by a smile dawned and rested there., The peaceful face reflected somewhat of peace and healing into his own spirit, and his thoughts wandered away to bygone times and dreamy memories., While he was deep in his musings, Becky woke up with a breezy little laugh--but it was stricken dead upon her lips, and a groan followed it., ""Oh, how COULD I sleep!, I wish I never, never had waked!, No!, No, I don't, Tom!, Don't look so!, I won't say it again."", ""I'm glad you've slept, Becky; you'll feel rested, now, and we'll find the way out."", ""We can try, Tom; but I've seen such a beautiful country in my dream., I reckon we are going there."", ""Maybe not, maybe not., Cheer up, Becky, and let's go on trying."", They rose up and wandered along, hand in hand and hopeless., They tried to estimate how long they had been in the cave, but all they knew was that it seemed days and weeks, and yet it was plain that this could not be, for their candles were not gone yet., A long time after this--they could not tell how long--Tom said they must go softly and listen for dripping water--they must find a spring., They found one presently, and Tom said it was time to rest again., Both were cruelly tired, yet Becky said she thought she could go a little farther., She was surprised to hear Tom dissent., She could not understand it., They sat down, and Tom fastened his candle to the wall in front of them with some clay., Thought was soon busy; nothing was said for some time., Then Becky broke the silence:  ""Tom, I am so hungry!"", Tom took something out of his pocket., ""Do you remember this?"", said he., Becky almost smiled., ""It's our wedding-cake, Tom."", ""Yes--I wish it was as big as a barrel, for it's all we've got."", ""I saved it from the picnic for us to dream on, Tom, the way grown-up people do with wedding-cake--but it'll be our--""  She dropped the sentence where it was., Tom divided the cake and Becky ate with good appetite, while Tom nibbled at his moiety., There was abundance of cold water to finish the feast with., By-and-by Becky suggested that they move on again., Tom was silent a moment., Then he said:  ""Becky, can you bear it if I tell you something?"", Becky's face paled, but she thought she could., ""Well, then, Becky, we must stay here, where there's water to drink., That little piece is our last candle!"", Becky gave loose to tears and wailings., Tom did what he could to comfort her, but with little effect., At length Becky said:  ""Tom!"", ""Well, Becky?"", ""They'll miss us and hunt for us!"", ""Yes, they will!, Certainly they will!"", ""Maybe they're hunting for us now, Tom."", ""Why, I reckon maybe they are., ...]",1
26,"[My head kept humming, ""A blue trip slip for an eight-cent fare, a buff trip slip for a six-cent fare,"" and so on and so on, without peace or respite., The day's work was ruined--I could see that plainly enough., I gave up and drifted down-town, and presently discovered that my feet were keeping time to that relentless jingle., When I could stand it no longer I altered my step., But it did no good; those rhymes accommodated themselves to the new step and went on harassing me just as before., I returned home, and suffered all the afternoon; suffered all through an unconscious and unrefreshing dinner; suffered, and cried, and jingled all through the evening; went to bed and rolled, tossed, and jingled right along, the same as ever; got up at midnight frantic, and tried to read; but there was nothing visible upon the whirling page except ""Punch!, punch in the presence of the passenjare."", By sunrise I was out of my mind, and everybody marveled and was distressed at the idiotic burden of my ravings--""Punch!, oh, punch!, punch in the presence of the passenjare!"", Two days later, on Saturday morning, I arose, a tottering wreck, and went forth to fulfil an engagement with a valued friend, the Rev., Mr.------, to walk to the Talcott Tower, ten miles distant., He stared at me, but asked no questions., We started., Mr.------ talked, talked, talked as is his wont., I said nothing; I heard nothing., At the end of a mile, Mr.------ said  ""Mark, are you sick?, I never saw a man look so haggard and worn and absent-minded., Say something, do!"", Drearily, without enthusiasm, I said: ""Punch brothers, punch with care!, Punch in the presence of the passenjare!"", My friend eyed me blankly, looked perplexed, they said:  ""I do not think I get your drift, Mark., Then does not seem to be any relevancy in what you have said, certainly nothing sad; and yet--maybe it was the way you said the words--I never heard anything that sounded so pathetic., What is--""  But I heard no more., I was already far away with my pitiless, heartbreaking ""blue trip slip for an eight-cent fare, buff trip slip for a six-cent fare, pink trip slip for a three-cent fare; punch in the presence of the passenjare."", I do not know what occurred during the other nine miles., However, all of a sudden Mr.------ laid his hand on my shoulder and shouted:  ""Oh, wake up!, wake up!, wake up!, Don't sleep all day!, Here we are at the Tower, man!, I have talked myself deaf and dumb and blind, and never got a response., Just look at this magnificent autumn landscape!, Look at it!, look at it!, Feast your eye on it!, You have traveled; you have seen boaster landscapes elsewhere., Come, now, deliver an honest opinion., What do you say to this?"", I sighed wearily; and murmured:  ""A buff trip slip for a six-cent fare, a pink trip slip for a three-cent fare, punch in the presence of the passenjare."", Rev., Mr. ------ stood there, very grave, full of concern, apparently, and looked long at me; then he said:  ""Mark, there is something about this that I cannot understand., Those are about the same words you said before; there does not seem to be anything in them, and yet they nearly break my heart when you say them., Punch in the--how is it they go?"", I began at the beginning and repeated all the lines., My friend's face lighted with interest., He said:  ""Why, what a captivating jingle it is!, It is almost music., It flows along so nicely., I have nearly caught the rhymes myself., Say them over just once more, and then I'll have them, sure."", I said them over., Then Mr. ------ said them., He made one little mistake, which I corrected., The next time and the next he got them right., Now a great burden seemed to tumble from my shoulders., That torturing jingle departed out of my brain, and a grateful sense of rest and peace descended upon me., I was light-hearted enough to sing; and I did sing for half an hour, straight along, as we went jogging homeward., Then my freed tongue found blessed speech again, and the pent talk of many a weary hour began to gush and flow., It flowed on and on, joyously, jubilantly, until the fountain was empty and dry., As I wrung my friend's hand at parting, I said:  ""Haven't we had a royal good time!, But now I remember, you haven't said a word for two hours., Come, come, out with something!"", The Rev., Mr.------ turned a lack-luster eye upon me, drew a deep sigh, and said, without animation, without apparent consciousness:  ""Punch, brothers, punch with care!, Punch in the presence of the passenjare!"", A pang shot through me as I said to myself, ""Poor fellow, poor fellow!, he has got it, now."", I did not see Mr.------ for two or three days after that., Then, on Tuesday evening, he staggered into my presence and sank dejectedly into a seat., He was pale, worn; he was a wreck., He lifted his faded eyes to my face and said:  ""Ah, Mark, it was a ruinous investment that I made in those heartless rhymes., They have ridden me like a nightmare, day and night, hour after hour, to this very moment., Since I saw you I have suffered the torments of the lost., Saturday evening I had a sudden call, by telegraph, and took the night train for Boston., The occasion was the death of a valued old friend who had requested that I should preach his funeral sermon., I took my seat in the cars and set myself to framing the discourse., But I never got beyond the opening paragraph; for then the train started and the car-wheels began their 'clack, clack-clack-clack-clack!, clack-clack!, --clack-clack-clack!', and right away those odious rhymes fitted themselves to that accompaniment., For an hour I sat there and set a syllable of those rhymes to every separate and distinct clack the car-wheels made., Why, I was as fagged out, then, as if I had been chopping wood all day., My skull was splitting with headache., It seemed to me that I must go mad if I sat there any longer; so I undressed and went to bed., I stretched myself out in my berth, and--well, you know what the result was., The thing went right along, just the same., 'Clack-clack clack, a blue trip slip, clack-clack-clack, for an eight cent fare; clack-clack-clack, a buff trip slip, clack clack-clack, for a six-cent fare, and so on, and so on, and so on punch in the presence of the passenjare!', Sleep?, Not a single wink!, I was almost a lunatic when I got to Boston., Don't ask me about the funeral., I did the best I could, but every solemn individual sentence was meshed and tangled and woven in and out with 'Punch, brothers, punch with care, punch in the presence of the passenjare.', And the most distressing thing was that my delivery dropped into the undulating rhythm of those pulsing rhymes, and I could actually catch absent-minded people nodding time to the swing of it with their stupid heads., And, Mark, you may believe it or not, but before I got through the entire assemblage were placidly bobbing their heads in solemn unison, mourners, undertaker, and all., The moment I had finished, I fled to the anteroom in a state bordering on frenzy., Of course it would be my luck to find a sorrowing and aged maiden aunt of the deceased there, who had arrived from Springfield too late to get into the church., She began to sob, and said:  ""'Oh, oh, he is gone, he is gone, and I didn't see him before he died!', ""'Yes!', I said, 'he is gone, he is gone, he is gone--oh, will this suffering never cease!', ...]",1
27,"[In that instant that far-off raft appeared for a second against the red disk, its needlelike oar and diminutive signal cut sharp and black against the bright surface, and in the next instant was thrust away into the dusk again., But that ship, that captain, and that pregnant instant had had their work appointed for them in the dawn of time and could not fail of the performance., The chronometer of God never errs!"", There was deep, thoughtful silence for some moments., Then the grave, pale young man said:  ""What is the chronometer of God?"", II  At dinner, six o'clock, the same people assembled whom we had talked with on deck and seen at luncheon and breakfast this second day out, and at dinner the evening before., That is to say, three journeying ship-masters, a Boston merchant, and a returning Bermudian who had been absent from his Bermuda thirteen years; these sat on the starboard side., On the port side sat the Reverend in the seat of honor; the pale young man next to him; I next; next to me an aged Bermudian, returning to his sunny islands after an absence of twenty-seven years., Of course, our captain was at the head of the table, the purser at the foot of it., A small company, but small companies are pleasantest., No racks upon the table; the sky cloudless, the sun brilliant, the blue sea scarcely ruffled; then what had become of the four married couples, the three bachelors, and the active and obliging doctor from the rural districts of Pennsylvania?--for all these were on deck when we sailed down New York harbor., This is the explanation., I quote from my note-book:       Thursday, 3.30 P.M., Under way, passing the Battery., The large      party, of four married couples, three bachelors, and a cheery,      exhilarating doctor from the wilds of Pennsylvania, are evidently      traveling together., All but the doctor grouped in camp-chairs on      deck., Passing principal fort., The doctor is one of those people who has      an infallible preventive of seasickness; is flitting from friend to      friend administering it and saying, ""Don't you be afraid; I know      this medicine; absolutely infallible; prepared under my own      supervision."", Takes a dose himself, intrepidly., 4.15 P.M.  Two of those ladies have struck their colors,      notwithstanding the ""infallible."", They have gone below., The other      two begin to show distress., 5 P.M.  Exit one husband and one bachelor., These still had their      infallible in cargo when they started, but arrived at the      companionway without it., 5.10., Lady No., 3, two bachelors, and one married man have gone      below with their own opinion of the infallible., 5.20., Passing Quarantine Hulk., The infallible has done the      business for all the party except the Scotchman's wife and the      author of that formidable remedy., Nearing the Light-Ship., Exit the Scotchman's wife, head drooped on      stewardess's shoulder., Entering the open sea., Exit doctor!, The rout seems permanent; hence the smallness of the company at table since the voyage began., Our captain is a grave, handsome Hercules of thirty-five, with a brown hand of such majestic size that one cannot eat for admiring it and wondering if a single kid or calf could furnish material for gloving it., Conversation not general; drones along between couples., One catches a sentence here and there., Like this, from Bermudian of thirteen years' absence: ""It is the nature of women to ask trivial, irrelevant, and pursuing questions--questions that pursue you from a beginning in nothing to a run-to-cover in nowhere."", Reply of Bermudian of twenty-seven years' absence:  ""Yes; and to think they have logical, analytical minds and argumentative ability., You see 'em begin to whet up whenever they smell argument in the air."", Plainly these be philosophers., Twice since we left port our engines have stopped for a couple of minutes at a time., Now they stop again., Says the pale young man, meditatively, ""There!--that engineer is sitting down to rest again."", Grave stare from the captain, whose mighty jaws cease to work, and whose harpooned potato stops in midair on its way to his open, paralyzed mouth., Presently he says in measured tones, ""Is it your idea that the engineer of this ship propels her by a crank turned by his own hands?"", The pale young man studies over this a moment, then lifts up his guileless eyes, and says, ""Don't he?"", Thus gently falls the death-blow to further conversation, and the dinner drags to its close in a reflective silence, disturbed by no sounds but the murmurous wash of the sea and the subdued clash of teeth., After a smoke and a promenade on deck, where is no motion to discompose our steps, we think of a game of whist., We ask the brisk and capable stewardess from Ireland if there are any cards in the ship., ""Bless your soul, dear, indeed there is., Not a whole pack, true for ye, but not enough missing to signify."", However, I happened by accident to bethink me of a new pack in a morocco case, in my trunk, which I had placed there by mistake, thinking it to be a flask of something., So a party of us conquered the tedium of the evening with a few games and were ready for bed at six bells, mariner's time, the signal for putting out the lights., There was much chat in the smoking-cabin on the upper deck after luncheon to-day, mostly whaler yarns from those old sea-captains., Captain Tom Bowling was garrulous., He had that garrulous attention to minor detail which is born of secluded farm life or life at sea on long voyages, where there is little to do and time no object., He would sail along till he was right in the most exciting part of a yarn, and then say, ""Well, as I was saying, the rudder was fouled, ship driving before the gale, head-on, straight for the iceberg, all hands holding their breath, turned to stone, top-hamper giving 'way, sails blown to ribbons, first one stick going, then another, boom!, smash!, crash!, duck your head and stand from under!, when up comes Johnny Rogers, capstan-bar in hand, eyes a-blazing, hair a-flying ., ., ., no, 'twa'n't Johnny Rogers., ., ., lemme see ., ., seems to me Johnny Rogers wa'n't along that voyage; he was along one voyage, I know that mighty well, but somehow it seems to me that he signed the articles for this voyage, but--but--whether he come along or not, or got left, or something happened--""  And so on and so on till the excitement all cooled down and nobody cared whether the ship struck the iceberg or not., In the course of his talk he rambled into a criticism upon New England degrees of merit in ship building., Said he, ""You get a vessel built away down Maine-way; Bath, for instance; what's the result?, First thing you do, you want to heave her down for repairs--that's the result!, Well, sir, she hain't been hove down a week till you can heave a dog through her seams., You send that vessel to sea, and what's the result?, She wets her oakum the first trip!, Leave it to any man if 'tain't so., Well, you let our folks build you a vessel--down New Bedford-way., What's the result?, Well, sir, you might take that ship and heave her down, and keep her hove down six months, and she'll never shed a tear!"", Everybody, landsmen and all, recognized the descriptive neatness of that figure, and applauded, which greatly pleased the old man., A moment later, the meek eyes of the pale young fellow heretofore mentioned came up slowly, rested upon the old man's face a moment, and the meek mouth began to open., ""Shet your head!"", shouted the old mariner., It was a rather startling surprise to everybody, but it was effective in the matter of its purpose., So the conversation flowed on instead of perishing., There was some talk about the perils of the sea, and a landsman delivered himself of the customary nonsense about the poor mariner wandering in far oceans, tempest-tossed, pursued by dangers, every storm-blast and thunderbolt in the home skies moving the friends by snug firesides to compassion for that poor mariner, and prayers for his succor., Captain Bowling put up with this for a while, and then burst out with a new view of the matter., ""Come, belay there!, I have read this kind of rot all my life in poetry and tales and such-like rubbage., Pity for the poor mariner!, sympathy for the poor mariner!, All right enough, but not in the way the poetry puts it., Pity for the mariner's wife!, all right again, but not in the way the poetry puts it., Look-a here!, whose life's the safest in the whole world The poor mariner's., You look at the statistics, you'll see., So don't you fool away any sympathy on the poor mariner's dangers and privations and sufferings., ...]",1
28,"[Well, a cat does--but you let a cat get excited once; you let a cat get to pulling fur with another cat on a shed, nights, and you'll hear grammar that will give you the lockjaw., Ignorant people think it's the NOISE which fighting cats make that is so aggravating, but it ain't so; it's the sickening grammar they use., Now I've never heard a jay use bad grammar but very seldom; and when they do, they are as ashamed as a human; they shut right down and leave., ""You may call a jay a bird., Well, so he is, in a measure --but he's got feathers on him, and don't belong to no church, perhaps; but otherwise he is just as much human as you be., And I'll tell you for why., A jay's gifts, and instincts, and feelings, and interests, cover the whole ground., A jay hasn't got any more principle than a Congressman., A jay will lie, a jay will steal, a jay will deceive, a jay will betray; and four times out of five, a jay will go back on his solemnest promise., The sacredness of an obligation is such a thing which you can't cram into no bluejay's head., Now, on top of all this, there's another thing; a jay can out-swear any gentleman in the mines., You think a cat can swear., Well, a cat can; but you give a bluejay a subject that calls for his reserve-powers, and where is your cat?, Don't talk to ME--I know too much about this thing; in the one little particular of scolding--just good, clean, out-and-out scolding --a bluejay can lay over anything, human or divine., Yes, sir, a jay is everything that a man is., A jay can cry, a jay can laugh, a jay can feel shame, a jay can reason and plan and discuss, a jay likes gossip and scandal, a jay has got a sense of humor, a jay knows when he is an ass just as well as you do--maybe better., If a jay ain't human, he better take in his sign, that's all., Now I'm going to tell you a perfectly true fact about some bluejays."", ""When I first begun to understand jay language correctly, there was a little incident happened here., Seven years ago, the last man in this region but me moved away., There stands his house--been empty ever since; a log house, with a plank roof--just one big room, and no more; no ceiling--nothing between the rafters and the floor., Well, one Sunday morning I was sitting out here in front of my cabin, with my cat, taking the sun, and looking at the blue hills, and listening to the leaves rustling so lonely in the trees, and thinking of the home away yonder in the states, that I hadn't heard from in thirteen years, when a bluejay lit on that house, with an acorn in his mouth, and says, 'Hello, I reckon I've struck something.', When he spoke, the acorn dropped out of his mouth and rolled down the roof, of course, but he didn't care; his mind was all on the thing he had struck., It was a knot-hole in the roof., He cocked his head to one side, shut one eye and put the other one to the hole, like a possum looking down a jug; then he glanced up with his bright eyes, gave a wink or two with his wings--which signifies gratification, you understand--and says, 'It looks like a hole, it's located like a hole--blamed if I don't believe it IS a hole!', ""Then he cocked his head down and took another look; he glances up perfectly joyful, this time; winks his wings and his tail both, and says, 'Oh, no, this ain't no fat thing, I reckon!, If I ain't in luck!, --Why it's a perfectly elegant hole!', So he flew down and got that acorn, and fetched it up and dropped it in, and was just tilting his head back, with the heavenliest smile on his face, when all of a sudden he was paralyzed into a listening attitude and that smile faded gradually out of his countenance like breath off'n a razor, and the queerest look of surprise took its place., Then he says, 'Why, I didn't hear it fall!', He cocked his eye at the hole again, and took a long look; raised up and shook his head; stepped around to the other side of the hole and took another look from that side; shook his head again., He studied a while, then he just went into the Details --walked round and round the hole and spied into it from every point of the compass., No use., Now he took a thinking attitude on the comb of the roof and scratched the back of his head with his right foot a minute, and finally says, 'Well, it's too many for ME, that's certain; must be a mighty long hole; however, I ain't got no time to fool around here, I got to ""tend to business""; I reckon it's all right--chance it, anyway.', ""So he flew off and fetched another acorn and dropped it in, and tried to flirt his eye to the hole quick enough to see what become of it, but he was too late., He held his eye there as much as a minute; then he raised up and sighed, and says, 'Confound it, I don't seem to understand this thing, no way; however, I'll tackle her again.', He fetched another acorn, and done his level best to see what become of it, but he couldn't., He says, 'Well, I never struck no such a hole as this before; I'm of the opinion it's a totally new kind of a hole.', Then he begun to get mad., He held in for a spell, walking up and down the comb of the roof and shaking his head and muttering to himself; but his feelings got the upper hand of him, presently, and he broke loose and cussed himself black in the face., I never see a bird take on so about a little thing., When he got through he walks to the hole and looks in again for half a minute; then he says, 'Well, you're a long hole, and a deep hole, and a mighty singular hole altogether--but I've started in to fill you, and I'm damned if I DON'T fill you, if it takes a hundred years!', ""And with that, away he went., You never see a bird work so since you was born., He laid into his work like a nigger, and the way he hove acorns into that hole for about two hours and a half was one of the most exciting and astonishing spectacles I ever struck., He never stopped to take a look anymore--he just hove 'em in and went for more., Well, at last he could hardly flop his wings, he was so tuckered out., He comes a-dropping down, once more, sweating like an ice-pitcher, dropped his acorn in and says, 'NOW I guess I've got the bulge on you by this time!', So he bent down for a look., If you'll believe me, when his head come up again he was just pale with rage., He says, 'I've shoveled acorns enough in there to keep the family thirty years, and if I can see a sign of one of 'em I wish I may land in a museum with a belly full of sawdust in two minutes!', ""He just had strength enough to crawl up on to the comb and lean his back agin the chimbly, and then he collected his impressions and begun to free his mind., I see in a second that what I had mistook for profanity in the mines was only just the rudiments, as you may say., ""Another jay was going by, and heard him doing his devotions, and stops to inquire what was up., The sufferer told him the whole circumstance, and says, 'Now yonder's the hole, and if you don't believe me, go and look for yourself.', So this fellow went and looked, and comes back and says, 'How many did you say you put in there?', 'Not any less than two tons,' says the sufferer., The other jay went and looked again., He couldn't seem to make it out, so he raised a yell, and three more jays come., They all examined the hole, they all made the sufferer tell it over again, then they all discussed it, and got off as many leather-headed opinions about it as an average crowd of humans could have done., ""They called in more jays; then more and more, till pretty soon this whole region 'peared to have a blue flush about it., There must have been five thousand of them; and such another jawing and disputing and ripping and cussing, you never heard., Every jay in the whole lot put his eye to the hole and delivered a more chuckle-headed opinion about the mystery than the jay that went there before him., They examined the house all over, too., The door was standing half open, and at last one old jay happened to go and light on it and look in., Of course, that knocked the mystery galley-west in a second., There lay the acorns, scattered all over the floor.., He flopped his wings and raised a whoop., 'Come here!', he says, 'Come here, everybody; hang'd if this fool hasn't been trying to fill up a house with acorns!', They all came a-swooping down like a blue cloud, and as each fellow lit on the door and took a glance, the whole absurdity of the contract that that first jay had tackled hit him home and he fell over backward suffocating with laughter, and the next jay took his place and done the same., ""Well, sir, they roosted around here on the housetop and the trees for an hour, and guffawed over that thing like human beings., It ain't any use to tell me a bluejay hasn't got a sense of humor, because I know better., And memory, too., They brought jays here from all over the United States to look down that hole, every summer for three years., Other birds, too., And they could all see the point except an owl that come from Nova Scotia to visit the Yo Semite, and he took this thing in on his way back., He said he couldn't see anything funny in it., But then he was a good deal disappointed about Yo Semite, too."", The summer semester was in full tide; consequently the most frequent figure in and about Heidelberg was the student., Most of the students were Germans, of course, but the representatives of foreign lands were very numerous., They hailed from every corner of the globe--for instruction is cheap in Heidelberg, and so is living, too., The Anglo-American Club, composed of British and American students, had twenty-five members, and there was still much material left to draw from., Nine-tenths of the Heidelberg students wore no badge or uniform; the other tenth wore caps of various colors, and belonged to social organizations called ""corps."", There were five corps, each with a color of its own; there were white caps, blue caps, and red, yellow, and green ones., The famous duel-fighting is confined to the ""corps"" boys., The ""KNEIP"" seems to be a specialty of theirs, too., Kneips are held, now and then, to celebrate great occasions, like the election of a beer king, for instance., The solemnity is simple; the five corps assemble at night, and at a signal they all fall loading themselves with beer, out of pint-mugs, as fast as possible, and each man keeps his own count--usually by laying aside a lucifer match for each mud he empties., The election is soon decided., When the candidates can hold no more, a count is instituted and the one who has drank the greatest number of pints is proclaimed king., I was told that the last beer king elected by the corps--or by his own capabilities--emptied his mug seventy-five times., No stomach could hold all that quantity at one time, of course--but there are ways of frequently creating a vacuum, which those who have been much at sea will understand., One sees so many students abroad at all hours, that he presently begins to wonder if they ever have any working-hours., Some of them have, some of them haven't., Each can choose for himself whether he will work or play; for German university life is a very free life; it seems to have no restraints., The student does not live in the college buildings, but hires his own lodgings, in any locality he prefers, and he takes his meals when and where he pleases., He goes to bed when it suits him, and does not get up at all unless he wants to., He is not entered at the university for any particular length of time; so he is likely to change about., He passes no examinations upon entering college., ...]",1
29,"[In the chancel was a twisted stone column, and the captain told us a legend about it, of course, for in the matter of legends he could not seem to restrain himself; but I do not repeat his tale because there was nothing plausible about it except that the Hero wrenched this column into its present screw-shape with his hands --just one single wrench., All the rest of the legend was doubtful., But Hirschhorn is best seen from a distance, down the river., Then the clustered brown towers perched on the green hilltop, and the old battlemented stone wall, stretching up and over the grassy ridge and disappearing in the leafy sea beyond, make a picture whose grace and beauty entirely satisfy the eye., We descended from the church by steep stone stairways which curved this way and that down narrow alleys between the packed and dirty tenements of the village., It was a quarter well stocked with deformed, leering, unkempt and uncombed idiots, who held out hands or caps and begged piteously., The people of the quarter were not all idiots, of course, but all that begged seemed to be, and were said to be., I was thinking of going by skiff to the next town, Necharsteinach; so I ran to the riverside in advance of the party and asked a man there if he had a boat to hire., I suppose I must have spoken High German--Court German--I intended it for that, anyway--so he did not understand me., I turned and twisted my question around and about, trying to strike that man's average, but failed., He could not make out what I wanted., Now Mr. X arrived, faced this same man, looked him in the eye, and emptied this sentence on him, in the most glib and confident way: ""Can man boat get here?"", The mariner promptly understood and promptly answered., I can comprehend why he was able to understand that particular sentence, because by mere accident all the words in it except ""get"" have the same sound and the same meaning in German that they have in English; but how he managed to understand Mr. X's next remark puzzled me., I will insert it, presently., X turned away a moment, and I asked the mariner if he could not find a board, and so construct an additional seat., I spoke in the purest German, but I might as well have spoken in the purest Choctaw for all the good it did., The man tried his best to understand me; he tried, and kept on trying, harder and harder, until I saw it was really of no use, and said:  ""There, don't strain yourself--it is of no consequence."", Then X turned to him and crisply said:  ""MACHEN SIE a flat board."", I wish my epitaph may tell the truth about me if the man did not answer up at once, and say he would go and borrow a board as soon as he had lit the pipe which he was filling., We changed our mind about taking a boat, so we did not have to go., I have given Mr. X's two remarks just as he made them., Four of the five words in the first one were English, and that they were also German was only accidental, not intentional; three out of the five words in the second remark were English, and English only, and the two German ones did not mean anything in particular, in such a connection., X always spoke English to Germans, but his plan was to turn the sentence wrong end first and upside down, according to German construction, and sprinkle in a German word without any essential meaning to it, here and there, by way of flavor., Yet he always made himself understood., He could make those dialect-speaking raftsmen understand him, sometimes, when even young Z had failed with them; and young Z was a pretty good German scholar., For one thing, X always spoke with such confidence--perhaps that helped., And possibly the raftsmen's dialect was what is called PLATT-DEUTSCH, and so they found his English more familiar to their ears than another man's German., Quite indifferent students of German can read Fritz Reuter's charming platt-Deutch tales with some little facility because many of the words are English., I suppose this is the tongue which our Saxon ancestors carried to England with them., By and by I will inquire of some other philologist., However, in the mean time it had transpired that the men employed to calk the raft had found that the leak was not a leak at all, but only a crack between the logs--a crack that belonged there, and was not dangerous, but had been magnified into a leak by the disordered imagination of the mate., Therefore we went aboard again with a good degree of confidence, and presently got to sea without accident., As we swam smoothly along between the enchanting shores, we fell to swapping notes about manners and customs in Germany and elsewhere., As I write, now, many months later, I perceive that each of us, by observing and noting and inquiring, diligently and day by day, had managed to lay in a most varied and opulent stock of misinformation., But this is not surprising; it is very difficult to get accurate details in any country., For example, I had the idea once, in Heidelberg, to find out all about those five student-corps., I started with the White Cap corps., I began to inquire of this and that and the other citizen, and here is what I found out:  1., It is called the Prussian Corps, because none but Prussians are admitted to it., 2., It is called the Prussian Corps for no particular reason., It has simply pleased each corps to name itself after some German state., 3., It is not named the Prussian Corps at all, but only the White Cap Corps., 4., Any student can belong to it who is a German by birth., 5., Any student can belong to it who is European by birth., 6., Any European-born student can belong to it, except he be a Frenchman., 7., Any student can belong to it, no matter where he was born., 8., No student can belong to it who is not of noble blood., 9., No student can belong to it who cannot show three full generations of noble descent., 10., Nobility is not a necessary qualification., 11., No moneyless student can belong to it., 12., Money qualification is nonsense--such a thing has never been thought of., I got some of this information from students themselves --students who did not belong to the corps., I finally went to headquarters--to the White Caps--where I would have gone in the first place if I had been acquainted., But even at headquarters I found difficulties; I perceived that there were things about the White Cap Corps which one member knew and another one didn't., It was natural; for very few members of any organization know ALL that can be known about it., I doubt there is a man or a woman in Heidelberg who would not answer promptly and confidently three out of every five questions about the White Cap Corps which a stranger might ask; yet it is a very safe bet that two of the three answers would be incorrect every time., There is one German custom which is universal--the bowing courteously to strangers when sitting down at table or rising up from it., This bow startles a stranger out of his self-possession, the first time it occurs, and he is likely to fall over a chair or something, in his embarrassment, but it pleases him, nevertheless., One soon learns to expect this bow and be on the lookout and ready to return it; but to learn to lead off and make the initial bow one's self is a difficult matter for a diffident man., One thinks, ""If I rise to go, and tender my box, and these ladies and gentlemen take it into their heads to ignore the custom of their nation, and not return it, how shall I feel, in case I survive to feel anything."", Therefore he is afraid to venture., He sits out the dinner, and makes the strangers rise first and originate the bowing., A table d'ho^te dinner is a tedious affair for a man who seldom touches anything after the three first courses; therefore I used to do some pretty dreary waiting because of my fears., It took me months to assure myself that those fears were groundless, but I did assure myself at last by experimenting diligently through my agent., I made Harris get up and bow and leave; invariably his bow was returned, then I got up and bowed myself and retired., Thus my education proceeded easily and comfortably for me, but not for Harris., Three courses of a table d'ho^te dinner were enough for me, but Harris preferred thirteen., Even after I had acquired full confidence, and no longer needed the agent's help, I sometimes encountered difficulties., Once at Baden-Baden I nearly lost a train because I could not be sure that three young ladies opposite me at table were Germans, since I had not heard them speak; they might be American, they might be English, it was not safe to venture a bow; but just as I had got that far with my thought, one of them began a German remark, to my great relief and gratitude; and before she got out her third word, our bows had been delivered and graciously returned, and we were off., There is a friendly something about the German character which is very winning., When Harris and I were making a pedestrian tour through the Black Forest, we stopped at a little country inn for dinner one day; two young ladies and a young gentleman entered and sat down opposite us., They were pedestrians, too., Our knapsacks were strapped upon our backs, but they had a sturdy youth along to carry theirs for them., All parties were hungry, so there was no talking., By and by the usual bows were exchanged, and we separated., As we sat at a late breakfast in the hotel at Allerheiligen, next morning, these young people and took places near us without observing us; but presently they saw us and at once bowed and smiled; not ceremoniously, but with the gratified look of people who have found acquaintances where they were expecting strangers., Then they spoke of the weather and the roads., We also spoke of the weather and the roads., Next, they said they had had an enjoyable walk, notwithstanding the weather., We said that that had been our case, too., Then they said they had walked thirty English miles the day before, and asked how many we had walked., I could not lie, so I told Harris to do it., Harris told them we had made thirty English miles, too., That was true; we had ""made"" them, though we had had a little assistance here and there., After breakfast they found us trying to blast some information out of the dumb hotel clerk about routes, and observing that we were not succeeding pretty well, they went and got their maps and things, and pointed out and explained our course so clearly that even a New York detective could have followed it., And when we started they spoke out a hearty good-by and wished us a pleasant journey., Perhaps they were more generous with us than they might have been with native wayfarers because we were a forlorn lot and in a strange land; I don't know; I only know it was lovely to be treated so., Very well, I took an American young lady to one of the fine balls in Baden-Baden, one night, and at the entrance-door upstairs we were halted by an official--something about Miss Jones's dress was not according to rule;

31,"[One must have a silk veil, to protect his face from snow, sleet, hail and gale, and colored goggles to protect his eyes from that dangerous enemy, snow-blindness., Finally, there must be some porters, to carry provisions, wine and scientific instruments, and also blanket bags for the party to sleep in., I closed my readings with a fearful adventure which Mr. Whymper once had on the Matterhorn when he was prowling around alone, five thousand feet above the town of Breil., He was edging his way gingerly around the corner of a precipice where the upper edge of a sharp declivity of ice-glazed snow joined it., This declivity swept down a couple of hundred feet, into a gully which curved around and ended at a precipice eight hundred feet high, overlooking a glacier., His foot slipped, and he fell., He says:  ""My knapsack brought my head down first, and I pitched into some rocks about a dozen feet below; they caught something, and tumbled me off the edge, head over heels, into the gully; the baton was dashed from my hands, and I whirled downward in a series of bounds, each longer than the last; now over ice, now into rocks, striking my head four or five times, each time with increased force., The last bound sent me spinning through the air in a leap of fifty or sixty feet, from one side of the gully to the other, and I struck the rocks, luckily, with the whole of my left side., They caught my clothes for a moment, and I fell back on to the snow with motion arrested., My head fortunately came the right side up, and a few frantic catches brought me to a halt, in the neck of the gully and on the verge of the precipice., Baton, hat, and veil skimmed by and disappeared, and the crash of the rocks--which I had started--as they fell on to the glacier, told how narrow had been the escape from utter destruction., As it was, I fell nearly two hundred feet in seven or eight bounds., Ten feet more would have taken me in one gigantic leaps of eight hundred feet on to the glacier below., ""The situation was sufficiently serious., The rocks could not be let go for a moment, and the blood was spurting out of more than twenty cuts., The most serious ones were in the head, and I vainly tried to close them with one hand, while holding on with the other., It was useless; the blood gushed out in blinding jets at each pulsation., At last, in a moment of inspiration, I kicked out a big lump of snow and struck it as plaster on my head., The idea was a happy one, and the flow of blood diminished., Then, scrambling up, I got, not a moment too soon, to a place of safety, and fainted away., The sun was setting when consciousness returned, and it was pitch-dark before the Great Staircase was descended; but by a combination of luck and care, the whole four thousand seven hundred feet of descent to Breil was accomplished without a slip, or once missing the way."", His wounds kept him abed some days., Then he got up and climbed that mountain again., That is the way with a true Alp-climber; the more fun he has, the more he wants., After I had finished my readings, I was no longer myself; I was tranced, uplifted, intoxicated, by the almost incredible perils and adventures I had been following my authors through, and the triumphs I had been sharing with them., I sat silent some time, then turned to Harris and said:  ""My mind is made up."", Something in my tone struck him: and when he glanced at my eye and read what was written there, his face paled perceptibly., He hesitated a moment, then said:  ""Speak."", I answered, with perfect calmness:  ""I will ascend the Riffelberg."", If I had shot my poor friend he could not have fallen from his chair more suddenly., If I had been his father he could not have pleaded harder to get me to give up my purpose., But I turned a deaf ear to all he said., When he perceived at last that nothing could alter my determination, he ceased to urge, and for a while the deep silence was broken only by his sobs., I sat in marble resolution, with my eyes fixed upon vacancy, for in spirit I was already wrestling with the perils of the mountains, and my friend sat gazing at me in adoring admiration through his tears., At last he threw himself upon me in a loving embrace and exclaimed in broken tones:  ""Your Harris will never desert you., We will die together."", I cheered the noble fellow with praises, and soon his fears were forgotten and he was eager for the adventure., He wanted to summon the guides at once and leave at two in the morning, as he supposed the custom was; but I explained that nobody was looking at that hour; and that the start in the dark was not usually made from the village but from the first night's resting-place on the mountain side., I said we would leave the village at 3 or 4 P.M. on the morrow; meantime he could notify the guides, and also let the public know of the attempt which we proposed to make., I went to bed, but not to sleep., No man can sleep when he is about to undertake one of these Alpine exploits., I tossed feverishly all night long, and was glad enough when I heard the clock strike half past eleven and knew it was time to get up for dinner., I rose, jaded and rusty, and went to the noon meal, where I found myself the center of interest and curiosity; for the news was already abroad., It is not easy to eat calmly when you are a lion; but it is very pleasant, nevertheless., As usual, at Zermatt, when a great ascent is about to be undertaken, everybody, native and foreign, laid aside his own projects and took up a good position to observe the start., The expedition consisted of 198 persons, including the mules; or 205, including the cows., As follows:  CHIEFS OF SERVICE SUBORDINATES  Myself 1 Veterinary Surgeon Mr. Harris 1 Butler 17 Guides 12 Waiters 4 Surgeons 1 Footman 1 Geologist 1 Barber 1 Botanist 1 Head Cook 3 Chaplains 9 Assistants 15 Barkeepers 1 Confectionery Artist 1 Latinist  TRANSPORTATION, ETC., 27 Porters 3 Coarse Washers and Ironers 44 Mules 1 Fine ditto 44 Muleteers 7 Cows 2 Milkers  Total, 154 men, 51 animals., Grand Total, 205., RATIONS, ETC., APPARATUS  16 Cases Hams 25 Spring Mattresses 2 Barrels Flour 2 Hair ditto 22 Barrels Whiskey Bedding for same 1 Barrel Sugar 2 Mosquito-nets 1 Keg Lemons 29 Tents 2,000 Cigars Scientific Instruments 1 Barrel Pies 97 Ice-axes 1 Ton of Pemmican 5 Cases Dynamite 143 Pair Crutches 7 Cans Nitroglycerin 2 Barrels Arnica 22 40-foot Ladders 1 Bale of Lint 2 Miles of Rope 27 Kegs Paregoric 154 Umbrellas  It was full four o'clock in the afternoon before my cavalcade was entirely ready., At that hour it began to move., In point of numbers and spectacular effect, it was the most imposing expedition that had ever marched from Zermatt., I commanded the chief guide to arrange the men and animals in single file, twelve feet apart, and lash them all together on a strong rope., He objected that the first two miles was a dead level, with plenty of room, and that the rope was never used except in very dangerous places., But I would not listen to that., My reading had taught me that many serious accidents had happened in the Alps simply from not having the people tied up soon enough; I was not going to add one to the list., The guide then obeyed my order., When the procession stood at ease, roped together, and ready to move, I never saw a finer sight., It was 3,122 feet long--over half a mile; every man and me was on foot, and had on his green veil and his blue goggles, and his white rag around his hat, and his coil of rope over one shoulder and under the other, and his ice-ax in his belt, and carried his alpenstock in his left hand, his umbrella (closed) in his right, and his crutches slung at his back., The burdens of the pack-mules and the horns of the cows were decked with the Edelweiss and the Alpine rose., I and my agent were the only persons mounted., We were in the post of danger in the extreme rear, and tied securely to five guides apiece., Our armor-bearers carried our ice-axes, alpenstocks, and other implements for us., We were mounted upon very small donkeys, as a measure of safety; in time of peril we could straighten our legs and stand up, and let the donkey walk from under., Still, I cannot recommend this sort of animal--at least for excursions of mere pleasure--because his ears interrupt the view., I and my agent possessed the regulation mountaineering costumes, but concluded to leave them behind., Out of respect for the great numbers of tourists of both sexes who would be assembled in front of the hotels to see us pass, and also out of respect for the many tourists whom we expected to encounter on our expedition, we decided to make the ascent in evening dress., We watered the caravan at the cold stream which rushes down a trough near the end of the village, and soon afterward left the haunts of civilization behind us., About half past five o'clock we arrived at a bridge which spans the Visp, and after throwing over a detachment to see if it was safe, the caravan crossed without accident., The way now led, by a gentle ascent, carpeted with fresh green grass, to the church at Winkelmatten., Without stopping to examine this edifice, I executed a flank movement to the right and crossed the bridge over the Findelenbach, after first testing its strength., Here I deployed to the right again, and presently entered an inviting stretch of meadowland which was unoccupied save by a couple of deserted huts toward the furthest extremity., These meadows offered an excellent camping-place., We pitched our tents, supped, established a proper grade, recorded the events of the day, and then went to bed., We rose at two in the morning and dressed by candle-light., It was a dismal and chilly business., A few stars were shining, but the general heavens were overcast, and the great shaft of the Matterhorn was draped in a cable pall of clouds., The chief guide advised a delay; he said he feared it was going to rain., We waited until nine o'clock, and then got away in tolerably clear weather., Our course led up some terrific steeps, densely wooded with larches and cedars, and traversed by paths which the rains had guttered and which were obstructed by loose stones., To add to the danger and inconvenience, we were constantly meeting returning tourists on foot and horseback, and as constantly being crowded and battered by ascending tourists who were in a hurry and wanted to get by., Our troubles thickened., About the middle of the afternoon the seventeen guides called a halt and held a consultation., After consulting an hour they said their first suspicion remained intact--that is to say, they believed they were lost., I asked if they did not KNOW it?, No, they said, they COULDN'T absolutely know whether they were lost or not, because none of them had ever been in that part of the country before., They had a strong instinct that they were lost, but they had no proofs--except that they did not know where they were., They had met no tourists for some time, and they considered that a suspicious sign., Plainly we were in an ugly fix., The guides were naturally unwilling to go alone and seek a way out of the difficulty; so we all went together., For better security we moved slow and cautiously, for the forest was very dense., We did not move up the mountain, but around it, hoping to strike across the old trail., Toward nightfall, when we were about tired out, we came up against a rock as big as a cottage., This barrier took all the remaining spirit out of the men, and a panic of fear and despair ensued., They moaned and wept, and said they should never see their homes and their dear ones again., Then they began to upbraid me for bringing them upon this fatal expedition., Some even muttered threats against me., Clearly it was no time to show weakness., So I made a speech in which I said that other Alp-climbers had been in as perilous a position as this, and yet by courage and perseverance had escaped., ...]",1
32,"[I was looking in at a window at a very pretty string of beads, suitable for a child., I was only admiring them; I had no use for them; I hardly ever wear beads., The shopwoman came out and offered them to me for thirty-five francs., I said it was cheap, but I did not need them., ""Ah, but monsieur, they are so beautiful!"", I confessed it, but said they were not suitable for one of my age and simplicity of character., She darted in and brought them out and tried to force them into my hands, saying:  ""Ah, but only see how lovely they are!, Surely monsieur will take them; monsieur shall have them for thirty francs., There, I have said it--it is a loss, but one must live."", I dropped my hands, and tried to move her to respect my unprotected situation., But no, she dangled the beads in the sun before my face, exclaiming, ""Ah, monsieur CANNOT resist them!"", She hung them on my coat button, folded her hand resignedly, and said: ""Gone,--and for thirty francs, the lovely things--it is incredible!--but the good God will sanctify the sacrifice to me."", I removed them gently, returned them, and walked away, shaking my head and smiling a smile of silly embarrassment while the passers-by halted to observe., The woman leaned out of her door, shook the beads, and screamed after me:  ""Monsieur shall have them for twenty-eight!"", I shook my head., ""Twenty-seven!, It is a cruel loss, it is ruin --but take them, only take them."", I still retreated, still wagging my head., ""MON DIEU, they shall even go for twenty-six!, There, I have said it., Come!"", I wagged another negative., A nurse and a little English girl had been near me, and were following me, now., The shopwoman ran to the nurse, thrust the beads into her hands, and said:  ""Monsieur shall have them for twenty-five!, Take them to the hotel--he shall send me the money tomorrow --next day--when he likes."", Then to the child: ""When thy father sends me the money, come thou also, my angel, and thou shall have something oh so pretty!"", I was thus providentially saved., The nurse refused the beads squarely and firmly, and that ended the matter., The ""sights"" of Geneva are not numerous., I made one attempt to hunt up the houses once inhabited by those two disagreeable people, Rousseau and Calvin, but I had no success., Then I concluded to go home., I found it was easier to propose to do that than to do it; for that town is a bewildering place., I got lost in a tangle of narrow and crooked streets, and stayed lost for an hour or two., Finally I found a street which looked somewhat familiar, and said to myself, ""Now I am at home, I judge."", But I was wrong; this was ""HELL street."", Presently I found another place which had a familiar look, and said to myself, ""Now I am at home, sure."", It was another error., This was ""PURGATORY street."", After a little I said, ""NOW I've got the right place, anyway ... no, this is 'PARADISE street'; I'm further from home than I was in the beginning."", Those were queer names--Calvin was the author of them, likely., ""Hell"" and ""Purgatory"" fitted those two streets like a glove, but the ""Paradise"" appeared to be sarcastic., I came out on the lake-front, at last, and then I knew where I was., I was walking along before the glittering jewelry shops when I saw a curious performance., A lady passed by, and a trim dandy lounged across the walk in such an apparently carefully timed way as to bring himself exactly in front of her when she got to him; he made no offer to step out of the way; he did not apologize; he did not even notice her., She had to stop still and let him lounge by., I wondered if he had done that piece of brutality purposely., He strolled to a chair and seated himself at a small table; two or three other males were sitting at similar tables sipping sweetened water., I waited; presently a youth came by, and this fellow got up and served him the same trick., Still, it did not seem possible that any one could do such a thing deliberately., To satisfy my curiosity I went around the block, and, sure enough, as I approached, at a good round speed, he got up and lounged lazily across my path, fouling my course exactly at the right moment to receive all my weight., This proved that his previous performances had not been accidental, but intentional., I saw that dandy's curious game played afterward, in Paris, but not for amusement; not with a motive of any sort, indeed, but simply from a selfish indifference to other people's comfort and rights., One does not see it as frequently in Paris as he might expect to, for there the law says, in effect, ""It is the business of the weak to get out of the way of the strong."", We fine a cabman if he runs over a citizen; Paris fines the citizen for being run over., At least so everybody says--but I saw something which caused me to doubt; I saw a horseman run over an old woman one day--the police arrested him and took him away., That looked as if they meant to punish him., It will not do for me to find merit in American manners --for are they not the standing butt for the jests of critical and polished Europe?, Still, I must venture to claim one little matter of superiority in our manners; a lady may traverse our streets all day, going and coming as she chooses, and she will never be molested by any man; but if a lady, unattended, walks abroad in the streets of London, even at noonday, she will be pretty likely to be accosted and insulted--and not by drunken sailors, but by men who carry the look and wear the dress of gentlemen., It is maintained that these people are not gentlemen, but are a lower sort, disguised as gentlemen., The case of Colonel Valentine Baker obstructs that argument, for a man cannot become an officer in the British army except he hold the rank of gentleman., This person, finding himself alone in a railway compartment with an unprotected girl--but it is an atrocious story, and doubtless the reader remembers it well enough., London must have been more or less accustomed to Bakers, and the ways of Bakers, else London would have been offended and excited., Baker was ""imprisoned""--in a parlor; and he could not have been more visited, or more overwhelmed with attentions, if he had committed six murders and then --while the gallows was preparing--""got religion""--after the manner of the holy Charles Peace, of saintly memory., Arkansaw--it seems a little indelicate to be trumpeting forth our own superiorities, and comparisons are always odious, but still--Arkansaw would certainly have hanged Baker., I do not say she would have tried him first, but she would have hanged him, anyway., Even the most degraded woman can walk our streets unmolested, her sex and her weakness being her sufficient protection., She will encounter less polish than she would in the old world, but she will run across enough humanity to make up for it., The music of a donkey awoke us early in the morning, and we rose up and made ready for a pretty formidable walk--to Italy; but the road was so level that we took the train.. We lost a good deal of time by this, but it was no matter, we were not in a hurry., We were four hours going to Chamb`ery., The Swiss trains go upward of three miles an hour, in places, but they are quite safe., That aged French town of Chamb`ery was as quaint and crooked as Heilbronn., A drowsy reposeful quiet reigned in the back streets which made strolling through them very pleasant, barring the almost unbearable heat of the sun., In one of these streets, which was eight feet wide, gracefully curved, and built up with small antiquated houses, I saw three fat hogs lying asleep, and a boy (also asleep) taking care of them., From queer old-fashioned windows along the curve projected boxes of bright flowers, and over the edge of one of these boxes hung the head and shoulders of a cat--asleep., The five sleeping creatures were the only living things visible in that street., There was not a sound; absolute stillness prevailed., It was Sunday; one is not used to such dreamy Sundays on the continent., In our part of the town it was different that night., A regiment of brown and battered soldiers had arrived home from Algiers, and I judged they got thirsty on the way., They sang and drank till dawn, in the pleasant open air., We left for Turin at ten the next morning by a railway which was profusely decorated with tunnels., We forgot to take a lantern along, consequently we missed all the scenery., Our compartment was full., A ponderous tow-headed Swiss woman, who put on many fine-lady airs, but was evidently more used to washing linen than wearing it, sat in a corner seat and put her legs across into the opposite one, propping them intermediately with her up-ended valise., In the seat thus pirated, sat two Americans, greatly incommoded by that woman's majestic coffin-clad feet., One of them begged, politely, to remove them., She opened her wide eyes and gave him a stare, but answered nothing., By and by he proferred his request again, with great respectfulness., She said, in good English, and in a deeply offended tone, that she had paid her passage and was not going to be bullied out of her ""rights"" by ill-bred foreigners, even if she was alone and unprotected., ""But I have rights, also, madam., My ticket entitles me to a seat, but you are occupying half of it."", ""I will not talk with you, sir., What right have you to speak to me?, I do not know you., One would know you came from a land where there are no gentlemen., No GENTLEMAN would treat a lady as you have treated me."", ""I come from a region where a lady would hardly give me the same provocation."", ""You have insulted me, sir!, You have intimated that I am not a lady--and I hope I am NOT one, after the pattern of your country."", ""I beg that you will give yourself no alarm on that head, madam; but at the same time I must insist--always respectfully--that you let me have my seat."", ...]",1
33,"[Perhaps a four-line sermon in a Saturday paper is the sufficient German equivalent of the eight or ten columns of sermons which the New-Yorkers get in their Monday morning papers., The latest news (two days old) follows the four-line sermon, under the pica headline ""Telegrams""--these are ""telegraphed"" with a pair of scissors out of the AUGSBURGER ZEITUNG of the day before., These telegrams consist of fourteen and two-thirds lines from Berlin, fifteen lines from Vienna, and two and five-eights lines from Calcutta., Thirty-three small-pica lines news in a daily journal in a King's Capital of one hundred and seventy thousand inhabitants is surely not an overdose., Next we have the pica heading, ""News of the Day,"" under which the following facts are set forth: Prince Leopold is going on a visit to Vienna, six lines; Prince Arnulph is coming back from Russia, two lines; the Landtag will meet at ten o'clock in the morning and consider an election law, three lines and one word over; a city government item, five and one-half lines; prices of tickets to the proposed grand Charity Ball, twenty-three lines--for this one item occupies almost one-fourth of the entire first page; there is to be a wonderful Wagner concert in Frankfurt-on-the-Main, with an orchestra of one hundred and eight instruments, seven and one-half lines., That concludes the first page., Eighty-five lines, altogether, on that page, including three headlines., About fifty of those lines, as one perceives, deal with local matters; so the reporters are not overworked., Exactly one-half of the second page is occupied with an opera criticism, fifty-three lines (three of them being headlines), and ""Death Notices,"" ten lines., The other half of the second page is made up of two paragraphs under the head of ""Miscellaneous News."", One of these paragraphs tells about a quarrel between the Czar of Russia and his eldest son, twenty-one and a half lines; and the other tells about the atrocious destruction of a peasant child by its parents, forty lines, or one-fifth of the total of the reading-matter contained in the paper., Consider what a fifth part of the reading-matter of an American daily paper issued in a city of one hundred and seventy thousand inhabitants amounts to!, Think what a mass it is., Would any one suppose I could so snugly tuck away such a mass in a chapter of this book that it would be difficult to find it again in the reader lost his place?, Surely not., I will translate that child-murder word for word, to give the reader a realizing sense of what a fifth part of the reading-matter of a Munich daily actually is when it comes under measurement of the eye:  ""From Oberkreuzberg, January 21st, the DONAU ZEITUNG receives a long account of a crime, which we shortened as follows: In Rametuach, a village near Eppenschlag, lived a young married couple with two children, one of which, a boy aged five, was born three years before the marriage., For this reason, and also because a relative at Iggensbach had bequeathed M400 ($100) to the boy, the heartless father considered him in the way; so the unnatural parents determined to sacrifice him in the cruelest possible manner., They proceeded to starve him slowly to death, meantime frightfully maltreating him--as the village people now make known, when it is too late., The boy was shut in a hole, and when people passed by he cried, and implored them to give him bread., His long-continued tortures and deprivations destroyed him at last, on the third of January., The sudden (sic) death of the child created suspicion, the more so as the body was immediately clothed and laid upon the bier., Therefore the coroner gave notice, and an inquest was held on the 6th., What a pitiful spectacle was disclosed then!, The body was a complete skeleton., The stomach and intestines were utterly empty; they contained nothing whatsoever., The flesh on the corpse was not as thick as the back of a knife, and incisions in it brought not one drop of blood., There was not a piece of sound skin the size of a dollar on the whole body; wounds, scars, bruises, discolored extravasated blood, everywhere--even on the soles of the feet there were wounds., The cruel parents asserted that the boy had been so bad that they had been obliged to use severe punishments, and that he finally fell over a bench and broke his neck., However, they were arrested two weeks after the inquest and put in the prison at Deggendorf."", Yes, they were arrested ""two weeks after the inquest."", What a home sound that has., That kind of police briskness rather more reminds me of my native land than German journalism does., I think a German daily journal doesn't do any good to speak of, but at the same time it doesn't do any harm., That is a very large merit, and should not be lightly weighted nor lightly thought of., The German humorous papers are beautifully printed upon fine paper, and the illustrations are finely drawn, finely engraved, and are not vapidly funny, but deliciously so., So also, generally speaking, are the two or three terse sentences which accompany the pictures., I remember one of these pictures: A most dilapidated tramp is ruefully contemplating some coins which lie in his open palm., He says: ""Well, begging is getting played out., Only about five marks ($1.25) for the whole day; many an official makes more!"", And I call to mind a picture of a commercial traveler who is about to unroll his samples:  MERCHANT (pettishly).--NO, don't., I don't want to buy anything!, DRUMMER.--If you please, I was only going to show you--  MERCHANT.--But I don't wish to see them!, DRUMMER (after a pause, pleadingly).--But do you you mind letting ME look at them!, I haven't seen them for three weeks!, I will set down a tale as it was told to me by one who had it of his father, which latter had it of HIS father, this last having in like manner had it of HIS father--and so on, back and still back, three hundred years and more, the fathers transmitting it to the sons and so preserving it., It may be history, it may be only a legend, a tradition., It may have happened, it may not have happened:  but it COULD have happened., It may be that the wise and the learned believed it in the old days; it may be that only the unlearned and the simple loved it and credited it., In the ancient city of London, on a certain autumn day in the second quarter of the sixteenth century, a boy was born to a poor family of the name of Canty, who did not want him., On the same day another English child was born to a rich family of the name of Tudor, who did want him., All England wanted him too., England had so longed for him, and hoped for him, and prayed God for him, that, now that he was really come, the people went nearly mad for joy., Mere acquaintances hugged and kissed each other and cried., Everybody took a holiday, and high and low, rich and poor, feasted and danced and sang, and got very mellow; and they kept this up for days and nights together., By day, London was a sight to see, with gay banners waving from every balcony and housetop, and splendid pageants marching along., By night, it was again a sight to see, with its great bonfires at every corner, and its troops of revellers making merry around them., There was no talk in all England but of the new baby, Edward Tudor, Prince of Wales, who lay lapped in silks and satins, unconscious of all this fuss, and not knowing that great lords and ladies were tending him and watching over him--and not caring, either., But there was no talk about the other baby, Tom Canty, lapped in his poor rags, except among the family of paupers whom he had just come to trouble with his presence., Let us skip a number of years., London was fifteen hundred years old, and was a great town--for that day., It had a hundred thousand inhabitants--some think double as many., The streets were very narrow, and crooked, and dirty, especially in the part where Tom Canty lived, which was not far from London Bridge., The houses were of wood, with the second story projecting over the first, and the third sticking its elbows out beyond the second., The higher the houses grew, the broader they grew., They were skeletons of strong criss-cross beams, with solid material between, coated with plaster., The beams were painted red or blue or black, according to the owner's taste, and this gave the houses a very picturesque look., The windows were small, glazed with little diamond-shaped panes, and they opened outward, on hinges, like doors., The house which Tom's father lived in was up a foul little pocket called Offal Court, out of Pudding Lane., It was small, decayed, and rickety, but it was packed full of wretchedly poor families., Canty's tribe occupied a room on the third floor., The mother and father had a sort of bedstead in the corner; but Tom, his grandmother, and his two sisters, Bet and Nan, were not restricted--they had all the floor to themselves, and might sleep where they chose., There were the remains of a blanket or two, and some bundles of ancient and dirty straw, but these could not rightly be called beds, for they were not organised; they were kicked into a general pile, mornings, and selections made from the mass at night, for service., Bet and Nan were fifteen years old--twins., They were good-hearted girls, unclean, clothed in rags, and profoundly ignorant., Their mother was like them., But the father and the grandmother were a couple of fiends., They got drunk whenever they could; then they fought each other or anybody else who came in the way; they cursed and swore always, drunk or sober; John Canty was a thief, and his mother a beggar., They made beggars of the children, but failed to make thieves of them., Among, but not of, the dreadful rabble that inhabited the house, was a good old priest whom the King had turned out of house and home with a pension of a few farthings, and he used to get the children aside and teach them right ways secretly., Father Andrew also taught Tom a little Latin, and how to read and write; and would have done the same with the girls, but they were afraid of the jeers of their friends, who could not have endured such a queer accomplishment in them., All Offal Court was just such another hive as Canty's house., Drunkenness, riot and brawling were the order, there, every night and nearly all night long., Broken heads were as common as hunger in that place., Yet little Tom was not unhappy., He had a hard time of it, but did not know it., It was the sort of time that all the Offal Court boys had, therefore he supposed it was the correct and comfortable thing., When he came home empty-handed at night, he knew his father would curse him and thrash him first, and that when he was done the awful grandmother would do it all over again and improve on it; and that away in the night his starving mother would slip to him stealthily with any miserable scrap or crust she had been able to save for him by going hungry herself, notwithstanding she was often caught in that sort of treason and soundly beaten for it by her husband., No, Tom's life went along well enough, especially in summer., He only begged just enough to save himself, for the laws against mendicancy were stringent, and the penalties heavy; so he put in a good deal of his time listening to good Father Andrew's charming old tales and legends about giants and fairies, dwarfs and genii, and enchanted castles, and gorgeous kings and princes., His head grew to be full of these wonderful things, and many a night as he lay in the dark on his scant and offensive straw, tired, hungry, and smarting from a thrashing, he unleashed his imagination and soon forgot his aches and pains in delicious picturings to himself of the charmed life of a petted prince in a regal palace., One desire came in time to haunt him day and night:  it was to see a real prince, with his own eyes., He spoke of it once to some of his Offal Court comrades; but they jeered him and scoffed him so unmercifully that he was glad to keep his dream to himself after that., He often read the priest's old books and got him to explain and enlarge upon them., His dreamings and readings worked certain changes in him, by-and-by., His dream-people were so fine that he grew to lament his shabby clothing and his dirt, and to wish to be clean and better clad., He went on playing in the mud just the same, and enjoying it, too; but, instead of splashing around in the Thames solely for the fun of it, he began to find an added value in it because of the washings and cleansings it afforded., Tom could always find something going on around the Maypole in Cheapside, and at the fairs; and now and then he and the rest of London had a chance to see a military parade when some famous unfortunate was carried prisoner to the Tower, by land or boat., One summer's day he saw poor Anne Askew and three men burned at the stake in Smithfield, and heard an ex-Bishop preach a sermon to them which did not interest him., Yes, Tom's life was varied and pleasant enough, on the whole., By-and-by Tom's reading and dreaming about princely life wrought such a strong effect upon him that he began to ACT the prince, unconsciously., ...]",1
34,"[""No, good your Majesty, my punishment was appointed for this day, and peradventure it may be annulled, as unbefitting the season of mourning that is come upon us; I know not, and so have made bold to come hither and remind your Grace about your gracious promise to intercede in my behalf--""  ""With the master?, To save thee thy whipping?"", ""Ah, thou dost remember!"", ""My memory mendeth, thou seest., Set thy mind at ease--thy back shall go unscathed--I will see to it."", ""Oh, thanks, my good lord!"", cried the boy, dropping upon his knee again., ""Mayhap I have ventured far enow; and yet--""  Seeing Master Humphrey hesitate, Tom encouraged him to go on, saying he was ""in the granting mood."", ""Then will I speak it out, for it lieth near my heart., Sith thou art no more Prince of Wales but King, thou canst order matters as thou wilt, with none to say thee nay; wherefore it is not in reason that thou wilt longer vex thyself with dreary studies, but wilt burn thy books and turn thy mind to things less irksome., Then am I ruined, and mine orphan sisters with me!"", ""Ruined?, Prithee how?"", ""My back is my bread, O my gracious liege!, if it go idle, I starve., An' thou cease from study mine office is gone thou'lt need no whipping-boy., Do not turn me away!"", Tom was touched with this pathetic distress., He said, with a right royal burst of generosity--  ""Discomfort thyself no further, lad., Thine office shall be permanent in thee and thy line for ever."", Then he struck the boy a light blow on the shoulder with the flat of his sword, exclaiming, ""Rise, Humphrey Marlow, Hereditary Grand Whipping-Boy to the Royal House of England!, Banish sorrow--I will betake me to my books again, and study so ill that they must in justice treble thy wage, so mightily shall the business of thine office be augmented."", The grateful Humphrey responded fervidly--  ""Thanks, O most noble master, this princely lavishness doth far surpass my most distempered dreams of fortune., Now shall I be happy all my days, and all the house of Marlow after me."", Tom had wit enough to perceive that here was a lad who could be useful to him., He encouraged Humphrey to talk, and he was nothing loath., He was delighted to believe that he was helping in Tom's 'cure'; for always, as soon as he had finished calling back to Tom's diseased mind the various particulars of his experiences and adventures in the royal school-room and elsewhere about the palace, he noticed that Tom was then able to 'recall' the circumstances quite clearly., At the end of an hour Tom found himself well freighted with very valuable information concerning personages and matters pertaining to the Court; so he resolved to draw instruction from this source daily; and to this end he would give order to admit Humphrey to the royal closet whenever he might come, provided the Majesty of England was not engaged with other people., Humphrey had hardly been dismissed when my Lord Hertford arrived with more trouble for Tom., He said that the Lords of the Council, fearing that some overwrought report of the King's damaged health might have leaked out and got abroad, they deemed it wise and best that his Majesty should begin to dine in public after a day or two--his wholesome complexion and vigorous step, assisted by a carefully guarded repose of manner and ease and grace of demeanour, would more surely quiet the general pulse--in case any evil rumours HAD gone about--than any other scheme that could be devised., Then the Earl proceeded, very delicately, to instruct Tom as to the observances proper to the stately occasion, under the rather thin disguise of 'reminding' him concerning things already known to him; but to his vast gratification it turned out that Tom needed very little help in this line--he had been making use of Humphrey in that direction, for Humphrey had mentioned that within a few days he was to begin to dine in public; having gathered it from the swift-winged gossip of the Court., Tom kept these facts to himself, however., Seeing the royal memory so improved, the Earl ventured to apply a few tests to it, in an apparently casual way, to find out how far its amendment had progressed., The results were happy, here and there, in spots--spots where Humphrey's tracks remained--and on the whole my lord was greatly pleased and encouraged., So encouraged was he, indeed, that he spoke up and said in a quite hopeful voice--  ""Now am I persuaded that if your Majesty will but tax your memory yet a little further, it will resolve the puzzle of the Great Seal--a loss which was of moment yesterday, although of none to-day, since its term of service ended with our late lord's life., May it please your Grace to make the trial?"", Tom was at sea--a Great Seal was something which he was totally unacquainted with., After a moment's hesitation he looked up innocently and asked--  ""What was it like, my lord?"", The Earl started, almost imperceptibly, muttering to himself, ""Alack, his wits are flown again!--it was ill wisdom to lead him on to strain them"" --then he deftly turned the talk to other matters, with the purpose of sweeping the unlucky seal out of Tom's thoughts--a purpose which easily succeeded., The next day the foreign ambassadors came, with their gorgeous trains; and Tom, throned in awful state, received them., The splendours of the scene delighted his eye and fired his imagination at first, but the audience was long and dreary, and so were most of the addresses --wherefore, what began as a pleasure grew into weariness and home-sickness by-and-by., Tom said the words which Hertford put into his mouth from time to time, and tried hard to acquit himself satisfactorily, but he was too new to such things, and too ill at ease to accomplish more than a tolerable success., He looked sufficiently like a king, but he was ill able to feel like one., He was cordially glad when the ceremony was ended., The larger part of his day was 'wasted'--as he termed it, in his own mind--in labours pertaining to his royal office., Even the two hours devoted to certain princely pastimes and recreations were rather a burden to him than otherwise, they were so fettered by restrictions and ceremonious observances., However, he had a private hour with his whipping-boy which he counted clear gain, since he got both entertainment and needful information out of it., The third day of Tom Canty's kingship came and went much as the others had done, but there was a lifting of his cloud in one way--he felt less uncomfortable than at first; he was getting a little used to his circumstances and surroundings; his chains still galled, but not all the time; he found that the presence and homage of the great afflicted and embarrassed him less and less sharply with every hour that drifted over his head., But for one single dread, he could have seen the fourth day approach without serious distress--the dining in public; it was to begin that day., There were greater matters in the programme--for on that day he would have to preside at a council which would take his views and commands concerning the policy to be pursued toward various foreign nations scattered far and near over the great globe; on that day, too, Hertford would be formally chosen to the grand office of Lord Protector; other things of note were appointed for that fourth day, also; but to Tom they were all insignificant compared with the ordeal of dining all by himself with a multitude of curious eyes fastened upon him and a multitude of mouths whispering comments upon his performance,--and upon his mistakes, if he should be so unlucky as to make any., Still, nothing could stop that fourth day, and so it came., It found poor Tom low-spirited and absent-minded, and this mood continued; he could not shake it off., The ordinary duties of the morning dragged upon his hands, and wearied him., Once more he felt the sense of captivity heavy upon him., Late in the forenoon he was in a large audience-chamber, conversing with the Earl of Hertford and dully awaiting the striking of the hour appointed for a visit of ceremony from a considerable number of great officials and courtiers., After a little while, Tom, who had wandered to a window and become interested in the life and movement of the great highway beyond the palace gates--and not idly interested, but longing with all his heart to take part in person in its stir and freedom--saw the van of a hooting and shouting mob of disorderly men, women, and children of the lowest and poorest degree approaching from up the road., ""I would I knew what 'tis about!"", he exclaimed, with all a boy's curiosity in such happenings., ""Thou art the King!"", solemnly responded the Earl, with a reverence., ""Have I your Grace's leave to act?"", ""O blithely, yes!, O gladly, yes!"", exclaimed Tom excitedly, adding to himself with a lively sense of satisfaction, ""In truth, being a king is not all dreariness--it hath its compensations and conveniences."", The Earl called a page, and sent him to the captain of the guard with the order--  ""Let the mob be halted, and inquiry made concerning the occasion of its movement., By the King's command!"", A few seconds later a long rank of the royal guards, cased in flashing steel, filed out at the gates and formed across the highway in front of the multitude., A messenger returned, to report that the crowd were following a man, a woman, and a young girl to execution for crimes committed against the peace and dignity of the realm., Death--and a violent death--for these poor unfortunates!, The thought wrung Tom's heart-strings., The spirit of compassion took control of him, to the exclusion of all other considerations; he never thought of the offended laws, or of the grief or loss which these three criminals had inflicted upon their victims; he could think of nothing but the scaffold and the grisly fate hanging over the heads of the condemned., His concern made him even forget, for the moment, that he was but the false shadow of a king, not the substance; and before he knew it he had blurted out the command--  ""Bring them here!"", Then he blushed scarlet, and a sort of apology sprung to his lips; but observing that his order had wrought no sort of surprise in the Earl or the waiting page, he suppressed the words he was about to utter., The page, in the most matter-of-course way, made a profound obeisance and retired backwards out of the room to deliver the command., Tom experienced a glow of pride and a renewed sense of the compensating advantages of the kingly office., He said to himself, ""Truly it is like what I was used to feel when I read the old priest's tales, and did imagine mine own self a prince, giving law and command to all, saying 'Do this, do that,' whilst none durst offer let or hindrance to my will."", Now the doors swung open; one high-sounding title after another was announced, the personages owning them followed, and the place was quickly half-filled with noble folk and finery., But Tom was hardly conscious of the presence of these people, so wrought up was he and so intensely absorbed in that other and more interesting matter., He seated himself absently in his chair of state, and turned his eyes upon the door with manifestations of impatient expectancy; seeing which, the company forbore to trouble him, and fell to chatting a mixture of public business and court gossip one with another., In a little while the measured tread of military men was heard approaching, and the culprits entered the presence in charge of an under-sheriff and escorted by a detail of the king's guard., The civil officer knelt before Tom, then stood aside; the three doomed persons knelt, also, and remained so; the guard took position behind Tom's chair., Tom scanned the prisoners curiously., Something about the dress or appearance of the man had stirred a vague memory in him., ""Methinks I have seen this man ere now ., ., ., but the when or the where fail me""--such was Tom's thought., Just then the man glanced quickly up and quickly dropped his face again, not being able to endure the awful port of sovereignty; but the one full glimpse of the face which Tom got was sufficient., He said to himself: ""Now is the matter clear; this is the stranger that plucked Giles Witt out of the Thames, and saved his life, that windy, bitter, first day of the New Year--a brave good deed--pity he hath been doing baser ones and got himself in this sad case ., ., ., I have not forgot the day, neither the hour; by reason that an hour after, upon the stroke of eleven, I did get a hiding by the hand of Gammer Canty which was of so goodly and admired severity that all that went before or followed after it were but fondlings and caresses by comparison."", Tom now ordered that the woman and the girl be removed from the presence for a little time; then addressed himself to the under-sheriff, saying--  ""Good sir, what is this man's offence?"", The officer knelt, and answered--  ""So please your Majesty, he hath taken the life of a subject by poison."", Tom's compassion for the prisoner, and admiration of him as the daring rescuer of a drowning boy, experienced a most damaging shock., ""The thing was proven upon him?"", he asked., ""Most clearly, sire."", Tom sighed, and said--  ""Take him away--he hath earned his death., 'Tis a pity, for he was a brave heart--na--na, I mean he hath the LOOK of it!"", ...]",1
35,"[The prisoners entered it through a massive archway of masonry, and were placed in file, standing, with their backs against the wall., A rope was stretched in front of them, and they were also guarded by their officers., It was a chill and lowering morning, and a light snow which had fallen during the night whitened the great empty space and added to the general dismalness of its aspect., Now and then a wintry wind shivered through the place and sent the snow eddying hither and thither., In the centre of the court stood two women, chained to posts., A glance showed the King that these were his good friends., He shuddered, and said to himself, ""Alack, they are not gone free, as I had thought., To think that such as these should know the lash!--in England!, Ay, there's the shame of it--not in Heathennesse, Christian England!, They will be scourged; and I, whom they have comforted and kindly entreated, must look on and see the great wrong done; it is strange, so strange, that I, the very source of power in this broad realm, am helpless to protect them., But let these miscreants look well to themselves, for there is a day coming when I will require of them a heavy reckoning for this work., For every blow they strike now, they shall feel a hundred then."", A great gate swung open, and a crowd of citizens poured in., They flocked around the two women, and hid them from the King's view., A clergyman entered and passed through the crowd, and he also was hidden., The King now heard talking, back and forth, as if questions were being asked and answered, but he could not make out what was said., Next there was a deal of bustle and preparation, and much passing and repassing of officials through that part of the crowd that stood on the further side of the women; and whilst this proceeded a deep hush gradually fell upon the people., Now, by command, the masses parted and fell aside, and the King saw a spectacle that froze the marrow in his bones., Faggots had been piled about the two women, and a kneeling man was lighting them!, The women bowed their heads, and covered their faces with their hands; the yellow flames began to climb upward among the snapping and crackling faggots, and wreaths of blue smoke to stream away on the wind; the clergyman lifted his hands and began a prayer--just then two young girls came flying through the great gate, uttering piercing screams, and threw themselves upon the women at the stake., Instantly they were torn away by the officers, and one of them was kept in a tight grip, but the other broke loose, saying she would die with her mother; and before she could be stopped she had flung her arms about her mother's neck again., She was torn away once more, and with her gown on fire., Two or three men held her, and the burning portion of her gown was snatched off and thrown flaming aside, she struggling all the while to free herself, and saying she would be alone in the world, now; and begging to be allowed to die with her mother., Both the girls screamed continually, and fought for freedom; but suddenly this tumult was drowned under a volley of heart-piercing shrieks of mortal agony--the King glanced from the frantic girls to the stake, then turned away and leaned his ashen face against the wall, and looked no more., He said, ""That which I have seen, in that one little moment, will never go out from my memory, but will abide there; and I shall see it all the days, and dream of it all the nights, till I die., Would God I had been blind!"", Hendon was watching the King., He said to himself, with satisfaction, ""His disorder mendeth; he hath changed, and groweth gentler., If he had followed his wont, he would have stormed at these varlets, and said he was King, and commanded that the women be turned loose unscathed., Soon his delusion will pass away and be forgotten, and his poor mind will be whole again., God speed the day!"", That same day several prisoners were brought in to remain over night, who were being conveyed, under guard, to various places in the kingdom, to undergo punishment for crimes committed., The King conversed with these --he had made it a point, from the beginning, to instruct himself for the kingly office by questioning prisoners whenever the opportunity offered --and the tale of their woes wrung his heart., One of them was a poor half-witted woman who had stolen a yard or two of cloth from a weaver --she was to be hanged for it., Another was a man who had been accused of stealing a horse; he said the proof had failed, and he had imagined that he was safe from the halter; but no--he was hardly free before he was arraigned for killing a deer in the King's park; this was proved against him, and now he was on his way to the gallows., There was a tradesman's apprentice whose case particularly distressed the King; this youth said he found a hawk, one evening, that had escaped from its owner, and he took it home with him, imagining himself entitled to it; but the court convicted him of stealing it, and sentenced him to death., The King was furious over these inhumanities, and wanted Hendon to break jail and fly with him to Westminster, so that he could mount his throne and hold out his sceptre in mercy over these unfortunate people and save their lives., ""Poor child,"" sighed Hendon, ""these woeful tales have brought his malady upon him again; alack, but for this evil hap, he would have been well in a little time."", Among these prisoners was an old lawyer--a man with a strong face and a dauntless mien., Three years past, he had written a pamphlet against the Lord Chancellor, accusing him of injustice, and had been punished for it by the loss of his ears in the pillory, and degradation from the bar, and in addition had been fined 3,000 pounds and sentenced to imprisonment for life., Lately he had repeated his offence; and in consequence was now under sentence to lose WHAT REMAINED OF HIS EARS, pay a fine of 5,000 pounds, be branded on both cheeks, and remain in prison for life., ""These be honourable scars,"" he said, and turned back his grey hair and showed the mutilated stubs of what had once been his ears., The King's eye burned with passion., He said--  ""None believe in me--neither wilt thou., But no matter--within the compass of a month thou shalt be free; and more, the laws that have dishonoured thee, and shamed the English name, shall be swept from the statute books., The world is made wrong; kings should go to school to their own laws, at times, and so learn mercy."", Meantime Miles was growing sufficiently tired of confinement and inaction., But now his trial came on, to his great gratification, and he thought he could welcome any sentence provided a further imprisonment should not be a part of it., But he was mistaken about that., He was in a fine fury when he found himself described as a 'sturdy vagabond' and sentenced to sit two hours in the stocks for bearing that character and for assaulting the master of Hendon Hall., His pretensions as to brothership with his prosecutor, and rightful heirship to the Hendon honours and estates, were left contemptuously unnoticed, as being not even worth examination., He raged and threatened on his way to punishment, but it did no good; he was snatched roughly along by the officers, and got an occasional cuff, besides, for his irreverent conduct., The King could not pierce through the rabble that swarmed behind; so he was obliged to follow in the rear, remote from his good friend and servant., The King had been nearly condemned to the stocks himself for being in such bad company, but had been let off with a lecture and a warning, in consideration of his youth., When the crowd at last halted, he flitted feverishly from point to point around its outer rim, hunting a place to get through; and at last, after a deal of difficulty and delay, succeeded., There sat his poor henchman in the degrading stocks, the sport and butt of a dirty mob--he, the body servant of the King of England!, Edward had heard the sentence pronounced, but he had not realised the half that it meant., His anger began to rise as the sense of this new indignity which had been put upon him sank home; it jumped to summer heat, the next moment, when he saw an egg sail through the air and crush itself against Hendon's cheek, and heard the crowd roar its enjoyment of the episode., He sprang across the open circle and confronted the officer in charge, crying--  ""For shame!, This is my servant--set him free!, I am the--""  ""Oh, peace!"", exclaimed Hendon, in a panic, ""thou'lt destroy thyself., Mind him not, officer, he is mad."", ""Give thyself no trouble as to the matter of minding him, good man, I have small mind to mind him; but as to teaching him somewhat, to that I am well inclined."", He turned to a subordinate and said, ""Give the little fool a taste or two of the lash, to mend his manners."", ""Half a dozen will better serve his turn,"" suggested Sir Hugh, who had ridden up, a moment before, to take a passing glance at the proceedings., The King was seized., He did not even struggle, so paralysed was he with the mere thought of the monstrous outrage that was proposed to be inflicted upon his sacred person., History was already defiled with the record of the scourging of an English king with whips--it was an intolerable reflection that he must furnish a duplicate of that shameful page., He was in the toils, there was no help for him; he must either take this punishment or beg for its remission., Hard conditions; he would take the stripes--a king might do that, but a king could not beg., But meantime, Miles Hendon was resolving the difficulty., ""Let the child go,"" said he; ""ye heartless dogs, do ye not see how young and frail he is?, Let him go--I will take his lashes."", ""Marry, a good thought--and thanks for it,"" said Sir Hugh, his face lighting with a sardonic satisfaction., ""Let the little beggar go, and give this fellow a dozen in his place--an honest dozen, well laid on."", The King was in the act of entering a fierce protest, but Sir Hugh silenced him with the potent remark, ""Yes, speak up, do, and free thy mind--only, mark ye, that for each word you utter he shall get six strokes the more."", Hendon was removed from the stocks, and his back laid bare; and whilst the lash was applied the poor little King turned away his face and allowed unroyal tears to channel his cheeks unchecked., ""Ah, brave good heart,"" he said to himself, ""this loyal deed shall never perish out of my memory., I will not forget it--and neither shall THEY!"", he added, with passion., Whilst he mused, his appreciation of Hendon's magnanimous conduct grew to greater and still greater dimensions in his mind, and so also did his gratefulness for it., Presently he said to himself, ""Who saves his prince from wounds and possible death--and this he did for me --performs high service; but it is little--it is nothing--oh, less than nothing!--when 'tis weighed against the act of him who saves his prince from SHAME!"", Hendon made no outcry under the scourge, but bore the heavy blows with soldierly fortitude., This, together with his redeeming the boy by taking his stripes for him, compelled the respect of even that forlorn and degraded mob that was gathered there; and its gibes and hootings died away, and no sound remained but the sound of the falling blows., The stillness that pervaded the place, when Hendon found himself once more in the stocks, was in strong contrast with the insulting clamour which had prevailed there so little a while before., The King came softly to Hendon's side, and whispered in his ear--  ""Kings cannot ennoble thee, thou good, great soul, for One who is higher than kings hath done that for thee; but a king can confirm thy nobility to men."", He picked up the scourge from the ground, touched Hendon's bleeding shoulders lightly with it, and whispered, ""Edward of England dubs thee Earl!"", Hendon was touched., The water welled to his eyes, yet at the same time the grisly humour of the situation and circumstances so undermined his gravity that it was all he could do to keep some sign of his inward mirth from showing outside., To be suddenly hoisted, naked and gory, from the common stocks to the Alpine altitude and splendour of an Earldom, seemed to him the last possibility in the line of the grotesque., He said to himself, ""Now am I finely tinselled, indeed!, The spectre-knight of the Kingdom of Dreams and Shadows is become a spectre-earl--a dizzy flight for a callow wing!, An' this go on, I shall presently be hung like a very maypole with fantastic gauds and make-believe honours., But I shall value them, all valueless as they are, for the love that doth bestow them., Better these poor mock dignities of mine, that come unasked, from a clean hand and a right spirit, than real ones bought by servility from grudging and interested power."", The dreaded Sir Hugh wheeled his horse about, and as he spurred away, the living wall divided silently to let him pass, and as silently closed together again., And so remained; nobody went so far as to venture a remark in favour of the prisoner, or in compliment to him; but no matter --the absence of abuse was a sufficient homage in itself., A late comer who was not posted as to the present circumstances, and who delivered a sneer at the 'impostor,' and was in the act of following it with a dead cat, was promptly knocked down and kicked out, without any words, and then the deep quiet resumed sway once more., When Hendon's term of service in the stocks was finished, he was released and ordered to quit the region and come back no more., ...]",1
36,"[However, I did not feel discouraged long., I judged that it was best to make some allowances, for doubtless Mr. Bixby was 'stretching.', Presently he pulled a rope and struck a few strokes on the big bell., The stars were all gone now, and the night was as black as ink., I could hear the wheels churn along the bank, but I was not entirely certain that I could see the shore., The voice of the invisible watchman called up from the hurricane deck--  'What's this, sir?', 'Jones's plantation.', I said to myself, I wish I might venture to offer a small bet that it isn't., But I did not chirp., I only waited to see., Mr. Bixby handled the engine bells, and in due time the boat's nose came to the land, a torch glowed from the forecastle, a man skipped ashore, a darky's voice on the bank said, 'Gimme de k'yarpet-bag, Mars' Jones,' and the next moment we were standing up the river again, all serene., I reflected deeply awhile, and then said--but not aloud--'Well, the finding of that plantation was the luckiest accident that ever happened; but it couldn't happen again in a hundred years.', And I fully believed it was an accident, too., By the time we had gone seven or eight hundred miles up the river, I had learned to be a tolerably plucky up-stream steersman, in daylight, and before we reached St. Louis I had made a trifle of progress in night- work, but only a trifle., I had a note-book that fairly bristled with the names of towns, 'points,' bars, islands, bends, reaches, etc., ; but the information was to be found only in the notebook--none of it was in my head., It made my heart ache to think I had only got half of the river set down; for as our watch was four hours off and four hours on, day and night, there was a long four-hour gap in my book for every time I had slept since the voyage began., My chief was presently hired to go on a big New Orleans boat, and I packed my satchel and went with him., She was a grand affair., When I stood in her pilot-house I was so far above the water that I seemed perched on a mountain; and her decks stretched so far away, fore and aft, below me, that I wondered how I could ever have considered the little 'Paul Jones' a large craft., There were other differences, too., The 'Paul Jones's' pilot-house was a cheap, dingy, battered rattle-trap, cramped for room: but here was a sumptuous glass temple; room enough to have a dance in; showy red and gold window-curtains; an imposing sofa; leather cushions and a back to the high bench where visiting pilots sit, to spin yarns and 'look at the river;' bright, fanciful 'cuspadores' instead of a broad wooden box filled with sawdust; nice new oil-cloth on the floor; a hospitable big stove for winter; a wheel as high as my head, costly with inlaid work; a wire tiller-rope; bright brass knobs for the bells; and a tidy, white-aproned, black 'texas-tender,' to bring up tarts and ices and coffee during mid-watch, day and night., Now this was 'something like,' and so I began to take heart once more to believe that piloting was a romantic sort of occupation after all., The moment we were under way I began to prowl about the great steamer and fill myself with joy., She was as clean and as dainty as a drawing-room; when I looked down her long, gilded saloon, it was like gazing through a splendid tunnel; she had an oil-picture, by some gifted sign-painter, on every stateroom door; she glittered with no end of prism-fringed chandeliers; the clerk's office was elegant, the bar was marvelous, and the bar-keeper had been barbered and upholstered at incredible cost., The boiler deck (i.e., the second story of the boat, so to speak) was as spacious as a church, it seemed to me; so with the forecastle; and there was no pitiful handful of deckhands, firemen, and roustabouts down there, but a whole battalion of men., The fires were fiercely glaring from a long row of furnaces, and over them were eight huge boilers!, This was unutterable pomp., The mighty engines--but enough of this., I had never felt so fine before., And when I found that the regiment of natty servants respectfully 'sir'd' me, my satisfaction was complete., WHEN I returned to the pilot-house St. Louis was gone and I was lost., Here was a piece of river which was all down in my book, but I could make neither head nor tail of it:  you understand, it was turned around., I had seen it when coming up-stream, but I had never faced about to see how it looked when it was behind me., My heart broke again, for it was plain that I had got to learn this troublesome river BOTH WAYS., The pilot-house was full of pilots, going down to 'look at the river.', What is called the 'upper river' (the two hundred miles between St. Louis and Cairo, where the Ohio comes in) was low; and the Mississippi changes its channel so constantly that the pilots used to always find it necessary to run down to Cairo to take a fresh look, when their boats were to lie in port a week; that is, when the water was at a low stage., A deal of this 'looking at the river' was done by poor fellows who seldom had a berth, and whose only hope of getting one lay in their being always freshly posted and therefore ready to drop into the shoes of some reputable pilot, for a single trip, on account of such pilot's sudden illness, or some other necessity., And a good many of them constantly ran up and down inspecting the river, not because they ever really hoped to get a berth, but because (they being guests of the boat) it was cheaper to 'look at the river' than stay ashore and pay board., In time these fellows grew dainty in their tastes, and only infested boats that had an established reputation for setting good tables., All visiting pilots were useful, for they were always ready and willing, winter or summer, night or day, to go out in the yawl and help buoy the channel or assist the boat's pilots in any way they could., They were likewise welcome because all pilots are tireless talkers, when gathered together, and as they talk only about the river they are always understood and are always interesting., Your true pilot cares nothing about anything on earth but the river, and his pride in his occupation surpasses the pride of kings., We had a fine company of these river-inspectors along, this trip., There were eight or ten; and there was abundance of room for them in our great pilot-house., Two or three of them wore polished silk hats, elaborate shirt-fronts, diamond breast-pins, kid gloves, and patent-leather boots., They were choice in their English, and bore themselves with a dignity proper to men of solid means and prodigious reputation as pilots., The others were more or less loosely clad, and wore upon their heads tall felt cones that were suggestive of the days of the Commonwealth., I was a cipher in this august company, and felt subdued, not to say torpid., I was not even of sufficient consequence to assist at the wheel when it was necessary to put the tiller hard down in a hurry; the guest that stood nearest did that when occasion required--and this was pretty much all the time, because of the crookedness of the channel and the scant water., I stood in a corner; and the talk I listened to took the hope all out of me., One visitor said to another--  'Jim, how did you run Plum Point, coming up?', 'It was in the night, there, and I ran it the way one of the boys on the ""Diana"" told me; started out about fifty yards above the wood pile on the false point, and held on the cabin under Plum Point till I raised the reef--quarter less twain--then straightened up for the middle bar till I got well abreast the old one-limbed cotton-wood in the bend, then got my stern on the cotton-wood and head on the low place above the point, and came through a-booming--nine and a half.', 'Pretty square crossing, an't it?', 'Yes, but the upper bar 's working down fast.', Another pilot spoke up and said--  'I had better water than that, and ran it lower down; started out from the false point--mark twain--raised the second reef abreast the big snag in the bend, and had quarter less twain.', One of the gorgeous ones remarked--  'I don't want to find fault with your leadsmen, but that's a good deal of water for Plum Point, it seems to me.', There was an approving nod all around as this quiet snub dropped on the boaster and 'settled' him., And so they went on talk-talk-talking., Meantime, the thing that was running in my mind was, 'Now if my ears hear aright, I have not only to get the names of all the towns and islands and bends, and so on, by heart, but I must even get up a warm personal acquaintanceship with every old snag and one-limbed cotton-wood and obscure wood pile that ornaments the banks of this river for twelve hundred miles; and more than that, I must actually know where these things are in the dark, unless these guests are gifted with eyes that can pierce through two miles of solid blackness; I wish the piloting business was in Jericho and I had never thought of it.', At dusk Mr. Bixby tapped the big bell three times (the signal to land), and the captain emerged from his drawing-room in the forward end of the texas, and looked up inquiringly., Mr. Bixby said--  'We will lay up here all night, captain.', 'Very well, sir.', That was all., The boat came to shore and was tied up for the night., It seemed to me a fine thing that the pilot could do as he pleased, without asking so grand a captain's permission., I took my supper and went immediately to bed, discouraged by my day's observations and experiences., My late voyage's note-booking was but a confusion of meaningless names., It had tangled me all up in a knot every time I had looked at it in the daytime., I now hoped for respite in sleep; but no, it reveled all through my head till sunrise again, a frantic and tireless nightmare., Next morning I felt pretty rusty and low-spirited., We went booming along, taking a good many chances, for we were anxious to 'get out of the river' (as getting out to Cairo was called) before night should overtake us., But Mr. Bixby's partner, the other pilot, presently grounded the boat, and we lost so much time in getting her off that it was plain that darkness would overtake us a good long way above the mouth., This was a great misfortune, especially to certain of our visiting pilots, whose boats would have to wait for their return, no matter how long that might be., It sobered the pilot-house talk a good deal., Coming up-stream, pilots did not mind low water or any kind of darkness; nothing stopped them but fog., But down-stream work was different; a boat was too nearly helpless, with a stiff current pushing behind her; so it was not customary to run down-stream at night in low water., There seemed to be one small hope, however:  if we could get through the intricate and dangerous Hat Island crossing before night, we could venture the rest, for we would have plainer sailing and better water., But it would be insanity to attempt Hat Island at night., So there was a deal of looking at watches all the rest of the day, and a constant ciphering upon the speed we were making; Hat Island was the eternal subject; sometimes hope was high and sometimes we were delayed in a bad crossing, and down it went again., For hours all hands lay under the burden of this suppressed excitement; it was even communicated to me, and I got to feeling so solicitous about Hat Island, and under such an awful pressure of responsibility, that I wished I might have five minutes on shore to draw a good, full, relieving breath, and start over again., We were standing no regular watches., Each of our pilots ran such portions of the river as he had run when coming up-stream, because of his greater familiarity with it; but both remained in the pilot house constantly., An hour before sunset, Mr. Bixby took the wheel and Mr. W----stepped aside., For the next thirty minutes every man held his watch in his hand and was restless, silent, and uneasy., At last somebody said, with a doomful sigh--  'Well, yonder's Hat Island--and we can't make it.', All the watches closed with a snap, everybody sighed and muttered something about its being 'too bad, too bad--ah, if we could only have got here half an hour sooner!', and the place was thick with the atmosphere of disappointment., Some started to go out, but loitered, hearing no bell-tap to land., The sun dipped behind the horizon, the boat went on., Inquiring looks passed from one guest to another; and one who had his hand on the door-knob and had turned it, waited, then presently took away his hand and let the knob turn back again., We bore steadily down the bend., More looks were exchanged, and nods of surprised admiration--but no words., Insensibly the men drew together behind Mr. Bixby, as the sky darkened and one or two dim stars came out., The dead silence and sense of waiting became oppressive., Mr. Bixby pulled the cord, and two deep, mellow notes from the big bell floated off on the night., Then a pause, and one more note was struck., The watchman's voice followed, from the hurricane deck--  'Labboard lead, there!, Stabboard lead!', ...]",1
37,"[I said, ""It's my nature; how can I change it?"", She says, ""Well, do go to bed and get some rest."", I said, ""Not till that poor, noble young man has got his money."", So I set up all night, and this morning out I shot, and the first man I struck told me you had shipped on the ""Grand Turk"" and gone to New Orleans., Well, sir, I had to lean up against a building and cry., So help me goodness, I couldn't help it., The man that owned the place come out cleaning up with a rag, and said he didn't like to have people cry against his building, and then it seemed to me that the whole world had turned against me, and it wasn't any use to live any more; and coming along an hour ago, suffering no man knows what agony, I met Jim Wilson and paid him the two hundred and fifty dollars on account; and to think that here you are, now, and I haven't got a cent!, But as sure as I am standing here on this ground on this particular brick,--there, I've scratched a mark on the brick to remember it by,--I'll borrow that money and pay it over to you at twelve o'clock sharp, tomorrow!, Now, stand so; let me look at you just once more.', And so on., Yates's life became a burden to him., He could not escape his debtor and his debtor's awful sufferings on account of not being able to pay., He dreaded to show himself in the street, lest he should find Stephen lying in wait for him at the corner., Bogart's billiard saloon was a great resort for pilots in those days., They met there about as much to exchange river news as to play., One morning Yates was there; Stephen was there, too, but kept out of sight., But by and by, when about all the pilots had arrived who were in town, Stephen suddenly appeared in the midst, and rushed for Yates as for a long-lost brother., 'OH, I am so glad to see you!, Oh my soul, the sight of you is such a comfort to my eyes!, Gentlemen, I owe all of you money; among you I owe probably forty thousand dollars., I want to pay it; I intend to pay it every last cent of it., You all know, without my telling you, what sorrow it has cost me to remain so long under such deep obligations to such patient and generous friends; but the sharpest pang I suffer--by far the sharpest--is from the debt I owe to this noble young man here; and I have come to this place this morning especially to make the announcement that I have at last found a method whereby I can pay off all my debts!, And most especially I wanted HIM to be here when I announced it., Yes, my faithful friend,--my benefactor, I've found the method!, I've found the method to pay off all my debts, and you'll get your money!', Hope dawned in Yates's eye; then Stephen, beaming benignantly, and placing his hand upon Yates's head, added, 'I am going to pay them off in alphabetical order!', Then he turned and disappeared., The full significance of Stephen's 'method' did not dawn upon the perplexed and musing crowd for some two minutes; and then Yates murmured with a sigh--  'Well, the Y's stand a gaudy chance., He won't get any further than the C's in THIS world, and I reckon that after a good deal of eternity has wasted away in the next one, I'll still be referred to up there as ""that poor, ragged pilot that came here from St. Louis in the early days!"", DURING the two or two and a half years of my apprenticeship, I served under many pilots, and had experience of many kinds of steamboatmen and many varieties of steamboats; for it was not always convenient for Mr. Bixby to have me with him, and in such cases he sent me with somebody else., I am to this day profiting somewhat by that experience; for in that brief, sharp schooling, I got personally and familiarly acquainted with about all the different types of human nature that are to be found in fiction, biography, or history., The fact is daily borne in upon me, that the average shore-employment requires as much as forty years to equip a man with this sort of an education., When I say I am still profiting by this thing, I do not mean that it has constituted me a judge of men--no, it has not done that; for judges of men are born, not made., My profit is various in kind and degree; but the feature of it which I value most is the zest which that early experience has given to my later reading., When I find a well-drawn character in fiction or biography, I generally take a warm personal interest in him, for the reason that I have known him before--met him on the river., The figure that comes before me oftenest, out of the shadows of that vanished time, is that of Brown, of the steamer 'Pennsylvania'--the man referred to in a former chapter, whose memory was so good and tiresome., He was a middle-aged, long, slim, bony, smooth-shaven, horse-faced, ignorant, stingy, malicious, snarling, fault hunting, mote-magnifying tyrant., I early got the habit of coming on watch with dread at my heart., No matter how good a time I might have been having with the off-watch below, and no matter how high my spirits might be when I started aloft, my soul became lead in my body the moment I approached the pilot-house., I still remember the first time I ever entered the presence of that man., The boat had backed out from St. Louis and was 'straightening down;' I ascended to the pilot-house in high feather, and very proud to be semi- officially a member of the executive family of so fast and famous a boat., Brown was at the wheel., I paused in the middle of the room, all fixed to make my bow, but Brown did not look around., I thought he took a furtive glance at me out of the corner of his eye, but as not even this notice was repeated, I judged I had been mistaken., By this time he was picking his way among some dangerous 'breaks' abreast the woodyards; therefore it would not be proper to interrupt him; so I stepped softly to the high bench and took a seat., There was silence for ten minutes; then my new boss turned and inspected me deliberately and painstakingly from head to heel for about--as it seemed to me--a quarter of an hour., After which he removed his countenance and I saw it no more for some seconds; then it came around once more, and this question greeted me--  'Are you Horace Bigsby's cub?', 'Yes, sir.', After this there was a pause and another inspection., Then--  'What's your name?', I told him., He repeated it after me., It was probably the only thing he ever forgot; for although I was with him many months he never addressed himself to me in any other way than 'Here!', and then his command followed., 'Where was you born?', 'In Florida, Missouri.', A pause., Then--  'Dern sight better staid there!', By means of a dozen or so of pretty direct questions, he pumped my family history out of me., The leads were going now, in the first crossing., This interrupted the inquest., When the leads had been laid in, he resumed--  'How long you been on the river?', I told him., After a pause--  'Where'd you get them shoes?', I gave him the information., 'Hold up your foot!', I did so., He stepped back, examined the shoe minutely and contemptuously, scratching his head thoughtfully, tilting his high sugar-loaf hat well forward to facilitate the operation, then ejaculated, 'Well, I'll be dod derned!', and returned to his wheel., What occasion there was to be dod derned about it is a thing which is still as much of a mystery to me now as it was then., It must have been all of fifteen minutes--fifteen minutes of dull, homesick silence-- before that long horse-face swung round upon me again--and then, what a change!, It was as red as fire, and every muscle in it was working., Now came this shriek--  'Here!--You going to set there all day?', I lit in the middle of the floor, shot there by the electric suddenness of the surprise., As soon as I could get my voice I said, apologetically:--'I have had no orders, sir.', 'You've had no ORDERS!, My, what a fine bird we are!, We must have ORDERS!, Our father was a GENTLEMAN--owned slaves--and we've been to SCHOOL., Yes, WE are a gentleman, TOO, and got to have ORDERS!, ORDERS, is it?, ORDERS is what you want!, Dod dern my skin, I'LL learn you to swell yourself up and blow around here about your dod-derned ORDERS!, G'way from the wheel!', (I had approached it without knowing it.), I moved back a step or two, and stood as in a dream, all my senses stupefied by this frantic assault., 'What you standing there for?, Take that ice-pitcher down to the texas- tender-come, move along, and don't you be all day about it!', The moment I got back to the pilot-house, Brown said--  'Here!, What was you doing down there all this time?', 'I couldn't find the texas-tender; I had to go all the way to the pantry.', 'Derned likely story!, Fill up the stove.', I proceeded to do so., He watched me like a cat., Presently he shouted--  'Put down that shovel!, Deadest numskull I ever saw--ain't even got sense enough to load up a stove.', All through the watch this sort of thing went on., Yes, and the subsequent watches were much like it, during a stretch of months., As I have said, I soon got the habit of coming on duty with dread., ...]",1
38,"[I went on telling fortunes., Every night I shut myself in, all alone, and studied the day's thumb-prints with a magnifying-glass., Imagine the devouring eagerness with which I pored over those mazy red spirals, with that document by my side which bore the right-hand thumb-and-finger- marks of that unknown murderer, printed with the dearest blood--to me-- that was ever shed on this earth!, And many and many a time I had to repeat the same old disappointed remark, 'will they NEVER correspond!', But my reward came at last., It was the print of the thumb of the forty- third man of Company C whom I had experimented on--Private Franz Adler., An hour before, I did not know the murderer's name, or voice, or figure, or face, or nationality; but now I knew all these things!, I believed I might feel sure; the Frenchman's repeated demonstrations being so good a warranty., Still, there was a way to MAKE sure., I had an impression of Kruger's left thumb., In the morning I took him aside when he was off duty; and when we were out of sight and hearing of witnesses, I said, impressively--  'A part of your fortune is so grave, that I thought it would be better for you if I did not tell it in public., You and another man, whose fortune I was studying last night,--Private Adler,--have been murdering a woman and a child!, You are being dogged: within five days both of you will be assassinated.', He dropped on his knees, frightened out of his wits; and for five minutes he kept pouring out the same set of words, like a demented person, and in the same half-crying way which was one of my memories of that murderous night in my cabin--  'I didn't do it; upon my soul I didn't do it; and I tried to keep HIM from doing it; I did, as God is my witness., He did it alone.', This was all I wanted., And I tried to get rid of the fool; but no, he clung to me, imploring me to save him from the assassin., He said--  'I have money--ten thousand dollars--hid away, the fruit of loot and thievery; save me--tell me what to do, and you shall have it, every penny., Two-thirds of it is my cousin Adler's; but you can take it all., We hid it when we first came here., But I hid it in a new place yesterday, and have not told him--shall not tell him., I was going to desert, and get away with it all., It is gold, and too heavy to carry when one is running and dodging; but a woman who has been gone over the river two days to prepare my way for me is going to follow me with it; and if I got no chance to describe the hiding-place to her I was going to slip my silver watch into her hand, or send it to her, and she would understand., There's a piece of paper in the back of the case, which tells it all., Here, take the watch--tell me what to do!', He was trying to press his watch upon me, and was exposing the paper and explaining it to me, when Adler appeared on the scene, about a dozen yards away., I said to poor Kruger--  'Put up your watch, I don't want it., You shan't come to any harm., Go, now; I must tell Adler his fortune., Presently I will tell you how to escape the assassin; meantime I shall have to examine your thumbmark again., Say nothing to Adler about this thing--say nothing to anybody.', He went away filled with fright and gratitude, poor devil., I told Adler a long fortune--purposely so long that I could not finish it; promised to come to him on guard, that night, and tell him the really important part of it--the tragical part of it, I said--so must be out of reach of eavesdroppers., They always kept a picket-watch outside the town--mere discipline and ceremony--no occasion for it, no enemy around., Toward midnight I set out, equipped with the countersign, and picked my way toward the lonely region where Adler was to keep his watch., It was so dark that I stumbled right on a dim figure almost before I could get out a protecting word., The sentinel hailed and I answered, both at the same moment., I added, 'It's only me--the fortune-teller.', Then I slipped to the poor devil's side, and without a word I drove my dirk into his heart!, YA WOHL, laughed I, it WAS the tragedy part of his fortune, indeed!, As he fell from his horse, he clutched at me, and my blue goggles remained in his hand; and away plunged the beast dragging him, with his foot in the stirrup., I fled through the woods, and made good my escape, leaving the accusing goggles behind me in that dead man's hand., This was fifteen or sixteen years ago., Since then I have wandered aimlessly about the earth, sometimes at work, sometimes idle; sometimes with money, sometimes with none; but always tired of life, and wishing it was done, for my mission here was finished, with the act of that night; and the only pleasure, solace, satisfaction I had, in all those tedious years, was in the daily reflection, 'I have killed him!', Four years ago, my health began to fail., I had wandered into Munich, in my purposeless way., Being out of money, I sought work, and got it; did my duty faithfully about a year, and was then given the berth of night watchman yonder in that dead-house which you visited lately., The place suited my mood., I liked it., I liked being with the dead--liked being alone with them., I used to wander among those rigid corpses, and peer into their austere faces, by the hour., The later the time, the more impressive it was; I preferred the late time., Sometimes I turned the lights low:  this gave perspective, you see; and the imagination could play; always, the dim receding ranks of the dead inspired one with weird and fascinating fancies., Two years ago--I had been there a year then--I was sitting all alone in the watch-room, one gusty winter's night, chilled, numb, comfortless; drowsing gradually into unconsciousness; the sobbing of the wind and the slamming of distant shutters falling fainter and fainter upon my dulling ear each moment, when sharp and suddenly that dead-bell rang out a blood-curdling alarum over my head!, The shock of it nearly paralyzed me; for it was the first time I had ever heard it., I gathered myself together and flew to the corpse-room., About midway down the outside rank, a shrouded figure was sitting upright, wagging its head slowly from one side to the other--a grisly spectacle!, Its side was toward me., I hurried to it and peered into its face., Heavens, it was Adler!, Can you divine what my first thought was?, Put into words, it was this: 'It seems, then, you escaped me once: there will be a different result this time!', Evidently this creature was suffering unimaginable terrors., Think what it must have been to wake up in the midst of that voiceless hush, and, look out over that grim congregation of the dead!, What gratitude shone in his skinny white face when he saw a living form before him!, And how the fervency of this mute gratitude was augmented when his eyes fell upon the life-giving cordials which I carried in my hands!, Then imagine the horror which came into this pinched face when I put the cordials behind me, and said mockingly--  'Speak up, Franz Adler--call upon these dead., Doubtless they will listen and have pity; but here there is none else that will.', He tried to speak, but that part of the shroud which bound his jaws, held firm and would not let him., He tried to lift imploring hands, but they were crossed upon his breast and tied., I said--  'Shout, Franz Adler; make the sleepers in the distant streets hear you and bring help., Shout--and lose no time, for there is little to lose., What, you cannot?, That is a pity; but it is no matter--it does not always bring help., When you and your cousin murdered a helpless woman and child in a cabin in Arkansas--my wife, it was, and my child!--they shrieked for help, you remember; but it did no good; you remember that it did no good, is it not so?, Your teeth chatter--then why cannot you shout?, Loosen the bandages with your hands--then you can., Ah, I see-- your hands are tied, they cannot aid you., How strangely things repeat themselves, after long years; for MY hands were tied, that night, you remember?, Yes, tied much as yours are now--how odd that is., I could not pull free., It did not occur to you to untie me; it does not occur to me to untie you., Sh--!, there's a late footstep., It is coming this way., Hark, how near it is!, One can count the footfalls--one--two--three., There--it is just outside., Now is the time!, Shout, man, shout!--it is the one sole chance between you and eternity!, Ah, you see you have delayed too long--it is gone by., There--it is dying out., It is gone!, Think of it--reflect upon it--you have heard a human footstep for the last time., How curious it must be, to listen to so common a sound as that, and know that one will never hear the fellow to it again.', Oh, my friend, the agony in that shrouded face was ecstasy to see!, I thought of a new torture, and applied it--assisting myself with a trifle of lying invention--  'That poor Kruger tried to save my wife and child, and I did him a grateful good turn for it when the time came., I persuaded him to rob you; and I and a woman helped him to desert, and got him away in safety.', A look as of surprise and triumph shone out dimly through the anguish in my victim's face., I was disturbed, disquieted., ...]",1
39,"[First, you heave your cane into the centrifugals and grind out the juice; then run it through the evaporating pan to extract the fiber; then through the bone-filter to remove the alcohol; then through the clarifying tanks to discharge the molasses; then through the granulating pipe to condense it; then through the vacuum pan to extract the vacuum., It is now ready for market., I have jotted these particulars down from memory., The thing looks simple and easy., Do not deceive yourself., To make sugar is really one of the most difficult things in the world., And to make it right, is next to impossible., If you will examine your own supply every now and then for a term of years, and tabulate the result, you will find that not two men in twenty can make sugar without getting sand into it., We could have gone down to the mouth of the river and visited Captain Eads' great work, the 'jetties,' where the river has been compressed between walls, and thus deepened to twenty-six feet; but it was voted useless to go, since at this stage of the water everything would be covered up and invisible., We could have visited that ancient and singular burg, 'Pilot-town,' which stands on stilts in the water--so they say; where nearly all communication is by skiff and canoe, even to the attending of weddings and funerals; and where the littlest boys and girls are as handy with the oar as unamphibious children are with the velocipede., We could have done a number of other things; but on account of limited time, we went back home., The sail up the breezy and sparkling river was a charming experience, and would have been satisfyingly sentimental and romantic but for the interruptions of the tug's pet parrot, whose tireless comments upon the scenery and the guests were always this- worldly, and often profane., He had also a superabundance of the discordant, ear-splitting, metallic laugh common to his breed--a machine-made laugh, a Frankenstein laugh, with the soul left out of it., He applied it to every sentimental remark, and to every pathetic song., He cackled it out with hideous energy after 'Home again, home again from a foreign shore,' and said he 'wouldn't give a damn for a tug-load of such rot.', Romance and sentiment cannot long survive this sort of discouragement; so the singing and talking presently ceased; which so delighted the parrot that he cursed himself hoarse for joy., Then the male members of the party moved to the forecastle, to smoke and gossip., There were several old steamboatmen along, and I learned from them a great deal of what had been happening to my former river friends during my long absence., I learned that a pilot whom I used to steer for is become a spiritualist, and for more than fifteen years has been receiving a letter every week from a deceased relative, through a New York spiritualist medium named Manchester--postage graduated by distance:  from the local post-office in Paradise to New York, five dollars; from New York to St. Louis, three cents., I remember Mr. Manchester very well., I called on him once, ten years ago, with a couple of friends, one of whom wished to inquire after a deceased uncle., This uncle had lost his life in a peculiarly violent and unusual way, half a dozen years before:  a cyclone blew him some three miles and knocked a tree down with him which was four feet through at the butt and sixty- five feet high., He did not survive this triumph., At the seance just referred to, my friend questioned his late uncle, through Mr. Manchester, and the late uncle wrote down his replies, using Mr. Manchester's hand and pencil for that purpose., The following is a fair example of the questions asked, and also of the sloppy twaddle in the way of answers, furnished by Manchester under the pretense that it came from the specter., If this man is not the paltriest fraud that lives, I owe him an apology--  QUESTION., Where are you?, ANSWER., In the spirit world., Q., Are you happy?, A., Very happy., Perfectly happy., Q., How do you amuse yourself?, A., Conversation with friends, and other spirits., Q., What else?, A., Nothing else., Nothing else is necessary., Q., What do you talk about?, A., About how happy we are; and about friends left behind in the earth, and how to influence them for their good., Q., When your friends in the earth all get to the spirit land, what shall you have to talk about then?--nothing but about how happy you all are?, No reply., It is explained that spirits will not answer frivolous questions., Q., How is it that spirits that are content to spend an eternity in frivolous employments, and accept it as happiness, are so fastidious about frivolous questions upon the subject?, No reply., Q., Would you like to come back?, A., No., Q., Would you say that under oath?, A., Yes., Q., What do you eat there?, A., We do not eat., Q., What do you drink?, A., We do not drink., Q., What do you smoke?, A., We do not smoke., Q., What do you read?, A., We do not read., Q., Do all the good people go to your place?, A., Yes., Q., You know my present way of life., Can you suggest any additions to it, in the way of crime, that will reasonably insure my going to some other place., A., No reply., Q., When did you die?, A. I did not die, I passed away., Q., Very well, then, when did you pass away?, How long have you been in the spirit land?, A., We have no measurements of time here., Q., Though you may be indifferent and uncertain as to dates and times in your present condition and environment, this has nothing to do with your former condition., You had dates then., One of these is what I ask for., You departed on a certain day in a certain year., ...]",1
40,"[These three rivers form the Black River., Troy, or a portion of it, is situated on and around three large Indian mounds, circular in shape, which rise above the present water about twelve feet., They are about one hundred and fifty feet in diameter, and are about two hundred yards apart., The houses are all built between these mounds, and hence are all flooded to a depth of eighteen inches on their floors., These elevations, built by the aborigines, hundreds of years ago, are the only points of refuge for miles., When we arrived we found them crowded with stock, all of which was thin and hardly able to stand up., They were mixed together, sheep, hogs, horses, mules, and cattle., One of these mounds has been used for many years as the grave-yard, and to-day we saw attenuated cows lying against the marble tomb-stones, chewing their cud in contentment, after a meal of corn furnished by General York., Here, as below, the remarkable skill of the women and girls in the management of the smaller pirogues was noticed., Children were paddling about in these most ticklish crafts with all the nonchalance of adepts., General York has put into operation a perfect system in regard to furnishing relief., He makes a personal inspection of the place where it is asked, sees what is necessary to be done, and then, having two boats chartered, with flats, sends them promptly to the place, when the cattle are loaded and towed to the pine hills and uplands of Catahoula., He has made Troy his headquarters, and to this point boats come for their supply of feed for cattle., On the opposite side of Little River, which branches to the left out of Black, and between it and the Ouachita, is situated the town of Trinity, which is hourly threatened with destruction., It is much lower than Troy, and the water is eight and nine feet deep in the houses., A strong current sweeps through it, and it is remarkable that all of its houses have not gone before., The residents of both Troy and Trinity have been cared for, yet some of their stock have to be furnished with food., As soon as the 'Susie' reached Troy, she was turned over to General York, and placed at his disposition to carry out the work of relief more rapidly., Nearly all her supplies were landed on one of the mounds to lighten her, and she was headed down stream to relieve those below., At Tom Hooper's place, a few miles from Troy, a large flat, with about fifty head of stock on board, was taken in tow., The animals were fed, and soon regained some strength., To-day we go on Little River, where the suffering is greatest., DOWN BLACK RIVER  Saturday Evening, March 25., We started down Black River quite early, under the direction of General York, to bring out what stock could be reached., Going down river a flat in tow was left in a central locality, and from there men poled her back in the rear of plantations, picking up the animals wherever found., In the loft of a gin-house there were seventeen head found, and after a gangway was built they were led down into the flat without difficulty., Taking a skiff with the General, your reporter was pulled up to a little house of two rooms, in which the water was standing two feet on the floors., In one of the large rooms were huddled the horses and cows of the place, while in the other the Widow Taylor and her son were seated on a scaffold raised on the floor., One or two dug-outs were drifting about in the roam ready to be put in service at any time., When the flat was brought up, the side of the house was cut away as the only means of getting the animals out, and the cattle were driven on board the boat., General York, in this as in every case, inquired if the family desired to leave, informing them that Major Burke, of 'The Times-Democrat,' has sent the 'Susie' up for that purpose., Mrs. Taylor said she thanked Major Burke, but she would try and hold out., The remarkable tenacity of the people here to their homes is beyond all comprehension., Just below, at a point sixteen miles from Troy, information was received that the house of Mr. Tom Ellis was in danger, and his family were all in it., We steamed there immediately, and a sad picture was presented., Looking out of the half of the window left above water, was Mrs. Ellis, who is in feeble health, whilst at the door were her seven children, the oldest not fourteen years., One side of the house was given up to the work animals, some twelve head, besides hogs., In the next room the family lived, the water coming within two inches of the bed-rail., The stove was below water, and the cooking was done on a fire on top of it., The house threatened to give way at any moment: one end of it was sinking, and, in fact, the building looked a mere shell., As the boat rounded to, Mr. Ellis came out in a dug-out, and General York told him that he had come to his relief; that 'The Times-Democrat' boat was at his service, and would remove his family at once to the hills, and on Monday a flat would take out his stock, as, until that time, they would be busy., Notwithstanding the deplorable situation himself and family were in, Mr. Ellis did not want to leave., He said he thought he would wait until Monday, and take the risk of his house falling., The children around the door looked perfectly contented, seeming to care little for the danger they were in., These are but two instances of the many., After weeks of privation and suffering, people still cling to their houses and leave only when there is not room between the water and the ceiling to build a scaffold on which to stand., It seemed to be incomprehensible, yet the love for the old place was stronger than that for safety., After leaving the Ellis place, the next spot touched at was the Oswald place., Here the flat was towed alongside the gin-house where there were fifteen head standing in water; and yet, as they stood on scaffolds, their heads were above the top of the entrance., It was found impossible to get them out without cutting away a portion of the front; and so axes were brought into requisition and a gap made., After much labor the horses and mules were securely placed on the flat., At each place we stop there are always three, four, or more dug-outs arriving, bringing information of stock in other places in need., Notwithstanding the fact that a great many had driven a part of their stock to the hills some time ago, there yet remains a large quantity, which General York, who is working with indomitable energy, will get landed in the pine hills by Tuesday., All along Black River the 'Susie' has been visited by scores of planters, whose tales are the repetition of those already heard of suffering and loss., An old planter, who has lived on the river since 1844, said there never was such a rise, and he was satisfied more than one quarter of the stock has been lost., Luckily the people cared first for their work stock, and when they could find it horses and mules were housed in a place of safety., The rise which still continues, and was two inches last night, compels them to get them out to the hills; hence it is that the work of General York is of such a great value., From daylight to late at night he is going this way and that, cheering by his kindly words and directing with calm judgment what is to be done., One unpleasant story, of a certain merchant in New Orleans, is told all along the river., It appears for some years past the planters have been dealing with this individual, and many of them had balances in his hands., When the overflow came they wrote for coffee, for meal, and, in fact, for such little necessities as were required., No response to these letters came, and others were written, and yet these old customers, with plantations under water, were refused even what was necessary to sustain life., It is needless to say he is not popular now on Back River., The hills spoken of as the place of refuge for the people and stock on Black River are in Catahoula parish, twenty-four miles from Black River., After filling the flat with cattle we took on board the family of T. S. Hooper, seven in number, who could not longer remain in their dwelling, and we are now taking them up Little River to the hills., THE FLOOD STILL RISING  Troy: March 27, 1882, noon., The flood here is rising about three and a half inches every twenty-four hours, and rains have set in which will increase this., General York feels now that our efforts ought to be directed towards saving life, as the increase of the water has jeopardized many houses., We intend to go up the Tensas in a few minutes, and then we will return and go down Black River to take off families., There is a lack of steam transportation here to meet the emergency., The General has three boats chartered, with flats in tow, but the demand for these to tow out stock is greater than they can meet with promptness., All are working night and day, and the 'Susie' hardly stops for more than an hour anywhere., The rise has placed Trinity in a dangerous plight, and momentarily it is expected that some of the houses will float off., Troy is a little higher, yet all are in the water., Reports have come in that a woman and child have been washed away below here, and two cabins floated off., Their occupants are the same who refused to come off day before yesterday., One would not believe the utter passiveness of the people., As yet no news has been received of the steamer 'Delia,' which is supposed to be the one sunk in yesterday's storm on Lake Catahoula., She is due here now, but has not arrived., Even the mail here is most uncertain, and this I send by skiff to Natchez to get it to you., It is impossible to get accurate data as to past crops, etc., as those who know much about the matter have gone, and those who remain are not well versed in the production of this section., General York desires me to say that the amount of rations formerly sent should be duplicated and sent at once., It is impossible to make any estimate, for the people are fleeing to the hills, so rapid is the rise., The residents here are in a state of commotion that can only be appreciated when seen, and complete demoralization has set in,  If rations are drawn for any particular section hereabouts, they would not be certain to be distributed, so everything should be sent to Troy as a center, and the General will have it properly disposed of., He has sent for one hundred tents, and, if all go to the hills who are in motion now, two hundred will be required., APPENDIX B  THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER COMMISSION  THE condition of this rich valley of the Lower Mississippi, immediately after and since the war, constituted one of the disastrous effects of war most to be deplored., Fictitious property in slaves was not only righteously destroyed, but very much of the work which had depended upon the slave labor was also destroyed or greatly impaired, especially the levee system., It might have been expected by those who have not investigated the subject, that such important improvements as the construction and maintenance of the levees would have been assumed at once by the several States., But what can the State do where the people are under subjection to rates of interest ranging from 18 to 30 per cent., and are also under the necessity of pledging their crops in advance even of planting, at these rates, for the privilege of purchasing all of their supplies at 100 per cent., profit?, It has needed but little attention to make it perfectly obvious that the control of the Mississippi River, if undertaken at all, must be undertaken by the national government, and cannot be compassed by States., The river must be treated as a unit; its control cannot be compassed under a divided or separate system of administration., Neither are the States especially interested competent to combine among themselves for the necessary operations., The work must begin far up the river; at least as far as Cairo, if not beyond; and must be conducted upon a consistent general plan throughout the course of the river., It does not need technical or scientific knowledge to comprehend the elements of the case if one will give a little time and attention to the subject, and when a Mississippi River commission has been constituted, as the existing commission is, of thoroughly able men of different walks in life, may it not be suggested that their verdict in the case should be accepted as conclusive, so far as any a priori theory of construction or control can be considered conclusive?, It should be remembered that upon this board are General Gilmore, General Comstock, and General Suter, of the United States Engineers; Professor Henry Mitchell (the most competent authority on the question of hydrography), of the United States Coast Survey; B., B. Harrod, the State Engineer of Louisiana; Jas., B. Eads, whose success with the jetties at New Orleans is a warrant of his competency, and Judge Taylor, of Indiana., It would be presumption on the part of any single man, however skilled, to contest the judgment of such a board as this., The method of improvement proposed by the commission is at once in accord with the results of engineering experience and with observations of nature where meeting our wants., ...]",1
41,"[Well, by this time I was most down to the foot of the island., A little ripply, cool breeze begun to blow, and that was as good as saying the night was about done., I give her a turn with the paddle and brung her nose to shore; then I got my gun and slipped out and into the edge of the woods., I sat down there on a log, and looked out through the leaves., I see the moon go off watch, and the darkness begin to blanket the river., But in a little while I see a pale streak over the treetops, and knowed the day was coming., So I took my gun and slipped off towards where I had run across that camp fire, stopping every minute or two to listen., But I hadn't no luck somehow; I couldn't seem to find the place., But by and by, sure enough, I catched a glimpse of fire away through the trees., I went for it, cautious and slow., By and by I was close enough to have a look, and there laid a man on the ground., It most give me the fantods., He had a blanket around his head, and his head was nearly in the fire., I set there behind a clump of bushes in about six foot of him, and kept my eyes on him steady., It was getting gray daylight now., Pretty soon he gapped and stretched himself and hove off the blanket, and it was Miss Watson's Jim!, I bet I was glad to see him., I says:  ""Hello, Jim!"", and skipped out., He bounced up and stared at me wild., Then he drops down on his knees, and puts his hands together and says:  ""Doan' hurt me--don't!, I hain't ever done no harm to a ghos'., I alwuz liked dead people, en done all I could for 'em., You go en git in de river agin, whah you b'longs, en doan' do nuffn to Ole Jim, 'at 'uz awluz yo' fren'."", Well, I warn't long making him understand I warn't dead., I was ever so glad to see Jim., I warn't lonesome now., I told him I warn't afraid of HIM telling the people where I was., I talked along, but he only set there and looked at me; never said nothing., Then I says:  ""It's good daylight., Le's get breakfast., Make up your camp fire good."", ""What's de use er makin' up de camp fire to cook strawbries en sich truck?, But you got a gun, hain't you?, Den we kin git sumfn better den strawbries."", ""Strawberries and such truck,"" I says., ""Is that what you live on?"", ""I couldn' git nuffn else,"" he says., ""Why, how long you been on the island, Jim?"", ""I come heah de night arter you's killed."", ""What, all that time?"", ""Yes--indeedy."", ""And ain't you had nothing but that kind of rubbage to eat?"", ""No, sah--nuffn else."", ""Well, you must be most starved, ain't you?"", ""I reck'n I could eat a hoss., I think I could., How long you ben on de islan'?"", ""Since the night I got killed."", ""No!, W'y, what has you lived on?, But you got a gun., Oh, yes, you got a gun., Dat's good., Now you kill sumfn en I'll make up de fire."", So we went over to where the canoe was, and while he built a fire in a grassy open place amongst the trees, I fetched meal and bacon and coffee, and coffee-pot and frying-pan, and sugar and tin cups, and the nigger was set back considerable, because he reckoned it was all done with witchcraft., I catched a good big catfish, too, and Jim cleaned him with his knife, and fried him., When breakfast was ready we lolled on the grass and eat it smoking hot., Jim laid it in with all his might, for he was most about starved., Then when we had got pretty well stuffed, we laid off and lazied., By and by Jim says:  ""But looky here, Huck, who wuz it dat 'uz killed in dat shanty ef it warn't you?"", Then I told him the whole thing, and he said it was smart., He said Tom Sawyer couldn't get up no better plan than what I had., Then I says:  ""How do you come to be here, Jim, and how'd you get here?"", He looked pretty uneasy, and didn't say nothing for a minute., Then he says:  ""Maybe I better not tell."", ""Why, Jim?"", ""Well, dey's reasons., But you wouldn' tell on me ef I uz to tell you, would you, Huck?"", ""Blamed if I would, Jim."", ""Well, I b'lieve you, Huck., I--I RUN OFF."", ""Jim!"", ""But mind, you said you wouldn' tell--you know you said you wouldn' tell, Huck."", ""Well, I did., I said I wouldn't, and I'll stick to it., Honest INJUN, I will., People would call me a low-down Abolitionist and despise me for keeping mum--but that don't make no difference., I ain't a-going to tell, and I ain't a-going back there, anyways., So, now, le's know all about it."", ""Well, you see, it 'uz dis way., Ole missus--dat's Miss Watson--she pecks on me all de time, en treats me pooty rough, but she awluz said she wouldn' sell me down to Orleans., But I noticed dey wuz a nigger trader roun' de place considable lately, en I begin to git oneasy., Well, one night I creeps to de do' pooty late, en de do' warn't quite shet, en I hear old missus tell de widder she gwyne to sell me down to Orleans, but she didn' want to, but she could git eight hund'd dollars for me, en it 'uz sich a big stack o' money she couldn' resis'., De widder she try to git her to say she wouldn' do it, but I never waited to hear de res'., I lit out mighty quick, I tell you., ""I tuck out en shin down de hill, en 'spec to steal a skift 'long de sho' som'ers 'bove de town, but dey wuz people a-stirring yit, so I hid in de ole tumble-down cooper-shop on de bank to wait for everybody to go 'way., Well, I wuz dah all night., Dey wuz somebody roun' all de time., 'Long 'bout six in de mawnin' skifts begin to go by, en 'bout eight er nine every skift dat went 'long wuz talkin' 'bout how yo' pap come over to de town en say you's killed., Dese las' skifts wuz full o' ladies en genlmen a-goin' over for to see de place., Sometimes dey'd pull up at de sho' en take a res' b'fo' dey started acrost, so by de talk I got to know all 'bout de killin'., I 'uz powerful sorry you's killed, Huck, but I ain't no mo' now., ""I laid dah under de shavin's all day., I 'uz hungry, but I warn't afeard;

42,"[Come along, old hoss."", Cold corn-pone, cold corn-beef, butter and buttermilk--that is what they had for me down there, and there ain't nothing better that ever I've come across yet., Buck and his ma and all of them smoked cob pipes, except the nigger woman, which was gone, and the two young women., They all smoked and talked, and I eat and talked., The young women had quilts around them, and their hair down their backs., They all asked me questions, and I told them how pap and me and all the family was living on a little farm down at the bottom of Arkansaw, and my sister Mary Ann run off and got married and never was heard of no more, and Bill went to hunt them and he warn't heard of no more, and Tom and Mort died, and then there warn't nobody but just me and pap left, and he was just trimmed down to nothing, on account of his troubles; so when he died I took what there was left, because the farm didn't belong to us, and started up the river, deck passage, and fell overboard; and that was how I come to be here., So they said I could have a home there as long as I wanted it., Then it was most daylight and everybody went to bed, and I went to bed with Buck, and when I waked up in the morning, drat it all, I had forgot what my name was., So I laid there about an hour trying to think, and when Buck waked up I says:  ""Can you spell, Buck?"", ""Yes,"" he says., ""I bet you can't spell my name,"" says I., ""I bet you what you dare I can,"" says he., ""All right,"" says I, ""go ahead."", ""G-e-o-r-g-e J-a-x-o-n--there now,"" he says., ""Well,"" says I, ""you done it, but I didn't think you could., It ain't no slouch of a name to spell--right off without studying."", I set it down, private, because somebody might want ME to spell it next, and so I wanted to be handy with it and rattle it off like I was used to it., It was a mighty nice family, and a mighty nice house, too., I hadn't seen no house out in the country before that was so nice and had so much style., It didn't have an iron latch on the front door, nor a wooden one with a buckskin string, but a brass knob to turn, the same as houses in town., There warn't no bed in the parlor, nor a sign of a bed; but heaps of parlors in towns has beds in them., There was a big fireplace that was bricked on the bottom, and the bricks was kept clean and red by pouring water on them and scrubbing them with another brick; sometimes they wash them over with red water-paint that they call Spanish-brown, same as they do in town., They had big brass dog-irons that could hold up a saw-log., There was a clock on the middle of the mantelpiece, with a picture of a town painted on the bottom half of the glass front, and a round place in the middle of it for the sun, and you could see the pendulum swinging behind it., It was beautiful to hear that clock tick; and sometimes when one of these peddlers had been along and scoured her up and got her in good shape, she would start in and strike a hundred and fifty before she got tuckered out., They wouldn't took any money for her., Well, there was a big outlandish parrot on each side of the clock, made out of something like chalk, and painted up gaudy., By one of the parrots was a cat made of crockery, and a crockery dog by the other; and when you pressed down on them they squeaked, but didn't open their mouths nor look different nor interested., They squeaked through underneath., There was a couple of big wild-turkey-wing fans spread out behind those things., On the table in the middle of the room was a kind of a lovely crockery basket that had apples and oranges and peaches and grapes piled up in it, which was much redder and yellower and prettier than real ones is, but they warn't real because you could see where pieces had got chipped off and showed the white chalk, or whatever it was, underneath., This table had a cover made out of beautiful oilcloth, with a red and blue spread-eagle painted on it, and a painted border all around., It come all the way from Philadelphia, they said., There was some books, too, piled up perfectly exact, on each corner of the table., One was a big family Bible full of pictures., One was Pilgrim's Progress, about a man that left his family, it didn't say why., I read considerable in it now and then., The statements was interesting, but tough., Another was Friendship's Offering, full of beautiful stuff and poetry; but I didn't read the poetry., Another was Henry Clay's Speeches, and another was Dr. Gunn's Family Medicine, which told you all about what to do if a body was sick or dead., There was a hymn book, and a lot of other books., And there was nice split-bottom chairs, and perfectly sound, too--not bagged down in the middle and busted, like an old basket., They had pictures hung on the walls--mainly Washingtons and Lafayettes, and battles, and Highland Marys, and one called ""Signing the Declaration."", There was some that they called crayons, which one of the daughters which was dead made her own self when she was only fifteen years old., They was different from any pictures I ever see before --blacker, mostly, than is common., One was a woman in a slim black dress, belted small under the armpits, with bulges like a cabbage in the middle of the sleeves, and a large black scoop-shovel bonnet with a black veil, and white slim ankles crossed about with black tape, and very wee black slippers, like a chisel, and she was leaning pensive on a tombstone on her right elbow, under a weeping willow, and her other hand hanging down her side holding a white handkerchief and a reticule, and underneath the picture it said ""Shall I Never See Thee More Alas."", Another one was a young lady with her hair all combed up straight to the top of her head, and knotted there in front of a comb like a chair-back, and she was crying into a handkerchief and had a dead bird laying on its back in her other hand with its heels up, and underneath the picture it said ""I Shall Never Hear Thy Sweet Chirrup More Alas."", There was one where a young lady was at a window looking up at the moon, and tears running down her cheeks; and she had an open letter in one hand with black sealing wax showing on one edge of it, and she was mashing a locket with a chain to it against her mouth, and underneath the picture it said ""And Art Thou Gone Yes Thou Art Gone Alas."", These was all nice pictures, I reckon, but I didn't somehow seem to take to them, because if ever I was down a little they always give me the fan-tods., Everybody was sorry she died, because she had laid out a lot more of these pictures to do, and a body could see by what she had done what they had lost., But I reckoned that with her disposition she was having a better time in the graveyard., She was at work on what they said was her greatest picture when she took sick, and every day and every night it was her prayer to be allowed to live till she got it done, but she never got the chance., It was a picture of a young woman in a long white gown, standing on the rail of a bridge all ready to jump off, with her hair all down her back, and looking up to the moon, with the tears running down her face, and she had two arms folded across her breast, and two arms stretched out in front, and two more reaching up towards the moon--and the idea was to see which pair would look best, and then scratch out all the other arms; but, as I was saying, she died before she got her mind made up, and now they kept this picture over the head of the bed in her room, and every time her birthday come they hung flowers on it., Other times it was hid with a little curtain., The young woman in the picture had a kind of a nice sweet face, but there was so many arms it made her look too spidery, seemed to me., This young girl kept a scrap-book when she was alive, and used to paste obituaries and accidents and cases of patient suffering in it out of the Presbyterian Observer, and write poetry after them out of her own head., It was very good poetry., This is what she wrote about a boy by the name of Stephen Dowling Bots that fell down a well and was drownded:  ODE TO STEPHEN DOWLING BOTS, DEC'D  And did young Stephen sicken, And did young Stephen die?, And did the sad hearts thicken, And did the mourners cry?, No; such was not the fate of Young Stephen Dowling Bots; Though sad hearts round him thickened, 'Twas not from sickness' shots., No whooping-cough did rack his frame, Nor measles drear with spots; Not these impaired the sacred name Of Stephen Dowling Bots., Despised love struck not with woe That head of curly knots, Nor stomach troubles laid him low, Young Stephen Dowling Bots., O no., Then list with tearful eye, Whilst I his fate do tell., His soul did from this cold world fly By falling down a well., They got him out and emptied him; Alas it was too late; His spirit was gone for to sport aloft In the realms of the good and great., If Emmeline Grangerford could make poetry like that before she was fourteen, there ain't no telling what she could a done by and by., Buck said she could rattle off poetry like nothing., She didn't ever have to stop to think., He said she would slap down a line, and if she couldn't find anything to rhyme with it would just scratch it out and slap down another one, and go ahead., She warn't particular; she could write about anything you choose to give her to write about just so it was sadful., Every time a man died, or a woman died, or a child died, she would be on hand with her ""tribute"" before he was cold., She called them tributes., The neighbors said it was the doctor first, then Emmeline, then the undertaker--the undertaker never got in ahead of Emmeline but once, and then she hung fire on a rhyme for the dead person's name, which was Whistler., She warn't ever the same after that; she never complained, but she kinder pined away and did not live long., Poor thing, many's the time I made myself go up to the little room that used to be hers and get out her poor old scrap-book and read in it when her pictures had been aggravating me and I had soured on her a little., I liked all that family, dead ones and all, and warn't going to let anything come between us., Poor Emmeline made poetry about all the dead people when she was alive, and it didn't seem right that there warn't nobody to make some about her now she was gone; so I tried to sweat out a verse or two myself, but I couldn't seem to make it go somehow., They kept Emmeline's room trim and nice, and all the things fixed in it just the way she liked to have them when she was alive, and nobody ever slept there., The old lady took care of the room herself, though there was plenty of niggers, and she sewed there a good deal and read her Bible there mostly., Well, as I was saying about the parlor, there was beautiful curtains on the windows:  white, with pictures painted on them of castles with vines all down the walls, and cattle coming down to drink., There was a little old piano, too, that had tin pans in it, I reckon, and nothing was ever so lovely as to hear the young ladies sing ""The Last Link is Broken"" and play ""The Battle of Prague"" on it., The walls of all the rooms was plastered, and most had carpets on the floors, and the whole house was whitewashed on the outside., It was a double house, and the big open place betwixt them was roofed and floored, and sometimes the table was set there in the middle of the day, and it was a cool, comfortable place., Nothing couldn't be better., And warn't the cooking good, and just bushels of it too!, COL.  GRANGERFORD was a gentleman, you see., He was a gentleman all over; and so was his family., He was well born, as the saying is, and that's worth as much in a man as it is in a horse, so the Widow Douglas said, and nobody ever denied that she was of the first aristocracy in our town; and pap he always said it, too, though he warn't no more quality than a mudcat himself., Col.  Grangerford was very tall and very slim, and had a darkish-paly complexion, not a sign of red in it anywheres; he was clean shaved every morning all over his thin face, and he had the thinnest kind of lips, and the thinnest kind of nostrils, and a high nose, and heavy eyebrows, and the blackest kind of eyes, sunk so deep back that they seemed like they was looking out of caverns at you, as you may say., His forehead was high, and his hair was black and straight and hung to his shoulders., His hands was long and thin, and every day of his life he put on a clean shirt and a full suit from head to foot made out of linen so white it hurt your eyes to look at it; and on Sundays he wore a blue tail-coat with brass buttons on it., He carried a mahogany cane with a silver head to it., There warn't no frivolishness about him, not a bit, and he warn't ever loud., He was as kind as he could be--you could feel that, you know, and so you had confidence., Sometimes he smiled, and it was good to see; but when he straightened himself up like a liberty-pole, and the lightning begun to flicker out from under his eyebrows, you wanted to climb a tree first, and find out what the matter was afterwards., He didn't ever have to tell anybody to mind their manners --everybody was always good-mannered where he was., Everybody loved to have him around, too; he was sunshine most always--I mean he made it seem like good weather., When he turned into a cloudbank it was awful dark for half a minute, and that was enough; there wouldn't nothing go wrong again for a week., When him and the old lady come down in the morning all the family got up out of their chairs and give them good-day, and didn't set down again till they had set down., ...]",1
43,"[I reckon he can stand a little thing like that, can't he?"", ""I don't care whether 'twas little or whether 'twas big; he's here in our house and a stranger, and it wasn't good of you to say it., If you was in his place it would make you feel ashamed; and so you oughtn't to say a thing to another person that will make THEM feel ashamed."", ""Why, Maim, he said--""  ""It don't make no difference what he SAID--that ain't the thing., The thing is for you to treat him KIND, and not be saying things to make him remember he ain't in his own country and amongst his own folks."", I says to myself, THIS is a girl that I'm letting that old reptle rob her of her money!, Then Susan SHE waltzed in; and if you'll believe me, she did give Hare-lip hark from the tomb!, Says I to myself, and this is ANOTHER one that I'm letting him rob her of her money!, Then Mary Jane she took another inning, and went in sweet and lovely again--which was her way; but when she got done there warn't hardly anything left o' poor Hare-lip., So she hollered., ""All right, then,"" says the other girls; ""you just ask his pardon."", She done it, too; and she done it beautiful., She done it so beautiful it was good to hear; and I wished I could tell her a thousand lies, so she could do it again., I says to myself, this is ANOTHER one that I'm letting him rob her of her money., And when she got through they all jest laid theirselves out to make me feel at home and know I was amongst friends., I felt so ornery and low down and mean that I says to myself, my mind's made up; I'll hive that money for them or bust., So then I lit out--for bed, I said, meaning some time or another., When I got by myself I went to thinking the thing over., I says to myself, shall I go to that doctor, private, and blow on these frauds?, No--that won't do., He might tell who told him; then the king and the duke would make it warm for me., Shall I go, private, and tell Mary Jane?, No--I dasn't do it., Her face would give them a hint, sure; they've got the money, and they'd slide right out and get away with it., If she was to fetch in help I'd get mixed up in the business before it was done with, I judge., No; there ain't no good way but one., I got to steal that money, somehow; and I got to steal it some way that they won't suspicion that I done it., They've got a good thing here, and they ain't a-going to leave till they've played this family and this town for all they're worth, so I'll find a chance time enough., I'll steal it and hide it; and by and by, when I'm away down the river, I'll write a letter and tell Mary Jane where it's hid., But I better hive it tonight if I can, because the doctor maybe hasn't let up as much as he lets on he has; he might scare them out of here yet., So, thinks I, I'll go and search them rooms., Upstairs the hall was dark, but I found the duke's room, and started to paw around it with my hands; but I recollected it wouldn't be much like the king to let anybody else take care of that money but his own self; so then I went to his room and begun to paw around there., But I see I couldn't do nothing without a candle, and I dasn't light one, of course., So I judged I'd got to do the other thing--lay for them and eavesdrop., About that time I hears their footsteps coming, and was going to skip under the bed; I reached for it, but it wasn't where I thought it would be; but I touched the curtain that hid Mary Jane's frocks, so I jumped in behind that and snuggled in amongst the gowns, and stood there perfectly still., They come in and shut the door; and the first thing the duke done was to get down and look under the bed., Then I was glad I hadn't found the bed when I wanted it., And yet, you know, it's kind of natural to hide under the bed when you are up to anything private., They sets down then, and the king says:  ""Well, what is it?, And cut it middlin' short, because it's better for us to be down there a-whoopin' up the mournin' than up here givin' 'em a chance to talk us over."", ""Well, this is it, Capet., I ain't easy; I ain't comfortable., That doctor lays on my mind., I wanted to know your plans., I've got a notion, and I think it's a sound one."", ""What is it, duke?"", ""That we better glide out of this before three in the morning, and clip it down the river with what we've got., Specially, seeing we got it so easy--GIVEN back to us, flung at our heads, as you may say, when of course we allowed to have to steal it back., I'm for knocking off and lighting out."", That made me feel pretty bad., About an hour or two ago it would a been a little different, but now it made me feel bad and disappointed, The king rips out and says:  ""What!, And not sell out the rest o' the property?, March off like a passel of fools and leave eight or nine thous'n' dollars' worth o' property layin' around jest sufferin' to be scooped in?--and all good, salable stuff, too."", The duke he grumbled; said the bag of gold was enough, and he didn't want to go no deeper--didn't want to rob a lot of orphans of EVERYTHING they had., ""Why, how you talk!"", says the king., ""We sha'n't rob 'em of nothing at all but jest this money., The people that BUYS the property is the suff'rers; because as soon 's it's found out 'at we didn't own it--which won't be long after we've slid--the sale won't be valid, and it 'll all go back to the estate., These yer orphans 'll git their house back agin, and that's enough for THEM; they're young and spry, and k'n easy earn a livin'., THEY ain't a-goin to suffer., Why, jest think--there's thous'n's and thous'n's that ain't nigh so well off., Bless you, THEY ain't got noth'n' to complain of."", Well, the king he talked him blind; so at last he give in, and said all right, but said he believed it was blamed foolishness to stay, and that doctor hanging over them., But the king says:  ""Cuss the doctor!, What do we k'yer for HIM?, Hain't we got all the fools in town on our side?, And ain't that a big enough majority in any town?"", So they got ready to go down stairs again., The duke says:  ""I don't think we put that money in a good place."", That cheered me up., I'd begun to think I warn't going to get a hint of no kind to help me., The king says:  ""Why?"", ""Because Mary Jane 'll be in mourning from this out; and first you know the nigger that does up the rooms will get an order to box these duds up and put 'em away; and do you reckon a nigger can run across money and not borrow some of it?"", ""Your head's level agin, duke,"" says the king; and he comes a-fumbling under the curtain two or three foot from where I was., I stuck tight to the wall and kept mighty still, though quivery; and I wondered what them fellows would say to me if they catched me; and I tried to think what I'd better do if they did catch me., But the king he got the bag before I could think more than about a half a thought, and he never suspicioned I was around., They took and shoved the bag through a rip in the straw tick that was under the feather-bed, and crammed it in a foot or two amongst the straw and said it was all right now, because a nigger only makes up the feather-bed, and don't turn over the straw tick only about twice a year, and so it warn't in no danger of getting stole now., But I knowed better., I had it out of there before they was half-way down stairs., I groped along up to my cubby, and hid it there till I could get a chance to do better., I judged I better hide it outside of the house somewheres, because if they missed it they would give the house a good ransacking:  I knowed that very well., Then I turned in, with my clothes all on; but I couldn't a gone to sleep if I'd a wanted to, I was in such a sweat to get through with the business., By and by I heard the king and the duke come up; so I rolled off my pallet and laid with my chin at the top of my ladder, and waited to see if anything was going to happen., But nothing did., So I held on till all the late sounds had quit and the early ones hadn't begun yet; and then I slipped down the ladder., I CREPT to their doors and listened; they was snoring., So I tiptoed along, and got down stairs all right., There warn't a sound anywheres., I peeped through a crack of the dining-room door, and see the men that was watching the corpse all sound asleep on their chairs., The door was open into the parlor, where the corpse was laying, and there was a candle in both rooms., I passed along, and the parlor door was open; but I see there warn't nobody in there but the remainders of Peter; so I shoved on by; but the front door was locked, and the key wasn't there., Just then I heard somebody coming down the stairs, back behind me., I run in the parlor and took a swift look around, and the only place I see to hide the bag was in the coffin., The lid was shoved along about a foot, showing the dead man's face down in there, with a wet cloth over it, and his shroud on., I tucked the money-bag in under the lid, just down beyond where his hands was crossed, which made me creep, they was so cold, and then I run back across the room and in behind the door., The person coming was Mary Jane., She went to the coffin, very soft, and kneeled down and looked in; then she put up her handkerchief, and I see she begun to cry, though I couldn't hear her, and her back was to me., I slid out, and as I passed the dining-room I thought I'd make sure them watchers hadn't seen me; so I looked through the crack, and everything was all right., They hadn't stirred., I slipped up to bed, feeling ruther blue, on accounts of the thing playing out that way after I had took so much trouble and run so much resk about it., ...]",1
44,"[Well, as I was saying, we waited that morning till everybody was settled down to business, and nobody in sight around the yard; then Tom he carried the sack into the lean-to whilst I stood off a piece to keep watch., By and by he come out, and we went and set down on the woodpile to talk., He says:  ""Everything's all right now except tools; and that's easy fixed."", ""Tools?"", I says., ""Yes."", ""Tools for what?"", ""Why, to dig with., We ain't a-going to GNAW him out, are we?"", ""Ain't them old crippled picks and things in there good enough to dig a nigger out with?"", I says., He turns on me, looking pitying enough to make a body cry, and says:  ""Huck Finn, did you EVER hear of a prisoner having picks and shovels, and all the modern conveniences in his wardrobe to dig himself out with?, Now I want to ask you--if you got any reasonableness in you at all--what kind of a show would THAT give him to be a hero?, Why, they might as well lend him the key and done with it., Picks and shovels--why, they wouldn't furnish 'em to a king."", ""Well, then,"" I says, ""if we don't want the picks and shovels, what do we want?"", ""A couple of case-knives."", ""To dig the foundations out from under that cabin with?"", ""Yes."", ""Confound it, it's foolish, Tom."", ""It don't make no difference how foolish it is, it's the RIGHT way--and it's the regular way., And there ain't no OTHER way, that ever I heard of, and I've read all the books that gives any information about these things., They always dig out with a case-knife--and not through dirt, mind you; generly it's through solid rock., And it takes them weeks and weeks and weeks, and for ever and ever., Why, look at one of them prisoners in the bottom dungeon of the Castle Deef, in the harbor of Marseilles, that dug himself out that way; how long was HE at it, you reckon?"", ""I don't know."", ""Well, guess."", ""I don't know., A month and a half."", ""THIRTY-SEVEN YEAR--and he come out in China., THAT'S the kind., I wish the bottom of THIS fortress was solid rock."", ""JIM don't know nobody in China."", ""What's THAT got to do with it?, Neither did that other fellow., But you're always a-wandering off on a side issue., Why can't you stick to the main point?"", ""All right--I don't care where he comes out, so he COMES out; and Jim don't, either, I reckon., But there's one thing, anyway--Jim's too old to be dug out with a case-knife., He won't last."", ""Yes he will LAST, too., You don't reckon it's going to take thirty-seven years to dig out through a DIRT foundation, do you?"", ""How long will it take, Tom?"", ""Well, we can't resk being as long as we ought to, because it mayn't take very long for Uncle Silas to hear from down there by New Orleans., He'll hear Jim ain't from there., Then his next move will be to advertise Jim, or something like that., So we can't resk being as long digging him out as we ought to., By rights I reckon we ought to be a couple of years; but we can't., Things being so uncertain, what I recommend is this:  that we really dig right in, as quick as we can; and after that, we can LET ON, to ourselves, that we was at it thirty-seven years., Then we can snatch him out and rush him away the first time there's an alarm., Yes, I reckon that 'll be the best way."", ""Now, there's SENSE in that,"" I says., ""Letting on don't cost nothing; letting on ain't no trouble; and if it's any object, I don't mind letting on we was at it a hundred and fifty year., It wouldn't strain me none, after I got my hand in., So I'll mosey along now, and smouch a couple of case-knives."", ""Smouch three,"" he says; ""we want one to make a saw out of."", ""Tom, if it ain't unregular and irreligious to sejest it,"" I says, ""there's an old rusty saw-blade around yonder sticking under the weather-boarding behind the smoke-house."", He looked kind of weary and discouraged-like, and says:  ""It ain't no use to try to learn you nothing, Huck., Run along and smouch the knives--three of them."", So I done it., AS soon as we reckoned everybody was asleep that night we went down the lightning-rod, and shut ourselves up in the lean-to, and got out our pile of fox-fire, and went to work., We cleared everything out of the way, about four or five foot along the middle of the bottom log., Tom said we was right behind Jim's bed now, and we'd dig in under it, and when we got through there couldn't nobody in the cabin ever know there was any hole there, because Jim's counter-pin hung down most to the ground, and you'd have to raise it up and look under to see the hole., So we dug and dug with the case-knives till most midnight; and then we was dog-tired, and our hands was blistered, and yet you couldn't see we'd done anything hardly., At last I says:  ""This ain't no thirty-seven year job; this is a thirty-eight year job, Tom Sawyer."", He never said nothing., But he sighed, and pretty soon he stopped digging, and then for a good little while I knowed that he was thinking., Then he says:  ""It ain't no use, Huck, it ain't a-going to work., If we was prisoners it would, because then we'd have as many years as we wanted, and no hurry; and we wouldn't get but a few minutes to dig, every day, while they was changing watches, and so our hands wouldn't get blistered, and we could keep it up right along, year in and year out, and do it right, and the way it ought to be done., But WE can't fool along; we got to rush; we ain't got no time to spare., If we was to put in another night this way we'd have to knock off for a week to let our hands get well--couldn't touch a case-knife with them sooner."", ""Well, then, what we going to do, Tom?"", ""I'll tell you., It ain't right, and it ain't moral, and I wouldn't like it to get out; but there ain't only just the one way:  we got to dig him out with the picks, and LET ON it's case-knives."", ""NOW you're TALKING!"", I says; ""your head gets leveler and leveler all the time, Tom Sawyer,"" I says., ""Picks is the thing, moral or no moral; and as for me, I don't care shucks for the morality of it, nohow., When I start in to steal a nigger, or a watermelon, or a Sunday-school book, I ain't no ways particular how it's done so it's done., What I want is my nigger; or what I want is my watermelon; or what I want is my Sunday-school book; and if a pick's the handiest thing, that's the thing I'm a-going to dig that nigger or that watermelon or that Sunday-school book out with; and I don't give a dead rat what the authorities thinks about it nuther."", ""Well,"" he says, ""there's excuse for picks and letting-on in a case like this; if it warn't so, I wouldn't approve of it, nor I wouldn't stand by and see the rules broke--because right is right, and wrong is wrong, and a body ain't got no business doing wrong when he ain't ignorant and knows better., It might answer for YOU to dig Jim out with a pick, WITHOUT any letting on, because you don't know no better; but it wouldn't for me, because I do know better., Gimme a case-knife."", He had his own by him, but I handed him mine., He flung it down, and says:  ""Gimme a CASE-KNIFE."", I didn't know just what to do--but then I thought., I scratched around amongst the old tools, and got a pickaxe and give it to him, and he took it and went to work, and never said a word., He was always just that particular., Full of principle., So then I got a shovel, and then we picked and shoveled, turn about, and made the fur fly., We stuck to it about a half an hour, which was as long as we could stand up; but we had a good deal of a hole to show for it., When I got up stairs I looked out at the window and see Tom doing his level best with the lightning-rod, but he couldn't come it, his hands was so sore., At last he says:  ""It ain't no use, it can't be done., What you reckon I better do?, Can't you think of no way?"", ""Yes,"" I says, ""but I reckon it ain't regular., Come up the stairs, and let on it's a lightning-rod."", So he done it., Next day Tom stole a pewter spoon and a brass candlestick in the house, for to make some pens for Jim out of, and six tallow candles; and I hung around the nigger cabins and laid for a chance, and stole three tin plates., Tom says it wasn't enough; but I said nobody wouldn't ever see the plates that Jim throwed out, because they'd fall in the dog-fennel and jimpson weeds under the window-hole--then we could tote them back and he could use them over again., So Tom was satisfied., ...]",1
45,"[The king said:  ""Be merciful, fair sir, and essay no further in this perilous matter, lest disaster follow., It was reported to us that your powers could not attain unto their full strength until the morrow; but--""  ""Your Majesty thinks the report may have been a lie?, It _was_ a lie."", That made an immense effect; up went appealing hands everywhere, and the king was assailed with a storm of supplications that I might be bought off at any price, and the calamity stayed., The king was eager to comply., He said:  ""Name any terms, reverend sir, even to the halving of my kingdom; but banish this calamity, spare the sun!"", My fortune was made., I would have taken him up in a minute, but I couldn't stop an eclipse; the thing was out of the question., So I asked time to consider., The king said:  ""How long--ah, how long, good sir?, Be merciful; look, it groweth darker, moment by moment., Prithee how long?"", ""Not long., Half an hour--maybe an hour."", There were a thousand pathetic protests, but I couldn't shorten up any, for I couldn't remember how long a total eclipse lasts., I was in a puzzled condition, anyway, and wanted to think., Something was wrong about that eclipse, and the fact was very unsettling., If this wasn't the one I was after, how was I to tell whether this was the sixth century, or nothing but a dream?, Dear me, if I could only prove it was the latter!, Here was a glad new hope., If the boy was right about the date, and this was surely the 20th, it _wasn't_ the sixth century., I reached for the monk's sleeve, in considerable excitement, and asked him what day of the month it was., Hang him, he said it was the _twenty-first_!, It made me turn cold to hear him., I begged him not to make any mistake about it; but he was sure; he knew it was the 21st., So, that feather-headed boy had botched things again!, The time of the day was right for the eclipse; I had seen that for myself, in the beginning, by the dial that was near by., Yes, I was in King Arthur's court, and I might as well make the most out of it I could., The darkness was steadily growing, the people becoming more and more distressed., I now said:  ""I have reflected, Sir King., For a lesson, I will let this darkness proceed, and spread night in the world; but whether I blot out the sun for good, or restore it, shall rest with you., These are the terms, to wit: You shall remain king over all your dominions, and receive all the glories and honors that belong to the kingship; but you shall appoint me your perpetual minister and executive, and give me for my services one per cent of such actual increase of revenue over and above its present amount as I may succeed in creating for the state., If I can't live on that, I sha'n't ask anybody to give me a lift., Is it satisfactory?"", There was a prodigious roar of applause, and out of the midst of it the king's voice rose, saying:  ""Away with his bonds, and set him free!, and do him homage, high and low, rich and poor, for he is become the king's right hand, is clothed with power and authority, and his seat is upon the highest step of the throne!, Now sweep away this creeping night, and bring the light and cheer again, that all the world may bless thee."", But I said:  ""That a common man should be shamed before the world, is nothing; but it were dishonor to the _king_ if any that saw his minister naked should not also see him delivered from his shame., If I might ask that my clothes be brought again--""  ""They are not meet,"" the king broke in., ""Fetch raiment of another sort; clothe him like a prince!"", My idea worked., I wanted to keep things as they were till the eclipse was total, otherwise they would be trying again to get me to dismiss the darkness, and of course I couldn't do it., Sending for the clothes gained some delay, but not enough., So I had to make another excuse., I said it would be but natural if the king should change his mind and repent to some extent of what he had done under excitement; therefore I would let the darkness grow a while, and if at the end of a reasonable time the king had kept his mind the same, the darkness should be dismissed., Neither the king nor anybody else was satisfied with that arrangement, but I had to stick to my point., It grew darker and darker and blacker and blacker, while I struggled with those awkward sixth-century clothes., It got to be pitch dark, at last, and the multitude groaned with horror to feel the cold uncanny night breezes fan through the place and see the stars come out and twinkle in the sky., At last the eclipse was total, and I was very glad of it, but everybody else was in misery; which was quite natural., I said:  ""The king, by his silence, still stands to the terms."", Then I lifted up my hands--stood just so a moment--then I said, with the most awful solemnity: ""Let the enchantment dissolve and pass harmless away!"", There was no response, for a moment, in that deep darkness and that graveyard hush., But when the silver rim of the sun pushed itself out, a moment or two later, the assemblage broke loose with a vast shout and came pouring down like a deluge to smother me with blessings and gratitude; and Clarence was not the last of the wash, to be sure., Inasmuch as I was now the second personage in the Kingdom, as far as political power and authority were concerned, much was made of me., My raiment was of silks and velvets and cloth of gold, and by consequence was very showy, also uncomfortable., But habit would soon reconcile me to my clothes; I was aware of that., I was given the choicest suite of apartments in the castle, after the king's., They were aglow with loud-colored silken hangings, but the stone floors had nothing but rushes on them for a carpet, and they were misfit rushes at that, being not all of one breed., As for conveniences, properly speaking, there weren't any., I mean _little_ conveniences; it is the little conveniences that make the real comfort of life., The big oaken chairs, graced with rude carvings, were well enough, but that was the stopping place., There was no soap, no matches, no looking-glass--except a metal one, about as powerful as a pail of water., And not a chromo., I had been used to chromos for years, and I saw now that without my suspecting it a passion for art had got worked into the fabric of my being, and was become a part of me., It made me homesick to look around over this proud and gaudy but heartless barrenness and remember that in our house in East Hartford, all unpretending as it was, you couldn't go into a room but you would find an insurance-chromo, or at least a three-color God-Bless-Our-Home over the door; and in the parlor we had nine., But here, even in my grand room of state, there wasn't anything in the nature of a picture except a thing the size of a bedquilt, which was either woven or knitted (it had darned places in it), and nothing in it was the right color or the right shape; and as for proportions, even Raphael himself couldn't have botched them more formidably, after all his practice on those nightmares they call his ""celebrated Hampton Court cartoons."", Raphael was a bird., We had several of his chromos; one was his ""Miraculous Draught of Fishes,"" where he puts in a miracle of his own--puts three men into a canoe which wouldn't have held a dog without upsetting., I always admired to study R.'s art, it was so fresh and unconventional., There wasn't even a bell or a speaking-tube in the castle., I had a great many servants, and those that were on duty lolled in the anteroom; and when I wanted one of them I had to go and call for him., There was no gas, there were no candles; a bronze dish half full of boarding-house butter with a blazing rag floating in it was the thing that produced what was regarded as light., A lot of these hung along the walls and modified the dark, just toned it down enough to make it dismal., If you went out at night, your servants carried torches., There were no books, pens, paper or ink, and no glass in the openings they believed to be windows., It is a little thing--glass is--until it is absent, then it becomes a big thing., But perhaps the worst of all was, that there wasn't any sugar, coffee, tea, or tobacco., I saw that I was just another Robinson Crusoe cast away on an uninhabited island, with no society but some more or less tame animals, and if I wanted to make life bearable I must do as he did--invent, contrive, create, reorganize things; set brain and hand to work, and keep them busy., Well, that was in my line., One thing troubled me along at first--the immense interest which people took in me., Apparently the whole nation wanted a look at me., It soon transpired that the eclipse had scared the British world almost to death; that while it lasted the whole country, from one end to the other, was in a pitiable state of panic, and the churches, hermitages, and monkeries overflowed with praying and weeping poor creatures who thought the end of the world was come., Then had followed the news that the producer of this awful event was a stranger, a mighty magician at Arthur's court; that he could have blown out the sun like a candle, and was just going to do it when his mercy was purchased, and he then dissolved his enchantments, and was now recognized and honored as the man who had by his unaided might saved the globe from destruction and its peoples from extinction., Now if you consider that everybody believed that, and not only believed it, but never even dreamed of doubting it, you will easily understand that there was not a person in all Britain that would not have walked fifty miles to get a sight of me., Of course I was all the talk--all other subjects were dropped; even the king became suddenly a person of minor interest and notoriety., Within twenty-four hours the delegations began to arrive, and from that time onward for a fortnight they kept coming., The village was crowded, and all the countryside., I had to go out a dozen times a day and show myself to these reverent and awe-stricken multitudes., It came to be a great burden, as to time and trouble, but of course it was at the same time compensatingly agreeable to be so celebrated and such a center of homage., It turned Brer Merlin green with envy and spite, which was a great satisfaction to me., But there was one thing I couldn't understand--nobody had asked for an autograph., I spoke to Clarence about it., By George!, I had to explain to him what it was., Then he said nobody in the country could read or write but a few dozen priests., Land!, think of that., There was another thing that troubled me a little., Those multitudes presently began to agitate for another miracle., That was natural., ...]",1
46,"[Between six and nine we made ten miles, which was plenty for a horse carrying triple--man, woman, and armor; then we stopped for a long nooning under some trees by a limpid brook., Right so came by and by a knight riding; and as he drew near he made dolorous moan, and by the words of it I perceived that he was cursing and swearing; yet nevertheless was I glad of his coming, for that I saw he bore a bulletin-board whereon in letters all of shining gold was writ:      ""USE PETERSON'S PROPHYLACTIC TOOTH-BRUSH--ALL THE GO."", I was glad of his coming, for even by this token I knew him for knight of mine., It was Sir Madok de la Montaine, a burly great fellow whose chief distinction was that he had come within an ace of sending Sir Launcelot down over his horse-tail once., He was never long in a stranger's presence without finding some pretext or other to let out that great fact., But there was another fact of nearly the same size, which he never pushed upon anybody unasked, and yet never withheld when asked: that was, that the reason he didn't quite succeed was, that he was interrupted and sent down over horse-tail himself., This innocent vast lubber did not see any particular difference between the two facts., I liked him, for he was earnest in his work, and very valuable., And he was so fine to look at, with his broad mailed shoulders, and the grand leonine set of his plumed head, and his big shield with its quaint device of a gauntleted hand clutching a prophylactic tooth-brush, with motto: ""Try Noyoudont."", This was a tooth-wash that I was introducing., He was aweary, he said, and indeed he looked it; but he would not alight., He said he was after the stove-polish man; and with this he broke out cursing and swearing anew., The bulletin-boarder referred to was Sir Ossaise of Surluse, a brave knight, and of considerable celebrity on account of his having tried conclusions in a tournament once, with no less a Mogul than Sir Gaheris himself--although not successfully., He was of a light and laughing disposition, and to him nothing in this world was serious., It was for this reason that I had chosen him to work up a stove-polish sentiment., There were no stoves yet, and so there could be nothing serious about stove-polish., All that the agent needed to do was to deftly and by degrees prepare the public for the great change, and have them established in predilections toward neatness against the time when the stove should appear upon the stage., Sir Madok was very bitter, and brake out anew with cursings., He said he had cursed his soul to rags; and yet he would not get down from his horse, neither would he take any rest, or listen to any comfort, until he should have found Sir Ossaise and settled this account., It appeared, by what I could piece together of the unprofane fragments of his statement, that he had chanced upon Sir Ossaise at dawn of the morning, and been told that if he would make a short cut across the fields and swamps and broken hills and glades, he could head off a company of travelers who would be rare customers for prophylactics and tooth-wash.  With characteristic zeal Sir Madok had plunged away at once upon this quest, and after three hours of awful crosslot riding had overhauled his game., And behold, it was the five patriarchs that had been released from the dungeons the evening before!, Poor old creatures, it was all of twenty years since any one of them had known what it was to be equipped with any remaining snag or remnant of a tooth., ""Blank-blank-blank him,"" said Sir Madok, ""an I do not stove-polish him an I may find him, leave it to me; for never no knight that hight Ossaise or aught else may do me this disservice and bide on live, an I may find him, the which I have thereunto sworn a great oath this day."", And with these words and others, he lightly took his spear and gat him thence., In the middle of the afternoon we came upon one of those very patriarchs ourselves, in the edge of a poor village., He was basking in the love of relatives and friends whom he had not seen for fifty years; and about him and caressing him were also descendants of his own body whom he had never seen at all till now; but to him these were all strangers, his memory was gone, his mind was stagnant., It seemed incredible that a man could outlast half a century shut up in a dark hole like a rat, but here were his old wife and some old comrades to testify to it., They could remember him as he was in the freshness and strength of his young manhood, when he kissed his child and delivered it to its mother's hands and went away into that long oblivion., The people at the castle could not tell within half a generation the length of time the man had been shut up there for his unrecorded and forgotten offense; but this old wife knew; and so did her old child, who stood there among her married sons and daughters trying to realize a father who had been to her a name, a thought, a formless image, a tradition, all her life, and now was suddenly concreted into actual flesh and blood and set before her face., It was a curious situation; yet it is not on that account that I have made room for it here, but on account of a thing which seemed to me still more curious., To wit, that this dreadful matter brought from these downtrodden people no outburst of rage against these oppressors., They had been heritors and subjects of cruelty and outrage so long that nothing could have startled them but a kindness., Yes, here was a curious revelation, indeed, of the depth to which this people had been sunk in slavery., Their entire being was reduced to a monotonous dead level of patience, resignation, dumb uncomplaining acceptance of whatever might befall them in this life., Their very imagination was dead., When you can say that of a man, he has struck bottom, I reckon; there is no lower deep for him., I rather wished I had gone some other road., This was not the sort of experience for a statesman to encounter who was planning out a peaceful revolution in his mind., For it could not help bringing up the unget-aroundable fact that, all gentle cant and philosophizing to the contrary notwithstanding, no people in the world ever did achieve their freedom by goody-goody talk and moral suasion: it being immutable law that all revolutions that will succeed must _begin_ in blood, whatever may answer afterward., If history teaches anything, it teaches that., What this folk needed, then, was a Reign of Terror and a guillotine, and I was the wrong man for them., Two days later, toward noon, Sandy began to show signs of excitement and feverish expectancy., She said we were approaching the ogre's castle., I was surprised into an uncomfortable shock., The object of our quest had gradually dropped out of my mind; this sudden resurrection of it made it seem quite a real and startling thing for a moment, and roused up in me a smart interest., Sandy's excitement increased every moment; and so did mine, for that sort of thing is catching., My heart got to thumping., You can't reason with your heart; it has its own laws, and thumps about things which the intellect scorns., Presently, when Sandy slid from the horse, motioned me to stop, and went creeping stealthily, with her head bent nearly to her knees, toward a row of bushes that bordered a declivity, the thumpings grew stronger and quicker., And they kept it up while she was gaining her ambush and getting her glimpse over the declivity; and also while I was creeping to her side on my knees., Her eyes were burning now, as she pointed with her finger, and said in a panting whisper:  ""The castle!, The castle!, Lo, where it looms!"", What a welcome disappointment I experienced!, I said:  ""Castle?, It is nothing but a pigsty; a pigsty with a wattled fence around it."", She looked surprised and distressed., The animation faded out of her face; and during many moments she was lost in thought and silent., Then:  ""It was not enchanted aforetime,"" she said in a musing fashion, as if to herself., ""And how strange is this marvel, and how awful --that to the one perception it is enchanted and dight in a base and shameful aspect; yet to the perception of the other it is not enchanted, hath suffered no change, but stands firm and stately still, girt with its moat and waving its banners in the blue air from its towers., And God shield us, how it pricks the heart to see again these gracious captives, and the sorrow deepened in their sweet faces!, We have tarried along, and are to blame."", I saw my cue., The castle was enchanted to _me_, not to her., It would be wasted time to try to argue her out of her delusion, it couldn't be done; I must just humor it., So I said:  ""This is a common case--the enchanting of a thing to one eye and leaving it in its proper form to another., You have heard of it before, Sandy, though you haven't happened to experience it., But no harm is done., In fact, it is lucky the way it is., If these ladies were hogs to everybody and to themselves, it would be necessary to break the enchantment, and that might be impossible if one failed to find out the particular process of the enchantment., And hazardous, too; for in attempting a disenchantment without the true key, you are liable to err, and turn your hogs into dogs, and the dogs into cats, the cats into rats, and so on, and end by reducing your materials to nothing finally, or to an odorless gas which you can't follow--which, of course, amounts to the same thing., But here, by good luck, no one's eyes but mine are under the enchantment, and so it is of no consequence to dissolve it., These ladies remain ladies to you, and to themselves, and to everybody else; and at the same time they will suffer in no way from my delusion, for when I know that an ostensible hog is a lady, that is enough for me, I know how to treat her."", ""Thanks, oh, sweet my lord, thou talkest like an angel., And I know that thou wilt deliver them, for that thou art minded to great deeds and art as strong a knight of your hands and as brave to will and to do, as any that is on live."", ""I will not leave a princess in the sty, Sandy., Are those three yonder that to my disordered eyes are starveling swine-herds--""  ""The ogres, Are _they_ changed also?, It is most wonderful., Now am I fearful; for how canst thou strike with sure aim when five of their nine cubits of stature are to thee invisible?, Ah, go warily, fair sir; this is a mightier emprise than I wend."", ""You be easy, Sandy., All I need to know is, how _much_ of an ogre is invisible; then I know how to locate his vitals., Don't you be afraid, I will make short work of these bunco-steerers., Stay where you are."", I left Sandy kneeling there, corpse-faced but plucky and hopeful, and rode down to the pigsty, and struck up a trade with the swine-herds., I won their gratitude by buying out all the hogs at the lump sum of sixteen pennies, which was rather above latest quotations., I was just in time; for the Church, the lord of the manor, and the rest of the tax-gatherers would have been along next day and swept off pretty much all the stock, leaving the swine-herds very short of hogs and Sandy out of princesses., But now the tax people could be paid in cash, and there would be a stake left besides., One of the men had ten children; and he said that last year when a priest came and of his ten pigs took the fattest one for tithes, the wife burst out upon him, and offered him a child and said:  ""Thou beast without bowels of mercy, why leave me my child, yet rob me of the wherewithal to feed it?"", How curious., The same thing had happened in the Wales of my day, under this same old Established Church, which was supposed by many to have changed its nature when it changed its disguise., I sent the three men away, and then opened the sty gate and beckoned Sandy to come--which she did; and not leisurely, but with the rush of a prairie fire., And when I saw her fling herself upon those hogs, with tears of joy running down her cheeks, and strain them to her heart, and kiss them, and caress them, and call them reverently by grand princely names, I was ashamed of her, ashamed of the human race., We had to drive those hogs home--ten miles; and no ladies were ever more fickle-minded or contrary., They would stay in no road, no path; they broke out through the brush on all sides, and flowed away in all directions, over rocks, and hills, and the roughest places they could find., And they must not be struck, or roughly accosted; Sandy could not bear to see them treated in ways unbecoming their rank., The troublesomest old sow of the lot had to be called my Lady, and your Highness, like the rest., It is annoying and difficult to scour around after hogs, in armor., There was one small countess, with an iron ring in her snout and hardly any hair on her back, that was the devil for perversity., She gave me a race of an hour, over all sorts of country, and then we were right where we had started from, having made not a rod of real progress., ...]",1
47,"[""Pretty fair--pretty fair., Chin a little lower, please--there, very good., Eyes too high; pray don't look at the horizon, look at the ground, ten steps in front of you., Ah--that is better, that is very good., Wait, please; you betray too much vigor, too much decision; you want more of a shamble., Look at me, please--this is what I mean....  Now you are getting it; that is the idea--at least, it sort of approaches it...., Yes, that is pretty fair., _But!_ There is a great big something wanting, I don't quite know what it is., Please walk thirty yards, so that I can get a perspective on the thing....

Nay, but me no buts, offer me no objections., I will have the thing., Strap it upon my back."", He was complete now with that knapsack on, and looked as little like a king as any man I had ever seen., But it was an obstinate pair of shoulders; they could not seem to learn the trick of stooping with any sort of deceptive naturalness., The drill went on, I prompting and correcting:  ""Now, make believe you are in debt, and eaten up by relentless creditors; you are out of work--which is horse-shoeing, let us say--and can get none; and your wife is sick, your children are crying because they are hungry--""  And so on, and so on., I drilled him as representing in turn all sorts of people out of luck and suffering dire privations and misfortunes., But lord, it was only just words, words--they meant nothing in the world to him, I might just as well have whistled., Words realize nothing, vivify nothing to you, unless you have suffered in your own person the thing which the words try to describe., There are wise people who talk ever so knowingly and complacently about ""the working classes,"" and satisfy themselves that a day's hard intellectual work is very much harder than a day's hard manual toil, and is righteously entitled to much bigger pay., Why, they really think that, you know, because they know all about the one, but haven't tried the other., But I know all about both; and so far as I am concerned, there isn't money enough in the universe to hire me to swing a pickaxe thirty days, but I will do the hardest kind of intellectual work for just as near nothing as you can cipher it down--and I will be satisfied, too., Intellectual ""work"" is misnamed; it is a pleasure, a dissipation, and is its own highest reward., The poorest paid architect, engineer, general, author, sculptor, painter, lecturer, advocate, legislator, actor, preacher, singer is constructively in heaven when he is at work; and as for the musician with the fiddle-bow in his hand who sits in the midst of a great orchestra with the ebbing and flowing tides of divine sound washing over him--why, certainly, he is at work, if you wish to call it that, but lord, it's a sarcasm just the same., The law of work does seem utterly unfair--but there it is, and nothing can change it: the higher the pay in enjoyment the worker gets out of it, the higher shall be his pay in cash, also., And it's also the very law of those transparent swindles, transmissible nobility and kingship., When we arrived at that hut at mid-afternoon, we saw no signs of life about it., The field near by had been denuded of its crop some time before, and had a skinned look, so exhaustively had it been harvested and gleaned., Fences, sheds, everything had a ruined look, and were eloquent of poverty., No animal was around anywhere, no living thing in sight., The stillness was awful, it was like the stillness of death., The cabin was a one-story one, whose thatch was black with age, and ragged from lack of repair., The door stood a trifle ajar., We approached it stealthily--on tiptoe and at half-breath--for that is the way one's feeling makes him do, at such a time., The king knocked., We waited., No answer., Knocked again., No answer., I pushed the door softly open and looked in., I made out some dim forms, and a woman started up from the ground and stared at me, as one does who is wakened from sleep., Presently she found her voice:  ""Have mercy!"", she pleaded., ""All is taken, nothing is left."", ""I have not come to take anything, poor woman."", ""You are not a priest?"", ""No."", ""Nor come not from the lord of the manor?"", ""No, I am a stranger."", ""Oh, then, for the fear of God, who visits with misery and death such as be harmless, tarry not here, but fly!, This place is under his curse--and his Church's."", ""Let me come in and help you--you are sick and in trouble."", I was better used to the dim light now., ...]",1
48,"[So he gave up at last, and left the king in possession of his style unimpaired., The fact is, the king was a good deal more than a king, he was a man; and when a man is a man, you can't knock it out of him., We had a rough time for a month, tramping to and fro in the earth, and suffering., And what Englishman was the most interested in the slavery question by that time?, His grace the king!, Yes; from being the most indifferent, he was become the most interested., He was become the bitterest hater of the institution I had ever heard talk., And so I ventured to ask once more a question which I had asked years before and had gotten such a sharp answer that I had not thought it prudent to meddle in the matter further., Would he abolish slavery?, His answer was as sharp as before, but it was music this time; I shouldn't ever wish to hear pleasanter, though the profanity was not good, being awkwardly put together, and with the crash-word almost in the middle instead of at the end, where, of course, it ought to have been., I was ready and willing to get free now; I hadn't wanted to get free any sooner., No, I cannot quite say that., I had wanted to, but I had not been willing to take desperate chances, and had always dissuaded the king from them., But now--ah, it was a new atmosphere!, Liberty would be worth any cost that might be put upon it now., I set about a plan, and was straightway charmed with it., It would require time, yes, and patience, too, a great deal of both., One could invent quicker ways, and fully as sure ones; but none that would be as picturesque as this; none that could be made so dramatic., And so I was not going to give this one up., It might delay us months, but no matter, I would carry it out or break something., Now and then we had an adventure., One night we were overtaken by a snow-storm while still a mile from the village we were making for., Almost instantly we were shut up as in a fog, the driving snow was so thick., You couldn't see a thing, and we were soon lost., The slave-driver lashed us desperately, for he saw ruin before him, but his lashings only made matters worse, for they drove us further from the road and from likelihood of succor., So we had to stop at last and slump down in the snow where we were., The storm continued until toward midnight, then ceased., By this time two of our feebler men and three of our women were dead, and others past moving and threatened with death., Our master was nearly beside himself., He stirred up the living, and made us stand, jump, slap ourselves, to restore our circulation, and he helped as well as he could with his whip., Now came a diversion., We heard shrieks and yells, and soon a woman came running and crying; and seeing our group, she flung herself into our midst and begged for protection., A mob of people came tearing after her, some with torches, and they said she was a witch who had caused several cows to die by a strange disease, and practiced her arts by help of a devil in the form of a black cat., This poor woman had been stoned until she hardly looked human, she was so battered and bloody., The mob wanted to burn her., Well, now, what do you suppose our master did?, When we closed around this poor creature to shelter her, he saw his chance., He said, burn her here, or they shouldn't have her at all., Imagine that!, They were willing., They fastened her to a post; they brought wood and piled it about her; they applied the torch while she shrieked and pleaded and strained her two young daughters to her breast; and our brute, with a heart solely for business, lashed us into position about the stake and warmed us into life and commercial value by the same fire which took away the innocent life of that poor harmless mother., That was the sort of master we had., I took _his_ number., That snow-storm cost him nine of his flock; and he was more brutal to us than ever, after that, for many days together, he was so enraged over his loss., We had adventures all along., One day we ran into a procession., And such a procession!, All the riffraff of the kingdom seemed to be comprehended in it; and all drunk at that., In the van was a cart with a coffin in it, and on the coffin sat a comely young girl of about eighteen suckling a baby, which she squeezed to her breast in a passion of love every little while, and every little while wiped from its face the tears which her eyes rained down upon it; and always the foolish little thing smiled up at her, happy and content, kneading her breast with its dimpled fat hand, which she patted and fondled right over her breaking heart., Men and women, boys and girls, trotted along beside or after the cart, hooting, shouting profane and ribald remarks, singing snatches of foul song, skipping, dancing--a very holiday of hellions, a sickening sight., We had struck a suburb of London, outside the walls, and this was a sample of one sort of London society., Our master secured a good place for us near the gallows., A priest was in attendance, and he helped the girl climb up, and said comforting words to her, and made the under-sheriff provide a stool for her., Then he stood there by her on the gallows, and for a moment looked down upon the mass of upturned faces at his feet, then out over the solid pavement of heads that stretched away on every side occupying the vacancies far and near, and then began to tell the story of the case., And there was pity in his voice --how seldom a sound that was in that ignorant and savage land!, I remember every detail of what he said, except the words he said it in; and so I change it into my own words:  ""Law is intended to mete out justice., Sometimes it fails., This cannot be helped., We can only grieve, and be resigned, and pray for the soul of him who falls unfairly by the arm of the law, and that his fellows may be few., A law sends this poor young thing to death--and it is right., But another law had placed her where she must commit her crime or starve with her child--and before God that law is responsible for both her crime and her ignominious death!, ""A little while ago this young thing, this child of eighteen years, was as happy a wife and mother as any in England; and her lips were blithe with song, which is the native speech of glad and innocent hearts., Her young husband was as happy as she; for he was doing his whole duty, he worked early and late at his handicraft, his bread was honest bread well and fairly earned, he was prospering, he was furnishing shelter and sustenance to his family, he was adding his mite to the wealth of the nation., By consent of a treacherous law, instant destruction fell upon this holy home and swept it away!, That young husband was waylaid and impressed, and sent to sea., The wife knew nothing of it., She sought him everywhere, she moved the hardest hearts with the supplications of her tears, the broken eloquence of her despair., Weeks dragged by, she watching, waiting, hoping, her mind going slowly to wreck under the burden of her misery., Little by little all her small possessions went for food., When she could no longer pay her rent, they turned her out of doors., She begged, while she had strength; when she was starving at last, and her milk failing, she stole a piece of linen cloth of the value of a fourth part of a cent, thinking to sell it and save her child., But she was seen by the owner of the cloth., She was put in jail and brought to trial., The man testified to the facts., A plea was made for her, and her sorrowful story was told in her behalf., She spoke, too, by permission, and said she did steal the cloth, but that her mind was so disordered of late by trouble that when she was overborne with hunger all acts, criminal or other, swam meaningless through her brain and she knew nothing rightly, except that she was so hungry!, For a moment all were touched, and there was disposition to deal mercifully with her, seeing that she was so young and friendless, and her case so piteous, and the law that robbed her of her support to blame as being the first and only cause of her transgression; but the prosecuting officer replied that whereas these things were all true, and most pitiful as well, still there was much small theft in these days, and mistimed mercy here would be a danger to property--oh, my God, is there no property in ruined homes, and orphaned babes, and broken hearts that British law holds precious!--and so he must require sentence., ""When the judge put on his black cap, the owner of the stolen linen rose trembling up, his lip quivering, his face as gray as ashes; and when the awful words came, he cried out, 'Oh, poor child, poor child, I did not know it was death!', and fell as a tree falls., When they lifted him up his reason was gone; before the sun was set, he had taken his own life., A kindly man; a man whose heart was right, at bottom; add his murder to this that is to be now done here; and charge them both where they belong --to the rulers and the bitter laws of Britain., The time is come, my child; let me pray over thee--not _for_ thee, dear abused poor heart and innocent, but for them that be guilty of thy ruin and death, who need it more."", After his prayer they put the noose around the young girl's neck, and they had great trouble to adjust the knot under her ear, because she was devouring the baby all the time, wildly kissing it, and snatching it to her face and her breast, and drenching it with tears, and half moaning, half shrieking all the while, and the baby crowing, and laughing, and kicking its feet with delight over what it took for romp and play., Even the hangman couldn't stand it, but turned away., When all was ready the priest gently pulled and tugged and forced the child out of the mother's arms, and stepped quickly out of her reach; but she clasped her hands, and made a wild spring toward him, with a shriek; but the rope--and the under-sheriff--held her short., Then she went on her knees and stretched out her hands and cried:  ""One more kiss--oh, my God, one more, one more,--it is the dying that begs it!"", She got it; she almost smothered the little thing., And when they got it away again, she cried out:  ""Oh, my child, my darling, it will die!, It has no home, it has no father, no friend, no mother--""  ""It has them all!"", said that good priest., ""All these will I be to it till I die."", You should have seen her face then!, Gratitude?, Lord, what do you want with words to express that?, Words are only painted fire; a look is the fire itself., She gave that look, and carried it away to the treasury of heaven, where all things that are divine belong., London--to a slave--was a sufficiently interesting place., It was merely a great big village; and mainly mud and thatch., The streets were muddy, crooked, unpaved., The populace was an ever flocking and drifting swarm of rags, and splendors, of nodding plumes and shining armor., ...]",1
49,"[Land, what a sight!, We were enclosed in three walls of dead men!, All the other fences were pretty nearly filled with the living, who were stealthily working their way forward through the wires., The sudden glare paralyzed this host, petrified them, you may say, with astonishment; there was just one instant for me to utilize their immobility in, and I didn't lose the chance., You see, in another instant they would have recovered their faculties, then they'd have burst into a cheer and made a rush, and my wires would have gone down before it; but that lost instant lost them their opportunity forever; while even that slight fragment of time was still unspent, I shot the current through all the fences and struck the whole host dead in their tracks!, _There_ was a groan you could _hear_!, It voiced the death-pang of eleven thousand men., It swelled out on the night with awful pathos., A glance showed that the rest of the enemy--perhaps ten thousand strong--were between us and the encircling ditch, and pressing forward to the assault., Consequently we had them _all!_ and had them past help., Time for the last act of the tragedy., I fired the three appointed revolver shots--which meant:  ""Turn on the water!"", There was a sudden rush and roar, and in a minute the mountain brook was raging through the big ditch and creating a river a hundred feet wide and twenty-five deep., ""Stand to your guns, men!, Open fire!"", The thirteen gatlings began to vomit death into the fated ten thousand., They halted, they stood their ground a moment against that withering deluge of fire, then they broke, faced about and swept toward the ditch like chaff before a gale., A full fourth part of their force never reached the top of the lofty embankment; the three-fourths reached it and plunged over--to death by drowning., Within ten short minutes after we had opened fire, armed resistance was totally annihilated, the campaign was ended, we fifty-four were masters of England., Twenty-five thousand men lay dead around us., But how treacherous is fortune!, In a little while--say an hour --happened a thing, by my own fault, which--but I have no heart to write that., Let the record end here., I, Clarence, must write it for him., He proposed that we two go out and see if any help could be accorded the wounded., I was strenuous against the project., I said that if there were many, we could do but little for them; and it would not be wise for us to trust ourselves among them, anyway., But he could seldom be turned from a purpose once formed; so we shut off the electric current from the fences, took an escort along, climbed over the enclosing ramparts of dead knights, and moved out upon the field., The first wounded mall who appealed for help was sitting with his back against a dead comrade., When The Boss bent over him and spoke to him, the man recognized him and stabbed him., That knight was Sir Meliagraunce, as I found out by tearing off his helmet., He will not ask for help any more., We carried The Boss to the cave and gave his wound, which was not very serious, the best care we could., In this service we had the help of Merlin, though we did not know it., He was disguised as a woman, and appeared to be a simple old peasant goodwife., In this disguise, with brown-stained face and smooth shaven, he had appeared a few days after The Boss was hurt and offered to cook for us, saying her people had gone off to join certain new camps which the enemy were forming, and that she was starving., The Boss had been getting along very well, and had amused himself with finishing up his record., We were glad to have this woman, for we were short handed., We were in a trap, you see--a trap of our own making., If we stayed where we were, our dead would kill us; if we moved out of our defenses, we should no longer be invincible., We had conquered; in turn we were conquered., The Boss recognized this; we all recognized it., If we could go to one of those new camps and patch up some kind of terms with the enemy--yes, but The Boss could not go, and neither could I, for I was among the first that were made sick by the poisonous air bred by those dead thousands., Others were taken down, and still others., To-morrow--  _To-morrow._  It is here., And with it the end., About midnight I awoke, and saw that hag making curious passes in the air about The Boss's head and face, and wondered what it meant., Everybody but the dynamo-watch lay steeped in sleep; there was no sound., The woman ceased from her mysterious foolery, and started tip-toeing toward the door., I called out:  ""Stop!, What have you been doing?"", She halted, and said with an accent of malicious satisfaction:  ""Ye were conquerors; ye are conquered!, These others are perishing --you also., Ye shall all die in this place--every one--except _him_., He sleepeth now--and shall sleep thirteen centuries., I am Merlin!"", Then such a delirium of silly laughter overtook him that he reeled about like a drunken man, and presently fetched up against one of our wires., His mouth is spread open yet; apparently he is still laughing., I suppose the face will retain that petrified laugh until the corpse turns to dust., The Boss has never stirred--sleeps like a stone., If he does not wake to-day we shall understand what kind of a sleep it is, and his body will then be borne to a place in one of the remote recesses of the cave where none will ever find it to desecrate it., As for the rest of us--well, it is agreed that if any one of us ever escapes alive from this place, he will write the fact here, and loyally hide this Manuscript with The Boss, our dear good chief, whose property it is, be he alive or dead., The dawn was come when I laid the Manuscript aside., The rain had almost ceased, the world was gray and sad, the exhausted storm was sighing and sobbing itself to rest., I went to the stranger's room, and listened at his door, which was slightly ajar., I could hear his voice, and so I knocked., There was no answer, but I still heard the voice., I peeped in., The man lay on his back in bed, talking brokenly but with spirit, and punctuating with his arms, which he thrashed about, restlessly, as sick people do in delirium., I slipped in softly and bent over him., His mutterings and ejaculations went on., I spoke--merely a word, to call his attention., His glassy eyes and his ashy face were alight in an instant with pleasure, gratitude, gladness, welcome:  ""Oh, Sandy, you are come at last--how I have longed for you!, Sit by me--do not leave me--never leave me again, Sandy, never again., Where is your hand?--give it me, dear, let me hold it--there --now all is well, all is peace, and I am happy again--_we_ are happy again, isn't it so, Sandy?, You are so dim, so vague, you are but a mist, a cloud, but you are _here_, and that is blessedness sufficient; and I have your hand; don't take it away--it is for only a little while, I shall not require it long....  Was that the child?..., Hello-Central!..., she doesn't answer., Asleep, perhaps?, Bring her when she wakes, and let me touch her hands, her face, her hair, and tell her good-bye....  Sandy!, Yes, you are there., I lost myself a moment, and I thought you were gone....  Have I been sick long?, It must be so; it seems months to me., And such dreams!, such strange and awful dreams, Sandy!, Dreams that were as real as reality--delirium, of course, but _so_ real!, Why, I thought the king was dead, I thought you were in Gaul and couldn't get home, I thought there was a revolution; in the fantastic frenzy of these dreams, I thought that Clarence and I and a handful of my cadets fought and exterminated the whole chivalry of England!, But even that was not the strangest., I seemed to be a creature out of a remote unborn age, centuries hence, and even _that_ was as real as the rest!, Yes, I seemed to have flown back out of that age into this of ours, and then forward to it again, and was set down, a stranger and forlorn in that strange England, with an abyss of thirteen centuries yawning between me and you!, between me and my home and my friends!, between me and all that is dear to me, all that could make life worth the living!, It was awful --awfuler than you can ever imagine, Sandy., Ah, watch by me, Sandy --stay by me every moment--_don't_ let me go out of my mind again; death is nothing, let it come, but not with those dreams, not with the torture of those hideous dreams--I cannot endure _that_ again...., Sandy?..."", He lay muttering incoherently some little time; then for a time he lay silent, and apparently sinking away toward death., Presently his fingers began to pick busily at the coverlet, and by that sign I knew that his end was at hand with the first suggestion of the death-rattle in his throat he started up slightly, and seemed to listen: then he said:  ""A bugle?..., It is the king!, The drawbridge, there!, Man the battlements!--turn out the--""  He was getting up his last ""effect""; but he never finished it., ...]",1

such as saying loff when you mean laff --but you'll get over that., He's a right down good fellow, and a little sociable with the photographer's boy and the caulker and the blacksmith that work in the navy yard, but not so much with the others., The fact is, though it's private, and the others don't know it, he's a kind of an aristocrat, his father being a doctor, and you know what style that is-- in England, I mean, because in this country a doctor ain't so very much, even if he's that., But over there of course it's different., So this chap had a falling out with his father, and was pretty high strung, and just cut for this country, and the first he knew he had to get to work or starve., Well, he'd been to college, you see, and so he judged he was all right--did you say anything?"", ""No--I only sighed."", ""And there's where he was mistaken., Why, he mighty near starved., And I reckon he would have starved sure enough, if some jour' printer or other hadn't took pity on him and got him a place as apprentice., So he learnt the trade, and then he was all right--but it was a close call., Once he thought he had got to haul in his pride and holler for his father and-- why, you're sighing again., Is anything the matter with you?--does my clatter--""  ""Oh, dear--no., Pray go on--I like it."", ""Yes, you see, he's been over here ten years; he's twenty-eight, now, and he ain't pretty well satisfied in his mind, because he can't get reconciled to being a mechanic and associating with mechanics, he being, as he says to me, a gentleman, which is a pretty plain letting-on that the boys ain't, but of course I know enough not to let that cat out of the bag."", ""Why--would there be any harm in it?"", ""Harm in it?, They'd lick him, wouldn't they?, Wouldn't you?, Of course you would., Don't you ever let a man say you ain't a gentleman in this country., But laws, what am I thinking about?, I reckon a body would think twice before he said a cowboy wasn't a gentleman."", A trim, active, slender and very pretty girl of about eighteen walked into the room now, in the most satisfied and unembarrassed way., She was cheaply but smartly and gracefully dressed, and the mother's quick glance at the stranger's face as he rose, was of the kind which inquires what effect has been produced, and expects to find indications of surprise and admiration., ""This is my daughter Hattie--we call her Puss., It's the new boarder, Puss."", This without rising., The young Englishman made the awkward bow common to his nationality and time of life in circumstances of delicacy and difficulty, and these were of that sort; for, being taken by surprise, his natural, lifelong self sprang to the front, and that self of course would not know just how to act when introduced to a chambermaid, or to the heiress of a mechanics' boarding house., His other self--the self which recognized the equality of all men--would have managed the thing better, if it hadn't been caught off guard and robbed of its chance., The young girl paid no attention to the bow, but put out her hand frankly and gave the stranger a friendly shake and said:  ""How do you do?"", Then she marched to the one washstand in the room, tilted her head this way and that before the wreck of a cheap mirror that hung above it, dampened her fingers with her tongue, perfected the circle of a little lock of hair that was pasted against her forehead, then began to busy herself with the slops., ""Well, I must be going--it's getting towards supper time., Make yourself at home, Mr.  Tracy, you'll hear the bell when it's ready."", The landlady took her tranquil departure, without commanding either of the young people to vacate the room., The young man wondered a little that a mother who seemed so honest and respectable should be so thoughtless, and was reaching for his hat, intending to disembarrass the girl of his presence; but she said:  ""Where are you going?"", ""Well--nowhere in particular, but as I am only in the way here--""  ""Why, who said you were in the way?, Sit down--I'll move you when you are in the way."", She was making the beds, now., He sat down and watched her deft and diligent performance., ""What gave you that notion?, Do you reckon I need a whole room just to make up a bed or two in?"", ""Well no, it wasn't that, exactly., We are away up here in an empty house, and your mother being gone--""  The girl interrupted him with an amused laugh, and said:  ""Nobody to protect me?, Bless you, I don't need it., I'm not afraid., I might be if I was alone, because I do hate ghosts, and I don't deny it., Not that I believe in them, for I don't., I'm only just afraid of them."", ""How can you be afraid of them if you don't believe in them?"", ""Oh, I don't know the how of it--that's too many for me;

I feel it as deeply as anybody could., But we've got to submit--on moral grounds., I need money, but God knows I am not poor enough or shabby enough to be an accessory to the punishing of a man's ancestor for crimes committed by that ancestor's posterity."", ""But Colonel!"", implored Hawkins; ""stop and think; don't be rash; you know it's the only chance we've got to get the money; and besides, the Bible itself says posterity to the fourth generation shall be punished for the sins and crimes committed by ancestors four generations back that hadn't anything to do with them; and so it's only fair to turn the rule around and make it work both ways."", The Colonel was struck with the strong logic of this position., He strode up and down, and thought it painfully over., Finally he said:  ""There's reason in it; yes, there's reason in it., And so, although it seems a piteous thing to sweat this poor ancient devil for a burglary he hadn't the least hand in, still if duty commands I suppose we must give him up to the authorities."", ""I would,"" said Hawkins, cheered and relieved, ""I'd give him up if he was a thousand ancestors compacted into one."", ""Lord bless me, that's just what he is,"" said Sellers, with something like a groan, ""it's exactly what he is; there's a contribution in him from every ancestor he ever had., In him there's atoms of priests, soldiers, crusaders, poets, and sweet and gracious women--all kinds and conditions of folk who trod this earth in old, old centuries, and vanished out of it ages ago, and now by act of ours they are summoned from their holy peace to answer for gutting a one-horse bank away out on the borders of Cherokee Strip, and it's just a howling outrage!"", ""Oh, don't talk like that, Colonel; it takes the heart all out of me, and makes me ashamed of the part I am proposing to--""  ""Wait--I've got it!"", ""A saving hope?, Shout it out, I am perishing."", ""It's perfectly simple; a child would have thought of it., He is all right, not a flaw in him, as far as I have carried the work., If I've been able to bring him as far as the beginning of this century, what's to stop me now?, I'll go on and materialize him down to date."", ""Land, I never thought of that!"", said Hawkins all ablaze with joy again., ""It's the very thing., What a brain you have got!, And will he shed the superfluous arm?"", ""He will."", ""And lose his English accent?"", ""It will wholly disappear., He will speak Cherokee Strip--and other forms of profanity."", ""Colonel, maybe he'll confess!"", ""Confess?, Merely that bank robbery?"", ""Merely?, Yes, but why 'merely'?"", The Colonel said in his most impressive manner: ""Hawkins, he will be wholly under my command., I will make him confess every crime he ever committed., There must be a thousand., Do you get the idea?"", ""Well--not quite."", ""The rewards will come to us."", ""Prodigious conception!, I never saw such ahead for seeing with a lightning glance all the outlying ramifications and possibilities of a central idea."", ""It is nothing;

She is in much trouble about the buzzard; says grass does not agree with it; is afraid she can't raise it; thinks it was intended to live on decayed flesh., The buzzard must get along the best it can with what is provided., We cannot overturn the whole scheme to accommodate the buzzard., Saturday  She fell in the pond yesterday, when she was looking at herself in it, which she is always doing., She nearly strangled, and said it was most uncomfortable., This made her sorry for the creatures which live in there, which she calls fish, for she continues to fasten names on to things that don't need them and don't come when they are called by them, which is a matter of no consequence to her, as she is such a numskull anyway; so she got a lot of them out and brought them in last night and put them in my bed to keep warm, but I have noticed them now and then all day, and I don't see that they are any happier there than they were before, only quieter., When night comes I shall throw them out-doors., I will not sleep with them again, for I find them clammy and unpleasant to lie among when a person hasn't anything on., Sunday  Pulled through., Tuesday  She has taken up with a snake now., The other animals are glad, for she was always experimenting with them and bothering them; and I am glad, because the snake talks, and this enables me to get a rest., Friday  She says the snake advises her to try the fruit of that tree, and says the result will be a great and fine and noble education., I told her there would be another result, too--it would introduce death into the world., That was a mistake--it had been better to keep the remark to myself; it only gave her an idea--she could save the sick buzzard, and furnish fresh meat to the despondent lions and tigers., I advised her to keep away from the tree., She said she wouldn't., I foresee trouble., Will emigrate., Wednesday  I have had a variegated time., I escaped that night, and rode a horse all night as fast as he could go, hoping to get clear out of the Park and hide in some other country before the trouble should begin; but it was not to be., About an hour after sunup, as I was riding through a flowery plain where thousands of animals were grazing, slumbering, or playing with each other, according to their wont, all of a sudden they broke into a tempest of frightful noises, and in one moment the plain was in a frantic commotion and every beast was destroying its neighbor., I knew what it meant--Eve had eaten that fruit, and death was come into the world...., The tigers ate my horse, paying no attention when I ordered them to desist,  and they would even have eaten me if I had stayed--which I didn't, but went away in much haste...., I found this place, outside the Park, and was fairly comfortable for a few days, but she has found me out., Found me out, and has named the place Tonawanda--says it looks like that., In fact, I was not sorry she came, for there are but meagre pickings here, and she brought some of those apples., I was obliged to eat them, I was so hungry., It was against my principles, but I find that principles have no real force except when one is well fed....  She came curtained in boughs and bunches of leaves, and when I asked her what she meant by such nonsense, and snatched them away and threw them down, she tittered and blushed., I had never seen a person titter and blush before, and to me it seemed unbecoming and idiotic., She said I would soon know how it was myself., This was correct., Hungry as I was, I laid down the apple half eaten--certainly the best one I ever saw, considering the lateness of the season--and arrayed myself in the discarded boughs and branches, and then spoke to her with some severity and ordered her to go and get some more and not make such a spectacle of herself., She did it, and after this we crept down to where the wild-beast battle had been, and collected some skins, and I made her patch together a couple of suits proper for public occasions., They are uncomfortable, it is true, but stylish, and that is the main point about clothes., ..., I find she is a good deal of a companion., I see I should be lonesome and depressed without her, now that I have lost my property., Another thing, she says it is ordered that we work for our living hereafter., She will be useful., I will superintend., Ten Days Later  She accuses me of being the cause of our disaster!, She says, with apparent sincerity and truth, that the Serpent assured her that the forbidden fruit was not apples, it was chestnuts., I said I was innocent, then, for I had not eaten any chestnuts., She said the Serpent informed her that ""chestnut"" was a figurative term meaning an aged and mouldy joke., I turned pale at that, for I have made many jokes to pass the weary time, and some of them could have been of that sort, though I had honestly supposed that they were new when I made them., She asked me if I had made one just at the time of the catastrophe., I was obliged to admit that I had made one to myself, though not aloud., It was this., I was thinking about the Falls, and I said to myself, ""How wonderful it is to see that vast body of water tumble down there!"", Then in an instant a bright thought flashed into my head, and I let it fly, saying, ""It would be a deal more wonderful to see it tumble up there!"", --and I was just about to kill myself with laughing at it when all nature broke loose in war and death, and I had to flee for my life., ""There,"" she said, with triumph, ""that is just it;

caught it in the timber a couple of miles from our dug-out--or it might have been four, she isn't certain which., It resembles us in some ways, and may be a relation., That is what she thinks, but this is an error, in my judgment., The difference in size warrants the conclusion that it is a different and new kind of animal--a fish, perhaps, though when I put it in the water to see, it sank, and she plunged in and snatched it out before there was opportunity for the experiment to determine the matter., I still think it is a fish, but she is indifferent about what it is, and will not let me have it to try., I do not understand this., The coming of the creature seems to have changed her whole nature and made her unreasonable about experiments., She thinks more of it than she does of any of the other animals, but is not able to explain why., Her mind is disordered--everything shows it., Sometimes she carries the fish in her arms half the night when it complains and wants to get to the water., At such times the water comes out of the places in her face that she looks out of, and she pats the fish on the back and makes soft sounds with her mouth to soothe it, and betrays sorrow and solicitude in a hundred ways., I have never seen her do like this with any other fish, and it troubles me greatly., She used to carry the young tigers around so, and play with them, before we lost our property; but it was only play; she never took on about them like this when their dinner disagreed with them., Sunday  She doesn't work Sundays, but lies around all tired out, and likes to have the fish wallow over her; and she makes fool noises to amuse it, and pretends to chew its paws, and that makes it laugh., I have not seen a fish before that could laugh., This makes me doubt...., I have come to like Sunday myself., Superintending all the week tires a body so., There ought to be more Sundays., In the old days they were tough, but now they come handy., Wednesday  It isn't a fish., I cannot quite make out what it is., It makes curious, devilish noises when not satisfied, and says ""goo-goo"" when it is., It is not one of us, for it doesn't walk; it is not a bird, for it doesn't fly; it is not a frog, for it doesn't hop; it is not a snake, for it doesn't crawl; I feel sure it is not a fish, though I cannot get a chance to find out whether it can swim or not., It merely lies around, and mostly on its back, with its feet up., I have not seen any other animal do that before., I said I believed it was an enigma, but she only admired the word without understanding it., In my judgment it is either an enigma or some kind of a bug., If it dies, I will take it apart and see what its arrangements are., I never had a thing perplex me so., Three Months Later  The perplexity augments instead of diminishing., I sleep but little., It has ceased from lying around, and goes about on its four legs now., ...]",1

G., CHIEF OF ORDNANCE., The kernel is the same in both prefaces, you see--the public must not take us too seriously., If we remove that kernel we remove the life-principle, and the preface is a corpse., Yes, it pleases me to have you use that idea, for it is a high compliment., But is leaves me nothing to combat; and that is damage to me., Am I seeming to say that your Reply is not a reply at all, M. Bourget?, If so, I must modify that; it is too sweeping., For you have furnished a general answer to my inquiry as to what France through you--can teach us., --[""What could France teach America!"", exclaims Mark Twain., France can teach America all the higher pursuits of life, and there is more artistic feeling and refinement in a street of French workingmen than in many avenues inhabited by American millionaires., She can teach her, not perhaps how to work, but how to rest, how to live, how to be happy., She can teach her that the aim of life is not money-making, but that money-making is only a means to obtain an end., She can teach her that wives are not expensive toys, but useful partners, friends, and confidants, who should always keep men under their wholesome influence by their diplomacy, their tact, their common-sense, without bumptiousness., These qualities, added to the highest standard of morality (not angular and morose, but cheerful morality), are conceded to Frenchwomen by whoever knows something of French life outside of the Paris boulevards, and Mark Twain's ill-natured sneer cannot even so much as stain them., I might tell Mark Twain that in France a man who was seen tipsy in his club would immediately see his name canceled from membership., A man who had settled his fortune on his wife to avoid meeting his creditors would be refused admission into any decent society., Many a Frenchman has blown his brains out rather than declare himself a bankrupt., Now would Mark Twain remark to this: 'An American is not such a fool: when a creditor stands in his way he closes his doors, and reopens them the following day., When he has been a bankrupt three times he can retire from business?'], --It is a good answer., It relates to manners, customs, and morals--three things concerning which we can never have exhaustive and determinate statistics, and so the verdicts delivered upon them must always lack conclusiveness and be subject to revision; but you have stated the truth, possibly, as nearly as any one could do it, in the circumstances., But why did you choose a detail of my question which could be answered only with vague hearsay evidence, and go right by one which could have been answered with deadly facts?--facts in everybody's reach, facts which none can dispute., I asked what France could teach us about government., I laid myself pretty wide open, there; and I thought I was handsomely generous, too, when I did it., France can teach us how to levy village and city taxes which distribute the burden with a nearer approach to perfect fairness than is the case in any other land; and she can teach us the wisest and surest system of collecting them that exists., She can teach us how to elect a President in a sane way; and also how to do it without throwing the country into earthquakes and convulsions that cripple and embarrass business, stir up party hatred in the hearts of men, and make peaceful people wish the term extended to thirty years., France can teach us--but enough of that part of the question., And what else can France teach us?, She can teach us all the fine arts--and does., She throws open her hospitable art academies, and says to us, ""Come""--and we come, troops and troops of our young and gifted; and she sets over us the ablest masters in the world and bearing the greatest names; and she, teaches us all that we are capable of learning, and persuades us and encourages us with prizes and honors, much as if we were somehow children of her own; and when this noble education is finished and we are ready to carry it home and spread its gracious ministries abroad over our nation, and we come with homage and gratitude and ask France for the bill--there is nothing to pay., And in return for this imperial generosity, what does America do?, She charges a duty on French works of art!, I wish I had your end of this dispute; I should have something worth talking about., If you would only furnish me something to argue, something to refute--but you persistently won't., You leave good chances unutilized and spend your strength in proving and establishing unimportant things., For instance, you have proven and established these eight facts here following--a good score as to number, but not worth while:  Mark Twain is--  1., ""Insulting."", 2., (Sarcastically speaking) ""This refined humor, 1st."", 3., Prefers the manure-pile to the violets., 4., Has uttered ""an ill-natured sneer."", 5., Is ""nasty."", 6., Needs a ""lesson in politeness and good manners."", 7., Has published a ""nasty article."", 8., Has made remarks ""unworthy of a gentleman."", --[""It is more funny than his"" (Mark Twain's) ""anecdote, and would have been less insulting.""], A quoted remark of mine ""is a gross insult to a nation friendly to America."", ""He has read La Terre, this refined humorist."", ""When Mark Twain visits a garden ., ., ., he goes in the far-away corner where the soil is prepared."", ""Mark Twain's ill-natured sneer cannot so much as stain them"" (the Frenchwomen)., ""When he"" (Mark Twain) ""takes his revenge he is unkind, unfair, bitter, nasty."", ""But not even your nasty article on my country, Mark,"" etc., ""Mark might certainly have derived from it"" (M. Bourget's book) ""a lesson in politeness and good manners."", A quoted remark of mine is ""unworthy of a gentleman."", --  These are all true, but really they are not valuable; no one cares much for such finds., In our American magazines we recognize this and suppress them., We avoid naming them., American writers never allow themselves to name them., It would look as if they were in a temper, and we hold that exhibitions of temper in public are not good form except in the very young and inexperienced., And even if we had the disposition to name them, in order to fill up a gap when we were short of ideas and arguments, our magazines would not allow us to do it, because they think that such words sully their pages., This present magazine is particularly strenuous about it., Its note to me announcing the forwarding of your proof-sheets to France closed thus--for your protection:  ""It is needless to ask you to avoid anything that he might consider as personal."", It was well enough, as a measure of precaution, but really it was not needed., You can trust me implicitly, M. Bourget; I shall never call you any names in print which I should be ashamed to call you with your unoffending and dearest ones present., Indeed, we are reserved, and particular in America to a degree which you would consider exaggerated., For instance, we should not write notes like that one of yours to a lady for a small fault--or a large one.--[When M. Paul Bourget indulges in a little chaffing at the expense of the Americans, ""who can always get away with a few years' trying to find out who their grandfathers were,""] he merely makes an allusion to an American foible; but, forsooth, what a kind man, what a humorist Mark Twain is when he retorts by calling France a nation of bastards!, How the Americans of culture and refinement will admire him for thus speaking in their name!, ...]",1
54,"[But that warn't the end yet., That ornery hound kept coming and coming till he had begged back all the camels and had the whole hundred., Then he was satisfied, and ever so grateful, and said he wouldn't ever forgit the dervish as long as he lived, and nobody hadn't been so good to him before, and liberal., So they shook hands good-bye, and separated and started off again., But do you know, it warn't ten minutes till the camel-driver was unsatisfied again--he was the lowdownest reptyle in seven counties--and he come a-running again., And this time the thing he wanted was to get the dervish to rub some of the salve on his other eye., ""Why?"", said the dervish., ""Oh, you know,"" says the driver., ""Know what?"", ""Well, you can't fool me,"" says the driver., ""You're trying to keep back something from me, you know it mighty well., You know, I reckon, that if I had the salve on the other eye I could see a lot more things that's valuable., Come--please put it on."", The dervish says:  ""I wasn't keeping anything back from you., I don't mind telling you what would happen if I put it on., You'd never see again., You'd be stone-blind the rest of your days."", But do you know that beat wouldn't believe him., No, he begged and begged, and whined and cried, till at last the dervish opened his box and told him to put it on, if he wanted to., So the man done it, and sure enough he was as blind as a bat in a minute., Then the dervish laughed at him and mocked at him and made fun of him; and says:  ""Good-bye--a man that's blind hain't got no use for jewelry."", And he cleared out with the hundred camels, and left that man to wander around poor and miserable and friendless the rest of his days in the Desert., Jim said he'd bet it was a lesson to him., ""Yes,"" Tom says, ""and like a considerable many lessons a body gets., They ain't no account, because the thing don't ever happen the same way again--and can't., The time Hen Scovil fell down the chimbly and crippled his back for life, everybody said it would be a lesson to him., What kind of a lesson?, How was he going to use it?, He couldn't climb chimblies no more, and he hadn't no more backs to break."", ""All de same, Mars Tom, dey IS sich a thing as learnin' by expe'ence., De Good Book say de burnt chile shun de fire."", ""Well, I ain't denying that a thing's a lesson if it's a thing that can happen twice just the same way., There's lots of such things, and THEY educate a person, that's what Uncle Abner always said; but there's forty MILLION lots of the other kind--the kind that don't happen the same way twice--and they ain't no real use, they ain't no more instructive than the small-pox., When you've got it, it ain't no good to find out you ought to been vaccinated, and it ain't no good to git vaccinated afterward, because the small-pox don't come but once., But, on the other hand, Uncle Abner said that the person that had took a bull by the tail once had learnt sixty or seventy times as much as a person that hadn't, and said a person that started in to carry a cat home by the tail was gitting knowledge that was always going to be useful to him, and warn't ever going to grow dim or doubtful., But I can tell you, Jim, Uncle Abner was down on them people that's all the time trying to dig a lesson out of everything that happens, no matter whether--""  But Jim was asleep., Tom looked kind of ashamed, because you know a person always feels bad when he is talking uncommon fine and thinks the other person is admiring, and that other person goes to sleep that way., Of course he oughtn't to go to sleep, because it's shabby; but the finer a person talks the certainer it is to make you sleep, and so when you come to look at it it ain't nobody's fault in particular; both of them's to blame., Jim begun to snore--soft and blubbery at first, then a long rasp, then a stronger one, then a half a dozen horrible ones like the last water sucking down the plug-hole of a bath-tub, then the same with more power to it, and some big coughs and snorts flung in, the way a cow does that is choking to death; and when the person has got to that point he is at his level best, and can wake up a man that is in the next block with a dipperful of loddanum in him, but can't wake himself up although all that awful noise of his'n ain't but three inches from his own ears., And that is the curiosest thing in the world, seems to me., But you rake a match to light the candle, and that little bit of a noise will fetch him., I wish I knowed what was the reason of that, but there don't seem to be no way to find out., Now there was Jim alarming the whole Desert, and yanking the animals out, for miles and miles around, to see what in the nation was going on up there; there warn't nobody nor nothing that was as close to the noise as HE was, and yet he was the only cretur that wasn't disturbed by it., We yelled at him and whooped at him, it never done no good; but the first time there come a little wee noise that wasn't of a usual kind it woke him up., No, sir, I've thought it all over, and so has Tom, and there ain't no way to find out why a snorer can't hear himself snore., Jim said he hadn't been asleep; he just shut his eyes so he could listen better., Tom said nobody warn't accusing him., That made him look like he wished he hadn't said anything., And he wanted to git away from the subject, I reckon, because he begun to abuse the camel-driver, just the way a person does when he has got catched in something and wants to take it out of somebody else., He let into the camel-driver the hardest he knowed how, and I had to agree with him; and he praised up the dervish the highest he could, and I had to agree with him there, too., But Tom says:  ""I ain't so sure., You call that dervish so dreadful liberal and good and unselfish, but I don't quite see it., He didn't hunt up another poor dervish, did he?, No, he didn't., If he was so unselfish, why didn't he go in there himself and take a pocketful of jewels and go along and be satisfied?, No, sir, the person he was hunting for was a man with a hundred camels., He wanted to get away with all the treasure he could."", ""Why, Mars Tom, he was willin' to divide, fair and square; he only struck for fifty camels."", ""Because he knowed how he was going to get all of them by and by."", ""Mars Tom, he TOLE de man de truck would make him bline."", ""Yes, because he knowed the man's character., It was just the kind of a man he was hunting for--a man that never believes in anybody's word or anybody's honorableness, because he ain't got none of his own., I reckon there's lots of people like that dervish., They swindle, right and left, but they always make the other person SEEM to swindle himself., They keep inside of the letter of the law all the time, and there ain't no way to git hold of them., THEY don't put the salve on--oh, no, that would be sin; but they know how to fool YOU into putting it on, then it's you that blinds yourself., I reckon the dervish and the camel-driver was just a pair--a fine, smart, brainy rascal, and a dull, coarse, ignorant one, but both of them rascals, just the same."", ""Mars Tom, does you reckon dey's any o' dat kind o' salve in de worl' now?"", ""Yes, Uncle Abner says there is., He says they've got it in New York, and they put it on country people's eyes and show them all the railroads in the world, and they go in and git them, and then when they rub the salve on the other eye the other man bids them goodbye and goes off with their railroads., Here's the treasure-hill now., Lower away!"", We landed, but it warn't as interesting as I thought it was going to be, because we couldn't find the place where they went in to git the treasure., Still, it was plenty interesting enough, just to see the mere hill itself where such a wonderful thing happened., Jim said he wou'dn't 'a' missed it for three dollars, and I felt the same way., And to me and Jim, as wonderful a thing as any was the way Tom could come into a strange big country like this and go straight and find a little hump like that and tell it in a minute from a million other humps that was almost just like it, and nothing to help him but only his own learning and his own natural smartness., We talked and talked it over together, but couldn't make out how he done it., He had the best head on him I ever see; and all he lacked was age, to make a name for himself equal to Captain Kidd or George Washington., I bet you it would 'a' crowded either of THEM to find that hill, with all their gifts, but it warn't nothing to Tom Sawyer; he went across Sahara and put his finger on it as easy as you could pick a nigger out of a bunch of angels., We found a pond of salt water close by and scraped up a raft of salt around the edges, and loaded up the lion's skin and the tiger's so as they would keep till Jim could tan them., WE went a-fooling along for a day or two, and then just as the full moon was touching the ground on the other side of the desert, we see a string of little black figgers moving across its big silver face., You could see them as plain as if they was painted on the moon with ink., It was another caravan., We cooled down our speed and tagged along after it, just to have company, though it warn't going our way., It was a rattler, that caravan, and a most bully sight to look at next morning when the sun come a-streaming across the desert and flung the long shadders of the camels on the gold sand like a thousand grand-daddy-long-legses marching in procession., We never went very near it, because we knowed better now than to act like that and scare people's camels and break up their caravans., It was the gayest outfit you ever see, for rich clothes and nobby style., Some of the chiefs rode on dromedaries, the first we ever see, and very tall, and they go plunging along like they was on stilts, and they rock the man that is on them pretty violent and churn up his dinner considerable, I bet you, but they make noble good time, and a camel ain't nowheres with them for speed., The caravan camped, during the middle part of the day, and then started again about the middle of the afternoon., Before long the sun begun to look very curious., First it kind of turned to brass, and then to copper, and after that it begun to look like a blood-red ball, and the air got hot and close, and pretty soon all the sky in the west darkened up and looked thick and foggy, but fiery and dreadful--like it looks through a piece of red glass, you know., We looked down and see a big confusion going on in the caravan, and a rushing every which way like they was scared; and then they all flopped down flat in the sand and laid there perfectly still., Pretty soon we see something coming that stood up like an amazing wide wall, and reached from the Desert up into the sky and hid the sun, and it was coming like the nation, too., Then a little faint breeze struck us, and then it come harder, and grains of sand begun to sift against our faces and sting like fire, and Tom sung out:  ""It's a sand-storm--turn your backs to it!"", We done it; and in another minute it was blowing a gale, and the sand beat against us by the shovelful, and the air was so thick with it we couldn't see a thing., In five minutes the boat was level full, and we was setting on the lockers buried up to the chin in sand, and only our heads out and could hardly breathe., Then the storm thinned, and we see that monstrous wall go a-sailing off across the desert, awful to look at, I tell you., We dug ourselves out and looked down, and where the caravan was before there wasn't anything but just the sand ocean now, and all still and quiet., All them people and camels was smothered and dead and buried--buried under ten foot of sand, we reckoned, and Tom allowed it might be years before the wind uncovered them, and all that time their friends wouldn't ever know what become of that caravan., ...]",1
55,"[Come right out and tell me you've found out somehow what a shape I'm in on account of dissipation and foolishness."", ""Disposition en foolishness!, NO sir, dat ain't it., Dat jist ain't nothin' at all, 'longside o' what _I_ knows."", Tom stared at her, and said:  ""Why, Roxy, what do you mean?"", She rose, and gloomed above him like a Fate., ""I means dis--en it's de Lord's truth., You ain't no more kin to ole Marse Driscoll den I is!, _dat's_  what I means!"", and her eyes flamed with triumph., ""What?"", ""Yassir, en _dat_ ain't all!, You's a _nigger!_--_bawn_ a nigger and a _slave!_--en you's a nigger en a slave dis minute;

en don't you git up ag'in till I tell you!"", Tom fretted and chafed awhile in a whirlwind of disorganizing sensations and emotions, and finally said, with something like settled conviction:  ""The whole thing is moonshine; now then, go ahead and do your worst; I'm done with you."", Roxy made no answer., She took the lantern and started for the door., Tom was in a cold panic in a moment., ""Come back, come back!"", he wailed., ""I didn't mean it, Roxy; I take it all back, and I'll never say it again!, Please come back, Roxy!"", The woman stood a moment, then she said gravely:  ""Dat's one thing you's got to stop, Valet de Chambers., You can't call me _Roxy_, same as if you was my equal., Chillen don't speak to dey mammies like dat., You'll call me ma or mammy, dat's what you'll call me--leastways when de ain't nobody aroun'., _Say_ it!"", It cost Tom a struggle, but he got it out., ""Dat's all right, don't you ever forgit it ag'in, if you knows what's good for you., Now den, you had said you wouldn't ever call it lies en moonshine ag'in., I'll tell you dis, for a warnin': if you ever does say it ag'in, it's de LAS' time you'll ever say it to me; I'll tramp as straight to de judge as I kin walk, en tell him who you is, en _prove_ it., Does you b'lieve me when I says dat?"", ""Oh,"" groaned Tom, ""I more than believe it; I _know_ it."", Roxy knew her conquest was complete., She could have proved nothing to anybody, and her threat of writings was a lie; but she knew the person she was dealing with, and had made both statements without any doubt as to the effect they would produce., She went and sat down on her candle box, and the pride and pomp of her victorious attitude made it a throne., She said:  ""Now den, Chambers, we's gwine to talk business, en dey ain't gwine to be no mo' foolishness., In de fust place, you gits fifty dollahs a month; you's gwine to han' over half of it to yo' ma., Plank it out!"", But Tom had only six dollars in the world., He gave her that, and promised to start fair on next month's pension., ""Chambers, how much is you in debt?"", Tom shuddered, and said:  ""Nearly three hundred dollars."", ""How is you gwine to pay it?"", Tom groaned out:  ""Oh, I don't know; don't ask me such awful questions."", But she stuck to her point until she wearied a confession out of him: he had been prowling about in disguise, stealing small valuables from private houses; in fact, he made a good deal of a raid on his fellow villagers a fortnight before, when he was supposed to be in St. Louis; but he doubted if he had sent away enough stuff to realize the required amount, and was afraid to make a further venture in the present excited state of the town., His mother approved of his conduct, and offered to help, but this frightened him., He tremblingly ventured to say that if she would retire from the town he should feel better and safer, and could hold his head higher--and was going on to make an argument, but she interrupted and surprised him pleasantly by saying she was ready; it didn't make any difference to her where she stayed, so that she got her share of the pension regularly., She said she would not go far, and would call at the haunted house once a month for her money., Then she said:  ""I don't hate you so much now, but I've hated you a many a year--and anybody would., Didn't I change you off, en give you a good fambly en a good name, en made you a white gen'l'man en rich, wid store clothes on--en what did I git for it?, You despised me all de time, en was al'ays sayin' mean hard things to me befo' folks, en wouldn't ever let me forgit I's a nigger--en--en--""  She fell to sobbing, and broke down., Tom said:  ""But you know I didn't know you were my mother; and besides--""  ""Well, nemmine 'bout dat, now; let it go., I's gwine to fo'git it."", Then she added fiercely, ""En don't ever make me remember it ag'in, or you'll be sorry, _I_ tell you."", When they were parting, Tom said, in the most persuasive way he could command:  ""Ma, would you mind telling me who was my father?"", He had supposed he was asking an embarrassing question., He was mistaken., Roxy drew herself up with a proud toss of her head, and said:  ""Does I mine tellin' you?, No, dat I don't!, You ain't got no 'casion to be shame' o' yo' father, _I_ kin tell you., He wuz de highest quality in dis whole town--ole Virginny stock., Fust famblies, he wuz., Jes as good stock as de Driscolls en de Howards, de bes' day dey ever seed."", She put on a little prouder air, if possible, and added impressively:  ""Does you 'member Cunnel Cecil Burleigh Essex, dat died de same year yo' young Marse Tom Driscoll's pappy died, en all de Masons en Odd Fellers en Churches turned out en give him de bigges' funeral dis town ever seed?, Dat's de man."", Under the inspiration of her soaring complacency the departed graces of her earlier days returned to her, and her bearing took to itself a dignity and state that might have passed for queenly if her surroundings had been a little more in keeping with it., ""Dey ain't another nigger in dis town dat's as highbawn as you is., Now den, go 'long!, En jes you hold yo' head up as high as you want to--you has de right, en dat I kin swah."", The Nymph Revealed  All say, ""How hard it is that we have to die""--a strange complaint to come from the mouths of people who have had to live., --Pudd'nhead Wilson's Calendar  When angry, count four;

but at last he said to himself, wearily:  ""There is but the one way out., I must follow her plan., But with a variation--I will not ask for the money and ruin myself; I will ROB the old skinflint."", The Prophesy Realized  Few things are harder to put up with than the annoyance of a good example., It were not best that we should all think alike; it is difference of opinion that makes horse races., Dawson's Landing was comfortably finishing its season of dull repose and waiting patiently for the duel., Count Luigi was waiting, too; but not patiently, rumor said., Sunday came, and Luigi insisted on having his challenge conveyed., Wilson carried it., Judge Driscoll declined to fight with an assassin--""that is,"" he added significantly, ""in the field of honor."", Elsewhere, of course, he would be ready., Wilson tried to convince him that if he had been present himself when Angelo told him about the homicide committed by Luigi, he would not have considered the act discreditable to Luigi; but the obstinate old man was not to be moved., Wilson went back to his principal and reported the failure of his mission., Luigi was incensed, and asked how it could be that the old gentleman, who was by no means dull-witted, held his trifling nephew's evidence in inferences to be of more value than Wilson's., But Wilson laughed, and said:  ""That is quite simple; that is easily explicable., I am not his doll--his baby--his infatuation:  his nature is., The judge and his late wife never had any children., The judge and his wife were past middle age when this treasure fell into their lap., One must make allowances for a parental instinct that has been starving for twenty-five or thirty years., It is famished, it is crazed with hunger by that time, and will be entirely satisfied with anything that comes handy; its taste is atrophied, it can't tell mud cat from shad., A devil born to a young couple is measurably recognizable by them as a devil before long, but a devil adopted by an old couple is an angel to them, and remains so, through thick and thin., Tom is this old man's angel; he is infatuated with him., Tom can persuade him into things which other people can't--not all things; I don't mean that, but a good many--particularly one class of things:  the things that create or abolish personal partialities or prejudices in the old man's mind., The old man liked both of you., Tom conceived a hatred for you., That was enough; it turned the old man around at once., The oldest and strongest friendship must go to the ground when one of these late-adopted darlings throws a brick at it."", ""It's a curious philosophy,"" said Luigi., ""It ain't philosophy at all--it's a fact., And there is something pathetic and beautiful about it, too., I think there is nothing more pathetic than to see one of these poor old childless couples taking a menagerie of yelping little worthless dogs to their hearts; and then adding some cursing and squawking parrots and a jackass-voiced macaw; and next a couple of hundred screeching songbirds, and presently some fetid guinea pigs and rabbits, and a howling colony of cats., It is all a groping and ignorant effort to construct out of base metal and brass filings, so to speak, something to take the place of that golden treasure denied them by Nature, a child., But this is a digression., The unwritten law of this region requires you to kill Judge Driscoll on sight, and he and the community will expect that attention at your hands--though of course your own death by his bullet will answer every purpose., Look out for him!, Are you healed--that is, fixed?"", ""Yes, he shall have his opportunity., If he attacks me, I will respond."", As Wilson was leaving, he said:  ""The judge is still a little used up by his campaign work, and will not get out for a day or so; but when he does get out, you want to be on the alert."", About eleven at night the twins went out for exercise, and started on a long stroll in the veiled moonlight., Tom Driscoll had landed at Hackett's Store, two miles below Dawson's, just about half an hour earlier, the only passenger for that lonely spot, and had walked up the shore road and entered Judge Driscoll's house without having encountered anyone either on the road or under the roof., He pulled down his window blinds and lighted his candle., He laid off his coat and hat and began his preparations., He unlocked his trunk and got his suit of girl's clothes out from under the male attire in it, and laid it by., Then he blacked his face with burnt cork and put the cork in his pocket., His plan was to slip down to his uncle's private sitting room below, pass into the bedroom, steal the safe key from the old gentleman's clothes, and then go back and rob the safe., He took up his candle to start., His courage and confidence were high, up to this point, but both began to waver a little now., Suppose he should make a noise, by some accident, and get caught--say, in the act of opening the safe?, Perhaps it would be well to go armed., He took the Indian knife from its hiding place, and felt a pleasant return of his wandering courage., He slipped stealthily down the narrow stair, his hair rising and his pulses halting at the slightest creak., When he was halfway down, he was disturbed to perceive that the landing below was touched by a faint glow of light., What could that mean?, Was his uncle still up?, No, that was not likely; he must have left his night taper there when he went to bed., Tom crept on down, pausing at every step to listen., He found the door standing open, and glanced it., What he saw pleased him beyond measure., His uncle was asleep on the sofa; on a small table at the head of the sofa a lamp was burning low, and by it stood the old man's small cashbox, closed., Near the box was a pile of bank notes and a piece of paper covered with figured in pencil., The safe door was not open., Evidently the sleeper had wearied himself with work upon his finances, and was taking a rest., Tom set his candle on the stairs, and began to make his way toward the pile of notes, stooping low as he went., When he was passing his uncle, the old man stirred in his sleep, and Tom stopped instantly--stopped, and softly drew the knife from its sheath, with his heart thumping, and his eyes fastened upon his benefactor's face., After a moment or two he ventured forward again--one step--reached for his prize and seized it, dropping the knife sheath., Then he felt the old man's strong grip upon him, and a wild cry of ""Help!, help!"", rang in his ear., Without hesitation he drove the knife home--and was free., Some of the notes escaped from his left hand and fell in the blood on the floor., He dropped the knife and snatched them up and started to fly; transferred them to his left hand, and seized the knife again, in his fright and confusion, but remembered himself and flung it from him, as being a dangerous witness to carry away with him., He jumped for the stair-foot, and closed the door behind him; and as he snatched his candle and fled upward, the stillness of the night was broken by the sound of urgent footsteps approaching the house., In another moment he was in his room, and the twins were standing aghast over the body of the murdered man!, Tom put on his coat, buttoned his hat under it, threw on his suit of girl's clothes, dropped the veil, blew out his light, locked the room door by which he had just entered, taking the key, passed through his other door into the black hall, locked that door and kept the key, then worked his way along in the dark and descended the black stairs., He was not expecting to meet anybody, for all interest was centered in the other part of the house now; his calculation proved correct., By the time he was passing through the backyard, Mrs. Pratt, her servants, and a dozen half-dressed neighbors had joined the twins and the dead, and accessions were still arriving at the front door., As Tom, quaking as with a palsy, passed out at the gate, three women came flying from the house on the opposite side of the lane., They rushed by him and in at the gate, asking him what the trouble was there, but not waiting for an answer., Tom said to himself, ""Those old maids waited to dress--they did the same thing the night Stevens's house burned down next door."", In a few minutes he was in the haunted house., He lighted a candle and took off his girl-clothes., There was blood on him all down his left side, and his right hand was red with the stains of the blood-soaked notes which he has crushed in it; but otherwise he was free from this sort of evidence., He cleansed his hand on the straw, and cleaned most of the smut from his face., Then he burned the male and female attire to ashes, scattered the ashes, and put on a disguise proper for a tramp., He blew out his light, went below, and was soon loafing down the river road with the intent to borrow and use one of Roxy's devices., He found a canoe and paddled down downstream, setting the canoe adrift as dawn approached, and making his way by land to the next village, where he kept out of sight till a transient steamer came along, and then took deck passage for St. Louis., He was ill at ease Dawson's Landing was behind him; then he said to himself, ""All the detectives on earth couldn't trace me now; there's not a vestige of a clue left in the world; that homicide will take its place with the permanent mysteries, and people won't get done trying to guess out the secret of it for fifty years."", ...]",1
57,"[It seems to me that if we can save these poor persecuted strangers, it is our bounden duty to stand up here and talk for them till--""  ""There, there, there, do sit down!"", It cost some trouble and a good deal of coaxing, but they were got into their seats at last., The trial was soon ended now., The twins themselves became witnesses in their own defense., They established the fact, upon oath, that the leg-power passed from one to the other every Saturday night at twelve o'clock sharp., But or cross-examination their counsel would not allow them to tell whose week of power the current week was., The judge insisted upon their answering, and proposed to compel them, but even the prosecution took fright and came to the rescue then, and helped stay the sturdy jurist's revolutionary hand., So the case had to go to the jury with that important point hanging in the air., They were out an hour and brought in this verdict:  ""We the jury do find:  1, that an assault was committed, as charged; 2, that it was committed by one of the persons accused, he having been seen to do it by several credible witnesses; 3, but that his identity is so merged in his brother's that we have not been able to tell which was him., We cannot convict both, for only one is guilty., We cannot acquit both, for only one is innocent., Our verdict is that justice has been defeated by the dispensation of God, and ask to be discharged from further duty."", This was read aloud in court and brought out a burst of hearty applause., The old ladies made a spring at the twins, to shake and congratulate, but were gently disengaged by Mr. Wilson and softly crowded back into their places., The judge rose in his little tribune, laid aside his silver-bowed spectacles, roached his gray hair up with his fingers, and said, with dignity and solemnity, and even with a certain pathos:  ""In all my experience on the bench, I have not seen justice bow her head in shame in this court until this day., You little realize what far-reaching harm has just been wrought here under the fickle forms of law., Imitation is the bane of courts--I thank God that this one is free from the contamination of that vice--and in no long time you will see the fatal work of this hour seized upon by profligate so-called guardians of justice in all the wide circumstance of this planet and perpetuated in their pernicious decisions., I wash my hands of this iniquity., I would have compelled these culprits to expose their guilt, but support failed me where I had most right to expect aid and encouragement., And I was confronted by a law made in the interest of crime, which protects the criminal from testifying against himself., Yet I had precedents of my own whereby I had set aside that law on two different occasions and thus succeeded in convicting criminals to whose crimes there were no witnesses but themselves., What have you accomplished this day?, Do you realize it?, You have set adrift, unadmonished, in this community, two men endowed with an awful and mysterious gift, a hidden and grisly power for evil --a power by which each in his turn may commit crime after crime of the most heinous character, and no man be able to tell which is the guilty or which the innocent party in any case of them all., Look to your homes look to your property look to your lives for you have need!, ""Prisoners at the bar, stand up., Through suppression of evidence, a jury of your--our--countrymen have been obliged to deliver a verdict concerning your case which stinks to heaven with the rankness of its injustice., By its terms you, the guilty one, go free with the innocent., Depart in peace, and come no more!, The costs devolve upon the outraged plaintiff--another iniquity., The court stands dissolved."", Almost everybody crowded forward to overwhelm the twins and their counsel with congratulations; but presently the two old aunties dug the duplicates out and bore them away in triumph through the hurrahing crowd, while lots of new friends carried Pudd'nhead Wilson off tavernward to feast him and ""wet down"" his great and victorious entry into the legal arena., To Wilson, so long familiar with neglect and depreciation, this strange new incense of popularity and admiration was as a fragrance blown from the fields of paradise., A happy man was Wilson., THE AMAZING DUEL       A deputation came in the evening and conferred upon Wilson the      welcome honor of a nomination for mayor; for the village has just      been converted into a city by charter., Tom skulks out of      challenging the twins., Judge Driscoll thereupon challenges Angelo      (accused by Tom of doing the kicking); he declines, but Luigi      accepts in his place against Angelo's timid protest., It was late Saturday night nearing eleven., The judge and his second found the rest of the war party at the further end of the vacant ground, near the haunted house., Pudd'nhead Wilson advanced to meet them, and said anxiously:  ""I must say a word in behalf of my principal's proxy, Count Luigi, to whom you have kindly granted the privilege of fighting my principal's battle for him., It is growing late, and Count Luigi is in great trouble lest midnight shall strike before the finish."", ""It is another testimony,"" said Howard, approvingly., ""That young man is fine all through., He wishes to save his brother the sorrow of fighting on the Sabbath, and he is right; it is the right and manly feeling and does him credit., We will make all possible haste."", Wilson said: ""There is also another reason--a consideration, in fact, which deeply concerns Count Luigi himself., These twins have command of their mutual legs turn about., Count Luigi is in command now; but at midnight, possession will pass to my principal, Count Angelo, and--well, you can foresee what will happen., He will march straight off the field, and carry Luigi with him."", ""Why!, sure enough!"", cried the judge, ""we have heard something about that extraordinary law of their being, already--nothing very definite, it is true, as regards dates and durations of power, but I see it is definite enough as regards to-night., Of course we must give Luigi every chance., Omit all the ceremonial possible, gentlemen, and place us in position."", The seconds at once tossed up a coin; Howard won the choice., He placed the judge sixty feet from the haunted house and facing it; Wilson placed the twins within fifteen feet of the house and facing the judge --necessarily., The pistol-case was opened and the long slim tubes taken out; when the moonlight glinted from them a shiver went through Angelo., The doctor was a fool, but a thoroughly well-meaning one, with a kind heart and a sincere disposition to oblige, but along with it an absence of tact which often hurt its effectiveness., He brought his box of lint and bandages, and asked Angelo to feel and see how soft and comfortable they were., Angelo's head fell over against Luigi's in a faint, and precious time was lost in bringing him to; which provoked Luigi into expressing his mind to the doctor with a good deal of vigor and frankness., After Angelo came to he was still so weak that Luigi was obliged to drink a stiff horn of brandy to brace him up., The seconds now stepped at once to their posts, halfway between the combatants, one of them on each side of the line of fire., Wilson was to count, very deliberately, ""One-two-three-fire!--stop!"", and the duelists could bang away at any time they chose during that recitation, but not after the last word., Angelo grew very nervous when he saw Wilson's hand rising slowly into the air as a sign to make ready, and he leaned his head against Luigi's and said:  ""Oh, please take me away from here, I can't stay, I know I can't!"", ""What in the world are you doing?, Straighten up!, What's the matter with you?--you're in no danger--nobody's going to shoot at you., Straighten up, I tell you!"", Angelo obeyed, just in time to hear:  ""One--!"", ""Bang!"", Just one report, and a little tuft of white hair floated slowly to the judge's feet in the moonlight., The judge did not swerve; he still stood erect and motionless, like a statue, with his pistol-arm hanging straight down at his side., He was reserving his fire., ""Two--!"", ""Three--""!, ""Fire--!"", Up came the pistol-arm instantly-Angelo dodged with the report., He said ""Ouch!"", and fainted again., The doctor examined and bandaged the wound., It was of no consequence, he said--bullet through fleshy part of arm--no bones broken the gentleman was still able to fight let the duel proceed., Next time Angelo jumped just as Luigi fired, which disordered his aim and caused him to cut a chip off of Howard's ear., The judge took his time again, and when he fired Angelo jumped and got a knuckle skinned., The doctor inspected and dressed the wounds., Angelo now spoke out and said he was content with the satisfaction he had got, and if the judge--but Luigi shut him roughly up, and asked him not to make an ass of himself; adding:  ""And I want you to stop dodging., You take a great deal too prominent a part in this thing for a person who has got nothing to do with it., You should remember that you are here only by courtesy, and are without official recognition; officially you are not here at all; officially you do not even exist., To all intents and purposes you are absent from this place, and you ought for your own modesty's sake to reflect that it cannot become a person who is not present here to be taking this sort of public and indecent prominence in a matter in which he is not in the slightest degree concerned., Now, don't dodge again; the bullets are not for you, they are for me; if I want them dodged I will attend to it myself., I never saw a person act so."", Angelo saw the reasonableness of what his brother had said, and he did try to reform, but it was of no use; both pistols went off at the same instant, and he jumped once more; he got a sharp scrape along his cheek from the judge's bullet, and so deflected Luigi's aim that his ball went wide and chipped flake of skin from Pudd'nhead Wilson's chin., The doctor attended to the wounded., By the terms, the duel was over., But Luigi was entirely out of patience, and begged for one exchange of shots, insisting that he had had no fair chance, on account of his brother's indelicate behavior., Howard was opposed to granting so unusual a privilege, but the judge took Luigi's part, and added that indeed he himself might fairly be considered entitled to another trial, because although the proxy on the other side was in no way to blame for his (the judge's) humiliatingly resultless work, the gentleman with whom he was fighting this duel was to blame for it, since if he had played no advantages and had held his head still, his proxy would have been disposed of early., He added:  ""Count Luigi's request for another exchange is another proof that he is a brave and chivalrous gentleman, and I beg that the courtesy he asks may be accorded him."", ""I thank you most sincerely for this generosity, Judge Driscoll,"" said Luigi, with a polite bow, and moving to his place., Then he added to Angelo, ""Now hold your grip, hold your grip, I tell you, and I'll land him sure!"", The men stood erect, their pistol-arms at their sides, the two seconds stood at their official posts, the doctor stood five paces in Wilson's rear with his instruments and bandages in his hands., ...]",1
58,"[He had dreamed of her doing such a thing, some time before, and now he remembered that dream with apprehension and anger, and said that rather than see her unsex herself and go away with the armies, he would require her brothers to drown her; and that if they should refuse, he would do it with his own hands., But none of these things shook her purpose in the least., Her parents kept a strict watch upon her to keep her from leaving the village, but she said her time was not yet; that when the time to go was come she should know it, and then the keepers would watch in vain., The summer wasted along; and when it was seen that her purpose continued steadfast, the parents were glad of a chance which finally offered itself for bringing her projects to an end through marriage., The Paladin had the effrontery to pretend that she had engaged herself to him several years before, and now he claimed a ratification of the engagement., She said his statement was not true, and refused to marry him., She was cited to appear before the ecclesiastical court at Toul to answer for her perversity; when she declined to have counsel, and elected to conduct her case herself, her parents and all her ill-wishers rejoiced, and looked upon her as already defeated., And that was natural enough; for who would expect that an ignorant peasant-girl of sixteen would be otherwise than frightened and tongue-tied when standing for the first time in presence of the practised doctors of the law, and surrounded by the cold solemnities of a court?, Yet all these people were mistaken., They flocked to Toul to see and enjoy this fright and embarrassment and defeat, and they had their trouble for their pains., She was modest, tranquil, and quite at her ease., She called no witnesses, saying she would content herself with examining the witnesses for the prosecution., When they had testified, she rose and reviewed their testimony in a few words, pronounced it vague, confused, and of no force, then she placed the Paladin again on the stand and began to search him., His previous testimony went rag by rag to ruin under her ingenious hands, until at last he stood bare, so to speak, he that had come so richly clothed in fraud and falsehood., His counsel began an argument, but the court declined to hear it, and threw out the case, adding a few words of grave compliment for Joan, and referring to her as ""this marvelous child."", After this victory, with this high praise from so imposing a source added, the fickle village turned again, and gave Joan countenance, compliment, and peace., Her mother took her back to her heart, and even her father relented and said he was proud of her., But the time hung heavy on her hands, nevertheless, for the siege of Orleans was begun, the clouds lowered darker and darker over France, and still her Voices said wait, and gave her no direct commands., The winter set in, and wore tediously along; but at last there was a change., IN COURT AND CAMP  Joan Says Good-By  THE 5th of January, 1429, Joan came to me with her uncle Laxart, and said:  ""The time is come., My Voices are not vague now, but clear, and they have told me what to do., In two months I shall be with the Dauphin."", Her spirits were high, and her bearing martial., I caught the infection and felt a great impulse stirring in me that was like what one feels when he hears the roll of the drums and the tramp of marching men., ""I believe it,"" I said., ""I also believe it,"" said Laxart., ""If she had told me before, that she was commanded of God to rescue France, I should not have believed; I should have let her seek the governor by her own ways and held myself clear of meddling in the matter, not doubting she was mad., But I have seen her stand before those nobles and might men unafraid, and say her say; and she had not been able to do that but by the help of God., That I know., Therefore with all humbleness I am at her command, to do with me as she will."", ""My uncle is very good to me,"" Joan said., ""I sent and asked him to come and persuade my mother to let him take me home with him to tend his wife, who is not well., It is arranged, and we go at dawn to-morrow., From his house I shall go soon to Vaucouleurs, and wait and strive until my prayer is granted., Who were the two cavaliers who sat to your left at the governor's table that day?"", ""One was the Sieur Jean de Novelonpont de Metz, the other the Sieur Bertrand de Poulengy."", ""Good metal--good metal, both., I marked them for men of mine., ., ., ., What is it I see in your face?, Doubt?"", I was teaching myself to speak the truth to her, not trimming it or polishing it; so I said:  ""They considered you out of your head, and said so., It is true they pitied you for being in such misfortune, but still they held you to be mad."", This did not seem to trouble her in any way or wound her., She only said:  ""The wise change their minds when they perceive that they have been in error., These will., They will march with me., I shall see them presently., ., ., ., You seem to doubt again?, Do you doubt?"", ""N-no., Not now., I was remembering that it was a year ago, and that they did not belong here, but only chanced to stop a day on their journey."", ""They will come again., But as to matters now in hand; I came to leave with you some instructions., You will follow me in a few days., Order your affairs, for you will be absent long."", ""Will Jean and Pierre go with me?"", ""No; they would refuse now, but presently they will come, and with them they will bring my parents' blessing, and likewise their consent that I take up my mission., I shall be stronger, then--stronger for that; for lack of it I am weak now."", She paused a little while, and the tears gathered in her eyes; then she went on: ""I would say good-by to Little Mengette., Bring her outside the village at dawn; she must go with me a little of the way--""  ""And Haumette?"", She broke down and began to cry, saying:  ""No, oh, no--she is too dear to me, I could not bear it, knowing I should never look upon her face again."", Next morning I brought Mengette, and we four walked along the road in the cold dawn till the village was far behind; then the two girls said their good-bys, clinging about each other's neck, and pouring out their grief in loving words and tears, a pitiful sight to see., And Joan took one long look back upon the distant village, and the Fairy Tree, and the oak forest, and the flowery plain, and the river, as if she was trying to print these scenes on her memory so that they would abide there always and not fade, for she knew she would not see them any more in this life; then she turned, and went from us, sobbing bitterly., It was her birthday and mine., She was seventeen years old., The Governor Speeds Joan  After a few days, Laxart took Joan to Vaucouleurs, and found lodging and guardianship for her with Catherine Royer, a wheelwright's wife, an honest and good woman., Joan went to mass regularly, she helped do the housework, earning her keep in that way, and if any wished to talk with her about her mission--and many did--she talked freely, making no concealments regarding the matter now., I was soon housed near by, and witnessed the effects which followed., At once the tidings spread that a young girl was come who was appointed of God to save France., The common people flocked in crowds to look at her and speak with her, and her fair young loveliness won the half of their belief, and her deep earnestness and transparent sincerity won the other half., The well-to-do remained away and scoffed, but that is their way., Next, a prophecy of Merlin's, more than eight hundred years old, was called to mind, which said that in a far future time France would be lost by a woman and restored by a woman., France was now, for the first time, lost--and by a woman, Isabel of Bavaria, her base Queen; doubtless this fair and pure young girl was commissioned of Heaven to complete the prophecy., This gave the growing interest a new and powerful impulse; the excitement rose higher and higher, and hope and faith along with it; and so from Vaucouleurs wave after wave of this inspiring enthusiasm flowed out over the land, far and wide, invading all the villages and refreshing and revivifying the perishing children of France; and from these villages came people who wanted to see for themselves, hear for themselves; and they did see and hear, and believe., They filled the town; they more than filled it; inns and lodgings were packed, and yet half of the inflow had to go without shelter., And still they came, winter as it was, for when a man's soul is starving, what does he care for meat and roof so he can but get that nobler hunger fed?, Day after day, and still day after day the great tide rose., Domremy was dazed, amazed, stupefied, and said to itself, ""Was this world-wonder in our familiar midst all these years and we too dull to see it?"", Jean and Pierre went out from the village, stared at and envied like the great and fortunate of the earth, and their progress to Vaucouleurs was like a triumph, all the country-side flocking to see and salute the brothers of one with whom angels had spoken face to face, and into whose hands by command of God they had delivered the destinies of France., The brothers brought the parents' blessing and godspeed to Joan, and their promise to bring it to her in person later; and so, with this culminating happiness in her heart and the high hope it inspired, she went and confronted the governor again., But he was no more tractable than he had been before., He refused to send her to the King., She was disappointed, but in no degree discouraged., She said:  ""I must still come to you until I get the men-at-arms; for so it is commanded, and I may not disobey., I must go to the Dauphin, though I go on my knees."", I and the two brothers were with Joan daily, to see the people that came and hear what they said; and one day, sure enough, the Sieur Jean de Metz came., He talked with her in a petting and playful way, as one talks with children, and said:  ""What are you doing here, my little maid?, Will they drive the King out of France, and shall we all turn English?"", She answered him in her tranquil, serious way:  ""I am come to bid Robert de Baudricourt take or send me to the King, but he does not heed my words."", ""Ah, you have an admirable persistence, truly; a whole year has not turned you from your wish., I saw you when you came before."", Joan said, as tranquilly as before:  ""It is not a wish, it is a purpose., He will grant it., ...]",1
59,"[All arrangements having been completed for the return of the main body of the army, she took the Bastard and La Hire and a thousand men and went down to Orleans, where all the town was in a fever of impatience to have sight of her face., It was eight in the evening when she and the troops rode in at the Burgundy gate, with the Paladin preceding her with her standard., She was riding a white horse, and she carried in her hand the sacred sword of Fierbois., You should have seen Orleans then., What a picture it was!, Such black seas of people, such a starry firmament of torches, such roaring whirlwinds of welcome, such booming of bells and thundering of cannon!, It was as if the world was come to an end., Everywhere in the glare of the torches one saw rank upon rank of upturned white faces, the mouths wide open, shouting, and the unchecked tears running down; Joan forged her slow way through the solid masses, her mailed form projecting above the pavement of heads like a silver statue., The people about her struggled along, gazing up at her through their tears with the rapt look of men and women who believe they are seeing one who is divine; and always her feet were being kissed by grateful folk, and such as failed of that privilege touched her horse and then kissed their fingers., Nothing that Joan did escaped notice; everything she did was commented upon and applauded., You could hear the remarks going all the time., ""There--she's smiling--see!"", ""Now she's taking her little plumed cap off to somebody--ah, it's fine and graceful!"", ""She's patting that woman on the head with her gauntlet."", ""Oh, she was born on a horse--see her turn in her saddle, and kiss the hilt of her sword to the ladies in the window that threw the flowers down."", ""Now there's a poor woman lifting up a child--she's kissed it--oh, she's divine!"", ""What a dainty little figure it is, and what a lovely face--and such color and animation!"", Joan's slender long banner streaming backward had an accident--the fringe caught fire from a torch., She leaned forward and crushed the flame in her hand., ""She's not afraid of fire nor anything!"", they shouted, and delivered a storm of admiring applause that made everything quake., She rode to the cathedral and gave thanks to God, and the people crammed the place and added their devotions to hers; then she took up her march again and picked her slow way through the crowds and the wilderness of torches to the house of Jacques Boucher, treasurer of the Duke of Orleans, where she was to be the guest of his wife as long as she stayed in the city, and have his young daughter for comrade and room-mate., The delirium of the people went on the rest of the night, and with it the clamor of the joy-bells and the welcoming cannon., Joan of Arc had stepped upon her stage at last, and was ready to begin., What the English Answered  SHE WAS ready, but must sit down and wait until there was an army to work with., Next morning, Saturday, April 30, 1429, she set about inquiring after the messenger who carried her proclamation to the English from Blois--the one which she had dictated at Poitiers., Here is a copy of it., It is a remarkable document, for several reasons: for its matter-of-fact directness, for its high spirit and forcible diction, and for its naive confidence in her ability to achieve the prodigious task which she had laid upon herself, or which had been laid upon her--which you please., All through it you seem to see the pomps of war and hear the rumbling of the drums., In it Joan's warrior soul is revealed, and for the moment the soft little shepherdess has disappeared from your view., This untaught country-damsel, unused to dictating anything at all to anybody, much less documents of state to kings and generals, poured out this procession of vigorous sentences as fluently as if this sort of work had been her trade from childhood:  JESUS MARIA King of England and you Duke of Bedford who call yourself Regent of France; William de la Pole, Earl of Suffolk; and you Thomas Lord Scales, who style yourselves lieutenants of the said Bedford--do right to the King of Heaven., Render to the Maid who is sent by God the keys of all the good towns you have taken and violated in France., She is sent hither by God, to restore the blood royal., She is very ready to make peace if you will do her right by giving up France and paying for what you have held., And you archers, companions of war, noble and otherwise, who are before the good city of Orleans, begone into your own land in God's name, or expect news from the Maid who will shortly go to see you to your very great hurt., King of England, if you do not so, I am chief of war, and whenever I shall find your people in France, I will drive them out, willing or not willing; and if they do not obey I will slay them all, but if they obey, I will have them to mercy., I am come hither by God, the King of Heaven, body for body, to put you our of France, in spite of those who would work treason and mischief against the kingdom., Think not you shall ever hold the kingdom from the King of Heaven, the Son of the Blessed Mary; King Charles shall hold it, for God wills it so, and has revealed it to him by the Maid., If you believe not the news sent by God through the Maid, wherever we shall met you we will strike boldly and make such a noise as has not been in France these thousand years., Be sure that God can send more strength to the Maid than you can bring to any assault against her and her good men-at-arms; and then we shall see who has the better right, the King of Heaven, or you., Duke of Bedford, the Maid prays you not to bring about your own destruction., If you do her right, you may yet go in her company where the French shall do the finest deed that has been done in Christendom, and if you do not, you shall be reminded shortly of your great wrongs., In that closing sentence she invites them to go on crusade with her to rescue the Holy Sepulcher., No answer had been returned to this proclamation, and the messenger himself had not come back., So now she sent her two heralds with a new letter warning the English to raise the siege and requiring them to restore that missing messenger., The heralds came back without him., All they brought was notice from the English to Joan that they would presently catch her and burn her if she did not clear out now while she had a chance, and ""go back to her proper trade of minding cows."", She held her peace, only saying it was a pity that the English would persist in inviting present disaster and eventual destruction when she was ""doing all she could to get them out of the country with their lives still in their bodies."", Presently she thought of an arrangement that might be acceptable, and said to the heralds, ""Go back and say to Lord Talbot this, from me: 'Come out of your bastilles with your host, and I will come with mine; if I beat you, go in peace out of France; if you beat me, burn me, according to your desire.'"", I did not hear this, but Dunois did, and spoke of it., The challenge was refused., Sunday morning her Voices or some instinct gave her a warning, and she sent Dunois to Blois to take command of the army and hurry it to Orleans., It was a wise move, for he found Regnault de Chartres and some more of the King's pet rascals there trying their best to disperse the army, and crippling all the efforts of Joan's generals to head it for Orleans., They were a fine lot, those miscreants., They turned their attention to Dunois now, but he had balked Joan once, with unpleasant results to himself, and was not minded to meddle in that way again., He soon had the army moving., My Exquisite Poem Goes to Smash  WE OF the personal staff were in fairyland now, during the few days that we waited for the return of the army., We went into society., To our two knights this was not a novelty, but to us young villagers it was a new and wonderful life., Any position of any sort near the person of the Maid of Vaucouleurs conferred high distinction upon the holder and caused his society to be courted; and so the D'Arc brothers, and Noel, and the Paladin, humble peasants at home, were gentlemen here, personages of weight and influence., It was fine to see how soon their country diffidences and awkwardnesses melted away under this pleasant sun of deference and disappeared, and how lightly and easily they took to their new atmosphere., The Paladin was as happy as it was possible for any one in this earth to be., His tongue went all the time, and daily he got new delight out of hearing himself talk., He began to enlarge his ancestry and spread it out all around, and ennoble it right and left, and it was not long until it consisted almost entirely of dukes., He worked up his old battles and tricked them out with fresh splendors; also with new terrors, for he added artillery now., We had seen cannon for the first time at Blois--a few pieces--here there was plenty of it, and now and then we had the impressive spectacle of a huge English bastille hidden from sight in a mountain of smoke from its own guns, with lances of red flame darting through it; and this grand picture, along with the quaking thunders pounding away in the heart of it, inflamed the Paladin's imagination and enabled him to dress out those ambuscade-skirmishes of ours with a sublimity which made it impossible for any to recognize them at all except people who had not been there., You may suspect that there was a special inspiration for these great efforts of the Paladin's, and there was., It was the daughter of the house, Catherine Boucher, who was eighteen, and gentle and lovely in her ways, and very beautiful., I think she might have been as beautiful as Joan herself, if she had had Joan's eyes., But that could never be., There was never but that one pair, there will never be another., Joan's eyes were deep and rich and wonderful beyond anything merely earthly., They spoke all the languages--they had no need of words., They produced all effects--and just by a glance, just a single glance; a glance that could convict a liar of his lie and make him confess it; that could bring down a proud man's pride and make him humble; that could put courage into a coward and strike dead the courage of the bravest; that could appease resentments and real hatreds; that could make the doubter believe and the hopeless hope again; that could purify the impure mind; that could persuade--ah, there it is--persuasion!, that is the word; what or who is it that it couldn't persuade?, The maniac of Domremy--the fairy-banishing priest--the reverend tribunal of Toul--the doubting and superstitious Laxart--the obstinate veteran of Vaucouleurs--the characterless heir of France--the sages and scholars of the Parliament and University of Poitiers--the darling of Satan, La Hire--the masterless Bastard of Orleans, accustomed to acknowledge no way as right and rational but his own--these were the trophies of that great gift that made her the wonder and mystery that she was., We mingled companionably with the great folk who flocked to the big house to make Joan's acquaintance, and they made much of us and we lived in the clouds, so to speak., But what we preferred even to this happiness was the quieter occasions, when the formal guests were gone and the family and a few dozen of its familiar friends were gathered together for a social good time., It was then that we did our best, we five youngsters, with such fascinations as we had, and the chief object of them was Catherine., None of us had ever been in love been in love before, and now we had the misfortune to all fall in love with the same person at the same time--which was the first moment we saw her., She was a merry heart, and full of life, and I still remember tenderly those few evenings that I was permitted to have my share of her dear society and of comradeship with that little company of charming people., The Paladin made us all jealous the first night, for when he got fairly started on those battles of his he had everything to himself, and there was no use in anybody else's trying to get any attention., Those people had been living in the midst of real war for seven months; and to hear this windy giant lay out his imaginary campaigns and fairly swim in blood and spatter it all around, entertained them to the verge of the grave., Catherine was like to die, for pure enjoyment., She didn't laugh loud--we, of course, wished she would--but kept in the shelter of a fan, and shook until there was danger that she would unhitch her ribs from her spine., Then when the Paladin had got done with a battle and we began to feel thankful and hope for a change, she would speak up in a way that was so sweet and persuasive that it rankled in me, and ask him about some detail or other in the early part of his battle which she said had greatly interested her, and would he be so good as to describe that part again and with a little more particularity?--which of course precipitated the whole battle on us, again, with a hundred lies added that had been overlooked before., I do not know how to make you realize the pain I suffered., I had never been jealous before, and it seemed intolerable that this creature should have this good fortune which he was so ill entitled to, and I have to sit and see myself neglected when I was so longing for the least little attention out of the thousand that this beloved girl was lavishing on him., I was near her, and tried two or three times to get started on some of the things that I had done in those battles--and I felt ashamed of myself, too, for stooping to such a business--but she cared for nothing but his battles, and could not be got to listen; and presently when one of my attempts caused her to lose some precious rag or other of his mendacities and she asked him to repeat, thus bringing on a new engagement, of course, and increasing the havoc and carnage tenfold, I felt so humiliated by this pitiful miscarriage of mine that I gave up and tried no more., The others were as outraged by the Paladin's selfish conduct as I was--and by his grand luck, too, of course--perhaps, indeed, that was the main hurt., We talked our trouble over together, which was natural, for rivals become brothers when a common affliction assails them and a common enemy bears off the victory., Each of us could do things that would please and get notice if it were not for this person, who occupied all the time and gave others no chance., I had made a poem, taking a whole night to it--a poem in which I most happily and delicately celebrated that sweet girl's charms, without mentioning her name, but any one could see who was meant; for the bare title--""The Rose of Orleans""--would reveal that, as it seemed to me., It pictured this pure and dainty white rose as growing up out of the rude soil of war and looking abroad out of its tender eyes upon the horrid machinery of death, and then--note this conceit--it blushes for the sinful nature of man, and turns red in a single night., Becomes a red rose, you see--a rose that was white before., The idea was my own, and quite new., Then it sent its sweet perfume out over the embattled city, and when the beleaguering forces smelt it they laid down their arms and wept., This was also my own idea, and new., That closed that part of the poem; then I put her into the similitude of the firmament--not the whole of it, but only part., That is to say, she was the moon, and all the constellations were following her about, their hearts in flames for love of her, but she would not halt, she would not listen, for 'twas thought she loved another., ...]",1
60,"[And you led an assault again., Joan, it is tempting Providence., I want you to make me a promise., I want you to promise me that you will let others lead the assaults, if there must be assaults, and that you will take better care of yourself in those dreadful battles., Will you?"", But Joan fought away from the promise and did not give it., Catherine sat troubled and discontented awhile, then she said:  ""Joan, are you going to be a soldier always?, These wars are so long--so long., They last forever and ever and ever."", There was a glad flash in Joan's eye as she cried:  ""This campaign will do all the really hard work that is in front of it in the next four days., The rest of it will be gentler--oh, far less bloody., Yes, in four days France will gather another trophy like the redemption of Orleans and make her second long step toward freedom!"", Catherine started (and do did I); then she gazed long at Joan like one in a trance, murmuring ""four days--four days,"" as if to herself and unconsciously., Finally she asked, in a low voice that had something of awe in it:  ""Joan, tell me--how is it that you know that?, For you do know it, I think."", ""Yes,"" said Joan, dreamily, ""I know--I know., I shall strike--and strike again., And before the fourth day is finished I shall strike yet again."", She became silent., We sat wondering and still., This was for a whole minute, she looking at the floor and her lips moving but uttering nothing., Then came these words, but hardly audible: ""And in a thousand years the English power in France will not rise up from that blow."", It made my flesh creep., It was uncanny., She was in a trance again--I could see it--just as she was that day in the pastures of Domremy when she prophesied about us boys in the war and afterward did not know that she had done it., She was not conscious now; but Catherine did not know that, and so she said, in a happy voice:  ""Oh, I believe it, I believe it, and I am so glad!, Then you will come back and bide with us all your life long, and we will love you so, and honor you!"", A scarcely perceptible spasm flitted across Joan's face, and the dreamy voice muttered:  ""Before two years are sped I shall die a cruel death!"", I sprang forward with a warning hand up., That is why Catherine did not scream., She was going to do that--I saw it plainly., Then I whispered her to slip out of the place, and say nothing of what had happened., I said Joan was asleep--asleep and dreaming., Catherine whispered back, and said:  ""Oh, I am so grateful that it is only a dream!, It sounded like prophecy."", And she was gone., Like prophecy!, I knew it was prophecy; and I sat down crying, as knowing we should lose her., Soon she started, shivering slightly, and came to herself, and looked around and saw me crying there, and jumped out of her chair and ran to me all in a whirl of sympathy and compassion, and put her hand on my head, and said:  ""My poor boy!, What is it?, Look up and tell me."", I had to tell her a lie; I grieved to do it, but there was no other way., I picked up an old letter from my table, written by Heaven knows who, about some matter Heaven knows what, and told her I had just gotten it from Pere Fronte, and that in it it said the children's Fairy Tree had been chopped down by some miscreant or other, and-- I got no further., She snatched the letter from my hand and searched it up and down and all over, turning it this way and that, and sobbing great sobs, and the tears flowing down her cheeks, and ejaculating all the time, ""Oh, cruel, cruel!, how could any be so heartless?, Ah, poor Arbre Fee de Bourlemont gone--and we children loved it so!, Show me the place where it says it!"", And I, still lying, showed her the pretended fatal words on the pretended fatal page, and she gazed at them through her tears, and said she could see herself that they were hateful, ugly words--they ""had the very look of it."", Then we heard a strong voice down the corridor announcing:  ""His majesty's messenger--with despatches for her Excellency the Commander-in-Chief of the Armies of France!"", Fierce Talbot Reconsiders  I KNEW she had seen the wisdom of the Tree., But when?, I could not know., Doubtless before she had lately told the King to use her, for that she had but one year left to work in., It had not occurred to me at the time, but the conviction came upon me now that at that time she had already seen the Tree., It had brought her a welcome message; that was plain, otherwise she could not have been so joyous and light-hearted as she had been these latter days., The death-warning had nothing dismal about it for her; no, it was remission of exile, it was leave to come home., Yes, she had seen the Tree., No one had taken the prophecy to heart which she made to the King; and for a good reason, no doubt; no one wanted to take it to heart; all wanted to banish it away and forget it., And all had succeeded, and would go on to the end placid and comfortable., All but me alone., I must carry my awful secret without any to help me., A heavy load, a bitter burden; and would cost me a daily heartbreak., She was to die; and so soon., I had never dreamed of that., How could I, and she so strong and fresh and young, and every day earning a new right to a peaceful and honored old age?, For at that time I though old age valuable., I do not know why, but I thought so., All young people think it, I believe, they being ignorant and full of superstitions., She had seen the Tree., All that miserable night those ancient verses went floating back and forth through my brain:       And when, in exile wand'ring, we      Shall fainting yearn for glimpse of thee,      Oh, rise upon our sight!, But at dawn the bugles and the drums burst through the dreamy hush of the morning, and it was turn out all!, mount and ride., For there was red work to be done., We marched to Meung without halting., There we carried the bridge by assault, and left a force to hold it, the rest of the army marching away next morning toward Beaugency, where the lion Talbot, the terror of the French, was in command., When we arrived at that place, the English retired into the castle and we sat down in the abandoned town., Talbot was not at the moment present in person, for he had gone away to watch for and welcome Fastolfe and his reinforcement of five thousand men., Joan placed her batteries and bombarded the castle till night., Then some news came: Richemont, Constable of France, this long time in disgrace with the King, largely because of the evil machinations of La Tremouille and his party, was approaching with a large body of men to offer his services to Joan--and very much she needed them, now that Fastolfe was so close by., Richemont had wanted to join us before, when we first marched on Orleans; but the foolish King, slave of those paltry advisers of his, warned him to keep his distance and refused all reconciliation with him., I go into these details because they are important., Important because they lead up to the exhibition of a new gift in Joan's extraordinary mental make-up--statesmanship., It is a sufficiently strange thing to find that great quality in an ignorant country-girl of seventeen and a half, but she had it., Joan was for receiving Richemont cordially, and so was La Hire and the two young Lavals and other chiefs, but the Lieutenant-General, d'Alencon, strenuously and stubbornly opposed it., He said he had absolute orders from the King to deny and defy Richemont, and that if they were overridden he would leave the army., This would have been a heavy disaster, indeed., But Joan set herself the task of persuading him that the salvation of France took precedence of all minor things--even the commands of a sceptered ass; and she accomplished it., She persuaded him to disobey the King in the interest of the nation, and to be reconciled to Count Richemont and welcome him., That was statesmanship; and of the highest and soundest sort., Whatever thing men call great, look for it in Joan of Arc, and there you will find it., In the early morning, June 17th, the scouts reported the approach of Talbot and Fastolfe with Fastolfe's succoring force., Then the drums beat to arms; and we set forth to meet the English, leaving Richemont and his troops behind to watch the castle of Beaugency and keep its garrison at home., By and by we came in sight of the enemy., Fastolfe had tried to convince Talbot that it would be wisest to retreat and not risk a battle with Joan at this time, but distribute the new levies among the English strongholds of the Loire, thus securing them against capture; then be patient and wait--wait for more levies from Paris; let Joan exhaust her army with fruitless daily skirmishing; then at the right time fall upon her in resistless mass and annihilate her., He was a wise old experienced general, was Fastolfe., But that fierce Talbot would hear of no delay., He was in a rage over the punishment which the Maid had inflicted upon him at Orleans and since, and he swore by God and Saint George that he would have it out with her if he had to fight her all alone., So Fastolfe yielded, though he said they were now risking the loss of everything which the English had gained by so many years' work and so many hard knocks., The enemy had taken up a strong position, and were waiting, in order of battle, with their archers to the front and a stockade before them., Night was coming on., ...]",1
61,"[It was a most joyful meeting, that you will easily know; and also as sad as it was joyful., We could not speak Joan's name., One's voice would have broken down., We knew who was meant when she was mentioned; we could say ""she"" and ""her,"" but we could not speak the name., We talked of the personal staff., Old D'Aulon, wounded and a prisoner, was still with Joan and serving her, by permission of the Duke of Burgundy., Joan was being treated with respect due to her rank and to her character as a prisoner of war taken in honorable conflict., And this was continued--as we learned later--until she fell into the hands of that bastard of Satan, Pierre Cauchon, Bishop of Beauvais., Noel was full of noble and affectionate praises and appreciations of our old boastful big Standard-Bearer, now gone silent forever, his real and imaginary battles all fought, his work done, his life honorably closed and completed., ""And think of his luck!"", burst out Noel, with his eyes full of tears., ""Always the pet child of luck!, ""See how it followed him and stayed by him, from his first step all through, in the field or out of it; always a splendid figure in the public eye, courted and envied everywhere; always having a chance to do fine things and always doing them; in the beginning called the Paladin in joke, and called it afterward in earnest because he magnificently made the title good; and at last--supremest luck of all--died in the field!, died with his harness on; died faithful to his charge the Standard in his hand; died--oh, think of it--with the approving eye of Joan of Arc upon him!, ""He drained the cup of glory to the last drop, and went jubilant to his peace, blessedly spared all part in the disaster which was to follow., What luck, what luck!, And we?, What was our sin that we are still here, we who have also earned our place with the happy dead?"", And presently he said:  ""They tore the sacred Standard from his dead hand and carried it away, their most precious prize after its captured owner., But they haven't it now., A month ago we put our lives upon the risk--our two good knights, my fellow-prisoners, and I--and stole it, and got it smuggled by trusty hands to Orleans, and there it is now, safe for all time in the Treasury."", I was glad and grateful to learn that., I have seen it often since, when I have gone to Orleans on the 8th of May to be the petted old guest of the city and hold the first place of honor at the banquets and in the processions--I mean since Joan's brothers passed from this life., It will still be there, sacredly guarded by French love, a thousand years from now--yes, as long as any shred of it hangs together., [1] Two or three weeks after this talk came the tremendous news like a thunder-clap, and we were aghast--Joan of Arc sold to the English!, Not for a moment had we ever dreamed of such a thing., We were young, you see, and did not know the human race, as I have said before., We had been so proud of our country, so sure of her nobleness, her magnanimity, her gratitude., We had expected little of the King, but of France we had expected everything., Everybody knew that in various towns patriot priests had been marching in procession urging the people to sacrifice money, property, everything, and buy the freedom of their heaven-sent deliverer., That the money would be raised we had not thought of doubting., But it was all over now, all over., It was a bitter time for us., The heavens seemed hung with black; all cheer went out from our hearts., Was this comrade here at my bedside really Noel Rainguesson, that light-hearted creature whose whole life was but one long joke, and who used up more breath in laughter than in keeping his body alive?, No, no; that Noel I was to see no more., This one's heart was broken., He moved grieving about, and absently, like one in a dream; the stream of his laughter was dried at its source., Well, that was best., It was my own mood., We were company for each other., He nursed me patiently through the dull long weeks, and at last, in January, I was strong enough to go about again., Then he said:  ""Shall we go now?"", ""Yes."", There was no need to explain., Our hearts were in Rouen; we would carry our bodies there., All that we cared for in this life was shut up in that fortress., We could not help her, but it would be some solace to us to be near her, to breathe the air that she breathed, and look daily upon the stone walls that hid her., What if we should be made prisoners there?, Well, we could but do our best, and let luck and fate decide what should happen., And so we started., We could not realize the change which had come upon the country., We seemed able to choose our own route and go whenever we pleased, unchallenged and unmolested., When Joan of Arc was in the field there was a sort of panic of fear everywhere; but now that she was out of the way, fear had vanished., Nobody was troubled about you or afraid of you, nobody was curious about you or your business, everybody was indifferent., We presently saw that we could take to the Seine, and not weary ourselves out with land travel., So we did it, and were carried in a boat to within a league of Rouen., Then we got ashore; not on the hilly side, but on the other, where it is as level as a floor., Nobody could enter or leave the city without explaining himself., It was because they feared attempts at a rescue of Joan., We had no trouble., We stopped in the plain with a family of peasants and stayed a week, helping them with their work for board and lodging, and making friends of them., We got clothes like theirs, and wore them., When we had worked our way through their reserves and gotten their confidence, we found that they secretly harbored French hearts in their bodies., Then we came out frankly and told them everything, and found them ready to do anything they could to help us., Our plan was soon made, and was quite simple., It was to help them drive a flock of sheep to the market of the city., One morning early we made the venture in a melancholy drizzle of rain, and passed through the frowning gates unmolested., Our friends had friends living over a humble wine shop in a quaint tall building situated in one of the narrow lanes that run down from the cathedral to the river, and with these they bestowed us; and the next day they smuggled our own proper clothing and other belongings to us., The family that lodged us--the Pieroons--were French in sympathy, and we needed to have no secrets from them., [1] It remained there three hundred and sixty years, and then was destroyed in a public bonfire, together with two swords, a plumed cap, several suits of state apparel, and other relics of the Maid, by a mob in the time of the Revolution., Nothing which the hand of Joan of Arc is known to have touched now remains in existence except a few preciously guarded military and state papers which she signed, her pen being guided by a clerk or her secretary, Louis de Conte., A boulder exists from which she is known to have mounted her horse when she was once setting out upon a campaign., Up to a quarter of a century ago there was a single hair from her head still in existence., It was drawn through the wax of a seal attached to the parchment of a state document., It was surreptitiously snipped out, seal and all, by some vandal relic-hunter, and carried off., Doubtless it still exists, but only the thief knows where., -- TRANSLATOR., Weaving the Net About Her  IT WAS necessary for me to have some way to gain bread for Noel and myself; and when the Pierrons found that I knew how to write, the applied to their confessor in my behalf, and he got a place for me with a good priest named Manchon, who was to be the chief recorder in the Great Trial of Joan of Arc now approaching., It was a strange position for me--clerk to the recorder--and dangerous if my sympathies and the late employment should be found out., But there was not much danger., Manchon was at bottom friendly to Joan and would not betray me; and my name would not, for I had discarded my surname and retained only my given one, like a person of low degree., I attended Manchon constantly straight along, out of January and into February, and was often in the citadel with him--in the very fortress where Joan was imprisoned, though not in the dungeon where she was confined, and so did not see her, of course., Manchon told me everything that had been happening before my coming., Ever since the purchase of Joan, Cauchon had been busy packing his jury for the destruction of the Maid--weeks and weeks he had spent in this bad industry., The University of Paris had sent him a number of learned and able and trusty ecclesiastics of the stripe he wanted; and he had scraped together a clergyman of like stripe and great fame here and there and yonder, until he was able to construct a formidable court numbering half a hundred distinguished names., French names they were, but their interests and sympathies were English., A great officer of the Inquisition was also sent from Paris for the accused must be tried by the forms of the Inquisition; but this was a brave and righteous man, and he said squarely that this court had no power to try the case, wherefore he refused to act; and the same honest talk was uttered by two or three others., The Inquisitor was right., The case as here resurrected against Joan had already been tried long ago at Poitiers, and decided in her favor., Yes, and by a higher tribunal than this one, for at the head of it was an Archbishop--he of Rheims--Cauchon's own metropolitan., So here, you see, a lower court was impudently preparing to try and redecide a cause which had already been decided by its superior, a court of higher authority., Imagine it!, No, the case could not properly be tried again., Cauchon could not properly preside in this new court, for more than one reason:  Rouen was not in his diocese; Joan had not been arrested in her domicile, which was still Domremy; and finally this proposed judge was the prisoner's outspoken enemy, and therefore he was incompetent to try her., Yet all these large difficulties were gotten rid of., The territorial Chapter of Rouen finally granted territorial letters to Cauchon--though only after a struggle and under compulsion., Force was also applied to the Inquisitor, and he was obliged to submit., So then, the little English King, by his representative, formally delivered Joan into the hands of the court, but with this reservation: if the court failed to condemn her, he was to have her back again!, Ah, dear, what chance was there for that forsaken and friendless child?, ...]",1
62,"[The Tenth Article was resentful against her for ""pretending"" that St. Catherine and St.  Marguerite spoke French and not English, and were French in their politics., The Twelve were to be submitted first to the learned doctors of theology of the University of Paris for approval., They were copied out and ready by the night of April 4th., Then Manchon did another bold thing: he wrote in the margin that many of the Twelve put statements in Joan's mouth which were the exact opposite of what she had said., That fact would not be considered important by the University of Paris, and would not influence its decision or stir its humanity, in case it had any--which it hadn't when acting in a political capacity, as at present--but it was a brave thing for that good Manchon to do, all the same., The Twelve were sent to Paris next day, April 5th., That afternoon there was a great tumult in Rouen, and excited crowds were flocking through all the chief streets, chattering and seeking for news; for a report had gone abroad that Joan of Arc was sick until death., In truth, these long seances had worn her out, and she was ill indeed., The heads of the English party were in a state of consternation; for if Joan should die uncondemned by the Church and go to the grave unsmirched, the pity and the love of the people would turn her wrongs and sufferings and death into a holy martyrdom, and she would be even a mightier power in France dead than she had been when alive., The Earl of Warwick and the English Cardinal (Winchester) hurried to the castle and sent messengers flying for physicians., Warwick was a hard man, a rude, coarse man, a man without compassion., There lay the sick girl stretched in her chains in her iron cage--not an object to move man to ungentle speech, one would think; yet Warwick spoke right out in her hearing and said to the physicians:  ""Mind you take good care of her., The King of England has no mind to have her die a natural death., She is dear to him, for he bought her dear, and he does not want her to die, save at the stake., Now then, mind you cure her."", The doctors asked Joan what had made her ill. She said the Bishop of Beauvais had sent her a fish and she thought it was that., Then Jean d'Estivet burst out on her, and called her names and abused her., He understood Joan to be charging the Bishop with poisoning her, you see; and that was not pleasing to him, for he was one of Cauchon's most loving and conscienceless slaves, and it outraged him to have Joan injure his master in the eyes of these great English chiefs, these being men who could ruin Cauchon and would promptly do it if they got the conviction that he was capable of saving Joan from the stake by poisoning her and thus cheating the English out of all the real value gainable by her purchase from the Duke of Burgundy., Joan had a high fever, and the doctors proposed to bleed her., Warwick said:  ""Be careful about that; she is smart and is capable of killing herself."", He meant that to escape the stake she might undo the bandage and let herself bleed to death., But the doctors bled her anyway, and then she was better., Not for long, though., Jean d'Estivet could not hold still, he was so worried and angry about the suspicion of poisoning which Joan had hinted at; so he came back in the evening and stormed at her till he brought the fever all back again., When Warwick heard of this he was in a fine temper, you may be sure, for here was his prey threatening to escape again, and all through the over-zeal of this meddling fool., Warwick gave D'Estivet a quite admirable cursing--admirable as to strength, I mean, for it was said by persons of culture that the art of it was not good--and after that the meddler kept still., Joan remained ill more than two weeks; then she grew better., She was still very weak, but she could bear a little persecution now without much danger to her life., It seemed to Cauchon a good time to furnish it., So he called together some of his doctors of theology and went to her dungeon., Manchon and I went along to keep the record--that is, to set down what might be useful to Cauchon, and leave out the rest., The sight of Joan gave me a shock., Why, she was but a shadow!, It was difficult for me to realize that this frail little creature with the sad face and drooping form was the same Joan of Arc that I had so often seen, all fire and enthusiasm, charging through a hail of death and the lightning and thunder of the guns at the head of her battalions., It wrung my heart to see her looking like this., But Cauchon was not touched., He made another of those conscienceless speeches of his, all dripping with hypocrisy and guile., He told Joan that among her answers had been some which had seemed to endanger religion; and as she was ignorant and without knowledge of the Scriptures, he had brought some good and wise men to instruct her, if she desired it., Said he, ""We are churchmen, and disposed by our good will as well as by our vocation to procure for you the salvation of your soul and your body, in every way in our power, just as we would do the like for our nearest kin or for ourselves., In this we but follow the example of Holy Church, who never closes the refuge of her bosom against any that are willing to return."", Joan thanked him for these sayings and said:  ""I seem to be in danger of death from this malady; if it be the pleasure of God that I die here, I beg that I may be heard in confession and also receive my Saviour; and that I may be buried in consecrated ground."", Cauchon thought he saw his opportunity at last; this weakened body had the fear of an unblessed death before it and the pains of hell to follow., This stubborn spirit would surrender now., So he spoke out and said:  ""Then if you want the Sacraments, you must do as all good Catholics do, and submit to the Church."", He was eager for her answer; but when it came there was no surrender in it, she still stood to her guns., She turned her head away and said wearily:  ""I have nothing more to say."", Cauchon's temper was stirred, and he raised his voice threateningly and said that the more she was in danger of death the more she ought to amend her life; and again he refused the things she begged for unless she would submit to the Church., Joan said:  ""If I die in this prison I beg you to have me buried in holy ground; if you will not, I cast myself upon my Saviour."", There was some more conversation of the like sort, then Cauchon demanded again, and imperiously, that she submit herself and all her deeds to the Church., His threatening and storming went for nothing., That body was weak, but the spirit in it was the spirit of Joan of Arc; and out of that came the steadfast answer which these people were already so familiar with and detested so sincerely:  ""Let come what may., I will neither do nor say any otherwise than I have said already in your tribunals."", Then the good theologians took turn about and worried her with reasonings and arguments and Scriptures; and always they held the lure of the Sacraments before her famishing soul, and tried to bribe her with them to surrender her mission to the Church's judgment--that is to their judgment--as if they were the Church!, But it availed nothing., I could have told them that beforehand, if they had asked me., But they never asked me anything; I was too humble a creature for their notice., Then the interview closed with a threat; a threat of fearful import; a threat calculated to make a Catholic Christian feel as if the ground were sinking from under him:  ""The Church calls upon you to submit; disobey, and she will abandon you as if you were a pagan!"", Think of being abandoned by the Church!--that August Power in whose hands is lodged the fate of the human race; whose scepter stretches beyond the furthest constellation that twinkles in the sky; whose authority is over millions that live and over the billions that wait trembling in purgatory for ransom or doom; whose smile opens the gates of heaven to you, whose frown delivers you to the fires of everlasting hell; a Power whose dominion overshadows and belittles the pomps and shows of a village., To be abandoned by one's King--yes, that is death, and death is much; but to be abandoned by Rome, to be abandoned by the Church!, Ah, death is nothing to that, for that is consignment to endless life--and such a life!, I could see the red waves tossing in that shoreless lake of fire, I could see the black myriads of the damned rise out of them and struggle and sink and rise again; and I knew that Joan was seeing what I saw, while she paused musing; and I believed that she must yield now, and in truth I hoped she would, for these men were able to make the threat good and deliver her over to eternal suffering, and I knew that it was in their natures to do it., But I was foolish to think that thought and hope that hope., Joan of Arc was not made as others are made., Fidelity to principle, fidelity to truth, fidelity to her word, all these were in her bone and in her flesh--they were parts of her., She could not change, she could not cast them out., She was the very genius of Fidelity; she was Steadfastness incarnated., Where she had taken her stand and planted her foot, there she would abide; hell itself could not move her from that place., Her Voices had not given her permission to make the sort of submission that was required, therefore she would stand fast., She would wait, in perfect obedience, let come what might., My heart was like lead in my body when I went out from that dungeon; but she--she was serene, she was not troubled., She had done what she believed to be her duty, and that was sufficient; the consequences were not her affair., The last thing she said that time was full of this serenity, full of contented repose:  ""I am a good Christian born and baptized, and a good Christian I will die."", 15 Undaunted by Threat of Burning  TWO WEEKS went by; the second of May was come, the chill was departed out of the air, the wild flowers were springing in the glades and glens, the birds were piping in the woods, all nature was brilliant with sunshine, all spirits were renewed and refreshed, all hearts glad, the world was alive with hope and cheer, the plain beyond the Seine stretched away soft and rich and green, the river was limpid and lovely, the leafy islands were dainty to see, and flung still daintier reflections of themselves upon the shining water; and from the tall bluffs above the bridge Rouen was become again a delight to the eye, the most exquisite and satisfying picture of a town that nestles under the arch of heaven anywhere., When I say that all hearts were glad and hopeful, I mean it in a general sense., There were exceptions--we who were the friends of Joan of Arc, also Joan of Arc herself, that poor girl shut up there in that frowning stretch of mighty walls and towers: brooding in darkness, so close to the flooding downpour of sunshine yet so impossibly far away from it; so longing for any little glimpse of it, yet so implacably denied it by those wolves in the black gowns who were plotting her death and the blackening of her good name., Cauchon was ready to go on with his miserable work., He had a new scheme to try now., He would see what persuasion could do--argument, eloquence, poured out upon the incorrigible captive from the mouth of a trained expert., That was his plan., But the reading of the Twelve Articles to her was not a part of it., No, even Cauchon was ashamed to lay that monstrosity before her; even he had a remnant of shame in him, away down deep, a million fathoms deep, and that remnant asserted itself now and prevailed., On this fair second of May, then, the black company gathered itself together in the spacious chamber at the end of the great hall of the castle--the Bishop of Beauvais on his throne, and sixty-two minor judges massed before him, with the guards and recorders at their stations and the orator at his desk., Then we heard the far clank of chains, and presently Joan entered with her keepers and took her seat upon her isolated bench., She was looking well now, and most fair and beautiful after her fortnight's rest from wordy persecution., She glanced about and noted the orator., Doubtless she divined the situation., The orator had written his speech all out, and had it in his hand, though he held it back of him out of sight., It was so thick that it resembled a book., He began flowing, but in the midst of a flowery period his memory failed him and he had to snatch a furtive glance at his manuscript--which much injured the effect., Again this happened, and then a third time., The poor man's face was red with embarrassment, the whole great house was pitying him, which made the matter worse; then Joan dropped in a remark which completed the trouble., She said:  ""Read your book--and then I will answer you!"", Why, it was almost cruel the way those moldy veterans laughed; and as for the orator, he looked so flustered and helpless that almost anybody would have pitied him, and I had difficulty to keep from doing it myself., Yes, Joan was feeling very well after her rest, and the native mischief that was in her lay near the surface., It did not show when she made the remark, but I knew it was close in there back of the words., When the orator had gotten back his composure he did a wise thing; for he followed Joan's advice: he made no more attempts at sham impromptu oratory, but read his speech straight from his ""book."", In the speech he compressed the Twelve Articles into six, and made these his text., Every now and then he stopped and asked questions, and Joan replied., The nature of the Church Militant was explained, and once more Joan was asked to submit herself to it., She gave her usual answer., ...]",1
63,"[""Why, of course., It wouldn't be you, Tom Sawyer, if you was to let such a chance go by., I reckon it ain't going to suffer none for lack of paint,"" I says, ""when you start in to scollop the facts."", ""Well, now,"" he says, perfectly ca'm, ""what would you say if I was to tell you I ain't going to start in at all?"", I was astonished to hear him talk so., I says:  ""I'd say it's a lie., You ain't in earnest, Tom Sawyer?"", ""You'll soon see., Was the ghost barefooted?"", ""No, it wasn't., What of it?"", ""You wait--I'll show you what., Did it have its boots on?"", ""Yes., I seen them plain."", ""Swear it?"", ""Yes, I swear it."", ""So do I., Now do you know what that means?"", ""No., What does it mean?"", ""Means that them thieves DIDN'T GET THE DI'MONDS."", ""Jimminy!, What makes you think that?"", ""I don't only think it, I know it., Didn't the breeches and goggles and whiskers and hand-bag and every blessed thing turn to ghost-stuff?, Everything it had on turned, didn't it?, It shows that the reason its boots turned too was because it still had them on after it started to go ha'nting around, and if that ain't proof that them blatherskites didn't get the boots, I'd like to know what you'd CALL proof."", Think of that now., I never see such a head as that boy had., Why, I had eyes and I could see things, but they never meant nothing to me., But Tom Sawyer was different., When Tom Sawyer seen a thing it just got up on its hind legs and TALKED to him--told him everything it knowed., I never see such a head., ""Tom Sawyer,"" I says, ""I'll say it again as I've said it a many a time before: I ain't fitten to black your boots., But that's all right--that's neither here nor there., God Almighty made us all, and some He gives eyes that's blind, and some He gives eyes that can see, and I reckon it ain't none of our lookout what He done it for; it's all right, or He'd 'a' fixed it some other way., Go on--I see plenty plain enough, now, that them thieves didn't get way with the di'monds., Why didn't they, do you reckon?"", ""Because they got chased away by them other two men before they could pull the boots off of the corpse."", ""That's so!, I see it now., But looky here, Tom, why ain't we to go and tell about it?"", ""Oh, shucks, Huck Finn, can't you see?, Look at it., What's a-going to happen?, There's going to be an inquest in the morning., Them two men will tell how they heard the yells and rushed there just in time to not save the stranger., Then the jury'll twaddle and twaddle and twaddle, and finally they'll fetch in a verdict that he got shot or stuck or busted over the head with something, and come to his death by the inspiration of God., And after they've buried him they'll auction off his things for to pay the expenses, and then's OUR chance."", ""How, Tom?"", ""Buy the boots for two dollars!"", Well, it 'most took my breath., ""My land!, Why, Tom, WE'LL get the di'monds!"", ""You bet., Some day there'll be a big reward offered for them--a thousand dollars, sure., That's our money!, Now we'll trot in and see the folks., And mind you we don't know anything about any murder, or any di'monds, or any thieves--don't you forget that."", I had to sigh a little over the way he had got it fixed., I'd 'a' SOLD them di'monds--yes, sir--for twelve thousand dollars; but I didn't say anything., It wouldn't done any good., I says:  ""But what are we going to tell your aunt Sally has made us so long getting down here from the village, Tom?"", ""Oh, I'll leave that to you,"" he says., ""I reckon you can explain it somehow."", He was always just that strict and delicate., He never would tell a lie himself., We struck across the big yard, noticing this, that, and t'other thing that was so familiar, and we so glad to see it again, and when we got to the roofed big passageway betwixt the double log house and the kitchen part, there was everything hanging on the wall just as it used to was, even to Uncle Silas's old faded green baize working-gown with the hood to it, and raggedy white patch between the shoulders that always looked like somebody had hit him with a snowball; and then we lifted the latch and walked in., Aunt Sally she was just a-ripping and a-tearing around, and the children was huddled in one corner, and the old man he was huddled in the other and praying for help in time of need., She jumped for us with joy and tears running down her face and give us a whacking box on the ear, and then hugged us and kissed us and boxed us again, and just couldn't seem to get enough of it, she was so glad to see us; and she says:  ""Where HAVE you been a-loafing to, you good-for-nothing trash!, I've been that worried about you I didn't know what to do., Your traps has been here ever so long, and I've had supper cooked fresh about four times so as to have it hot and good when you come, till at last my patience is just plumb wore out, and I declare I--I--why I could skin you alive!, You must be starving, poor things!--set down, set down, everybody; don't lose no more time."", It was good to be there again behind all that noble corn-pone and spareribs, and everything that you could ever want in this world., Old Uncle Silas he peeled off one of his bulliest old-time blessings, with as many layers to it as an onion, and whilst the angels was hauling in the slack of it I was trying to study up what to say about what kept us so long., When our plates was all loadened and we'd got a-going, she asked me, and I says:  ""Well, you see,--er--Mizzes--""  ""Huck Finn!, Since when am I Mizzes to you?, Have I ever been stingy of cuffs or kisses for you since the day you stood in this room and I took you for Tom Sawyer and blessed God for sending you to me, though you told me four thousand lies and I believed every one of them like a simpleton?, Call me Aunt Sally--like you always done."", So I done it., And I says:  ""Well, me and Tom allowed we would come along afoot and take a smell of the woods, and we run across Lem Beebe and Jim Lane, and they asked us to go with them blackberrying to-night, and said they could borrow Jubiter Dunlap's dog, because he had told them just that minute--""  ""Where did they see him?"", says the old man; and when I looked up to see how HE come to take an intrust in a little thing like that, his eyes was just burning into me, he was that eager., It surprised me so it kind of throwed me off, but I pulled myself together again and says:  ""It was when he was spading up some ground along with you, towards sundown or along there."", He only said, ""Um,"" in a kind of a disappointed way, and didn't take no more intrust., So I went on., I says:  ""Well, then, as I was a-saying--""  ""That'll do, you needn't go no furder."", It was Aunt Sally., She was boring right into me with her eyes, and very indignant., ""Huck Finn,"" she says, ""how'd them men come to talk about going a-black-berrying in September--in THIS region?"", I see I had slipped up, and I couldn't say a word., She waited, still a-gazing at me, then she says:  ""And how'd they come to strike that idiot idea of going a-blackberrying in the night?"", ""Well, m'm, they--er--they told us they had a lantern, and--""  ""Oh, SHET up--do!, Looky here; what was they going to do with a dog?--hunt blackberries with it?"", ""I think, m'm, they--""  ""Now, Tom Sawyer, what kind of a lie are you fixing YOUR mouth to contribit to this mess of rubbage?, Speak out--and I warn you before you begin, that I don't believe a word of it., You and Huck's been up to something you no business to--I know it perfectly well; I know you, BOTH of you., Now you explain that dog, and them blackberries, and the lantern, and the rest of that rot--and mind you talk as straight as a string--do you hear?"", Tom he looked considerable hurt, and says, very dignified:  ""It is a pity if Huck is to be talked to that way, just for making a little bit of a mistake that anybody could make."", ""What mistake has he made?"", ...]",1
64,"[Mr. Thomas and I were the contestants., He won the lead and went to the bat--so to speak., And there he stood, with the crotch of his cue resting against his disk while the ship rose slowly up, sank slowly down, rose again, sank again., She never seemed to rise to suit him exactly., She started up once more; and when she was nearly ready for the turn, he let drive and landed his disk just within the left-hand end of the 10., (Applause)., The umpire proclaimed ""a good 10,"" and the game-keeper set it down., I played: my disk grazed the edge of Mr. Thomas's disk, and went out of the diagram., (No applause.), Mr. Thomas played again--and landed his second disk alongside of the first, and almost touching its right-hand side., ""Good 10."", (Great applause.), I played, and missed both of them., (No applause.), Mr. Thomas delivered his third shot and landed his disk just at the right of the other two., ""Good 10."", (Immense applause.), There they lay, side by side, the three in a row., It did not seem possible that anybody could miss them., Still I did it., (Immense silence.), Mr. Thomas played his last disk., It seems incredible, but he actually landed that disk alongside of the others, and just to the right of them-a straight solid row of 4 disks., (Tumultuous and long-continued applause.), Then I played my last disk., Again it did not seem possible that anybody could miss that row--a row which would have been 14 inches long if the disks had been clamped together; whereas, with the spaces separating them they made a longer row than that., But I did it., It may be that I was getting nervous., I think it unlikely that that innings has ever had its parallel in the history of horse-billiards., To place the four disks side by side in the 10 was an extraordinary feat; indeed, it was a kind of miracle., To miss them was another miracle., It will take a century to produce another man who can place the four disks in the 10; and longer than that to find a man who can't knock them out., I was ashamed of my performance at the time, but now that I reflect upon it I see that it was rather fine and difficult., Mr. Thomas kept his luck, and won the game, and later the championship., In a minor tournament I won the prize, which was a Waterbury watch., I put it in my trunk., In Pretoria, South Africa, nine months afterward, my proper watch broke down and I took the Waterbury out, wound it, set it by the great clock on the Parliament House (8.05), then went back to my room and went to bed, tired from a long railway journey., The parliamentary clock had a peculiarity which I was not aware of at the time --a peculiarity which exists in no other clock, and would not exist in that one if it had been made by a sane person; on the half-hour it strikes the succeeding hour, then strikes the hour again, at the proper time., I lay reading and smoking awhile; then, when I could hold my eyes open no longer and was about to put out the light, the great clock began to boom, and I counted ten., I reached for the Waterbury to see how it was getting along., It was marking 9.30., It seemed rather poor speed for a three-dollar watch, but I supposed that the climate was affecting it., I shoved it half an hour ahead; and took to my book and waited to see what would happen., At 10 the great clock struck ten again., I looked--the Waterbury was marking half-past 10., This was too much speed for the money, and it troubled me., I pushed the hands back a half hour, and waited once more; I had to, for I was vexed and restless now, and my sleepiness was gone., By and by the great clock struck 11., The Waterbury was marking 10.30., I pushed it ahead half an hour, with some show of temper., By and by the great clock struck 11 again., The Waterbury showed up 11.30, now, and I beat her brains out against the bedstead., I was sorry next day, when I found out., To return to the ship., The average human being is a perverse creature; and when he isn't that, he is a practical joker., The result to the other person concerned is about the same: that is, he is made to suffer., The washing down of the decks begins at a very early hour in all ships; in but few ships are any measures taken to protect the passengers, either by waking or warning them, or by sending a steward to close their ports., And so the deckwashers have their opportunity, and they use it., They send a bucket of water slashing along the side of the ship and into the ports, drenching the passenger's clothes, and often the passenger himself., This good old custom prevailed in this ship, and under unusually favorable circumstances, for in the blazing tropical regions a removable zinc thing like a sugarshovel projects from the port to catch the wind and bring it in; this thing catches the wash-water and brings it in, too--and in flooding abundance., Mrs. L, an invalid, had to sleep on the locker--sofa under her port, and every time she over-slept and thus failed to take care of herself, the deck-washers drowned her out., And the painters, what a good time they had!, This ship would be going into dock for a month in Sydney for repairs; but no matter, painting was going on all the time somewhere or other., The ladies' dresses were constantly getting ruined, nevertheless protests and supplications went for nothing., Sometimes a lady, taking an afternoon nap on deck near a ventilator or some other thing that didn't need painting, would wake up by and by and find that the humorous painter had been noiselessly daubing that thing and had splattered her white gown all over with little greasy yellow spots., The blame for this untimely painting did not lie with the ship's officers, but with custom., As far back as Noah's time it became law that ships must be constantly painted and fussed at when at sea; custom grew out of the law, and at sea custom knows no death; this custom will continue until the sea goes dry., Sept., 8.--Sunday., We are moving so nearly south that we cross only about two meridians of longitude a day., This morning we were in longitude 178 west from Greenwich, and 57 degrees west from San Francisco., To-morrow we shall be close to the center of the globe--the 180th degree of west longitude and 180th degree of east longitude., And then we must drop out a day-lose a day out of our lives, a day never to be found again., We shall all die one day earlier than from the beginning of time we were foreordained to die., We shall be a day behindhand all through eternity., We shall always be saying to the other angels, ""Fine day today,"" and they will be always retorting, ""But it isn't to-day, it's tomorrow."", We shall be in a state of confusion all the time and shall never know what true happiness is., Next Day., Sure enough, it has happened., Yesterday it was September 8, Sunday; to-day, per the bulletin-board at the head of the companionway, it is September 10, Tuesday., There is something uncanny about it., And uncomfortable., In fact, nearly unthinkable, and wholly unrealizable, when one comes to consider it., While we were crossing the 180th meridian it was Sunday in the stern of the ship where my family were, and Tuesday in the bow where I was., They were there eating the half of a fresh apple on the 8th, and I was at the same time eating the other half of it on the 10th--and I could notice how stale it was, already., The family were the same age that they were when I had left them five minutes before, but I was a day older now than I was then., The day they were living in stretched behind them half way round the globe, across the Pacific Ocean and America and Europe; the day I was living in stretched in front of me around the other half to meet it., They were stupendous days for bulk and stretch; apparently much larger days than we had ever been in before., All previous days had been but shrunk-up little things by comparison., The difference in temperature between the two days was very marked, their day being hotter than mine because it was closer to the equator., Along about the moment that we were crossing the Great Meridian a child was born in the steerage, and now there is no way to tell which day it was born on., The nurse thinks it was Sunday, the surgeon thinks it was Tuesday., The child will never know its own birthday., It will always be choosing first one and then the other, and will never be able to make up its mind permanently., This will breed vacillation and uncertainty in its opinions about religion, and politics, and business, and sweethearts, and everything, and will undermine its principles, and rot them away, and make the poor thing characterless, and its success in life impossible., Every one in the ship says so., And this is not all--in fact, not the worst., For there is an enormously rich brewer in the ship who said as much as ten days ago, that if the child was born on his birthday he would give it ten thousand dollars to start its little life with., His birthday was Monday, the 9th of September., If the ships all moved in the one direction--westward, I mean--the world would suffer a prodigious loss--in the matter of valuable time, through the dumping overboard on the Great Meridian of such multitudes of days by ships crews and passengers., ...]",1
65,"[That is to say, the product of the individual Indian, annually (for export some whither), is worth $1.15; that of the individual Australasian (for export some whither), $75!, Or, to put it in another way, the Indian family of man and wife and three children sends away an annual result worth $8.75, while the Australasian family sends away $375 worth., There are trustworthy statistics furnished by Sir Richard Temple and others, which show that the individual Indian's whole annual product, both for export and home use, is worth in gold only $7.50; or, $37.50 for the family-aggregate., Ciphered out on a like ratio of multiplication, the Australasian family's aggregate production would be nearly $1,600., Truly, nothing is so astonishing as figures, if they once get started., We left Melbourne by rail for Adelaide, the capital of the vast Province of South Australia--a seventeen-hour excursion., On the train we found several Sydney friends; among them a Judge who was going out on circuit, and was going to hold court at Broken Hill, where the celebrated silver mine is., It seemed a curious road to take to get to that region., Broken Hill is close to the western border of New South Wales, and Sydney is on the eastern border., A fairly straight line, 700 miles long, drawn westward from Sydney, would strike Broken Hill, just as a somewhat shorter one drawn west from Boston would strike Buffalo., The way the Judge was traveling would carry him over 2,000 miles by rail, he said; southwest from Sydney down to Melbourne, then northward up to Adelaide, then a cant back northeastward and over the border into New South Wales once more--to Broken Hill., It was like going from Boston southwest to Richmond, Virginia, then northwest up to Erie, Pennsylvania, then a cant back northeast and over the border--to Buffalo, New York., But the explanation was simple., Years ago the fabulously rich silver discovery at Broken Hill burst suddenly upon an unexpectant world., Its stocks started at shillings, and went by leaps and bounds to the most fanciful figures., It was one of those cases where the cook puts a month's wages into shares, and comes next mouth and buys your house at your own price, and moves into it herself; where the coachman takes a few shares, and next month sets up a bank; and where the common sailor invests the price of a spree, and next month buys out the steamship company and goes into business on his own hook., In a word, it was one of those excitements which bring multitudes of people to a common center with a rush, and whose needs must be supplied, and at once., Adelaide was close by, Sydney was far away., Adelaide threw a short railway across the border before Sydney had time to arrange for a long one; it was not worth while for Sydney to arrange at all., The whole vast trade-profit of Broken Hill fell into Adelaide's hands, irrevocably., New South Wales furnishes for Broken Hill and sends her Judges 2,000 miles--mainly through alien countries--to administer it, but Adelaide takes the dividends and makes no moan., We started at 4.20 in the afternoon, and moved across level until night., In the morning we had a stretch of ""scrub"" country--the kind of thing which is so useful to the Australian novelist., In the scrub the hostile aboriginal lurks, and flits mysteriously about, slipping out from time to time to surprise and slaughter the settler; then slipping back again, and leaving no track that the white man can follow., In the scrub the novelist's heroine gets lost, search fails of result; she wanders here and there, and finally sinks down exhausted and unconscious, and the searchers pass within a yard or two of her, not suspecting that she is near, and by and by some rambler finds her bones and the pathetic diary which she had scribbled with her failing hand and left behind., Nobody can find a lost heroine in the scrub but the aboriginal ""tracker,"" and he will not lend himself to the scheme if it will interfere with the novelist's plot., The scrub stretches miles and miles in all directions, and looks like a level roof of bush-tops without a break or a crack in it --as seamless as a blanket, to all appearance., One might as well walk under water and hope to guess out a route and stick to it, I should think., Yet it is claimed that the aboriginal ""tracker"" was able to hunt out people lost in the scrub., Also in the ""bush""; also in the desert; and even follow them over patches of bare rocks and over alluvial ground which had to all appearance been washed clear of footprints., From reading Australian books and talking with the people, I became convinced that the aboriginal tracker's performances evince a craft, a penetration, a luminous sagacity, and a minuteness and accuracy of observation in the matter of detective-work not found in nearly so remarkable a degree in any other people, white or colored., In an official account of the blacks of Australia published by the government of Victoria, one reads that the aboriginal not only notices the faint marks left on the bark of a tree by the claws of a climbing opossum, but knows in some way or other whether the marks were made to-day or yesterday., And there is the case, on records where A., a settler, makes a bet with B., that B. may lose a cow as effectually as he can, and A. will produce an aboriginal who will find her., B. selects a cow and lets the tracker see the cow's footprint, then be put under guard., B. then drives the cow a few miles over a course which drifts in all directions, and frequently doubles back upon itself; and he selects difficult ground all the time, and once or twice even drives the cow through herds of other cows, and mingles her tracks in the wide confusion of theirs., He finally brings his cow home; the aboriginal is set at liberty, and at once moves around in a great circle, examining all cow-tracks until he finds the one he is after; then sets off and follows it throughout its erratic course, and ultimately tracks it to the stable where B. has hidden the cow., Now wherein does one cow-track differ from another?, There must be a difference, or the tracker could not have performed the feat; a difference minute, shadowy, and not detectible by you or me, or by the late Sherlock Holmes, and yet discernible by a member of a race charged by some people with occupying the bottom place in the gradations of human intelligence., It is easier to stay out than get out., The train was now exploring a beautiful hill country, and went twisting in and out through lovely little green valleys., There were several varieties of gum trees; among them many giants., Some of them were bodied and barked like the sycamore; some were of fantastic aspect, and reminded one of the quaint apple trees in Japanese pictures., And there was one peculiarly beautiful tree whose name and breed I did not know., The foliage seemed to consist of big bunches of pine-spines, the lower half of each bunch a rich brown or old-gold color, the upper half a most vivid and strenuous and shouting green., The effect was altogether bewitching., The tree was apparently rare., I should say that the first and last samples of it seen by us were not more than half an hour apart., There was another tree of striking aspect, a kind of pine, we were told., Its foliage was as fine as hair, apparently, and its mass sphered itself above the naked straight stem like an explosion of misty smoke., It was not a sociable sort; it did not gather in groups or couples, but each individual stood far away from its nearest neighbor., It scattered itself in this spacious and exclusive fashion about the slopes of swelling grassy great knolls, and stood in the full flood of the wonderful sunshine; and as far as you could see the tree itself you could also see the ink-black blot of its shadow on the shining green carpet at its feet., On some part of this railway journey we saw gorse and broom--importations from England--and a gentleman who came into our compartment on a visit tried to tell me which--was which; but as he didn't know, he had difficulty., He said he was ashamed of his ignorance, but that he had never been confronted with the question before during the fifty years and more that he had spent in Australia, and so he had never happened to get interested in the matter., But there was no need to be ashamed., The most of us have his defect., We take a natural interest in novelties, but it is against nature to take an interest in familiar things., The gorse and the broom were a fine accent in the landscape., Here and there they burst out in sudden conflagrations of vivid yellow against a background of sober or sombre color, with a so startling effect as to make a body catch his breath with the happy surprise of it., And then there was the wattle, a native bush or tree, an inspiring cloud of sumptuous yellow bloom., It is a favorite with the Australians, and has a fine fragrance, a quality usually wanting in Australian blossoms., The gentleman who enriched me with the poverty of his formation about the gorse and the broom told me that he came out from England a youth of twenty and entered the Province of South Australia with thirty-six shillings in his pocket--an adventurer without trade, profession, or friends, but with a clearly-defined purpose in his head: he would stay until he was worth L200, then go back home., He would allow himself five years for the accumulation of this fortune., ""That was more than fifty years ago,"" said he., ""And here I am, yet."", As he went out at the door he met a friend, and turned and introduced him to me, and the friend and I had a talk and a smoke., I spoke of the previous conversation and said there something very pathetic about this half century of exile, and that I wished the L200 scheme had succeeded., ""With him?, Oh, it did., It's not so sad a case., He is modest, and he left out some of the particulars., The lad reached South Australia just in time to help discover the Burra-Burra copper mines., They turned out L700,000 in the first three years., Up to now they have yielded L120,000,000., He has had his share., Before that boy had been in the country two years he could have gone home and bought a village; he could go now and buy a city, I think., No, there is nothing very pathetic about his case., He and his copper arrived at just a handy time to save South Australia., It had got mashed pretty flat under the collapse of a land boom a while before."", There it is again; picturesque history --Australia's specialty., In 1829 South Australia hadn't a white man in it., In 1836 the British Parliament erected it--still a solitude--into a Province, and gave it a governor and other governmental machinery., Speculators took hold, now, and inaugurated a vast land scheme, and invited immigration, encouraging it with lurid promises of sudden wealth., It was well worked in London; and bishops, statesmen, and all ports of people made a rush for the land company's shares., Immigrants soon began to pour into the region of Adelaide and select town lots and farms in the sand and the mangrove swamps by the sea., The crowds continued to come, prices of land rose high, then higher and still higher, everybody was prosperous and happy, the boom swelled into gigantic proportions., A village of sheet iron huts and clapboard sheds sprang up in the sand, and in these wigwams fashion made display; richly-dressed ladies played on costly pianos, London swells in evening dress and patent-leather boots were abundant, and this fine society drank champagne, and in other ways conducted itself in this capital of humble sheds as it had been accustomed to do in the aristocratic quarters of the metropolis of the world., The provincial government put up expensive buildings for its own use, and a palace with gardens for the use of its governor., The governor had a guard, and maintained a court., Roads, wharves, and hospitals were built., All this on credit, on paper, on wind, on inflated and fictitious values--on the boom's moonshine, in fact., This went on handsomely during four or five years., Then of a sudden came a smash., Bills for a huge amount drawn the governor upon the Treasury were dishonored, the land company's credit went up in smoke, a panic followed, values fell with a rush, the frightened immigrants seized their grips and fled to other lands, leaving behind them a good imitation of a solitude, where lately had been a buzzing and populous hive of men., Adelaide was indeed almost empty; its population had fallen to 3,000., During two years or more the death-trance continued., Prospect of revival there was none; hope of it ceased., Then, as suddenly as the paralysis had come, came the resurrection from it., Those astonishingly rich copper mines were discovered, and the corpse got up and danced., The wool production began to grow; grain-raising followed--followed so vigorously, too, that four or five years after the copper discovery, this little colony, which had had to import its breadstuffs formerly, and pay hard prices for them--once $50 a barrel for flour--had become an exporter of grain., The prosperities continued., ...]",1
66,"[And to Ed's eager inquiry as to what made them act as they had been acting, they answered evasively, and pretended that they had put it up as a joke, to see what he would do., It was the best explanation they could invent at such short notice., And each said to himself, ""He never delivered that letter, and the joke is on us, if he only knew it or we were dull enough to come out and tell."", Then, of course, they wanted to know all about the trip; and he said--  ""Come right up on the boiler deck and order the drinks it's my treat., I'm going to tell you all about it., And to-night it's my treat again --and we'll have oysters and a time!"", When the drinks were brought and cigars lighted, Ed said:  ""Well, when, I delivered the letter to Mr. Vanderbilt----""  ""Great Scott!"", ""Gracious, how you scared me., What's the matter?"", ""Oh--er--nothing., Nothing--it was a tack in the chair-seat,"" said one., ""But you all said it., However, no matter., When I delivered the letter----""  ""Did you deliver it?"", And they looked at each other as people might who thought that maybe they were dreaming., Then they settled to listening; and as the story deepened and its marvels grew, the amazement of it made them dumb, and the interest of it took their breath., They hardly uttered a whisper during two hours, but sat like petrifactions and drank in the immortal romance., At last the tale was ended, and Ed said--  ""And it's all owing to you, boys, and you'll never find me ungrateful --bless your hearts, the best friends a fellow ever had!, You'll all have places; I want every one of you., I know you--I know you 'by the back,' as the gamblers say., You're jokers, and all that, but you're sterling, with the hallmark on., And Charley Fairchild, you shall be my first assistant and right hand, because of your first-class ability, and because you got me the letter, and for your father's sake who wrote it for me, and to please Mr. Vanderbilt, who said it would!, And here's to that great man--drink hearty!"", Yes, when the Moment comes, the Man appears--even if he is a thousand miles away, and has to be discovered by a practical joke., When people do not respect us we are sharply offended; yet deep down in his private heart no man much respects himself., Necessarily, the human interest is the first interest in the log-book of any country., The annals of Tasmania, in whose shadow we were sailing, are lurid with that feature., Tasmania was a convict-dump, in old times; this has been indicated in the account of the Conciliator, where reference is made to vain attempts of desperate convicts to win to permanent freedom, after escaping from Macquarrie Harbor and the ""Gates of Hell."", In the early days Tasmania had a great population of convicts, of both sexes and all ages, and a bitter hard life they had., In one spot there was a settlement of juvenile convicts--children--who had been sent thither from their home and their friends on the other side of the globe to expiate their ""crimes."", In due course our ship entered the estuary called the Derwent, at whose head stands Hobart, the capital of Tasmania., The Derwent's shores furnish scenery of an interesting sort., The historian Laurie, whose book, ""The Story of Australasia,"" is just out, invoices its features with considerable truth and intemperance: ""The marvelous picturesqueness of every point of view, combined with the clear balmy atmosphere and the transparency of the ocean depths, must have delighted and deeply impressed"" the early explorers., ""If the rock-bound coasts, sullen, defiant, and lowering, seemed uninviting, these were occasionally broken into charmingly alluring coves floored with golden sand, clad with evergreen shrubbery, and adorned with every variety of indigenous wattle, she-oak, wild flower, and fern, from the delicately graceful 'maiden-hair' to the palm-like 'old man'; while the majestic gum-tree, clean and smooth as the mast of 'some tall admiral' pierces the clear air to the height of 230 feet or more."", It looked so to me., ""Coasting along Tasman's Peninsula, what a shock of pleasant wonder must have struck the early mariner on suddenly sighting Cape Pillar, with its cluster of black-ribbed basaltic columns rising to a height of 900 feet, the hydra head wreathed in a turban of fleecy cloud, the base lashed by jealous waves spouting angry fountains of foam."", That is well enough, but I did not suppose those snags were 900 feet high., Still they were a very fine show., They stood boldly out by themselves, and made a fascinatingly odd spectacle., But there was nothing about their appearance to suggest the heads of a hydra., They looked like a row of lofty slabs with their upper ends tapered to the shape of a carving-knife point; in fact, the early voyager, ignorant of their great height, might have mistaken them for a rusty old rank of piles that had sagged this way and that out of the perpendicular., The Peninsula is lofty, rocky, and densely clothed with scrub, or brush, or both., It is joined to the main by a low neck., At this junction was formerly a convict station called Port Arthur--a place hard to escape from., Behind it was the wilderness of scrub, in which a fugitive would soon starve; in front was the narrow neck, with a cordon of chained dogs across it, and a line of lanterns, and a fence of living guards, armed., We saw the place as we swept by--that is, we had a glimpse of what we were told was the entrance to Port Arthur., The glimpse was worth something, as a remembrancer, but that was all., The voyage thence up the Derwent Frith displays a grand succession of fairy visions, in its entire length elsewhere unequaled., In gliding over the deep blue sea studded with lovely islets luxuriant to the water's edge, one is at a loss which scene to choose for contemplation and to admire most., When the Huon and Bruni have been passed, there seems no possible chance of a rival; but suddenly Mount Wellington, massive and noble like his brother Etna, literally heaves in sight, sternly guarded on either hand by Mounts Nelson and Rumney; presently we arrive at Sullivan's Cove--Hobart!, It is an attractive town., It sits on low hills that slope to the harbor --a harbor that looks like a river, and is as smooth as one., Its still surface is pictured with dainty reflections of boats and grassy banks and luxuriant foliage., Back of the town rise highlands that are clothed in woodland loveliness, and over the way is that noble mountain, Wellington, a stately bulk, a most majestic pile., How beautiful is the whole region, for form, and grouping, and opulence, and freshness of foliage, and variety of color, and grace and shapeliness of the hills, the capes, the, promontories; and then, the splendor of the sunlight, the dim rich distances, the charm of the water-glimpses!, And it was in this paradise that the yellow-liveried convicts were landed, and the Corps-bandits quartered, and the wanton slaughter of the kangaroo-chasing black innocents consummated on that autumn day in May, in the brutish old time., It was all out of keeping with the place, a sort of bringing of heaven and hell together., The remembrance of this paradise reminds me that it was at Hobart that we struck the head of the procession of Junior Englands., We were to encounter other sections of it in New Zealand, presently, and others later in Natal., Wherever the exiled Englishman can find in his new home resemblances to his old one, he is touched to the marrow of his being; the love that is in his heart inspires his imagination, and these allied forces transfigure those resemblances into authentic duplicates of the revered originals., It is beautiful, the feeling which works this enchantment, and it compels one's homage; compels it, and also compels one's assent--compels it always--even when, as happens sometimes, one does not see the resemblances as clearly as does the exile who is pointing them out., The resemblances do exist, it is quite true; and often they cunningly approximate the originals--but after all, in the matter of certain physical patent rights there is only one England., Now that I have sampled the globe, I am not in doubt., There is a beauty of Switzerland, and it is repeated in the glaciers and snowy ranges of many parts of the earth; there is a beauty of the fiord, and it is repeated in New Zealand and Alaska; there is a beauty of Hawaii, and it is repeated in ten thousand islands of the Southern seas; there is a beauty of the prairie and the plain, and it is repeated here and there in the earth; each of these is worshipful, each is perfect in its way, yet holds no monopoly of its beauty; but that beauty which is England is alone--it has no duplicate., It is made up of very simple details--just grass, and trees, and shrubs, and roads, and hedges, and gardens, and houses, and vines, and churches, and castles, and here and there a ruin--and over it all a mellow dream-haze of history., But its beauty is incomparable, and all its own., Hobart has a peculiarity--it is the neatest town that the sun shines on; and I incline to believe that it is also the cleanest., However that may be, its supremacy in neatness is not to be questioned., There cannot be another town in the world that has no shabby exteriors; no rickety gates and fences, no neglected houses crumbling to ruin, no crazy and unsightly sheds, no weed-grown front-yards of the poor, no back-yards littered with tin cans and old boots and empty bottles, no rubbish in the gutters, no clutter on the sidewalks, no outer-borders fraying out into dirty lanes and tin-patched huts., No, in Hobart all the aspects are tidy, and all a comfort to the eye; the modestest cottage looks combed and brushed, and has its vines, its flowers, its neat fence, its neat gate, its comely cat asleep on the window ledge., We had a glimpse of the museum, by courtesy of the American gentleman who is curator of it., It has samples of half-a-dozen different kinds of marsupials--[A marsupial is a plantigrade vertebrate whose specialty is its pocket., In some countries it is extinct, in the others it is rare., The first American marsupials were Stephen Girard, Mr. Aston and the opossum; the principal marsupials of the Southern Hemisphere are Mr. Rhodes, and the kangaroo., I, myself, am the latest marsupial., Also, I might boast that I have the largest pocket of them all., But there is nothing in that.], --one, the ""Tasmanian devil;"" that is, I think he was one of them., And there was a fish with lungs., When the water dries up it can live in the mud., Most curious of all was a parrot that kills sheep., On one great sheep-run this bird killed a thousand sheep in a whole year., He doesn't want the whole sheep, but only the kidney-fat., This restricted taste makes him an expensive bird to support., To get the fat he drives his beak in and rips it out; the wound is mortal., This parrot furnishes a notable example of evolution brought about by changed conditions., When the sheep culture was introduced, it presently brought famine to the parrot by exterminating a kind of grub which had always thitherto been the parrot's diet., The miseries of hunger made the bird willing to eat raw flesh, since it could get no other food, and it began to pick remnants of meat from sheep skins hung out on the fences to dry., It soon came to prefer sheep meat to any other food, and by and by it came to prefer the kidney-fat to any other detail of the sheep., The parrot's bill was not well shaped for digging out the fat, but Nature fixed that matter; she altered the bill's shape, and now the parrot can dig out kidney-fat better than the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, or anybody else, for that matter--even an Admiral., And there was another curiosity--quite a stunning one, I thought: Arrow-heads and knives just like those which Primeval Man made out of flint, and thought he had done such a wonderful thing--yes, and has been humored and coddled in that superstition by this age of admiring scientists until there is probably no living with him in the other world by now., Yet here is his finest and nicest work exactly duplicated in our day; and by people who have never heard of him or his works: by aborigines who lived in the islands of these seas, within our time., And they not only duplicated those works of art but did it in the brittlest and most treacherous of substances--glass: made them out of old brandy bottles flung out of the British camps; millions of tons of them., It is time for Primeval Man to make a little less noise, now., He has had his day., He is not what he used to be., We had a drive through a bloomy and odorous fairy-land, to the Refuge for the Indigent--a spacious and comfortable home, with hospitals, etc., for both sexes., There was a crowd in there, of the oldest people I have ever seen., It was like being suddenly set down in a new world--a weird world where Youth has never been, a world sacred to Age, and bowed forms, and wrinkles., Out of the 359 persons present, 223, were ex-convicts, and could have told stirring tales, no doubt, if they had been minded to talk; 42 of the 359 were past 80, and several were close upon 90; the average age at death there is 76 years., ...]",1
67,"[Hence corpses must not be burned, neither must they be buried., None may touch the dead or enter the Towers where they repose except certain men who are officially appointed for that purpose., They receive high pay, but theirs is a dismal life, for they must live apart from their species, because their commerce with the dead defiles them, and any who should associate with them would share their defilement., When they come out of the Tower the clothes they are wearing are exchanged for others, in a building within the grounds, and the ones which they have taken off are left behind, for they are contaminated, and must never be used again or suffered to go outside the grounds., These bearers come to every funeral in new garments., So far as is known, no human being, other than an official corpse-bearer--save one--has ever entered a Tower of Silence after its consecration., Just a hundred years ago a European rushed in behind the bearers and fed his brutal curiosity with a glimpse of the forbidden mysteries of the place., This shabby savage's name is not given; his quality is also concealed., These two details, taken in connection with the fact that for his extraordinary offense the only punishment he got from the East India Company's Government was a solemn official ""reprimand""--suggest the suspicion that he was a European of consequence., The same public document which contained the reprimand gave warning that future offenders of his sort, if in the Company's service, would be dismissed; and if merchants, suffer revocation of license and exile to England., The Towers are not tall, but are low in proportion to their circumference, like a gasometer., If you should fill a gasometer half way up with solid granite masonry, then drive a wide and deep well down through the center of this mass of masonry, you would have the idea of a Tower of Silence., On the masonry surrounding the well the bodies lie, in shallow trenches which radiate like wheel-spokes from the well., The trenches slant toward the well and carry into it the rainfall., Underground drains, with charcoal filters in them, carry off this water from the bottom of the well., When a skeleton has lain in the Tower exposed to the rain and the flaming sun a month it is perfectly dry and clean., Then the same bearers that brought it there come gloved and take it up with tongs and throw it into the well., There it turns to dust., It is never seen again, never touched again, in the world., Other peoples separate their dead, and preserve and continue social distinctions in the grave--the skeletons of kings and statesmen and generals in temples and pantheons proper to skeletons of their degree, and the skeletons of the commonplace and the poor in places suited to their meaner estate; but the Parsees hold that all men rank alike in death--all are humble, all poor, all destitute., In sign of their poverty they are sent to their grave naked, in sign of their equality the bones of the rich, the poor, the illustrious and the obscure are flung into the common well together., At a Parsee funeral there are no vehicles; all concerned must walk, both rich and poor, howsoever great the distance to be traversed may be., In the wells of the Five Towers of Silence is mingled the dust of all the Parsee men and women and children who have died in Bombay and its vicinity during the two centuries which have elapsed since the Mohammedan conquerors drove the Parsees out of Persia, and into that region of India., The earliest of the five towers was built by the Modi family something more than 200 years ago, and it is now reserved to the heirs of that house; none but the dead of that blood are carried thither., The origin of at least one of the details of a Parsee funeral is not now known--the presence of the dog., Before a corpse is borne from the house of mourning it must be uncovered and exposed to the gaze of a dog; a dog must also be led in the rear of the funeral., Mr. Nusserwanjee Byranijee, Secretary to the Parsee Punchayet, said that these formalities had once had a meaning and a reason for their institution, but that they were survivals whose origin none could now account for., Custom and tradition continue them in force, antiquity hallows them., It is thought that in ancient times in Persia the dog was a sacred animal and could guide souls to heaven; also that his eye had the power of purifying objects which had been contaminated by the touch of the dead; and that hence his presence with the funeral cortege provides an ever-applicable remedy in case of need., The Parsees claim that their method of disposing of the dead is an effective protection of the living; that it disseminates no corruption, no impurities of any sort, no disease-germs; that no wrap, no garment which has touched the dead is allowed to touch the living afterward; that from the Towers of Silence nothing proceeds which can carry harm to the outside world., These are just claims, I think., As a sanitary measure, their system seems to be about the equivalent of cremation, and as sure., We are drifting slowly--but hopefully--toward cremation in these days., It could not be expected that this progress should be swift, but if it be steady and continuous, even if slow, that will suffice., When cremation becomes the rule we shall cease to shudder at it; we should shudder at burial if we allowed ourselves to think what goes on in the grave., The dog was an impressive figure to me, representing as he did a mystery whose key is lost., He was humble, and apparently depressed; and he let his head droop pensively, and looked as if he might be trying to call back to his mind what it was that he had used to symbolize ages ago when he began his function., There was another impressive thing close at hand, but I was not privileged to see it., That was the sacred fire--a fire which is supposed to have been burning without interruption for more than two centuries; and so, living by the same heat that was imparted to it so long ago., The Parsees are a remarkable community., There are only about 60,000 in Bombay, and only about half as many as that in the rest of India; but they make up in importance what they lack in numbers., They are highly educated, energetic, enterprising, progressive, rich, and the Jew himself is not more lavish or catholic in his charities and benevolences., The Parsees build and endow hospitals, for both men and animals; and they and their womenkind keep an open purse for all great and good objects., They are a political force, and a valued support to the government., They have a pure and lofty religion, and they preserve it in its integrity and order their lives by it., We took a final sweep of the wonderful view of plain and city and ocean, and so ended our visit to the garden and the Towers of Silence; and the last thing I noticed was another symbol--a voluntary symbol this one; it was a vulture standing on the sawed-off top of a tall and slender and branchless palm in an open space in the ground; he was perfectly motionless, and looked like a piece of sculpture on a pillar., And he had a mortuary look, too, which was in keeping with the place., There is an old-time toast which is golden for its beauty., ""When you ascend the hill of prosperity may you not meet a friend."", The next picture that drifts across the field of my memory is one which is connected with religious things., We were taken by friends to see a Jain temple., It was small, and had many flags or streamers flying from poles standing above its roof; and its little battlements supported a great many small idols or images., Upstairs, inside, a solitary Jain was praying or reciting aloud in the middle of the room., Our presence did not interrupt him, nor even incommode him or modify his fervor., Ten or twelve feet in front of him was the idol, a small figure in a sitting posture., It had the pinkish look of a wax doll, but lacked the doll's roundness of limb and approximation to correctness of form and justness of proportion., Mr. Gandhi explained every thing to us., He was delegate to the Chicago Fair Congress of Religions., It was lucidly done, in masterly English, but in time it faded from me, and now I have nothing left of that episode but an impression: a dim idea of a religious belief clothed in subtle intellectual forms, lofty and clean, barren of fleshly grossnesses; and with this another dim impression which connects that intellectual system somehow with that crude image, that inadequate idol --how, I do not know., Properly they do not seem to belong together., Apparently the idol symbolized a person who had become a saint or a god through accessions of steadily augmenting holiness acquired through a series of reincarnations and promotions extending over many ages; and was now at last a saint and qualified to vicariously receive worship and transmit it to heaven's chancellery., Was that it?, And thence we went to Mr. Premchand Roychand's bungalow, in Lovelane, Byculla, where an Indian prince was to receive a deputation of the Jain community who desired to congratulate him upon a high honor lately conferred upon him by his sovereign, Victoria, Empress of India., She had made him a knight of the order of the Star of India., It would seem that even the grandest Indian prince is glad to add the modest title ""Sir"" to his ancient native grandeurs, and is willing to do valuable service to win it., He will remit taxes liberally, and will spend money freely upon the betterment of the condition of his subjects, if there is a knighthood to be gotten by it., And he will also do good work and a deal of it to get a gun added to the salute allowed him by the British Government., Every year the Empress distributes knighthoods and adds guns for public services done by native princes., The salute of a small prince is three or four guns; princes of greater consequence have salutes that run higher and higher, gun by gun,--oh, clear away up to eleven; possibly more, but I did not hear of any above eleven-gun princes., I was told that when a four-gun prince gets a gun added, he is pretty troublesome for a while, till the novelty wears off, for he likes the music, and keeps hunting up pretexts to get himself saluted., It may be that supremely grand folk, like the Nyzam of Hyderabad and the Gaikwar of Baroda, have more than eleven guns, but I don't know., When we arrived at the bungalow, the large hall on the ground floor was already about full, and carriages were still flowing into the grounds., The company present made a fine show, an exhibition of human fireworks, so to speak, in the matters of costume and comminglings of brilliant color., The variety of form noticeable in the display of turbans was remarkable., We were told that the explanation of this was, that this Jain delegation was drawn from many parts of India, and that each man wore the turban that was in vogue in his own region., This diversity of turbans made a beautiful effect., I could have wished to start a rival exhibition there, of Christian hats and clothes., I would have cleared one side of the room of its Indian splendors and repacked the space with Christians drawn from America, England, and the Colonies, dressed in the hats and habits of now, and of twenty and forty and fifty years ago., It would have been a hideous exhibition, a thoroughly devilish spectacle., Then there would have been the added disadvantage of the white complexion., It is not an unbearably unpleasant complexion when it keeps to itself, but when it comes into competition with masses of brown and black the fact is betrayed that it is endurable only because we are used to it., Nearly all black and brown skins are beautiful, but a beautiful white skin is rare., How rare, one may learn by walking down a street in Paris, New York, or London on a week-day particularly an unfashionable street--and keeping count of the satisfactory complexions encountered in the course of a mile., Where dark complexions are massed, they make the whites look bleached-out, unwholesome, and sometimes frankly ghastly., I could notice this as a boy, down South in the slavery days before the war., The splendid black satin skin of the South African Zulus of Durban seemed to me to come very close to perfection., I can see those Zulus yet--'ricksha athletes waiting in front of the hotel for custom; handsome and intensely black creatures, moderately clothed in loose summer stuffs whose snowy whiteness made the black all the blacker by contrast., Keeping that group in my mind, I can compare those complexions with the white ones which are streaming past this London window now:       A lady., Complexion, new parchment., Another lady., Complexion, old      parchment., Another., Pink and white, very fine., Man., Grayish skin, with purple areas., Man., Unwholesome fish-belly skin., Girl., Sallow face, sprinkled with freckles., Old woman., ...]",1
68,"[At first I was strongly interested in the tree, for I was told that it was the renowned peepul--the tree in whose shadow you cannot tell a lie., This one failed to stand the test, and I went away from it disappointed., There was a softly creaking well close by, and a couple of oxen drew water from it by the hour, superintended by two natives dressed in the usual ""turban and pocket-handkerchief."", The tree and the well were the only scenery, and so the compound was a soothing and lonesome and satisfying place; and very restful after so many activities., There was nobody in our bungalow but ourselves; the other guests were in the next one, where the table d'hote was furnished., A body could not be more pleasantly situated., Each room had the customary bath attached--a room ten or twelve feet square, with a roomy stone-paved pit in it and abundance of water., One could not easily improve upon this arrangement, except by furnishing it with cold water and excluding the hot, in deference to the fervency of the climate; but that is forbidden., It would damage the bather's health., The stranger is warned against taking cold baths in India, but even the most intelligent strangers are fools, and they do not obey, and so they presently get laid up., I was the most intelligent fool that passed through, that year., But I am still more intelligent now., Now that it is too late., I wonder if the 'dorian', if that is the name of it, is another superstition, like the peepul tree., There was a great abundance and variety of tropical fruits, but the dorian was never in evidence., It was never the season for the dorian., It was always going to arrive from Burma sometime or other, but it never did., By all accounts it was a most strange fruit, and incomparably delicious to the taste, but not to the smell., Its rind was said to exude a stench of so atrocious a nature that when a dorian was in the room even the presence of a polecat was a refreshment., We found many who had eaten the dorian, and they all spoke of it with a sort of rapture., They said that if you could hold your nose until the fruit was in your mouth a sacred joy would suffuse you from head to foot that would make you oblivious to the smell of the rind, but that if your grip slipped and you caught the smell of the rind before the fruit was in your mouth, you would faint., There is a fortune in that rind., Some day somebody will import it into Europe and sell it for cheese., Benares was not a disappointment., It justified its reputation as a curiosity., It is on high ground, and overhangs a grand curve of the Ganges., It is a vast mass of building, compactly crusting a hill, and is cloven in all directions by an intricate confusion of cracks which stand for streets., Tall, slim minarets and beflagged temple-spires rise out of it and give it picturesqueness, viewed from the river., The city is as busy as an ant-hill, and the hurly-burly of human life swarming along the web of narrow streets reminds one of the ants., The sacred cow swarms along, too, and goes whither she pleases, and takes toll of the grain-shops, and is very much in the way, and is a good deal of a nuisance, since she must not be molested., Benares is older than history, older than tradition, older even than legend, and looks twice as old as all of them put together., From a Hindoo statement quoted in Rev., Mr. Parker's compact and lucid Guide to Benares, I find that the site of the town was the beginning-place of the Creation., It was merely an upright ""lingam,"" at first, no larger than a stove-pipe, and stood in the midst of a shoreless ocean., This was the work of the God Vishnu., Later he spread the lingam out till its surface was ten miles across., Still it was not large enough for the business; therefore he presently built the globe around it., Benares is thus the center of the earth., This is considered an advantage., It has had a tumultuous history, both materially and spiritually., It started Brahminically, many ages ago; then by and by Buddha came in recent times 2,500 years ago, and after that it was Buddhist during many centuries--twelve, perhaps--but the Brahmins got the upper hand again, then, and have held it ever since., It is unspeakably sacred in Hindoo eyes, and is as unsanitary as it is sacred, and smells like the rind of the dorian., It is the headquarters of the Brahmin faith, and one-eighth of the population are priests of that church., But it is not an overstock, for they have all India as a prey., All India flocks thither on pilgrimage, and pours its savings into the pockets of the priests in a generous stream, which never fails., A priest with a good stand on the shore of the Ganges is much better off than the sweeper of the best crossing in London., A good stand is worth a world of money., The holy proprietor of it sits under his grand spectacular umbrella and blesses people all his life, and collects his commission, and grows fat and rich; and the stand passes from father to son, down and down and down through the ages, and remains a permanent and lucrative estate in the family., As Mr. Parker suggests, it can become a subject of dispute, at one time or another, and then the matter will be settled, not by prayer and fasting and consultations with Vishnu, but by the intervention of a much more puissant power--an English court., In Bombay I was told by an American missionary that in India there are 640 Protestant missionaries at work., At first it seemed an immense force, but of course that was a thoughtless idea., One missionary to 500,000 natives--no, that is not a force; it is the reverse of it; 640 marching against an intrenched camp of 300,000,000--the odds are too great., A force of 640 in Benares alone would have its hands over-full with 8,000 Brahmin priests for adversary., Missionaries need to be well equipped with hope and confidence, and this equipment they seem to have always had in all parts of the world., Mr. Parker has it., It enables him to get a favorable outlook out of statistics which might add up differently with other mathematicians., For instance:  ""During the past few years competent observers declare that the number of pilgrims to Benares has increased."", And then he adds up this fact and gets this conclusion:  ""But the revival, if so it may be called, has in it the marks of death., It is a spasmodic struggle before dissolution."", In this world we have seen the Roman Catholic power dying, upon these same terms, for many centuries., Many a time we have gotten all ready for the funeral and found it postponed again, on account of the weather or something., Taught by experience, we ought not to put on our things for this Brahminical one till we see the procession move., Apparently one of the most uncertain things in the world is the funeral of a religion., I should have been glad to acquire some sort of idea of Hindoo theology, but the difficulties were too great, the matter was too intricate., Even the mere A, B, C of it is baffling., There is a trinity--Brahma, Shiva, and Vishnu--independent powers, apparently, though one cannot feel quite sure of that, because in one of the temples there is an image where an attempt has been made to concentrate the three in one person., The three have other names and plenty of them, and this makes confusion in one's mind., The three have wives and the wives have several names, and this increases the confusion., There are children, the children have many names, and thus the confusion goes on and on., It is not worth while to try to get any grip upon the cloud of minor gods, there are too many of them., It is even a justifiable economy to leave Brahma, the chiefest god of all, out of your studies, for he seems to cut no great figure in India., The vast bulk of the national worship is lavished upon Shiva and Vishnu and their families., Shiva's symbol--the ""lingam"" with which Vishnu began the Creation--is worshiped by everybody, apparently., It is the commonest object in Benares., It is on view everywhere, it is garlanded with flowers, offerings are made to it, it suffers no neglect., Commonly it is an upright stone, shaped like a thimble-sometimes like an elongated thimble., This priapus-worship, then, is older than history., Mr. Parker says that the lingams in Benares ""outnumber the inhabitants."", In Benares there are many Mohammedan mosques., There are Hindoo temples without number--these quaintly shaped and elaborately sculptured little stone jugs crowd all the lanes., The Ganges itself and every individual drop of water in it are temples., Religion, then, is the business of Benares, just as gold-production is the business of Johannesburg., Other industries count for nothing as compared with the vast and all-absorbing rush and drive and boom of the town's specialty., Benares is the sacredest of sacred cities., The moment you step across the sharply-defined line which separates it from the rest of the globe, you stand upon ineffably and unspeakably holy ground., Mr. Parker says: ""It is impossible to convey any adequate idea of the intense feelings of veneration and affection with which the pious Hindoo regards 'Holy Kashi' (Benares)."", And then he gives you this vivid and moving picture:       ""Let a Hindoo regiment be marched through the district, and as soon      as they cross the line and enter the limits of the holy place they      rend the air with cries of 'Kashi ji ki jai--jai--jai!, (Holy      Kashi!, Hail to thee!, Hail!, Hail!, Hail)'., The weary pilgrim      scarcely able to stand, with age and weakness, blinded by the dust      and heat, and almost dead with fatigue, crawls out of the oven-like      railway carriage and as soon as his feet touch the ground he lifts      up his withered hands and utters the same pious exclamation., Let a      European in some distant city in casual talk in the bazar mention      the fact that he has lived at Benares, and at once voices will be      raised to call down blessings on his head, for a dweller in Benares      is of all men most blessed."", It makes our own religious enthusiasm seem pale and cold., Inasmuch as the life of religion is in the heart, not the head, Mr. Parker's touching picture seems to promise a sort of indefinite postponement of that funeral., Let me make the superstitions of a nation and I care not who makes its laws or its songs either., Yes, the city of Benares is in effect just a big church, a religious hive, whose every cell is a temple, a shrine or a mosque, and whose every conceivable earthly and heavenly good is procurable under one roof, so to speak--a sort of Army and Navy Stores, theologically stocked., I will make out a little itinerary for the pilgrim; then you will see how handy the system is, how convenient, how comprehensive., If you go to Benares with a serious desire to spiritually benefit yourself, you will find it valuable., ...]",1
69,"[It occurs to me now that I have never seen the ice-storm put upon canvas, and have not heard that any painter has tried to do it., I wonder why that is., Is it that paint cannot counterfeit the intense blaze of a sun-flooded jewel?, There should be, and must be, a reason, and a good one, why the most enchanting sight that Nature has created has been neglected by the brush., Often, the surest way to convey misinformation is to tell the strict truth., The describers of the Taj have used the word gem in its strictest sense--its scientific sense., In that sense it is a mild word, and promises but little to the eye-nothing bright, nothing brilliant, nothing sparkling, nothing splendid in the way of color., It accurately describes the sober and unobtrusive gem-work of the Taj; that is, to the very highly-educated one person in a thousand; but it most falsely describes it to the 999., But the 999 are the people who ought to be especially taken care of, and to them it does not mean quiet-colored designs wrought in carnelians, or agates, or such things; they know the word in its wide and ordinary sense only, and so to them it means diamonds and rubies and opals and their kindred, and the moment their eyes fall upon it in print they see a vision of glorious colors clothed in fire., These describers are writing for the ""general,"" and so, in order to make sure of being understood, they ought to use words in their ordinary sense, or else explain., The word fountain means one thing in Syria, where there is but a handful of people; it means quite another thing in North America, where there are 75,000,000., If I were describing some Syrian scenery, and should exclaim, ""Within the narrow space of a quarter of a mile square I saw, in the glory of the flooding moonlight, two hundred noble fountains--imagine the spectacle!"", the North American would have a vision of clustering columns of water soaring aloft, bending over in graceful arches, bursting in beaded spray and raining white fire in the moonlight-and he would be deceived., But the Syrian would not be deceived; he would merely see two hundred fresh-water springs--two hundred drowsing puddles, as level and unpretentious and unexcited as so many door-mats, and even with the help of the moonlight he would not lose his grip in the presence of the exhibition., My word ""fountain"" would be correct; it would speak the strict truth; and it would convey the strict truth to the handful of Syrians, and the strictest misinformation to the North American millions., With their gems--and gems--and more gems--and gems again--and still other gems--the describers of the Taj are within their legal but not their moral rights; they are dealing in the strictest scientific truth; and in doing it they succeed to admiration in telling ""what ain't so."", SATAN (impatiently) to NEW-COMER., The trouble with you Chicago people is, that you think you are the best people down here; whereas you are merely the most numerous., We wandered contentedly around here and there in India; to Lahore, among other places, where the Lieutenant-Governor lent me an elephant., This hospitality stands out in my experiences in a stately isolation., It was a fine elephant, affable, gentlemanly, educated, and I was not afraid of it., I even rode it with confidence through the crowded lanes of the native city, where it scared all the horses out of their senses, and where children were always just escaping its feet., It took the middle of the road in a fine independent way, and left it to the world to get out of the way or take the consequences., I am used to being afraid of collisions when I ride or drive, but when one is on top of an elephant that feeling is absent., I could have ridden in comfort through a regiment of runaway teams., I could easily learn to prefer an elephant to any other vehicle, partly because of that immunity from collisions, and partly because of the fine view one has from up there, and partly because of the dignity one feels in that high place, and partly because one can look in at the windows and see what is going on privately among the family., The Lahore horses were used to elephants, but they were rapturously afraid of them just the same., It seemed curious., Perhaps the better they know the elephant the more they respect him in that peculiar way., In our own case--we are not afraid of dynamite till we get acquainted with it., We drifted as far as Rawal Pindi, away up on the Afghan frontier--I think it was the Afghan frontier, but it may have been Hertzegovina--it was around there somewhere--and down again to Delhi, to see the ancient architectural wonders there and in Old Delhi and not describe them, and also to see the scene of the illustrious assault, in the Mutiny days, when the British carried Delhi by storm, one of the marvels of history for impudent daring and immortal valor., We had a refreshing rest, there in Delhi, in a great old mansion which possessed historical interest., It was built by a rich Englishman who had become orientalized--so much so that he had a zenana., But he was a broadminded man, and remained so., To please his harem he built a mosque; to please himself he built an English church., That kind of a man will arrive, somewhere., In the Mutiny days the mansion was the British general's headquarters., It stands in a great garden--oriental fashion --and about it are many noble trees., The trees harbor monkeys; and they are monkeys of a watchful and enterprising sort, and not much troubled with fear., They invade the house whenever they get a chance, and carry off everything they don't want., One morning the master of the house was in his bath, and the window was open., Near it stood a pot of yellow paint and a brush., Some monkeys appeared in the window; to scare them away, the gentleman threw his sponge at them., They did not scare at all; they jumped into the room and threw yellow paint all over him from the brush, and drove him out; then they painted the walls and the floor and the tank and the windows and the furniture yellow, and were in the dressing-room painting that when help arrived and routed them., Two of these creatures came into my room in the early morning, through a window whose shutters I had left open, and when I woke one of them was before the glass brushing his hair, and the other one had my note-book, and was reading a page of humorous notes and crying., I did not mind the one with the hair-brush, but the conduct of the other one hurt me; it hurts me yet., I threw something at him, and that was wrong, for my host had told me that the monkeys were best left alone., They threw everything at me that they could lift, and then went into the bathroom to get some more things, and I shut the door on them., At Jeypore, in Rajputana, we made a considerable stay., We were not in the native city, but several miles from it, in the small European official suburb., There were but few Europeans--only fourteen but they were all kind and hospitable, and it amounted to being at home., In Jeypore we found again what we had found all about India--that while the Indian servant is in his way a very real treasure, he will sometimes bear watching, and the Englishman watches him., If he sends him on an errand, he wants more than the man's word for it that he did the errand., When fruit and vegetables were sent to us, a ""chit"" came with them--a receipt for us to sign; otherwise the things might not arrive., If a gentleman sent up his carriage, the chit stated ""from"" such-and-such an hour ""to"" such-and-such an hour--which made it unhandy for the coachman and his two or three subordinates to put us off with a part of the allotted time and devote the rest of it to a lark of their own., We were pleasantly situated in a small two-storied inn, in an empty large compound which was surrounded by a mud wall as high as a man's head., The inn was kept by nine Hindoo brothers, its owners., They lived, with their families, in a one-storied building within the compound, but off to one side, and there was always a long pile of their little comely brown children loosely stacked in its veranda, and a detachment of the parents wedged among them, smoking the hookah or the howdah, or whatever they call it., By the veranda stood a palm, and a monkey lived in it, and led a lonesome life, and always looked sad and weary, and the crows bothered him a good deal., The inn cow poked about the compound and emphasized the secluded and country air of the place, and there was a dog of no particular breed, who was always present in the compound, and always asleep, always stretched out baking in the sun and adding to the deep tranquility and reposefulness of the place, when the crows were away on business., White-draperied servants were coming and going all the time, but they seemed only spirits, for their feet were bare and made no sound., Down the lane a piece lived an elephant in the shade of a noble tree, and rocked and rocked, and reached about with his trunk, begging of his brown mistress or fumbling the children playing at his feet., And there were camels about, but they go on velvet feet, and were proper to the silence and serenity of the surroundings., The Satan mentioned at the head of this chapter was not our Satan, but the other one., Our Satan was lost to us., In these later days he had passed out of our life--lamented by me, and sincerely., I was missing him; I am missing him yet, after all these months., He was an astonishing creature to fly around and do things., He didn't always do them quite right, but he did them, and did them suddenly., There was no time wasted., You would say:  ""Pack the trunks and bags, Satan."", ""Wair good"" (very good)., Then there would be a brief sound of thrashing and slashing and humming and buzzing, and a spectacle as of a whirlwind spinning gowns and jackets and coats and boots and things through the air, and then with bow and touch--  ""Awready, master."", It was wonderful., It made one dizzy., He crumpled dresses a good deal, and he had no particular plan about the work--at first--except to put each article into the trunk it didn't belong in., But he soon reformed, in this matter., Not entirely; for, to the last, he would cram into the satchel sacred to literature any odds and ends of rubbish that he couldn't find a handy place for elsewhere., When threatened with death for this, it did not trouble him; he only looked pleasant, saluted with soldierly grace, said ""Wair good,"" and did it again next day., He was always busy; kept the rooms tidied up, the boots polished, the clothes brushed, the wash-basin full of clean water, my dress clothes laid out and ready for the lecture-hall an hour ahead of time; and he dressed me from head to heel in spite of my determination to do it myself, according to my lifelong custom., He was a born boss, and loved to command, and to jaw and dispute with inferiors and harry them and bullyrag them., He was fine at the railway station--yes, he was at his finest there., He would shoulder and plunge and paw his violent way through the packed multitude of natives with nineteen coolies at his tail, each bearing a trifle of luggage--one a trunk, another a parasol, another a shawl, another a fan, and so on; one article to each, and the longer the procession, the better he was suited --and he was sure to make for some engaged sleeper and begin to hurl the owner's things out of it, swearing that it was ours and that there had been a mistake., Arrived at our own sleeper, he would undo the bedding-bundles and make the beds and put everything to rights and shipshape in two minutes; then put his head out at, a window and have a restful good time abusing his gang of coolies and disputing their bill until we arrived and made him pay them and stop his noise., Speaking of noise, he certainly was the noisiest little devil in India --and that is saying much, very much, indeed., I loved him for his noise, but the family detested him for it., They could not abide it; they could not get reconciled to it., It humiliated them., As a rule, when we got within six hundred yards of one of those big railway stations, a mighty racket of screaming and shrieking and shouting and storming would break upon us, and I would be happy to myself, and the family would say, with shame:  ""There--that's Satan., Why do you keep him?"", And, sure enough, there in the whirling midst of fifteen hundred wondering people we would find that little scrap of a creature gesticulating like a spider with the colic, his black eyes snapping, his fez-tassel dancing, his jaws pouring out floods of billingsgate upon his gang of beseeching and astonished coolies., I loved him; I couldn't help it; but the family--why, they could hardly speak of him with patience., To this day I regret his loss, and wish I had him back; but they--it is different with them., He was a native, and came from Surat., Twenty degrees of latitude lay between his birthplace and Manuel's, and fifteen hundred between their ways and characters and dispositions., I only liked Manuel, but I loved Satan., This latter's real name was intensely Indian., I could not quite get the hang of it, but it sounded like Bunder Rao Ram Chunder Clam Chowder., It was too long for handy use, anyway; so I reduced it., When he had been with us two or three weeks, he began to make mistakes which I had difficulty in patching up for him., ...]",1
70,"[The stranger bought it for a trifle and carried it away; and being without honor, made another stranger believe it was a diamond, and so got $125 out of him for it, and was as pleased with himself as if he had done a righteous thing., In Paris the wronged stranger sold it to a pawnshop for $10,000, who sold it to a countess for $90,000, who sold it to a brewer for $800;000, who traded it to a king for a dukedom and a pedigree, and the king ""put it up the spout."", --[handwritten note: ""From the Greek meaning 'pawned it.'"", M.T.], --I know these particulars to be correct., The news flew around, and the South African diamond-boom began., The original traveler--the dishonest one--now remembered that he had once seen a Boer teamster chocking his wagon-wheel on a steep grade with a diamond as large as a football, and he laid aside his occupations and started out to hunt for it, but not with the intention of cheating anybody out of $125 with it, for he had reformed., We now come to matters more didactic., Diamonds are not imbedded in rock ledges fifty miles long, like the Johannesburg gold, but are distributed through the rubbish of a filled-up well, so to speak., The well is rich, its walls are sharply defined; outside of the walls are no diamonds., The well is a crater, and a large one., Before it had been meddled with, its surface was even with the level plain, and there was no sign to suggest that it was there., The pasturage covering the surface of the Kimberley crater was sufficient for the support of a cow, and the pasturage underneath was sufficient for the support of a kingdom; but the cow did not know it, and lost her chance., The Kimberley crater is roomy enough to admit the Roman Coliseum; the bottom of the crater has not been reached, and no one can tell how far down in the bowels of the earth it goes., Originally, it was a perpendicular hole packed solidly full of blue rock or cement, and scattered through that blue mass, like raisins in a pudding, were the diamonds., As deep down in the earth as the blue stuff extends, so deep will the diamonds be found., There are three or four other celebrated craters near by a circle three miles in diameter would enclose them all., They are owned by the De Beers Company, a consolidation of diamond properties arranged by Mr. Rhodes twelve or fourteen years ago., The De Beers owns other craters; they are under the grass, but the De Beers knows where they are, and will open them some day, if the market should require it., Originally, the diamond deposits were the property of the Orange Free State; but a judicious ""rectification"" of the boundary line shifted them over into the British territory of Cape Colony., A high official of the Free State told me that the sum of $4,00,000 was handed to his commonwealth as a compromise, or indemnity, or something of the sort, and that he thought his commonwealth did wisely to take the money and keep out of a dispute, since the power was all on the one side and the weakness all on the other., The De Beers Company dig out $400,000 worth of diamonds per week, now., The Cape got the territory, but no profit; for Mr. Rhodes and the Rothschilds and the other De Beers people own the mines, and they pay no taxes., In our day the mines are worked upon scientific principles, under the guidance of the ablest mining-engineering talent procurable in America., There are elaborate works for reducing the blue rock and passing it through one process after another until every diamond it contains has been hunted down and secured., I watched the ""concentrators"" at work big tanks containing mud and water and invisible diamonds--and was told that each could stir and churn and properly treat 300 car-loads of mud per day 1,600 pounds to the car-load--and reduce it to 3 car-loads of slush., I saw the 3 carloads of slush taken to the ""pulsators"" and there reduced to quarter of a load of nice clean dark-colored sand., Then I followed it to the sorting tables and saw the men deftly and swiftly spread it out and brush it about and seize the diamonds as they showed up., I assisted, and once I found a diamond half as large as an almond., It is an exciting kind of fishing, and you feel a fine thrill of pleasure every time you detect the glow of one of those limpid pebbles through the veil of dark sand., I would like to spend my Saturday holidays in that charming sport every now and then., Of course there are disappointments., Sometimes you find a diamond which is not a diamond; it is only a quartz crystal or some such worthless thing., The expert can generally distinguish it from the precious stone which it is counterfeiting; but if he is in doubt he lays it on a flatiron and hits it with a sledgehammer., If it is a diamond it holds its own; if it is anything else, it is reduced to powder., I liked that experiment very much, and did not tire of repetitions of it., It was full of enjoyable apprehensions, unmarred by any personal sense of risk., The De Beers concern treats 8;000 carloads --about 6,000 tons--of blue rock per day, and the result is three pounds of diamonds., Value, uncut, $50,000 to $70,000., After cutting, they will weigh considerably less than a pound, but will be worth four or five times as much as they were before., All the plain around that region is spread over, a foot deep, with blue rock, placed there by the Company, and looks like a plowed field., Exposure for a length of time make the rock easier to work than it is when it comes out of the mine., If mining should cease now, the supply of rock spread over those fields would furnish the usual 8,000 car-loads per day to the separating works during three years., The fields are fenced and watched; and at night they are under the constant inspection of lofty electric searchlight., They contain fifty or sixty million dollars' worth' of diamonds, and there is an abundance of enterprising thieves around., In the dirt of the Kimberley streets there is much hidden wealth., Some time ago the people were granted the privilege of a free wash-up., There was a general rush, the work was done with thoroughness, and a good harvest of diamonds was gathered., The deep mining is done by natives., There are many hundreds of them., They live in quarters built around the inside of a great compound., They are a jolly and good-natured lot, and accommodating., They performed a war-dance for us, which was the wildest exhibition I have ever seen., They are not allowed outside of the compound during their term of service three months, I think it, is, as a rule., They go down the shaft, stand their watch, come up again, are searched, and go to bed or to their amusements in the compound; and this routine they repeat, day in and day out., It is thought that they do not now steal many diamonds successfully., They used to swallow them, and find other ways of concealing them, but the white man found ways of beating their various games., One man cut his leg and shoved a diamond into the wound, but even that project did not succeed., When they find a fine large diamond they are more likely to report it than to steal it, for in the former case they get a reward, and in the latter they are quite apt to merely get into trouble., Some years ago, in a mine not owned by the De Beers, a black found what has been claimed to be the largest diamond known to the world's history; and, as a reward he was released from service and given a blanket, a horse, and five hundred dollars., It made him a Vanderbilt., He could buy four wives, and have money left., Four wives are an ample support for a native., With four wives he is wholly independent, and need never do a stroke of work again., That great diamond weighs 97l carats., Some say it is as big as a piece of alum, others say it is as large as a bite of rock candy, but the best authorities agree that it is almost exactly the size of a chunk of ice., But those details are not important; and in my opinion not trustworthy., It has a flaw in it, otherwise it would be of incredible value., As it is, it is held to be worth $2,000,000., After cutting it ought to be worth from $5,000,000 to $8,000,000, therefore persons desiring to save money should buy it now., It is owned by a syndicate, and apparently there is no satisfactory market for it., It is earning nothing; it is eating its head off., Up to this time it has made nobody rich but the native who found it., He found it in a mine which was being worked by contract., That is to say, a company had bought the privilege of taking from the mine 5,000,000 carloads of blue-rock, for a sum down and a royalty., Their speculation had not paid; but on the very day that their privilege ran out that native found the $2,000,000-diamond and handed it over to them., Even the diamond culture is not without its romantic episodes., The Koh-i-Noor is a large diamond, and valuable; but it cannot compete in these matters with three which--according to legend--are among the crown trinkets of Portugal and Russia., One of these is held to be worth $20,000,000; another, $25,000,000, and the third something over $28,000,000., Those are truly wonderful diamonds, whether they exist or not; and yet they are of but little importance by comparison with the one wherewith the Boer wagoner chocked his wheel on that steep grade as heretofore referred to., In Kimberley I had some conversation with the man who saw the Boer do that--an incident which had occurred twenty-seven or twenty-eight years before I had my talk with him., He assured me that that diamond's value could have been over a billion dollars, but not under it., I believed him, because he had devoted twenty-seven years to hunting for it, and was, in a position to know., A fitting and interesting finish to an examination of the tedious and laborious and costly processes whereby the diamonds are gotten out of the deeps of the earth and freed from the base stuffs which imprison them is the visit to the De Beers offices in the town of Kimberley, where the result of each day's mining is brought every day, and, weighed, assorted, valued, and deposited in safes against shipping-day., An unknown and unaccredited person cannot, get into that place; and it seemed apparent from the generous supply of warning and protective and prohibitory signs that were posted all about, that not even the known and accredited can steal diamonds there without inconvenience., We saw the day's output--shining little nests of diamonds, distributed a foot apart, along a counter, each nest reposing upon a sheet of white paper., That day's catch was about $70,000 worth., In the course of a year half a ton of diamonds pass under the scales there and sleep on that counter; the resulting money is $18,000,000 or $20,000,000., Profit, about $12,000,000., Young girls were doing the sorting--a nice, clean, dainty, and probably distressing employment., Every day ducal incomes sift and sparkle through the fingers of those young girls; yet they go to bed at night as poor as they were when they got up in the morning., The same thing next day, and all the days., They are beautiful things, those diamonds, in their native state., They are of various shapes; they have flat surfaces, rounded borders, and never a sharp edge., They are of all colors and shades of color, from dewdrop white to actual black; and their smooth and rounded surfaces and contours, variety of color, and transparent limpidity make them look like piles of assorted candies., A very light straw color is their commonest tint., It seemed to me that these uncut gems must be more beautiful than any cut ones could be; but when a collection of cut ones was brought out, I saw my mistake., Nothing is so beautiful as a rose diamond with the light playing through it, except that uncostly thing which is just like it--wavy sea-water with the sunlight playing through it and striking a white-sand bottom., Before the middle of July we reached Cape Town, and the end of our African journeyings., And well satisfied; for, towering above us was Table Mountain--a reminder that we had now seen each and all of the great features of South Africa except Mr. Cecil Rhodes., ...]",1
71,"[I was clean --artificially--like the rest; and like the rest I fell when temptation came., I signed a lie, and claimed the miserable sack., Mr. Burgess remembered that I had done him a service, and in gratitude (and ignorance) he suppressed my claim and saved me., You know the thing that was charged against Burgess years ago., My testimony, and mine alone, could have cleared him, and I was a coward and left him to suffer disgrace--""  ""No--no--Mr.  Richards, you--""  ""My servant betrayed my secret to him--""  ""No one has betrayed anything to me--""  --""And then he did a natural and justifiable thing; he repented of the saving kindness which he had done me, and he EXPOSED me--as I deserved--""  ""Never!--I make oath--""  ""Out of my heart I forgive him."", Burgess's impassioned protestations fell upon deaf ears; the dying man passed away without knowing that once more he had done poor Burgess a wrong., The old wife died that night., The last of the sacred Nineteen had fallen a prey to the fiendish sack; the town was stripped of the last rag of its ancient glory., Its mourning was not showy, but it was deep., By act of the Legislature--upon prayer and petition--Hadleyburg was allowed to change its name to (never mind what--I will not give it away), and leave one word out of the motto that for many generations had graced the town's official seal., It is an honest town once more, and the man will have to rise early that catches it napping again., MY FIRST LIE, AND HOW I GOT OUT OF IT  As I understand it, what you desire is information about 'my first lie, and how I got out of it.', I was born in 1835; I am well along, and my memory is not as good as it was., If you had asked about my first truth it would have been easier for me and kinder of you, for I remember that fairly well., I remember it as if it were last week., The family think it was week before, but that is flattery and probably has a selfish project back of it., When a person has become seasoned by experience and has reached the age of sixty-four, which is the age of discretion, he likes a family compliment as well as ever, but he does not lose his head over it as in the old innocent days., I do not remember my first lie, it is too far back; but I remember my second one very well., I was nine days old at the time, and had noticed that if a pin was sticking in me and I advertised it in the usual fashion, I was lovingly petted and coddled and pitied in a most agreeable way and got a ration between meals besides., It was human nature to want to get these riches, and I fell., I lied about the pin--advertising one when there wasn't any., You would have done it; George Washington did it, anybody would have done it., During the first half of my life I never knew a child that was able to rise about that temptation and keep from telling that lie., Up to 1867 all the civilised children that were ever born into the world were liars --including George., Then the safety-pin came in and blocked the game., But is that reform worth anything?, No; for it is reform by force and has no virtue in it; it merely stops that form of lying, it doesn't impair the disposition to lie, by a shade., It is the cradle application of conversion by fire and sword, or of the temperance principle through prohibition., To return to that early lie., They found no pin and they realised that another liar had been added to the world's supply., For by grace of a rare inspiration a quite commonplace but seldom noticed fact was borne in upon their understandings--that almost all lies are acts, and speech has no part in them., Then, if they examined a little further they recognised that all people are liars from the cradle onwards, without exception, and that they begin to lie as soon as they wake in the morning, and keep it up without rest or refreshment until they go to sleep at night., If they arrived at that truth it probably grieved them--did, if they had been heedlessly and ignorantly educated by their books and teachers; for why should a person grieve over a thing which by the eternal law of his make he cannot help?, He didn't invent the law; it is merely his business to obey it and keep still; join the universal conspiracy and keep so still that he shall deceive his fellow-conspirators into imagining that he doesn't know that the law exists., It is what we all do--we that know., I am speaking of the lie of silent assertion; we can tell it without saying a word, and we all do it--we that know., In the magnitude of its territorial spread it is one of the most majestic lies that the civilisations make it their sacred and anxious care to guard and watch and propagate., For instance., It would not be possible for a humane and intelligent person to invent a rational excuse for slavery; yet you will remember that in the early days of the emancipation agitation in the North the agitators got but small help or countenance from any one., Argue and plead and pray as they might, they could not break the universal stillness that reigned, from pulpit and press all the way down to the bottom of society--the clammy stillness created and maintained by the lie of silent assertion--the silent assertion that there wasn't anything going on in which humane and intelligent people were interested., From the beginning of the Dreyfus case to the end of it all France, except a couple of dozen moral paladins, lay under the smother of the silent-assertion lie that no wrong was being done to a persecuted and unoffending man., The like smother was over England lately, a good half of the population silently letting on that they were not aware that Mr. Chamberlain was trying to manufacture a war in South Africa and was willing to pay fancy prices for the materials., Now there we have instances of three prominent ostensible civilisations working the silent-assertion lie., Could one find other instances in the three countries?, I think so., Not so very many perhaps, but say a billion--just so as to keep within bounds., Are those countries working that kind of lie, day in and day out, in thousands and thousands of varieties, without ever resting?, Yes, we know that to be true., The universal conspiracy of the silent-assertion lie is hard at work always and everywhere, and always in the interest of a stupidity or a sham, never in the interest of a thing fine or respectable., Is it the most timid and shabby of all lies?, It seems to have the look of it., For ages and ages it has mutely laboured in the interest of despotisms and aristocracies and chattel slaveries, and military slaveries, and religious slaveries, and has kept them alive; keeps them alive yet, here and there and yonder, all about the globe; and will go on keeping them alive until the silent-assertion lie retires from business--the silent assertion that nothing is going on which fair and intelligent men are aware of and are engaged by their duty to try to stop., What I am arriving at is this: When whole races and peoples conspire to propagate gigantic mute lies in the interest of tyrannies and shams, why should we care anything about the trifling lies told by individuals?, Why should we try to make it appear that abstention from lying is a virtue?, Why should we want to beguile ourselves in that way?, Why should we without shame help the nation lie, and then be ashamed to do a little lying on our own account?, Why shouldn't we be honest and honourable, and lie every time we get a chance?, That is to say, why shouldn't we be consistent, and either lie all the time or not at all?, Why should we help the nation lie the whole day long and then object to telling one little individual private lie in our own interest to go to bed on?, Just for the refreshment of it, I mean, and to take the rancid taste out of our mouth., Here in England they have the oddest ways., They won't tell a spoken lie --nothing can persuade them., Except in a large moral interest, like politics or religion, I mean., To tell a spoken lie to get even the poorest little personal advantage out of it is a thing which is impossible to them., They make me ashamed of myself sometimes, they are so bigoted., They will not even tell a lie for the fun of it; they will not tell it when it hasn't even a suggestion of damage or advantage in it for any one., This has a restraining influence upon me in spite of reason, and I am always getting out of practice., Of course, they tell all sorts of little unspoken lies, just like anybody; but they don't notice it until their attention is called to it., They have got me so that sometimes I never tell a verbal lie now except in a modified form; and even in the modified form they don't approve of it., Still, that is as far as I can go in the interest of the growing friendly relations between the two countries; I must keep some of my self-respect--and my health., I can live on a pretty low diet, but I can't get along on no sustenance at all., Of course, there are times when these people have to come out with a spoken lie, for that is a thing which happens to everybody once in a while, and would happen to the angels if they came down here much., Particularly to the angels, in fact, for the lies I speak of are self-sacrificing ones told for a generous object, not a mean one; but even when these people tell a lie of that sort it seems to scare them and unsettle their minds., It is a wonderful thing to see, and shows that they are all insane., In fact, it is a country which is full of the most interesting superstitions., I have an English friend of twenty-five years' standing, and yesterday when we were coming down-town on top of the 'bus I happened to tell him a lie--a modified one, of course; a half-breed, a mulatto; I can't seem to tell any other kind now, the market is so flat., I was explaining to him how I got out of an embarrassment in Austria last year., I do not know what might have become of me if I hadn't happened to remember to tell the police that I belonged to the same family as the Prince of Wales., That made everything pleasant and they let me go; and apologised, too, and were ever so kind and obliging and polite, and couldn't do too much for me, and explained how the mistake came to be made, and promised to hang the officer that did it, and hoped I would let bygones be bygones and not say anything about it; and I said they could depend on me., My friend said, austerely:  'You call it a modified lie?, Where is the modification?', I explained that it lay in the form of my statement to the police., 'I didn't say I belonged to the Royal Family; I only said I belonged to the same family as the Prince--meaning the human family, of course; and if those people had had any penetration they would have known it., I can't go around furnishing brains to the police; it is not to be expected.', 'How did you feel after that performance?', 'Well, of course I was distressed to find that the police had misunderstood me, but as long as I had not told any lie I knew there was no occasion to sit up nights and worry about it.', My friend struggled with the case several minutes, turning it over and examining it in his mind, then he said that so far as he could see the modification was itself a lie, it being a misleading reservation of an explanatory fact, and so I had told two lies instead of only one., 'I wouldn't have done it,' said he; 'I have never told a lie, and I should be very sorry to do such a thing.', Just then he lifted his hat and smiled a basketful of surprised and delighted smiles down at a gentleman who was passing in a hansom., 'Who was that, G---?', 'I don't know.', 'Then why did you do that?', 'Because I saw he thought he knew me and was expecting it of me., If I hadn't done it he would have been hurt., I didn't want to embarrass him before the whole street.', 'Well, your heart was right, G---, and your act was right., What you did was kindly and courteous and beautiful; I would have done it myself; but it was a lie.', 'A lie?, I didn't say a word., How do you make it out?', ...]",1

but he waited patiently for the hilarity to calm down, and then went on again with his project:  '""Yes, one of us must die, to save the others--and himself., We will cast lots., The one chosen shall be illustrious, all of us shall be rich., Hold still, now--hold still; don't interrupt--I tell you I know what I am talking about., Here is the idea., During the next three months the one who is to die shall paint with all his might, enlarge his stock all he can--not pictures, no!, skeleton sketches, studies, parts of studies, fragments of studies, a dozen dabs of the brush on each--meaningless, of course, but his, with his cipher on them; turn out fifty a day, each to contain some peculiarity or mannerism easily detectable as his--they're the things that sell, you know, and are collected at fabulous prices for the world's museums, after the great man is gone; we'll have a ton of them ready--a ton!, And all that time the rest of us will be busy supporting the moribund, and working Paris and the dealers--preparations for the coming event, you know; and when everything is hot and just right, we'll spring the death on them and have the notorious funeral., You get the idea?"", '""N-o; at least, not qu--""  '""Not quite?, Don't you see?, The man doesn't really die; he changes his name and vanishes; we bury a dummy, and cry over it, with all the world to help., And I--""  'But he wasn't allowed to finish., Everybody broke out into a rousing hurrah of applause; and all jumped up and capered about the room and fell on each other's necks in transports of gratitude and joy., For hours we talked over the great plan, without ever feeling hungry; and at last, when all the details had been arranged satisfactorily, we cast lots and Millet was elected--elected to die, as we called it., Then we scraped together those things which one never parts with until he is betting them against future wealth--keepsake trinkets and suchlike--and these we pawned for enough to furnish us a frugal farewell supper and breakfast, and leave us a few francs over for travel, and a stake of turnips and such for Millet to live on for a few days., 'Next morning, early, the three of us cleared out, straightway after breakfast--on foot, of course., Each of us carried a dozen of Millet's small pictures, purposing to market them., Carl struck for Paris, where he would start the work of building up Millet's name against the coming great day., Claude and I were to separate, and scatter abroad over France., 'Now, it will surprise you to know what an easy and comfortable thing we had., I walked two days before I began business., Then I began to sketch a villa in the outskirts of a big town--because I saw the proprietor standing on an upper veranda., He came down to look on--I thought he would., I worked swiftly, intending to keep him interested., Occasionally he fired off a little ejaculation of approbation, and by-and-by he spoke up with enthusiasm, and said I was a master!, 'I put down my brush, reached into my satchel, fetched out a Millet, and pointed to the cipher in the corner., I said, proudly:  '""I suppose you recognise that?, Well, he taught me!, I should think I ought to know my trade!"", 'The man looked guiltily embarrassed, and was silent., I said sorrowfully:  '""You don't mean to intimate that you don't know the cipher of Francois Millet!"", 'Of course he didn't know that cipher; but he was the gratefullest man you ever saw, just the same, for being let out of an uncomfortable place on such easy terms., He said:  '""No!, Why, it is Millet's, sure enough!, I don't know what I could have been thinking of., Of course I recognise it now."", 'Next, he wanted to buy it; but I said that although I wasn't rich I wasn't that poor., However, at last, I let him have it for eight hundred francs.', 'Eight hundred!', 'Yes., Millet would have sold it for a pork chop., Yes, I got eight hundred francs for that little thing., I wish I could get it back for eighty thousand., But that time's gone by., I made a very nice picture of that man's house and I wanted to offer it to him for ten francs, but that wouldn't answer, seeing I was the pupil of such a master, so I sold it to him for a hundred., I sent the eight hundred francs straight to Millet from that town and struck out again next day., 'But I didn't walk--no., I rode., I have ridden ever since., I sold one picture every day, and never tried to sell two., I always said to my customer:  '""I am a fool to sell a picture of Francois Millet's at all, for that man is not going to live three months, and when he dies his pictures can't be had for love or money."", 'I took care to spread that little fact as far as I could, and prepare the world for the event., ...]",1
73,"[His company was not desired, and he was made to feel it., That he nevertheless conquered his wounded pride and sacrificed both that and his blood for his flag raises the average and quality of his patriotism above the Christian's., His record for capacity, for fidelity, and for gallant soldiership in the field is as good as any one's., This is true of the Jewish private soldiers and of the Jewish generals alike., Major-General O. O. Howard speaks of one of his Jewish staff officers as being 'of the bravest and best;' of another--killed at Chancellorsville --as being 'a true friend and a brave officer;' he highly praises two of his Jewish brigadier-generals; finally, he uses these strong words: 'Intrinsically there are no more patriotic men to be found in the country than those who claim to be of Hebrew descent, and who served with me in parallel commands or more directly under my instructions.', Fourteen Jewish Confederate and Union families contributed, between them, fifty-one soldiers to the war., Among these, a father and three sons; and another, a father and four sons., In the above article I was neither able to endorse nor repel the common approach that the Jew is willing to feed upon a country but not to fight for it, because I did not know whether it was true or false., I supposed it to be true, but it is not allowable to endorse wandering maxims upon supposition--except when one is trying to make out a case., That slur upon the Jew cannot hold up its head in presence of the figures of the War Department., It has done its work, and done it long and faithfully, and with high approval: it ought to be pensioned off now, and retired from active service., See 'Stirring Times in Austria,' in this volume., Here is another piece of picturesque history; and it reminds us that shabbiness and dishonesty are not the monopoly of any race or creed, but are merely human:  'Congress has passed a bill to pay $379.56 to Moses Pendergrass, of Libertyville, Missouri., The story of the reason of this liberality is pathetically interesting, and shows the sort of pickle that an honest man may get into who undertakes to do an honest job of work for Uncle Sam., In 1886 Moses Pendergrass put in a bid for the contract to carry the mail on the route from Knob Lick to Libertyville and Coffman, thirty miles a day, from July 1, 1887, for one years., He got the postmaster at Knob Lick to write the letter for him, and while Moses intended that his bid should be $400, his scribe carelessly made it $4., Moses got the contract, and did not find out about the mistake until the end of the first quarter, when he got his first pay., When he found at what rate he was working he was sorely cast down, and opened communication with the Post Office Department., The department informed his that he must either carry out his contract or throw it up, and that if he threw it up his bondsman would have the pay the Government $1,459.85 damages., So Moses carried out his contract, walked thirty miles every week-day for a year, and carried the mail, and received for his labour $4, or, to be accurate, $6.84; for, the route being extended after his bid was accepted, his pay was proportionately increased., Now, after ten years, a bill was finally passed to pay to Moses the difference between what he earned in that unlucky year and what he received.', The 'Sun,' which tells the above story, says that bills were introduced in three or four Congresses for Moses' relief, and that committees repeatedly investigated his claim., It took six Congresses, containing in their persons the compressed virtues of 70,000,000 of people, and cautiously and carefully giving expression to those virtues in the fear of God and the next election, eleven years to find out some way to cheat a fellow Christian out of about $13 on his honestly executed contract, and out of nearly $300 due him on its enlarged terms., And they succeeded., During the same time they paid out $1,000,000,000 in pensions--a third of it unearned and undeserved., This indicates a splendid all-round competency in theft, for it starts with farthings, and works its industries all the way up to ship-loads., It may be possible that the Jews can beat this, but the man that bets on it is taking chances., The article was written in the summer of 1898., In Austria the renaming was merely done because the Jews in some newly-acquired regions had no surnames, but were mostly named Abraham and Moses, and therefore the tax-gatherer could tell t'other from which, and was likely to lose his reason over the matter., The renaming was put into the hands of the War Department, and a charming mess the graceless young lieutenants made of it., To them a Jew was of no sort of consequence, and they labelled the race in a way to make the angels weep., As an example, take these two: Abraham Bellyache and Schmul Godbedamned--Culled from 'Namens Studien,' by Karl Emil Fransos., FROM THE 'LONDON TIMES' OF 1904  Correspondence of the 'London Times' Chicago, April 1, 1904  I resume by cable-telephone where I left off yesterday., For many hours now, this vast city--along with the rest of the globe, of course--has talked of nothing but the extraordinary episode mentioned in my last report., In accordance with your instructions, I will now trace the romance from its beginnings down to the culmination of yesterday--or today; call it which you like., By an odd chance, I was a personal actor in a part of this drama myself., The opening scene plays in Vienna., Date, one o'clock in the morning, March 31, 1898., I had spent the evening at a social entertainment., About midnight I went away, in company with the military attaches of the British, Italian, and American embassies, to finish with a late smoke., This function had been appointed to take place in the house of Lieutenant Hillyer, the third attache mentioned in the above list., When we arrived there we found several visitors in the room; young Szczepanik;[1] Mr. K., his financial backer; Mr. W., the latter's secretary; and Lieutenant Clayton, of the United States Army., War was at that time threatening between Spain and our country, and Lieutenant Clayton had been sent to Europe on military business., I was well acquainted with young Szczepanik and his two friends, and I knew Mr. Clayton slightly., I had met him at West Point years before, when he was a cadet., It was when General Merritt was superintendent., He had the reputation of being an able officer, and also of being quick-tempered and plain-spoken., This smoking-party had been gathered together partly for business., This business was to consider the availability of the telelectroscope for military service., It sounds oddly enough now, but it is nevertheless true that at that time the invention was not taken seriously by any one except its inventor., Even his financial support regarded it merely as a curious and interesting toy., Indeed, he was so convinced of this that he had actually postponed its use by the general world to the end of the dying century by granting a two years' exclusive lease of it to a syndicate, whose intent was to exploit it at the Paris World's Fair., When we entered the smoking-room we found Lieutenant Clayton and Szczepanik engaged in a warm talk over the telelectroscope in the German tongue., Clayton was saying:  'Well, you know my opinion of it, anyway!', and he brought his fist down with emphasis upon the table., 'And I do not value it,' retorted the young inventor, with provoking calmness of tone and manner., Clayton turned to Mr. K., and said:  'I cannot see why you are wasting money on this toy., In my opinion, the day will never come when it will do a farthing's worth of real service for any human being.', 'That may be; yes, that may be; still, I have put the money in it, and am content., I think, myself, that it is only a toy; but Szczepanik claims more for it, and I know him well enough to believe that he can see father than I can--either with his telelectroscope or without it.', The soft answer did not cool Clayton down; it seemed only to irritate him the more; and he repeated and emphasised his conviction that the invention would never do any man a farthing's worth of real service., He even made it a 'brass' farthing, this time., Then he laid an English farthing on the table, and added:  'Take that, Mr. K., and put it away; and if ever the telelectroscope does any man an actual service--mind, a real service--please mail it to me as a reminder, and I will take back what I have been saying., Will you?', 'I will,' and Mr. K. put the coin in his pocket., Mr. Clayton now turned toward Szczepanik, and began with a taunt--a taunt which did not reach a finish; Szczepanik interrupted it with a hardy retort, and followed this with a blow., There was a brisk fight for a moment or two; then the attaches separated the men., The scene now changes to Chicago., Time, the autumn of 1901., As soon as the Paris contract released the telelectroscope, it was delivered to public use, and was soon connected with the telephonic systems of the whole world., The improved 'limitless-distance' telephone was presently introduced, and the daily doings of the globe made visible to everybody, and audibly discussible, too, by witnesses separated by any number of leagues., By-and-by Szczepanik arrived in Chicago., Clayton (now captain) was serving in that military department at the time., The two men resumed the Viennese quarrel of 1898., On three different occasions they quarrelled, and were separated by witnesses., Then came an interval of two months, during which time Szczepanik was not seen by any of his friends, and it was at first supposed that he had gone off on a sight seeing tour and would soon be heard from., But no; no word came from him., Then it was supposed that he had returned to Europe., Still, time drifted on, and he was not heard from., Nobody was troubled, for he was like most inventors and other kinds of poets, and went and came in a capricious way, and often without notice., Now comes the tragedy., On December 29, in a dark and unused compartment of the cellar under Captain Clayton's house, a corpse was discovered by one of Clayton's maid-servants., Friends of deceased identified it as Szczepanik's., The man had died by violence., Clayton was arrested, indicted, and brought to trial, charged with this murder., The evidence against him was perfect in every detail, and absolutely unassailable., Clayton admitted this himself., He said that a reasonable man could not examine this testimony with a dispassionate mind and not be convinced by it; yet the man would be in error, nevertheless., Clayton swore that he did not commit the murder, and that he had had nothing to do with it., As your readers will remember, he was condemned to death., He had numerous and powerful friends, and they worked hard to save him, for none of them doubted the truth of his assertion., I did what little I could to help, for I had long since become a close friend of his, and thought I knew that it was not in his character to inveigle an enemy into a corner and assassinate him., During 1902 and 1903 he was several times reprieved by the governor; he was reprieved once more in the beginning of the present year, and the execution day postponed to March 31., The governor's situation has been embarrassing, from the day of the condemnation, because of the fact that Clayton's wife is the governor's niece., The marriage took place in 1899, when Clayton was thirty-four and the girl twenty-three, and has been a happy one., There is one child, a little girl three years old., Pity for the poor mother and child kept the mouths of grumblers closed at first; but this could not last for ever --for in America politics has a hand in everything--and by-and-by the governor's political opponents began to call attention to his delay in allowing the law to take its course., These hints have grown more and more frequent of late, and more and more pronounced., As a natural result, his own part grew nervous., Its leaders began to visit Springfield and hold long private conferences with him., ...]",1

'Once more I call Representative Wolf to order!, Do not forget that you are a Representative, sir!', Wolf (slam-banging with his desk-board)., 'I will force this matter!, Are you going to grant me the floor, or not?', And still the sergeant-at-arms did not appear., It was because there wasn't any., It is a curious thing, but the Chair has no effectual means of compelling order., After some more interruptions:  Wolf (banging with his board)., 'I demand the floor., I will not yield!', P.  'I have no recourse against Representative Wolf., In the presence of behaviour like this it is to be regretted that such is the case.', [A shout from the Right, 'Throw him out!'], It is true he had no effective recourse., He had an official called an 'Ordner,' whose help he could invoke in desperate cases, but apparently the Ordner is only a persuader, not a compeller., Apparently he is a sergeant-at-arms who is not loaded; a good enough gun to look at, but not valuable for business., For another twenty or thirty minutes Wolf went on banging with his board and demanding his rights; then at last the weary President threatened to summon the dread order-maker., But both his manner and his words were reluctant., Evidently it grieved him to have to resort to this dire extremity., He said to Wolf, 'If this goes on, I shall feel obliged to summon the Ordner, and beg him to restore order in the House.', Wolf., 'I'd like to see you do it!, Suppose you fetch in a few policemen too!, [Great tumult.], Are you going to put my motion to adjourn, or not?', Dr. Lecher continues his speech., Wolf accompanies him with his board-clatter., The President despatches the Ordner, Dr. Lang (himself a deputy), on his order-restoring mission., Wolf, with his board uplifted for defence, confronts the Ordner with a remark which Boss Tweed might have translated into 'Now let's see what you are going to do about it!', [Noise and tumult all over the House.], Wolf stands upon his rights, and says he will maintain them until he is killed in his tracks., Then he resumes his banging, the President jangles his bell and begs for order, and the rest of the House augments the racket the best it can., Wolf., 'I require an adjournment, because I find myself personally threatened., [Laughter from the Right.], Not that I fear for myself; I am only anxious about what will happen to the man who touches me.', The Ordner., 'I am not going to fight with you.', Nothing came of the efforts of the angel of peace, and he presently melted out of the scene and disappeared., Wolf went on with his noise and with his demands that he be granted the floor, resting his board at intervals to discharge criticisms and epithets at the Chair., Once he reminded the Chairman of his violated promise to grant him (Wolf) the floor, and said, 'Whence I came, we call promise-breakers rascals!', And he advised the Chairman to take his conscience to bed with him and use it as a pillow., Another time he said that the Chair was making itself ridiculous before all Europe., In fact, some of Wolf's language was almost unparliamentary., By-and-by he struck the idea of beating out a tune with his board., Later he decided to stop asking for the floor, and to confer it upon himself., And so he and Dr. Lecher now spoke at the same time, and mingled their speeches with the other noises, and nobody heard either of them., Wolf rested himself now and then from speech-making by reading, in his clarion voice, from a pamphlet., I will explain that Dr. Lecher was not making a twelve-hour speech for pastime, but for an important purpose., It was the Government's intention to push the Ausgleich through its preliminary stages in this one sitting (for which it was the Order of the Day), and then by vote refer it to a select committee., It was the Majority's scheme--as charged by the Opposition--to drown debate upon the bill by pure noise--drown it out and stop it., The debate being thus ended, the vote upon the reference would follow--with victory for the Government., But into the Government's calculations had not entered the possibility of a single-barrelled speech which should occupy the entire time-limit of the setting, and also get itself delivered in spite of all the noise., Goliath was not expecting David., But David was there; and during twelve hours he tranquilly pulled statistical, historical, and argumentative pebbles out of his scrip and slung them at the giant; and when he was done he was victor, and the day was saved., In the English House an obstructionist has held the floor with Bible-readings and other outside matters; but Dr. Lecher could not have that restful and recuperative privilege--he must confine himself strictly to the subject before the House., More than once, when the President could not hear him because of the general tumult, he sent persons to listen and report as to whether the orator was speaking to the subject or not., ...]",1

YOU HAVE TAKEN MY BELIEF AWAY, AND MY COMFORT., NOW I HAVE NOTHING LEFT, AND I DIE MISERABLE; FOR THE THINGS WHICH YOU HAVE TOLD ME DO NOT TAKE THE PLACE OF THAT WHICH I HAVE LOST."", And the mother, also, reproached the Infidel, and said:  ""MY CHILD IS FOREVER LOST, AND MY HEART IS BROKEN., HOW COULD YOU DO THIS CRUEL THING?, WE HAVE DONE YOU NO HARM, BUT ONLY KINDNESS; WE MADE OUR HOUSE YOUR HOME, YOU WERE WELCOME TO ALL WE HAD, AND THIS IS OUR REWARD."", The heart of the Infidel was filled with remorse for what he had done, and he said:  ""IT WAS WRONG--I SEE IT NOW; BUT I WAS ONLY TRYING TO DO HIM GOOD., IN MY VIEW HE WAS IN ERROR; IT SEEMED MY DUTY TO TEACH HIM THE TRUTH."", Then the mother said:  ""I HAD TAUGHT HIM, ALL HIS LITTLE LIFE, WHAT I BELIEVED TO BE THE TRUTH, AND IN HIS BELIEVING FAITH BOTH OF US WERE HAPPY., NOW HE IS DEAD,--AND LOST;

he infers that that is the new home, and follows to inquire., Here, now, is the experience of a gull, as related by a naturalist., The scene is a Scotch fishing village where the gulls were kindly treated., This particular gull visited a cottage; was fed; came next day and was fed again; came into the house, next time, and ate with the family; kept on doing this almost daily, thereafter., But, once the gull was away on a journey for a few days, and when it returned the house was vacant., Its friends had removed to a village three miles distant., Several months later it saw the head of the family on the street there, followed him home, entered the house without excuse or apology, and became a daily guest again., Gulls do not rank high mentally, but this one had memory and the reasoning faculty, you see, and applied them Edisonially., Y.M., Yet it was not an Edison and couldn't be developed into one., O.M., Perhaps not., Could you?, Y.M., That is neither here nor there., Go on., O.M., If Edison were in trouble and a stranger helped him out of it and next day he got into the same difficulty again, he would infer the wise thing to do in case he knew the stranger's address., Here is a case of a bird and a stranger as related by a naturalist., An Englishman saw a bird flying around about his dog's head, down in the grounds, and uttering cries of distress., He went there to see about it., The dog had a young bird in his mouth--unhurt., The gentleman rescued it and put it on a bush and brought the dog away., Early the next morning the mother bird came for the gentleman, who was sitting on his veranda, and by its maneuvers persuaded him to follow it to a distant part of the grounds--flying a little way in front of him and waiting for him to catch up, and so on; and keeping to the winding path, too, instead of flying the near way across lots., The distance covered was four hundred yards., The same dog was the culprit; he had the young bird again, and once more he had to give it up., Now the mother bird had reasoned it all out: since the stranger had helped her once, she inferred that he would do it again; she knew where to find him, and she went upon her errand with confidence., Her mental processes were what Edison's would have been., She put this and that together--and that is all that thought IS--and out of them built her logical arrangement of inferences., Edison couldn't have done it any better himself., Y.M., Do you believe that many of the dumb animals can think?, O.M., Yes--the elephant, the monkey, the horse, the dog, the parrot, the macaw, the mocking-bird, and many others., The elephant whose mate fell into a pit, and who dumped dirt and rubbish into the pit till bottom was raised high enough to enable the captive to step out, was equipped with the reasoning quality., I conceive that all animals that can learn things through teaching and drilling have to know how to observe, and put this and that together and draw an inference--the process of thinking., Could you teach an idiot of manuals of arms, and to advance, retreat, and go through complex field maneuvers at the word of command?, Y.M., Not if he were a thorough idiot., O.M., Well, canary-birds can learn all that;

we know when she is saying to the chicks, ""Run here, dears, I've found a worm""; we know what she is saying when she voices a warning: ""Quick!, hurry!, gather yourselves under mamma, there's a hawk coming!"", We understand the cat when she stretches herself out, purring with affection and contentment and lifts up a soft voice and says, ""Come, kitties, supper's ready""; we understand her when she goes mourning about and says, ""Where can they be?, They are lost., Won't you help me hunt for them?"", and we understand the disreputable Tom when he challenges at midnight from his shed, ""You come over here, you product of immoral commerce, and I'll make your fur fly!"", We understand a few of a dog's phrases and we learn to understand a few of the remarks and gestures of any bird or other animal that we domesticate and observe., The clearness and exactness of the few of the hen's speeches which we understand is argument that she can communicate to her kind a hundred things which we cannot comprehend--in a word, that she can converse., And this argument is also applicable in the case of others of the great army of the Unrevealed., It is just like man's vanity and impertinence to call an animal dumb because it is dumb to his dull perceptions., Now as to the ant--  Y.M., Yes, go back to the ant, the creature that--as you seem to think--sweeps away the last vestige of an intellectual frontier between man and the Unrevealed., O.M., That is what she surely does., In all his history the aboriginal Australian never thought out a house for himself and built it., The ant is an amazing architect., She is a wee little creature, but she builds a strong and enduring house eight feet high--a house which is as large in proportion to her size as is the largest capitol or cathedral in the world compared to man's size., ...]",1

his ears are not alike; still, editor suggests the sound of Edward, and he will do., I could make him better if I had a model, but I made this one from memory., But is no particular matter; they all look alike, anyway., They are conceited and troublesome, and don't pay enough., Edward was the first really English king that had yet occupied the throne., The editor in the picture probably looks just as Edward looked when it was first borne in upon him that this was so., His whole attitude expressed gratification and pride mixed with stupefaction and astonishment., Edward II., now; twenty BLUE squares., Another editor., That thing behind his ear is his pencil., Whenever he finds a bright thing in your manuscript he strikes it out with that., That does him good, and makes him smile and show his teeth, the way he is doing in the picture., This one has just been striking out a smart thing, and now he is sitting there with his thumbs in his vest-holes, gloating., They are full of envy and malice, editors are., This picture will serve to remind you that Edward II., was the first English king who was DEPOSED., Upon demand, he signed his deposition himself., He had found kingship a most aggravating and disagreeable occupation, and you can see by the look of him that he is glad he resigned., He has put his blue pencil up for good now., He had struck out many a good thing with it in his time., Edward III., next; fifty RED squares., This editor is a critic., He has pulled out his carving-knife and his tomahawk and is starting after a book which he is going to have for breakfast., This one's arms are put on wrong., I did not notice it at first, but I see it now., Somehow he has got his right arm on his left shoulder, and his left arm on his right shoulder, and this shows us the back of his hands in both instances., It makes him left-handed all around, which is a thing which has never happened before, except perhaps in a museum., That is the way with art, when it is not acquired but born to you: you start in to make some simple little thing, not suspecting that your genius is beginning to work and swell and strain in secret, and all of a sudden there is a convulsion and you fetch out something astonishing., This is called inspiration., It is an accident; you never know when it is coming., I might have tried as much as a year to think of such a strange thing as an all-around left-handed man and I could not have done it, for the more you try to think of an unthinkable thing the more it eludes you; but it can't elude inspiration; you have only to bait with inspiration and you will get it every time., Look at Botticelli's ""Spring."", Those snaky women were unthinkable, but inspiration secured them for us, thanks to goodness., It is too late to reorganize this editor-critic now; we will leave him as he is., He will serve to remind us., Richard II., next; twenty-two WHITE squares., We use the lion again because this is another Richard., Like Edward II., he was DEPOSED., He is taking a last sad look at his crown before they take it away., There was not room enough and I have made it too small; but it never fitted him, anyway., Now we turn the corner of the century with a new line of monarchs--the Lancastrian kings., Henry IV., ; fourteen squares of YELLOW paper., This hen has laid the egg of a new dynasty and realizes the magnitude of the event., She is giving notice in the usual way., You notice I am improving in the construction of hens., At first I made them too much like other animals, but this one is orthodox., I mention this to encourage you., You will find that the more you practice the more accurate you will become., I could always draw animals, but before I was educated I could not tell what kind they were when I got them done, but now I can., Keep up your courage; it will be the same with you, although you may not think it., This Henry died the year after Joan of Arc was born., Henry V.; nine BLUE squares., There you see him lost in meditation over the monument which records the amazing figures of the battle of Agincourt., French history says 20,000 Englishmen routed 80,000 Frenchmen there; and English historians say that the French loss, in killed and wounded, was 60,000., Henry VI., ; thirty-nine RED squares., This is poor Henry VI., who reigned long and scored many misfortunes and humiliations., Also two great disasters: he lost France to Joan of Arc and he lost the throne and ended the dynasty which Henry IV., ...]",1
79,"[[Figure 1]  It is arranged on the basis of Isaac Pitman's PHONOGRAPHY., Isaac Pitman was the originator and father of scientific phonography., It is used throughout the globe., It was a memorable invention., He made it public seventy-three years ago., The firm of Isaac Pitman & Sons, New York, still exists, and they continue the master's work., What should we gain?, First of all, we could spell DEFINITELY--and correctly--any word you please, just by the SOUND of it., We can't do that with our present alphabet., For instance, take a simple, every-day word PHTHISIS., If we tried to spell it by the sound of it, we should make it TYSIS, and be laughed at by every educated person., Secondly, we should gain in REDUCTION OF LABOR in writing., Simplified Spelling makes valuable reductions in the case of several hundred words, but the new spelling must be LEARNED., You can't spell them by the sound; you must get them out of the book., But even if we knew the simplified form for every word in the language, the phonographic alphabet would still beat the Simplified Speller ""hands down"" in the important matter of economy of labor., I will illustrate:  PRESENT FORM: through, laugh, highland., SIMPLIFIED FORM: thru, laff, hyland., PHONOGRAPHIC FORM:   To write the word ""through,"" the pen has to make twenty-one strokes., To write the word ""thru,"" then pen has to make twelve strokes--a good saving., To write that same word with the phonographic alphabet, the pen has to make only THREE strokes., To write the word ""laugh,"" the pen has to make FOURTEEN strokes., To write ""laff,"" the pen has to make the SAME NUMBER of strokes--no labor is saved to the penman., To write the same word with the phonographic alphabet, the pen has to make only THREE strokes., To write the word ""highland,"" the pen has to make twenty-two strokes., To write ""hyland,"" the pen has to make eighteen strokes., To write that word with the phonographic alphabet, the pen has to make only FIVE strokes., To write the words ""phonographic alphabet,"" the pen has to make fifty-three strokes., To write ""fonografic alfabet,"" the pen has to make fifty strokes., To the penman, the saving in labor is insignificant., To write that word (with vowels) with the phonographic alphabet, the pen has to make only SEVENTEEN strokes., Without the vowels, only THIRTEEN strokes., The vowels are hardly necessary, this time., We make five pen-strokes in writing an m.  Thus: a stroke down; a stroke up; a second stroke down; a second stroke up; a final stroke down., Total, five., The phonographic alphabet accomplishes the m with a single stroke--a curve, like a parenthesis that has come home drunk and has fallen face down right at the front door where everybody that goes along will see him and say, Alas!, When our written m is not the end of a word, but is otherwise located, it has to be connected with the next letter, and that requires another pen-stroke, making six in all, before you get rid of that m.  But never mind about the connecting strokes--let them go., Without counting them, the twenty-six letters of our alphabet consumed about eighty pen-strokes for their construction--about three pen-strokes per letter., It is THREE TIMES THE NUMBER required by the phonographic alphabet., It requires but ONE stroke for each letter., My writing-gait is--well, I don't know what it is, but I will time myself and see., Result: it is twenty-four words per minute., I don't mean composing; I mean COPYING., There isn't any definite composing-gait., Very well, my copying-gait is 1,440 words per hour--say 1,500., If I could use the phonographic character with facility I could do the 1,500 in twenty minutes., I could do nine hours' copying in three hours; I could do three years' copying in one year., Also, if I had a typewriting machine with the phonographic alphabet on it--oh, the miracles I could do!, I am not pretending to write that character well., I have never had a lesson, and I am copying the letters from the book., But I can accomplish my desire, at any rate, which is, to make the reader get a good and clear idea of the advantage it would be to us if we could discard our present alphabet and put this better one in its place--using it in books, newspapers, with the typewriter, and with the pen., --MAN DOG HORSE., I think it is graceful and would look comely in print., And consider--once more, I beg--what a labor-saver it is!, Ten pen-strokes with the one system to convey those three words above, and thirty-three by the other!, [Figure 6]  I mean, in SOME ways, not in all., I suppose I might go so far as to say in most ways, and be within the facts, but never mind; let it go at SOME., One of the ways in which it exercises this birthright is--as I think--continuing to use our laughable alphabet these seventy-three years while there was a rational one at hand, to be had for the taking., It has taken five hundred years to simplify some of Chaucer's rotten spelling--if I may be allowed to use to frank a term as that--and it will take five hundred years more to get our exasperating new Simplified Corruptions accepted and running smoothly., And we sha'n't be any better off then than we are now; for in that day we shall still have the privilege the Simplifiers are exercising now: ANYBODY can change the spelling that wants to., BUT YOU CAN'T CHANGE THE PHONOGRAPHIC SPELLING; THERE ISN'T ANY WAY., It will always follow the SOUND., If you want to change the spelling, you have to change the sound first., Mind, I myself am a Simplified Speller; I belong to that unhappy guild that is patiently and hopefully trying to reform our drunken old alphabet by reducing his whiskey., Well, it will improve him., When they get through and have reformed him all they can by their system he will be only HALF drunk., Above that condition their system can never lift him., There is no competent, and lasting, and real reform for him but to take away his whiskey entirely, and fill up his jug with Pitman's wholesome and undiseased alphabet., One great drawback to Simplified Spelling is, that in print a simplified word looks so like the very nation!, and when you bunch a whole squadron of the Simplified together the spectacle is very nearly unendurable., The da ma ov koars kum when the publik ma be expektd to get rekonsyled to the bezair asspekt of the Simplified Kombynashuns, but--if I may be allowed the expression--is it worth the wasted time?, [Figure 7]  To see our letters put together in ways to which we are not accustomed offends the eye, and also takes the EXPRESSION out of the words., La on, Makduf, and damd be he hoo furst krys hold, enuf!, It doesn't thrill you as it used to do., The simplifications have sucked the thrill all out of it., But a written character with which we are NOT ACQUAINTED does not offend us--Greek, Hebrew, Russian, Arabic, and the others--they have an interesting look, and we see beauty in them, too., And this is true of hieroglyphics, as well., There is something pleasant and engaging about the mathematical signs when we do not understand them., The mystery hidden in these things has a fascination for us: we can't come across a printed page of shorthand without being impressed by it and wishing we could read it., Very well, what I am offering for acceptance and adopting is not shorthand, but longhand, written with the SHORTHAND ALPHABET UNREACHED., You can write three times as many words in a minute with it as you can write with our alphabet., And so, in a way, it IS properly a shorthand., It has a pleasant look, too; a beguiling look, an inviting look., I will write something in it, in my rude and untaught way: [Figure 8]  Even when _I_ do it it comes out prettier than it does in Simplified Spelling., Yes, and in the Simplified it costs one hundred and twenty-three pen-strokes to write it, whereas in the phonographic it costs only twenty-nine., Let us hope so, anyway., AS CONCERNS INTERPRETING THE DEITY  This line of hieroglyphics was for fourteen years the despair of all the scholars who labored over the mysteries of the Rosetta stone: [Figure 1]  After five years of study Champollion translated it thus:  Therefore let the worship of Epiphanes be maintained in all the temples, this upon pain of death., That was the twenty-forth translation that had been furnished by scholars., For a time it stood., But only for a time., Then doubts began to assail it and undermine it, and the scholars resumed their labors., Three years of patient work produced eleven new translations; among them, this, by Gr:unfeldt, was received with considerable favor:  The horse of Epiphanes shall be maintained at the public expense; this upon pain of death., But the following rendering, by Gospodin, was received by the learned world with yet greater favor:  The priest shall explain the wisdom of Epiphanes to all these people, and these shall listen with reverence, upon pain of death., Seven years followed, in which twenty-one fresh and widely varying renderings were scored--none of them quite convincing., But now, at last, came Rawlinson, the youngest of all the scholars, with a translation which was immediately and universally recognized as being the correct version, and his name became famous in a day., So famous, indeed, that even the children were familiar with it; and such a noise did the achievement itself make that not even the noise of the monumental political event of that same year--the flight from Elba--was able to smother it to silence., Rawlinson's version reads as follows:  Therefore, walk not away from the wisdom of Epiphanes, but turn and follow it; so shall it conduct thee to the temple's peace, and soften for thee the sorrows of life and the pains of death., Here is another difficult text:   It is demotic--a style of Egyptian writing and a phase of the language which has perished from the knowledge of all men twenty-five hundred years before the Christian era., Our red Indians have left many records, in the form of pictures, upon our crags and boulders., It has taken our most gifted and painstaking students two centuries to get at the meanings hidden in these pictures; yet there are still two little lines of hieroglyphics among the figures grouped upon the Dighton Rocks which they have not succeeds in interpreting to their satisfaction., These:   The suggested solutions are practically innumerable; they would fill a book., ...]",1
80,"[Save one--far and away the most colossal prodigy of the entire accumulation--Shakespeare!, About him you can find out NOTHING., Nothing of even the slightest importance., Nothing worth the trouble of stowing away in your memory., Nothing that even remotely indicates that he was ever anything more than a distinctly commonplace person--a manager, an actor of inferior grade, a small trader in a small village that did not regard him as a person of any consequence, and had forgotten all about him before he was fairly cold in his grave., We can go to the records and find out the life-history of every renowned RACE-HORSE of modern times--but not Shakespeare's!, There are many reasons why, and they have been furnished in cart-loads (of guess and conjecture) by those troglodytes; but there is one that is worth all the rest of the reasons put together, and is abundantly sufficient all by itself--HE HADN'T ANY HISTORY TO RECORD., There is no way of getting around that deadly fact., And no sane way has yet been discovered of getting around its formidable significance., Its quite plain significance--to any but those thugs (I do not use the term unkindly) is, that Shakespeare had no prominence while he lived, and none until he had been dead two or three generations., The Plays enjoyed high fame from the beginning; and if he wrote them it seems a pity the world did not find it out., He ought to have explained that he was the author, and not merely a NOM DE PLUME for another man to hide behind., If he had been less intemperately solicitous about his bones, and more solicitous about his Works, it would have been better for his good name, and a kindness to us., The bones were not important., They will moulder away, they will turn to dust, but the Works will endure until the last sun goes down., About two months ago I was illuminating this Autobiography with some notions of mine concerning the Bacon-Shakespeare controversy, and I then took occasion to air the opinion that the Stratford Shakespeare was a person of no public consequence or celebrity during his lifetime, but was utterly obscure and unimportant., And not only in great London, but also in the little village where he was born, where he lived a quarter of a century, and where he died and was buried., I argued that if he had been a person of any note at all, aged villagers would have had much to tell about him many and many a year after his death, instead of being unable to furnish inquirers a single fact connected with him., I believed, and I still believe, that if he had been famous, his notoriety would have lasted as long as mine has lasted in my native village out in Missouri., It is a good argument, a prodigiously strong one, and most formidable one for even the most gifted and ingenious and plausible Stratfordolator to get around or explain away., Today a Hannibal COURIER-POST of recent date has reached me, with an article in it which reinforces my contention that a really celebrated person cannot be forgotten in his village in the short space of sixty years., I will make an extract from it:  Hannibal, as a city, may have many sins to answer for, but ingratitude is not one of them, or reverence for the great men she has produced, and as the years go by her greatest son, Mark Twain, or S. L. Clemens as a few of the unlettered call him, grows in the estimation and regard of the residents of the town he made famous and the town that made him famous., His name is associated with every old building that is torn down to make way for the modern structures demanded by a rapidly growing city, and with every hill or cave over or through which he might by any possibility have roamed, while the many points of interest which he wove into his stories, such as Holiday Hill, Jackson's Island, or Mark Twain Cave, are now monuments to his genius., Hannibal is glad of any opportunity to do him honor as he had honored her., So it has happened that the ""old timers"" who went to school with Mark or were with him on some of his usual escapades have been honored with large audiences whenever they were in a reminiscent mood and condescended to tell of their intimacy with the ordinary boy who came to be a very extraordinary humorist and whose every boyish act is now seen to have been indicative of what was to come., Like Aunt Becky and Mrs. Clemens, they can now see that Mark was hardly appreciated when he lived here and that the things he did as a boy and was whipped for doing were not all bad, after all., So they have been in no hesitancy about drawing out the bad things he did as well as the good in their efforts to get a ""Mark Twain"" story, all incidents being viewed in the light of his present fame, until the volume of ""Twainiana"" is already considerable and growing in proportion as the ""old timers"" drop away and the stories are retold second and third hand by their descendants., With some seventy-three years and living in a villa instead of a house, he is a fair target, and let him incorporate, copyright, or patent himself as he will, there are some of his ""works"" that will go swooping up Hannibal chimneys as long as graybeards gather about the fires and begin with, ""I've heard father tell,"" or possibly, ""Once when I."", The Mrs. Clemens referred to is my mother--WAS my mother., And here is another extract from a Hannibal paper, of date twenty days ago:  Miss Becca Blankenship died at the home of William Dickason, 408 Rock Street, at 2.30 o'clock yesterday afternoon, aged 72 years., The deceased was a sister of ""Huckleberry Finn,"" one of the famous characters in Mark Twain's TOM SAWYER., She had been a member of the Dickason family--the housekeeper--for nearly forty-five years, and was a highly respected lady., For the past eight years she had been an invalid, but was as well cared for by Mr. Dickason and his family as if she had been a near relative., She was a member of the Park Methodist Church and a Christian woman., I remember her well., I have a picture of her in my mind which was graven there, clear and sharp and vivid, sixty-three years ago., She was at that time nine years old, and I was about eleven., I remember where she stood, and how she looked; and I can still see her bare feet, her bare head, her brown face, and her short tow-linen frock., She was crying., What it was about I have long ago forgotten., But it was the tears that preserved the picture for me, no doubt., She was a good child, I can say that for her., She knew me nearly seventy years ago., Did she forget me, in the course of time?, I think not., If she had lived in Stratford in Shakespeare's time, would she have forgotten him?, Yes., For he was never famous during his lifetime, he was utterly obscure in Stratford, and there wouldn't be any occasion to remember him after he had been dead a week., ""Injun Joe,"" ""Jimmy Finn,"" and ""General Gaines"" were prominent and very intemperate ne'er-do-weels in Hannibal two generations ago., Plenty of grayheads there remember them to this day, and can tell you about them., Isn't it curious that two ""town drunkards"" and one half-breed loafer should leave behind them, in a remote Missourian village, a fame a hundred times greater and several hundred times more particularized in the matter of definite facts than Shakespeare left behind him in the village where he had lived the half of his lifetime?, It was in 1590--winter., Austria was far away from the world, and asleep; it was still the Middle Ages in Austria, and promised to remain so forever., Some even set it away back centuries upon centuries and said that by the mental and spiritual clock it was still the Age of Belief in Austria., But they meant it as a compliment, not a slur, and it was so taken, and we were all proud of it., I remember it well, although I was only a boy; and I remember, too, the pleasure it gave me., Yes, Austria was far from the world, and asleep, and our village was in the middle of that sleep, being in the middle of Austria., It drowsed in peace in the deep privacy of a hilly and woodsy solitude where news from the world hardly ever came to disturb its dreams, and was infinitely content., At its front flowed the tranquil river, its surface painted with cloud-forms and the reflections of drifting arks and stone-boats; behind it rose the woody steeps to the base of the lofty precipice; from the top of the precipice frowned a vast castle, its long stretch of towers and bastions mailed in vines; beyond the river, a league to the left, was a tumbled expanse of forest-clothed hills cloven by winding gorges where the sun never penetrated; and to the right a precipice overlooked the river, and between it and the hills just spoken of lay a far-reaching plain dotted with little homesteads nested among orchards and shade trees., The whole region for leagues around was the hereditary property of a prince, whose servants kept the castle always in perfect condition for occupancy, but neither he nor his family came there oftener than once in five years., When they came it was as if the lord of the world had arrived, and had brought all the glories of its kingdoms along; and when they went they left a calm behind which was like the deep sleep which follows an orgy., Eseldorf was a paradise for us boys., We were not overmuch pestered with schooling., Mainly we were trained to be good Christians; to revere the Virgin, the Church, and the saints above everything., Beyond these matters we were not required to know much; and, in fact, not allowed to., Knowledge was not good for the common people, and could make them discontented with the lot which God had appointed for them, and God would not endure discontentment with His plans., We had two priests., One of them, Father Adolf, was a very zealous and strenuous priest, much considered., There may have been better priests, in some ways, than Father Adolf, but there was never one in our commune who was held in more solemn and awful respect., This was because he had absolutely no fear of the Devil., He was the only Christian I have ever known of whom that could be truly said., People stood in deep dread of him on that account; for they thought that there must be something supernatural about him, else he could not be so bold and so confident., All men speak in bitter disapproval of the Devil, but they do it reverently, not flippantly; but Father Adolf's way was very different; he called him by every name he could lay his tongue to, and it made everyone shudder that heard him; and often he would even speak of him scornfully and scoffingly; then the people crossed themselves and went quickly out of his presence, fearing that something fearful might happen., Father Adolf had actually met Satan face to face more than once, and defied him., This was known to be so., Father Adolf said it himself., He never made any secret of it, but spoke it right out., And that he was speaking true there was proof in at least one instance, for on that occasion he quarreled with the enemy, and intrepidly threw his bottle at him; and there, upon the wall of his study, was the ruddy splotch where it struck and broke., But it was Father Peter, the other priest, that we all loved best and were sorriest for., Some people charged him with talking around in conversation that God was all goodness and would find a way to save all his poor human children., It was a horrible thing to say, but there was never any absolute proof that Father Peter said it; and it was out of character for him to say it, too, for he was always good and gentle and truthful., He wasn't charged with saying it in the pulpit, where all the congregation could hear and testify, but only outside, in talk; and it is easy for enemies to manufacture that., Father Peter had an enemy and a very powerful one, the astrologer who lived in a tumbled old tower up the valley, and put in his nights studying the stars., Every one knew he could foretell wars and famines, though that was not so hard, for there was always a war, and generally a famine somewhere., But he could also read any man's life through the stars in a big book he had, and find lost property, and every one in the village except Father Peter stood in awe of him., Even Father Adolf, who had defied the Devil, had a wholesome respect for the astrologer when he came through our village wearing his tall, pointed hat and his long, flowing robe with stars on it, carrying his big book, and a staff which was known to have magic power., The bishop himself sometimes listened to the astrologer, it was said, for, besides studying the stars and prophesying, the astrologer made a great show of piety, which would impress the bishop, of course., But Father Peter took no stock in the astrologer., He denounced him openly as a charlatan--a fraud with no valuable knowledge of any kind, or powers beyond those of an ordinary and rather inferior human being, which naturally made the astrologer hate Father Peter and wish to ruin him., It was the astrologer, as we all believed, who originated the story about Father Peter's shocking remark and carried it to the bishop., It was said that Father Peter had made the remark to his niece, Marget, though Marget denied it and implored the bishop to believe her and spare her old uncle from poverty and disgrace., But the bishop wouldn't listen., He suspended Father Peter indefinitely, though he wouldn't go so far as to excommunicate him on the evidence of only one witness; and now Father Peter had been out a couple of years, and our other priest, Father Adolf, had his flock., Those had been hard years for the old priest and Marget., They had been favorites, but of course that changed when they came under the shadow of the bishop's frown., Many of their friends fell away entirely, and the rest became cool and distant., Marget was a lovely girl of eighteen when the trouble came, and she had the best head in the village, and the most in it., She taught the harp, and earned all her clothes and pocket money by her own industry., But her scholars fell off one by one now; she was forgotten when there were dances and parties among the youth of the village; the young fellows stopped coming to the house, all except Wilhelm Meidling--and he could have been spared; she and her uncle were sad and forlorn in their neglect and disgrace, and the sunshine was gone out of their lives., Matters went worse and worse, all through the two years., ...]",1
81,"[It's drying, in the kitchen; I'll fetch it."", He had been spending his penny savings in fanciful trifles of various kinds, to go as prizes in the games, and they were marshaled with fine and showy effect upon the table., He said:  ""Examine them at your leisure while I get mother to touch up the kite with her iron if it isn't dry enough yet."", Then he tripped out and went clattering down-stairs, whistling., We did not look at the things; we couldn't take any interest in anything but the clock., We sat staring at it in silence, listening to the ticking, and every time the minute-hand jumped we nodded recognition--one minute fewer to cover in the race for life or for death., Finally Seppi drew a deep breath and said:  ""Two minutes to ten., Seven minutes more and he will pass the death-point., Theodor, he is going to be saved!, He's going to--""  ""Hush!, I'm on needles., Watch the clock and keep still."", Five minutes more., We were panting with the strain and the excitement., Another three minutes, and there was a footstep on the stair., ""Saved!"", And we jumped up and faced the door., The old mother entered, bringing the kite., ""Isn't it a beauty?"", she said., ""And, dear me, how he has slaved over it--ever since daylight, I think, and only finished it awhile before you came."", She stood it against the wall, and stepped back to take a view of it., ""He drew the pictures his own self, and I think they are very good., The church isn't so very good, I'll have to admit, but look at the bridge--any one can recognize the bridge in a minute., He asked me to bring it up....  Dear me!, it's seven minutes past ten, and I--""  ""But where is he?"", ""He?, Oh, he'll be here soon; he's gone out a minute."", ""Gone out?"", ""Yes., Just as he came down-stairs little Lisa's mother came in and said the child had wandered off somewhere, and as she was a little uneasy I told Nikolaus to never mind about his father's orders--go and look her up....  Why, how white you two do look!, I do believe you are sick., Sit down; I'll fetch something., That cake has disagreed with you., It is a little heavy, but I thought--""  She disappeared without finishing her sentence, and we hurried at once to the back window and looked toward the river., There was a great crowd at the other end of the bridge, and people were flying toward that point from every direction., ""Oh, it is all over--poor Nikolaus!, Why, oh, why did she let him get out of the house!"", ""Come away,"" said Seppi, half sobbing, ""come quick--we can't bear to meet her; in five minutes she will know."", But we were not to escape., She came upon us at the foot of the stairs, with her cordials in her hands, and made us come in and sit down and take the medicine., Then she watched the effect, and it did not satisfy her; so she made us wait longer, and kept upbraiding herself for giving us the unwholesome cake., Presently the thing happened which we were dreading., There was a sound of tramping and scraping outside, and a crowd came solemnly in, with heads uncovered, and laid the two drowned bodies on the bed., ""Oh, my God!"", that poor mother cried out, and fell on her knees, and put her arms about her dead boy and began to cover the wet face with kisses., ""Oh, it was I that sent him, and I have been his death., If I had obeyed, and kept him in the house, this would not have happened., And I am rightly punished; I was cruel to him last night, and him begging me, his own mother, to be his friend."", And so she went on and on, and all the women cried, and pitied her, and tried to comfort her, but she could not forgive herself and could not be comforted, and kept on saying if she had not sent him out he would be alive and well now, and she was the cause of his death., It shows how foolish people are when they blame themselves for anything they have done., Satan knows, and he said nothing happens that your first act hasn't arranged to happen and made inevitable; and so, of your own motion you can't ever alter the scheme or do a thing that will break a link., Next we heard screams, and Frau Brandt came wildly plowing and plunging through the crowd with her dress in disorder and hair flying loose, and flung herself upon her dead child with moans and kisses and pleadings and endearments; and by and by she rose up almost exhausted with her outpourings of passionate emotion, and clenched her fist and lifted it toward the sky, and her tear-drenched face grew hard and resentful, and she said:  ""For nearly two weeks I have had dreams and presentiments and warnings that death was going to strike what was most precious to me, and day and night and night and day I have groveled in the dirt before Him praying Him to have pity on my innocent child and save it from harm--and here is His answer!"", Why, He had saved it from harm--but she did not know., She wiped the tears from her eyes and cheeks, and stood awhile gazing down at the child and caressing its face and its hair with her hands; then she spoke again in that bitter tone: ""But in His hard heart is no compassion., I will never pray again."", She gathered her dead child to her bosom and strode away, the crowd falling back to let her pass, and smitten dumb by the awful words they had heard., Ah, that poor woman!, It is as Satan said, we do not know good fortune from bad, and are always mistaking the one for the other., Many a time since I have heard people pray to God to spare the life of sick persons, but I have never done it., Both funerals took place at the same time in our little church next day., Everybody was there, including the party guests., Satan was there, too; which was proper, for it was on account of his efforts that the funerals had happened., Nikolaus had departed this life without absolution, and a collection was taken up for masses, to get him out of purgatory., Only two-thirds of the required money was gathered, and the parents were going to try to borrow the rest, but Satan furnished it., He told us privately that there was no purgatory, but he had contributed in order that Nikolaus's parents and their friends might be saved from worry and distress., We thought it very good of him, but he said money did not cost him anything., At the graveyard the body of little Lisa was seized for debt by a carpenter to whom the mother owed fifty groschen for work done the year before., She had never been able to pay this, and was not able now., The carpenter took the corpse home and kept it four days in his cellar, the mother weeping and imploring about his house all the time; then he buried it in his brother's cattle-yard, without religious ceremonies., It drove the mother wild with grief and shame, and she forsook her work and went daily about the town, cursing the carpenter and blaspheming the laws of the emperor and the church, and it was pitiful to see., Seppi asked Satan to interfere, but he said the carpenter and the rest were members of the human race and were acting quite neatly for that species of animal., He would interfere if he found a horse acting in such a way, and we must inform him when we came across that kind of horse doing that kind of human thing, so that he could stop it., We believed this was sarcasm, for of course there wasn't any such horse., But after a few days we found that we could not abide that poor woman's distress, so we begged Satan to examine her several possible careers, and see if he could not change her, to her profit, to a new one., He said the longest of her careers as they now stood gave her forty-two years to live, and her shortest one twenty-nine, and that both were charged with grief and hunger and cold and pain., The only improvement he could make would be to enable her to skip a certain three minutes from now; and he asked us if he should do it., This was such a short time to decide in that we went to pieces with nervous excitement, and before we could pull ourselves together and ask for particulars he said the time would be up in a few more seconds; so then we gasped out, ""Do it!"", ""It is done,"" he said; ""she was going around a corner; I have turned her back; it has changed her career."", ""Then what will happen, Satan?"", ""It is happening now., She is having words with Fischer, the weaver., In his anger Fischer will straightway do what he would not have done but for this accident., He was present when she stood over her child's body and uttered those blasphemies."", ""What will he do?"", ""He is doing it now--betraying her., In three days she will go to the stake."", We could not speak; we were frozen with horror, for if we had not meddled with her career she would have been spared this awful fate., Satan noticed these thoughts, and said:  ""What you are thinking is strictly human-like--that is to say, foolish., The woman is advantaged., Die when she might, she would go to heaven., By this prompt death she gets twenty-nine years more of heaven than she is entitled to, and escapes twenty-nine years of misery here."", A moment before we were bitterly making up our minds that we would ask no more favors of Satan for friends of ours, for he did not seem to know any way to do a person a kindness but by killing him; but the whole aspect of the case was changed now, and we were glad of what we had done and full of happiness in the thought of it., After a little I began to feel troubled about Fischer, and asked, timidly, ""Does this episode change Fischer's life-scheme, Satan?"", ""Change it?, Why, certainly., And radically., If he had not met Frau Brandt awhile ago he would die next year, thirty-four years of age., Now he will live to be ninety, and have a pretty prosperous and comfortable life of it, as human lives go."", We felt a great joy and pride in what we had done for Fischer, and were expecting Satan to sympathize with this feeling; but he showed no sign and this made us uneasy., ...]",1

everybody wanted to tell him; everybody began., But Billy Stevens, the barkeeper, called the house to order, and said one at a time was best., He distributed the drinks, and appointed Ferguson to lead., Ferguson said:  ""Well, he's a boy., And that is just about all we know about him., You can pump him till you are tired; it ain't any use; you won't get anything., At least about his intentions, or line of business, or where he's from, and such things as that., And as for getting at the nature and get-up of his main big chief mystery, why, he'll just change the subject, that's all., You can guess till you're black in the face--it's your privilege--but suppose you do, where do you arrive at?, Nowhere, as near as I can make out."", ""What is his big chief one?"", ""Sight, maybe., Hearing, maybe., Instinct, maybe., Magic, maybe., Take your choice--grownups, twenty-five;

we've hunted everywhere!"", Said the barkeeper:  ""Sit down, sit down, Mrs. Hogan, and don't worry., He asked for a bed three hours ago, tuckered out tramping the trails the way he's always doing, and went up-stairs., Ham Sandwich, run up and roust him out; he's in No., 14."", The youth was soon down-stairs and ready., He asked Mrs. Hogan for particulars., ""Bless you, dear, there ain't any; I wish there was., I put her to sleep at seven in the evening, and when I went in there an hour ago to go to bed myself, she was gone., I rushed for your cabin, dear, and you wasn't there, and I've hunted for you ever since, at every cabin down the gulch, and now I've come up again, and I'm that distracted and scared and heart-broke; but, thanks to God, I've found you at last, dear heart, and you'll find my child., Come on!, come quick!"", ""Move right along; I'm with you, madam., Go to your cabin first."", The whole company streamed out to join the hunt., All the southern half of the village was up, a hundred men strong, and waiting outside, a vague dark mass sprinkled with twinkling lanterns., The mass fell into columns by threes and fours to accommodate itself to the narrow road, and strode briskly along southward in the wake of the leaders., In a few minutes the Hogan cabin was reached., ""There's the bunk,"" said Mrs. Hogan; ""there's where she was; it's where I laid her at seven o'clock; but where she is now, God only knows."", ""Hand me a lantern,"" said Archy., He set it on the hard earth floor and knelt by it, pretending to examine the ground closely., ""Here's her track,"" he said, touching the ground here and there and yonder with his finger., ""Do you see?"", Several of the company dropped upon their knees and did their best to see., One or two thought they discerned something like a track; the others shook their heads and confessed that the smooth hard surface had no marks upon it which their eyes were sharp enough to discover., One said, ""Maybe a child's foot could make a mark on it, but I don't see how."", Young Stillman stepped outside, held the light to the ground, turned leftward, and moved three steps, closely examining; then said, ""I've got the direction--come along; take the lantern, somebody."", He strode off swiftly southward, the files following, swaying and bending in and out with the deep curves of the gorge., Thus a mile, and the mouth of the gorge was reached; before them stretched the sagebrush plain, dim, vast, and vague., Stillman called a halt, saying, ""We mustn't start wrong, now; we must take the direction again."", He took a lantern and examined the ground for a matter of twenty yards; then said, ""Come on; it's all right,"" and gave up the lantern., In and out among the sage-bushes he marched, a quarter of a mile, bearing gradually to the right; then took a new direction and made another great semicircle; then changed again and moved due west nearly half a mile--and stopped., ""She gave it up, here, poor little chap., Hold the lantern., You can see where she sat."", But this was in a slick alkali flat which was surfaced like steel, and no person in the party was quite hardy enough to claim an eyesight that could detect the track of a cushion on a veneer like that., The bereaved mother fell upon her knees and kissed the spot, lamenting., ""But where is she, then?"", some one said., ""She didn't stay here., We can see that much, anyway."", Stillman moved about in a circle around the place, with the lantern, pretending to hunt for tracks., ""Well!"", he said presently, in an annoyed tone, ""I don't understand it."", He examined again., ""No use., She was here--that's certain;

they saw all things dimly, as through a veil; they were steeped in dreams, often they did not hear when they were spoken to; they often did not understand when they heard; they answered confusedly or at random; Sally sold molasses by weight, sugar by the yard, and furnished soap when asked for candles, and Aleck put the cat in the wash and fed milk to the soiled linen., Everybody was stunned and amazed, and went about muttering, ""What CAN be the matter with the Fosters?"", Three days., Then came events!, Things had taken a happy turn, and for forty-eight hours Aleck's imaginary corner had been booming., Up--up--still up!, Cost point was passed., Still up--and up --and up!, Cost point was passed., STill up--and up--and up!, Five points above cost--then ten--fifteen--twenty!, Twenty points cold profit on the vast venture, now, and Aleck's imaginary brokers were shouting frantically by imaginary long-distance, ""Sell!, sell!, for Heaven's sake SELL!"", She broke the splendid news to Sally, and he, too, said, ""Sell!, sell--oh, don't make a blunder, now, you own the earth!, --sell, sell!"", But she set her iron will and lashed it amidships, and said she would hold on for five points more if she died for it., It was a fatal resolve., The very next day came the historic crash, the record crash, the devastating crash, when the bottom fell out of Wall Street, and the whole body of gilt-edged stocks dropped ninety-five points in five hours, and the multimillionaire was seen begging his bread in the Bowery., Aleck sternly held her grip and ""put up"" as long as she could, but at last there came a call which she was powerless to meet, and her imaginary brokers sold her out., Then, and not till then, the man in her was vanished, and the woman in her resumed sway., She put her arms about her husband's neck and wept, saying:  ""I am to blame, do not forgive me, I cannot bear it., We are paupers!, Paupers, and I am so miserable., The weddings will never come off; all that is past; we could not even buy the dentist, now."", A bitter reproach was on Sally's tongue:  ""I BEGGED you to sell, but you--"" He did not say it; he had not the heart to add a hurt to that broken and repentant spirit., A nobler thought came to him and he said:  ""Bear up, my Aleck, all is not lost!, You really never invested a penny of my uncle's bequest, but only its unmaterialized future; what we have lost was only the incremented harvest from that future by your incomparable financial judgment and sagacity., Cheer up, banish these griefs; we still have the thirty thousand untouched; and with the experience which you have acquired, think what you will be able to do with it in a couple years!, The marriages are not off, they are only postponed."", These are blessed words., Aleck saw how true they were, and their influence was electric; her tears ceased to flow, and her great spirit rose to its full stature again., With flashing eye and grateful heart, and with hand uplifted in pledge and prophecy, she said:  ""Now and here I proclaim--""  But she was interrupted by a visitor., It was the editor and proprietor of the SAGAMORE., He had happened into Lakeside to pay a duty-call upon an obscure grandmother of his who was nearing the end of her pilgrimage, and with the idea of combining business with grief he had looked up the Fosters, who had been so absorbed in other things for the past four years that they neglected to pay up their subscription., Six dollars due., No visitor could have been more welcome., He would know all about Uncle Tilbury and what his chances might be getting to be, cemeterywards., They could, of course, ask no questions, for that would squelch the bequest, but they could nibble around on the edge of the subject and hope for results., The scheme did not work., The obtuse editor did not know he was being nibbled at; but at last, chance accomplished what art had failed in., In illustration of something under discussion which required the help of metaphor, the editor said:  ""Land, it's a tough as Tilbury Foster!--as WE say."", It was sudden, and it made the Fosters jump., The editor noticed, and said, apologetically:  ""No harm intended, I assure you., It's just a saying;

""a rival, sir, you would fancy in your own mind; but let me say for you, fear not!, fear not!, I will be one of the last persons to disgrace my sex by thus encouraging every one who may feel disposed to visit me, who may honor me with their graceful bows and their choicest compliments., It is true that young men too often mistake civil politeness for the finer emotions of the heart, which is tantamount to courtship; but, ah!, how often are they deceived, when they come to test the weight of sunbeams with those on whose strength hangs the future happiness of an untried life."", The people were now rushing to the Academy with impatient anxiety; the band of music was closely followed by the students; then the parents and guardians; nothing interrupted the glow of spirits which ran through every bosom, tinged with the songs of a Virgil and the tide of a Homer., Elfonzo and Ambulinia soon repaired to the scene, and fortunately for them both the house was so crowded that they took their seats together in the music department, which was not in view of the auditory., This fortuitous circumstances added more the bliss of the Major than a thousand such exhibitions would have done., He forgot that he was man; music had lost its charms for him; whenever he attempted to carry his part, the string of the instrument would break, the bow became stubborn, and refused to obey the loud calls of the audience., Here, he said, was the paradise of his home, the long-sought-for opportunity; he felt as though he could send a million supplications to the throne of Heaven for such an exalted privilege., Poor Leos, who was somewhere in the crowd, looking as attentively as if he was searching for a needle in a haystack; here is stood, wondering to himself why Ambulinia was not there., ""Where can she be?, Oh!, if she was only here, how I could relish the scene!, Elfonzo is certainly not in town; but what if he is?, I have got the wealth, if I have not the dignity, and I am sure that the squire and his lady have always been particular friends of mine, and I think with this assurance I shall be able to get upon the blind side of the rest of the family and make the heaven-born Ambulinia the mistress of all I possess."", Then, again, he would drop his head, as if attempting to solve the most difficult problem in Euclid., While he was thus conjecturing in his own mind, a very interesting part of the exhibition was going on, which called the attention of all present., The curtains of the stage waved continually by the repelled forces that were given to them, which caused Leos to behold Ambulinia leaning upon the chair of Elfonzo., Her lofty beauty, seen by the glimmering of the chandelier, filled his heart with rapture, he knew not how to contain himself; to go where they were would expose him to ridicule; to continue where he was, with such an object before him, without being allowed an explanation in that trying hour, would be to the great injury of his mental as well as of his physical powers; and, in the name of high heaven, what must he do?, Finally, he resolved to contain himself as well as he conveniently could, until the scene was over, and then he would plant himself at the door, to arrest Ambulinia from the hands of the insolent Elfonzo, and thus make for himself a more prosperous field of immortality than ever was decreed by Omnipotence, or ever pencil drew or artist imagined., Accordingly he made himself sentinel, immediately after the performance of the evening --retained his position apparently in defiance of all the world; he waited, he gazed at every lady, his whole frame trembled; here he stood, until everything like human shape had disappeared from the institution, and he had done nothing; he had failed to accomplish that which he so eagerly sought for., Poor, unfortunate creature!, he had not the eyes of an Argus, or he might have seen his Juno and Elfonzo, assisted by his friend Sigma, make their escape from the window, and, with the rapidity of a race-horse, hurry through the blast of the storm to the residence of her father, without being recognized., He did not tarry long, but assured Ambulinia the endless chain of their existence was more closely connected than ever, since he had seen the virtuous, innocent, imploring, and the constant Amelia murdered by the jealous-hearted Farcillo, the accursed of the land., The following is the tragical scene, which is only introduced to show the subject-matter that enabled Elfonzo to come to such a determinate resolution that nothing of the kind should ever dispossess him of his true character, should he be so fortunate as to succeed in his present undertaking., Amelia was the wife of Farcillo, and a virtuous woman;

something, if possible, that could evoke sentiment, interest, feeling., ""What is cat, in Italian?"", I asked., ""Gatto."", ""Is it a gentleman cat, or a lady?"", ""Gentleman cat."", ""How are these people as regards that animal?"", ""We-ll, they--they--""  ""You hesitate:  that is enough., How are they about chickens?"", He tilted his eyes toward heaven in mute ecstasy., I understood., ""What is chicken, in Italian?"", I asked., ""Pollo, PODERE."", (Podere is Italian for master., It is a title of courtesy, and conveys reverence and admiration.), ""Pollo is one chicken by itself; when there are enough present to constitute a plural, it is POLLI."", ""Very well, polli will do., Which squad is detailed for duty next?"", ""The Past Definite."", ""Send out and order it to the front--with chickens., And let them understand that we don't want any more of this cold indifference."", He gave the order to an aide, adding, with a haunting tenderness in his tone and a watering mouth in his aspect:  ""Convey to them the conception that these are unprotected chickens."", He turned to me, saluting with his hand to his temple, and explained, ""It will inflame their interest in the poultry, sire."", A few minutes elapsed., Then the squad marched in and formed up, their faces glowing with enthusiasm, and the file-leader shouted:  ""EBBI POLLI, I had chickens!"", ""Good!"", I said., ""Go on, the next."", ""AVEST POLLI, thou hadst chickens!"", ""Fine!, Next!"", ""EBBE POLLI, he had chickens!"", ""Moltimoltissimo!, Go on, the next!"", ""AVEMMO POLLI, we had chickens!"", ""Basta-basta aspettatto avanti--last man--CHARGE!"", ""EBBERO POLLI, they had chickens!"", Then they formed in echelon, by columns of fours, refused the left, and retired in great style on the double-quick., I was enchanted, and said:  ""Now, doctor, that is something LIKE!, Chickens are the ticket, there is no doubt about it., What is the next squad?"", ""The Imperfect."", ""How does it go?"", ""IO AVENA, I had, TU AVEVI, thou hadst, EGLI AVENA, he had, NOI AV--""  ""Wait--we've just HAD the hads., What are you giving me?"", ""But this is another breed."", ""What do we want of another breed?, Isn't one breed enough?, HAD is HAD, and your tricking it out in a fresh way of spelling isn't going to make it any hadder than it was before; now you know that yourself."", ""But there is a distinction--they are not just the same Hads."", ""How do you make it out?"", ""Well, you use that first Had when you are referring to something that happened at a named and sharp and perfectly definite moment; you use the other when the thing happened at a vaguely defined time and in a more prolonged and indefinitely continuous way."", ""Why, doctor, it is pure nonsense; you know it yourself., Look here: If I have had a had, or have wanted to have had a had, or was in a position right then and there to have had a had that hadn't had any chance to go out hadding on account of this foolish discrimination which lets one Had go hadding in any kind of indefinite grammatical weather but restricts the other one to definite and datable meteoric convulsions, and keeps it pining around and watching the barometer all the time, and liable to get sick through confinement and lack of exercise, and all that sort of thing, why--why, the inhumanity of it is enough, let alone the wanton superfluity and uselessness of any such a loafing consumptive hospital-bird of a Had taking up room and cumbering the place for nothing., These finical refinements revolt me; it is not right, it is not honorable; it is constructive nepotism to keep in office a Had that is so delicate it can't come out when the wind's in the nor'west--I won't have this dude on the payroll., Cancel his exequator; and look here--""  ""But you miss the point., It is like this., You see--""  ""Never mind explaining, I don't care anything about it., Six Hads is enough for me; anybody that needs twelve, let him subscribe; I don't want any stock in a Had Trust., Knock out the Prolonged and Indefinitely Continuous; four-fifths of it is water, anyway."", ""But I beg you, podere!, It is often quite indispensable in cases where--""  ""Pipe the next squad to the assault!"", But it was not to be; for at that moment the dull boom of the noon gun floated up out of far-off Florence, followed by the usual softened jangle of church-bells, Florentine and suburban, that bursts out in murmurous response; by labor-union law the COLAZIONE [1] must stop; stop promptly, stop instantly, stop definitely, like the chosen and best of the breed of Hads., A BURLESQUE BIOGRAPHY    Two or three persons having at different times intimated that if I would write an autobiography they would read it when they got leisure, I yield at last to this frenzied public demand and herewith tender my history., Ours is a noble house, and stretches a long way back into antiquity., The earliest ancestor the Twains have any record of was a friend of the family by the name of Higgins., This was in the eleventh century, when our people were living in Aberdeen, county of Cork, England., Why it is that our long line has ever since borne the maternal name (except when one of them now and then took a playful refuge in an alias to avert foolishness), instead of Higgins, is a mystery which none of us has ever felt much desire to stir., It is a kind of vague, pretty romance, and we leave it alone., All the old families do that way., Arthour Twain was a man of considerable note--a solicitor on the highway in William Rufus's time., At about the age of thirty he went to one of those fine old English places of resort called Newgate, to see about something, and never returned again., ...]",1
86,"[If it is a reptile, and I suppose it is; for it has frowzy hair and blue eyes, and looks like a reptile., It has no hips; it tapers like a carrot; when it stands, it spreads itself apart like a derrick; so I think it is a reptile, though it may be architecture., I was afraid of it at first, and started to run every time it turned around, for I thought it was going to chase me; but by and by I found it was only trying to get away, so after that I was not timid any more, but tracked it along, several hours, about twenty yards behind, which made it nervous and unhappy., At last it was a good deal worried, and climbed a tree., I waited a good while, then gave it up and went home., Today the same thing over., I've got it up the tree again., SUNDAY.--It is up there yet., Resting, apparently., But that is a subterfuge:  Sunday isn't the day of rest; Saturday is appointed for that., It looks to me like a creature that is more interested in resting than it anything else., It would tire me to rest so much., It tires me just to sit around and watch the tree., I do wonder what it is for; I never see it do anything., They returned the moon last night, and I was SO happy!, I think it is very honest of them., It slid down and fell off again, but I was not distressed; there is no need to worry when one has that kind of neighbors; they will fetch it back., I wish I could do something to show my appreciation., I would like to send them some stars, for we have more than we can use., I mean I, not we, for I can see that the reptile cares nothing for such things., It has low tastes, and is not kind., When I went there yesterday evening in the gloaming it had crept down and was trying to catch the little speckled fishes that play in the pool, and I had to clod it to make it go up the tree again and let them alone., I wonder if THAT is what it is for?, Hasn't it any heart?, Hasn't it any compassion for those little creature?, Can it be that it was designed and manufactured for such ungentle work?, It has the look of it., One of the clods took it back of the ear, and it used language., It gave me a thrill, for it was the first time I had ever heard speech, except my own., I did not understand the words, but they seemed expressive., When I found it could talk I felt a new interest in it, for I love to talk; I talk, all day, and in my sleep, too, and I am very interesting, but if I had another to talk to I could be twice as interesting, and would never stop, if desired., If this reptile is a man, it isn't an IT, is it?, That wouldn't be grammatical, would it?, I think it would be HE., I think so., In that case one would parse it thus:  nominative, HE; dative, HIM; possessive, HIS'N., Well, I will consider it a man and call it he until it turns out to be something else., This will be handier than having so many uncertainties., NEXT WEEK SUNDAY.--All the week I tagged around after him and tried to get acquainted., I had to do the talking, because he was shy, but I didn't mind it., He seemed pleased to have me around, and I used the sociable ""we"" a good deal, because it seemed to flatter him to be included., WEDNESDAY.--We are getting along very well indeed, now, and getting better and better acquainted., He does not try to avoid me any more, which is a good sign, and shows that he likes to have me with him., That pleases me, and I study to be useful to him in every way I can, so as to increase his regard., During the last day or two I have taken all the work of naming things off his hands, and this has been a great relief to him, for he has no gift in that line, and is evidently very grateful., He can't think of a rational name to save him, but I do not let him see that I am aware of his defect., Whenever a new creature comes along I name it before he has time to expose himself by an awkward silence., In this way I have saved him many embarrassments., I have no defect like this., The minute I set eyes on an animal I know what it is., I don't have to reflect a moment; the right name comes out instantly, just as if it were an inspiration, as no doubt it is, for I am sure it wasn't in me half a minute before., I seem to know just by the shape of the creature and the way it acts what animal it is., When the dodo came along he thought it was a wildcat--I saw it in his eye., But I saved him., And I was careful not to do it in a way that could hurt his pride., I just spoke up in a quite natural way of pleasing surprise, and not as if I was dreaming of conveying information, and said, ""Well, I do declare, if there isn't the dodo!"", I explained--without seeming to be explaining --how I know it for a dodo, and although I thought maybe he was a little piqued that I knew the creature when he didn't, it was quite evident that he admired me., That was very agreeable, and I thought of it more than once with gratification before I slept., How little a thing can make us happy when we feel that we have earned it!, THURSDAY.--my first sorrow., Yesterday he avoided me and seemed to wish I would not talk to him., I could not believe it, and thought there was some mistake, for I loved to be with him, and loved to hear him talk, and so how could it be that he could feel unkind toward me when I had not done anything?, But at last it seemed true, so I went away and sat lonely in the place where I first saw him the morning that we were made and I did not know what he was and was indifferent about him; but now it was a mournful place, and every little think spoke of him, and my heart was very sore., I did not know why very clearly, for it was a new feeling; I had not experienced it before, and it was all a mystery, and I could not make it out., But when night came I could not bear the lonesomeness, and went to the new shelter which he has built, to ask him what I had done that was wrong and how I could mend it and get back his kindness again; but he put me out in the rain, and it was my first sorrow., SUNDAY.--It is pleasant again, now, and I am happy; but those were heavy days; I do not think of them when I can help it., I tried to get him some of those apples, but I cannot learn to throw straight., I failed, but I think the good intention pleased him., They are forbidden, and he says I shall come to harm; but so I come to harm through pleasing him, why shall I care for that harm?, MONDAY.--This morning I told him my name, hoping it would interest him., But he did not care for it., It is strange., If he should tell me his name, I would care., I think it would be pleasanter in my ears than any other sound., He talks very little., Perhaps it is because he is not bright, and is sensitive about it and wishes to conceal it., It is such a pity that he should feel so, for brightness is nothing; it is in the heart that the values lie., I wish I could make him understand that a loving good heart is riches, and riches enough, and that without it intellect is poverty., Although he talks so little, he has quite a considerable vocabulary., This morning he used a surprisingly good word., He evidently recognized, himself, that it was a good one, for he worked in in twice afterward, casually., It was good casual art, still it showed that he possesses a certain quality of perception., Without a doubt that seed can be made to grow, if cultivated., Where did he get that word?, I do not think I have ever used it., No, he took no interest in my name., I tried to hide my disappointment, but I suppose I did not succeed., I went away and sat on the moss-bank with my feet in the water., It is where I go when I hunger for companionship, some one to look at, some one to talk to., It is not enough--that lovely white body painted there in the pool --but it is something, and something is better than utter loneliness., It talks when I talk; it is sad when I am sad; it comforts me with its sympathy; it says, ""Do not be downhearted, you poor friendless girl; I will be your friend."", It IS a good friend to me, and my only one; it is my sister., That first time that she forsook me!, ah, I shall never forget that --never, never., My heart was lead in my body!, I said, ""She was all I had, and now she is gone!"", In my despair I said, ""Break, my heart; I cannot bear my life any more!"", and hid my face in my hands, and there was no solace for me., And when I took them away, after a little, there she was again, white and shining and beautiful, and I sprang into her arms!, That was perfect happiness; I had known happiness before, but it was not like this, which was ecstasy., ...]",1
87,"[I was eager to get to business and find relief, but she was distressingly deliberate., She unpinned and unhooked and uncoupled her upholsteries one by one, abolished the wrinkles with a flirt of her hand, and hung the articles up; peeled off her gloves and disposed of them, got a book out of her hand-bag, then drew a chair to the bedside, descended into it without hurry, and I hung out my tongue., She said, with pity but without passion:  ""Return it to its receptacle., We deal with the mind only, not with its dumb servants."", I could not offer my pulse, because the connection was broken; but she detected the apology before I could word it, and indicated by a negative tilt of her head that the pulse was another dumb servant that she had no use for., Then I thought I would tell her my symptoms and how I felt, so that she would understand the case; but that was another inconsequence, she did not need to know those things; moreover, my remark about how I felt was an abuse of language, a misapplication of terms., ""One does not feel,"" she explained; ""there is no such thing as feeling: therefore, to speak of a non-existent thing as existent is a contradiction., Matter has no existence; nothing exists but mind; the mind cannot feel pain, it can only imagine it."", ""But if it hurts, just the same--""  ""It doesn't., A thing which is unreal cannot exercise the functions of reality., Pain is unreal; hence, pain cannot hurt."", In making a sweeping gesture to indicate the act of shooing the illusion of pain out of the mind, she raked her hand on a pin in her dress, said ""Ouch!"", and went tranquilly on with her talk., ""You should never allow yourself to speak of how you feel, nor permit others to ask you how you are feeling; you should never concede that you are ill, nor permit others to talk about disease or pain or death or similar nonexistences in your presence., Such talk only encourages the mind to continue its empty imaginings."", Just at that point the Stuben-madchen trod on the cat's tail, and the cat let fly a frenzy of cat-profanity., I asked, with caution:  ""Is a cat's opinion about pain valuable?"", ""A cat has no opinion; opinions proceed from mind only; the lower animals, being eternally perishable, have not been granted mind; without mind, opinion is impossible."", ""She merely imagined she felt a pain--the cat?"", ""She cannot imagine a pain, for imagining is an effect of mind; without mind, there is no imagination., A cat has no imagination."", ""Then she had a real pain?"", ""I have already told you there is no such thing as real pain."", ""It is strange and interesting., I do wonder what was the matter with the cat., Because, there being no such thing as a real pain, and she not being able to imagine an imaginary one, it would seem that God in His pity has compensated the cat with some kind of a mysterious emotion usable when her tail is trodden on which, for the moment, joins cat and Christian in one common brotherhood of--""  She broke in with an irritated--  ""Peace!, The cat feels nothing, the Christian feels nothing., Your empty and foolish imaginings are profanation and blasphemy, and can do you an injury., It is wiser and better and holier to recognize and confess that there is no such thing as disease or pain or death."", ""I am full of imaginary tortures,"" I said, ""but I do not think I could be any more uncomfortable if they were real ones., What must I do to get rid of them?"", ""There is no occasion to get rid of them since they do not exist., They are illusions propagated by matter, and matter has no existence; there is no such thing as matter."", ""It sounds right and clear, but yet it seems in a degree elusive; it seems to slip through, just when you think you are getting a grip on it."", ""Explain."", ""Well, for instance: if there is no such thing as matter, how can matter propagate things?"", In her compassion she almost smiled., She would have smiled if there were any such thing as a smile., ""It is quite simple,"" she said; ""the fundamental propositions of Christian Science explain it, and they are summarized in the four following self-evident propositions: 1., God is All in all., 2., God is good., Good is Mind 3., God, Spirit, being all, nothing is matter 4., Life, God, omnipotent Good, deny death, evil, sin, disease., ""There--now you see."", It seemed nebulous; it did not seem to say anything about the difficulty in hand--how non-existent matter can propagate illusions I said, with some hesitancy:  ""Does--does it explain?"", ""Doesn't it?, Even if read backward it will do it."", With a budding hope, I asked her to do it backwards., ""Very well., Disease sin evil death deny Good omnipotent God life matter is nothing all being Spirit God Mind is Good good is God all in All is God., There do you understand now?, ""It--it--well, it is plainer than it was before; still--""  ""Well?"", ""Could you try it some more ways?"", ""As many as you like; it always means the same., Interchanged in any way you please it cannot be made to mean anything different from what it means when put in any other way., Because it is perfect., You can jumble it all up, and it makes no difference: it always comes out the way it was before., It was a marvelous mind that produced it., As a mental tour de force it is without a mate, it defies alike the simple, the concrete, and the occult."", ""It seems to be a corker."", I blushed for the word, but it was out before I could stop it., ""A what?"", ""A--wonderful structure--combination, so to speak, of profound thoughts --unthinkable ones--um--""  It is true., Read backward, or forward, or perpendicularly, or at any given angle, these four propositions will always be found to agree in statement and proof."", ""Ah--proof., Now we are coming at it., The statements agree; they agree with--with--anyway, they agree; I noticed that; but what is it they prove I mean, in particular?"", ""Why, nothing could be clearer., They prove:  ""1., GOD--Principle, Life, Truth, Love, Soul, Spirit, Mind., Do you get that?"", ""I--well, I seem to., Go on, please."", ""2., MAN--God's universal idea, individual, perfect, eternal., Is it clear?"", ""It--I think so., Continue."", ""3., IDEA--An image in Mind; the immediate object of understanding., There it is--the whole sublime Arcana of Christian Science in a nutshell., Do you find a weak place in it anywhere?"", ""Well--no; it seems strong."", ""Very well There is more., Those three constitute the Scientific Definition of Immortal Mind., Next, we have the Scientific Definition of Mortal Mind., Thus., FIRST DEGREE: Depravity I.

88,"[Mrs. Eddy framed it--it is her very own--it bears her trade-mark., ""The Bible and Science and Health, with other works by the same author,"" could have come from no literary vacuum but the one which produced the remark (in the Autobiography): ""I remember reading, in my childhood, certain manuscripts containing Scriptural Sonnets, besides other verses and enigmas."", We know what she means, in both instances, but a low-priced Clerk would not necessarily know, and on a salary like his he could quite excusably aver that the Pastor Emeritus had commanded him to come and make proclamation that she was author of the Bible, and that she was thinking of discharging some Scriptural sonnets and other enigmas upon the congregation., It could lose him his place, but it would not be fair, if it happened before the edict about ""Understanding Communications"" was promulgated., The By-law book makes a showy pretence of orderliness and system, but it is only a pretence., I will not go so far as to say it is a harum-scarum jumble, for it is not that, but I think it fair to say it is at least jumbulacious in places., For instance, Articles III., and IV., set forth in much detail the qualifications and duties of Readers, she then skips some thirty pages and takes up the subject again., It looks like slovenliness, but it may be only art., The belated By-law has a sufficiently quiet look, but it has a ton of dynamite in it., It makes all the Christian Science Church Readers on the globe the personal chattels of Mrs. Eddy., Whenever she chooses, she can stretch her long arm around the world's fat belly and flirt a Reader out of his pulpit, though he be tucked away in seeming safety and obscurity in a lost village in the middle of China:  She does not have to prefer charges against him, she does not have to find him lazy, careless, incompetent, untidy, ill-mannered, unholy, dishonest, she does not have to discover a fault of any kind in him, she does not have to tell him nor his congregation why she dismisses and disgraces him and insults his meek flock, she does not have to explain to his family why she takes the bread out of their mouths and turns them out-of-doors homeless and ashamed in a strange land; she does not have to do anything but send a letter and say: ""Pack!--and ask no questions!"", Has the Pope this power?--the other Pope--the one in Rome., Has he anything approaching it?, Can he turn a priest out of his pulpit and strip him of his office and his livelihood just upon a whim, a caprice, and meanwhile furnishing no reasons to the parish?, Not in America., And not elsewhere, we may believe., It is odd and strange, to see intelligent and educated people among us worshipping this self-seeking and remorseless tyrant as a God., This worship is denied--by persons who are themselves worshippers of Mrs. Eddy., I feel quite sure that it is a worship which will continue during ages., That Mrs. Eddy wrote that amazing By-law with her own hand we have much better evidence than her word., We have her English., It is there., It cannot be imitated., She ought never to go to the expense of copyrighting her verbal discharges., When any one tries to claim them she should call me; I can always tell them from any other literary apprentice's at a glance., It was like her to call America a ""nation""; she would call a sand-bar a nation if it should fall into a sentence in which she was speaking of peoples, for she would not know how to untangle it and get it out and classify it by itself., And the closing arrangement of that By-law is in true Eddysonian form, too., In it she reserves authority to make a Reader fill any office connected with a Science church-sexton, grave-digger, advertising-agent, Annex-polisher, leader of the choir, President, Director, Treasurer, Clerk, etc., She did not mean that., She already possessed that authority., She meant to clothe herself with power, despotic and unchallengeable, to appoint all Science Readers to their offices, both at home and abroad., The phrase ""or to appoint"" is another miscarriage of intention; she did not mean ""or,"" she meant ""and."", That By-law puts into Mrs. Eddy's hands absolute command over the most formidable force and influence existent in the Christian Science kingdom outside of herself, and it does this unconditionally and (by auxiliary force of Laws already quoted) irrevocably., Still, she is not quite satisfied., Something might happen, she doesn't know what., Therefore she drives in one more nail, to make sure, and drives it deep:  Let some one with a wild and delirious fancy try and see if he can imagine her furnishing that consent., Very properly, the first qualification for membership in the Mother-Church is belief in the doctrines of Christian Science., But these doctrines must not be gathered from secondary sources., There is but one recognized source., The candidate must be a believer in the doctrines of Christian Science ""according to the platform and teaching contained in the Christian Science text-book, 'Science and Health, with Key to the Scriptures,' by Rev., Mary Baker G., Eddy."", That is definite, and is final., There are to be no commentaries, no labored volumes of exposition and explanation by anybody except Mrs. Eddy., Because such things could sow error, create warring opinions, split the religion into sects, and disastrously cripple its power., Mrs. Eddy will do the whole of the explaining, Herself--has done it, in fact., She has written several books., They are to be had (for cash in advance), they are all sacred; additions to them can never be needed and will never be permitted., They tell the candidate how to instruct himself, how to teach others, how to do all things comprised in the business--and they close the door against all would-be competitors, and monopolize the trade:  Mrs. Eddy's words are to be the sole elucidators of the Bible and Science and Health--forever., Throughout the ages, whenever there is doubt as to the meaning of a passage in either of these books the inquirer will not dream of trying to explain it to himself; he would shudder at the thought of such temerity, such profanity, he would be haled to the Inquisition and thence to the public square and the stake if he should be caught studying into text-meanings on his own hook; he will be prudent and seek the meanings at the only permitted source, Mrs. Eddy's commentaries., Value of this Strait-jacket., One must not underrate the magnificence of this long-headed idea, one must not underestimate its giant possibilities in the matter of trooping the Church solidly together and keeping it so., It squelches independent inquiry, and makes such a thing impossible, profane, criminal, it authoritatively settles every dispute that can arise., It starts with finality--a point which the Roman Church has travelled towards fifteen or sixteen centuries, stage by stage, and has not yet reached., The matter of the Immaculate Conception of the Virgin Mary was not authoritatively settled until the days of Pius IX., --yesterday, so to speak., As already noticed, the Protestants are broken up into a long array of sects, a result of disputes about the meanings of texts, disputes made unavoidable by the absence of an infallible authority to submit doubtful passages to., A week or two ago (I am writing in the middle of January, 1903), the clergy and others hereabouts had a warm dispute in the papers over this question: Did Jesus anywhere claim to be God?, It seemed an easy question, but it turned out to be a hard one., It was ably and elaborately discussed, by learned men of several denominations, but in the end it remained unsettled., A week ago, another discussion broke out., It was over this text:  One verdict was worded as follows:  Ten clergymen of various denominations were interviewed, and nine of them agreed with that verdict., That did not settle the matter, because the tenth said the language of Jesus was so strait and definite that it explained itself: ""Sell all,"" not a percentage., There is a most unusual feature about that dispute: the nine persons who decided alike, quoted not a single authority in support of their position., I do not know when I have seen trained disputants do the like of that before., The nine merely furnished their own opinions, founded upon--nothing at all., In the other dispute (""Did Jesus anywhere claim to be God?""), the same kind of men--trained and learned clergymen--backed up their arguments with chapter and verse., On both sides., Plenty of verses., Were no reinforcing verses to be found in the present case?, It looks that way., The opinion of the nine seems strange to me, for it is unsupported by authority, while there was at least constructive authority for the opposite view., It is hair-splitting differences of opinion over disputed text-meanings that have divided into many sects a once united Church., One may infer from some of the names in the following list that some of the differences are very slight--so slight as to be not distinctly important, perhaps --yet they have moved groups to withdraw from communions to which they belonged and set up a sect of their own., The list--accompanied by various Church statistics for 1902, compiled by Rev., Dr.  H.

Lindh, A..M., has communicated to the Boston Transcript a hopeful article on the solution of the problem of the ""divided church."", Divided is not too violent a term., Subdivided could have been permitted if he had thought of it., He came near thinking of it, for he mentions some of the subdivisions himself: ""the 12 kinds of Presbyterians, the 17 kinds of Methodists, the 13 kinds of Baptists, etc."", He overlooked the 12 kinds of Mennonites and the 22 kinds of Lutherans, but they are in Rev., Mr. Carroll's list., Altogether, 76 splits under 5 flags., The Literary Digest (February 14th) is pleased with Mr. Lindh's optimistic article, and also with the signs of the times, and perceives that ""the idea of Church unity is in the air."", Now, then, is not Mrs. Eddy profoundly wise in forbidding, for all time, all explanations of her religion except such as she shall let on to be her own?, I think so., I think there can be no doubt of it., In a way, they will be her own; for, no matter which member of her clerical staff shall furnish the explanations, not a line of them will she ever allow to be printed until she shall have approved it, accepted it, copyrighted it, cabbaged it., We may depend on that with a four-ace confidence., THE NEW INFALLIBILITY  All in proper time Mrs. Eddy's factory will take hold of that Commandment, and explain it for good and all., It may be that one member of the shift will vote that the word ""all"" means all; it may be that ten members of the shift will vote that ""all"" means only a percentage; but it is Mrs. Eddy, not the eleven, who will do the deciding., And if she says it is percentage, then percentage it is, forevermore--and that is what I am expecting, for she doesn't sell all herself, nor any considerable part of it, and as regards the poor, she doesn't declare any dividend; but if she says ""all"" means all, then all it is, to the end of time, and no follower of hers will ever be allowed to reconstruct that text, or shrink it, or inflate it, or meddle with it in any way at all., Even to-day --right here in the beginning--she is the sole person who, in the matter of Christian Science exegesis, is privileged to exploit the Spiral Twist., The Christian world has two Infallibles now., Of equal power?, For the present only., ...]",1
89,"[Says I--  ""Sam, I'm as glad to hear it as I thought I'd be sorry., I'm glad I come, now."", Says he--  ""Cap'n, ain't you pretty physically tired?"", Says I--  ""Sam, it ain't any name for it!, I'm dog-tired."", ""Just so--just so., You've earned a good sleep, and you'll get it., You've earned a good appetite, and you'll enjoy your dinner., It's the same here as it is on earth--you've got to earn a thing, square and honest, before you enjoy it., You can't enjoy first and earn afterwards., But there's this difference, here:  you can choose your own occupation, and all the powers of heaven will be put forth to help you make a success of it, if you do your level best., The shoe-maker on earth that had the soul of a poet in him won't have to make shoes here."", ""Now that's all reasonable and right,"" says I., ""Plenty of work, and the kind you hanker after; no more pain, no more suffering--""  ""Oh, hold on; there's plenty of pain here--but it don't kill., There's plenty of suffering here, but it don't last., You see, happiness ain't a THING IN ITSELF--it's only a CONTRAST with something that ain't pleasant., That's all it is., There ain't a thing you can mention that is happiness in its own self--it's only so by contrast with the other thing., And so, as soon as the novelty is over and the force of the contrast dulled, it ain't happiness any longer, and you have to get something fresh., Well, there's plenty of pain and suffering in heaven--consequently there's plenty of contrasts, and just no end of happiness."", Says I, ""It's the sensiblest heaven I've heard of yet, Sam, though it's about as different from the one I was brought up on as a live princess is different from her own wax figger."", Along in the first months I knocked around about the Kingdom, making friends and looking at the country, and finally settled down in a pretty likely region, to have a rest before taking another start., I went on making acquaintances and gathering up information., I had a good deal of talk with an old bald-headed angel by the name of Sandy McWilliams., He was from somewhere in New Jersey., I went about with him, considerable., We used to lay around, warm afternoons, in the shade of a rock, on some meadow-ground that was pretty high and out of the marshy slush of his cranberry-farm, and there we used to talk about all kinds of things, and smoke pipes., One day, says I--  ""About how old might you be, Sandy?"", ""Seventy-two."", ""I judged so., How long you been in heaven?"", ""Twenty-seven years, come Christmas."", ""How old was you when you come up?"", ""Why, seventy-two, of course."", ""You can't mean it!"", ""Why can't I mean it?"", ""Because, if you was seventy-two then, you are naturally ninety-nine now."", ""No, but I ain't., I stay the same age I was when I come."", ""Well,"" says I, ""come to think, there's something just here that I want to ask about., Down below, I always had an idea that in heaven we would all be young, and bright, and spry."", ""Well, you can be young if you want to., You've only got to wish."", ""Well, then, why didn't you wish?"", ""I did., They all do., You'll try it, some day, like enough; but you'll get tired of the change pretty soon."", ""Why?"", ""Well, I'll tell you., Now you've always been a sailor; did you ever try some other business?"", ""Yes, I tried keeping grocery, once, up in the mines; but I couldn't stand it; it was too dull--no stir, no storm, no life about it; it was like being part dead and part alive, both at the same time., I wanted to be one thing or t'other., I shut up shop pretty quick and went to sea."", ""That's it., Grocery people like it, but you couldn't., You see you wasn't used to it., Well, I wasn't used to being young, and I couldn't seem to take any interest in it., I was strong, and handsome, and had curly hair,--yes, and wings, too!--gay wings like a butterfly., I went to picnics and dances and parties with the fellows, and tried to carry on and talk nonsense with the girls, but it wasn't any use; I couldn't take to it--fact is, it was an awful bore., What I wanted was early to bed and early to rise, and something to DO; and when my work was done, I wanted to sit quiet, and smoke and think--not tear around with a parcel of giddy young kids., You can't think what I suffered whilst I was young."", ""How long was you young?"", ""Only two weeks., That was plenty for me., Laws, I was so lonesome!, You see, I was full of the knowledge and experience of seventy-two years; the deepest subject those young folks could strike was only a-b-c to me., And to hear them argue--oh, my!, it would have been funny, if it hadn't been so pitiful., Well, I was so hungry for the ways and the sober talk I was used to, that I tried to ring in with the old people, but they wouldn't have it., They considered me a conceited young upstart, and gave me the cold shoulder., Two weeks was a-plenty for me., I was glad to get back my bald head again, and my pipe, and my old drowsy reflections in the shade of a rock or a tree."", ""Well,"" says I, ""do you mean to say you're going to stand still at seventy-two, forever?"", ""I don't know, and I ain't particular., But I ain't going to drop back to twenty-five any more--I know that, mighty well., I know a sight more than I did twenty-seven years ago, and I enjoy learning, all the time, but I don't seem to get any older., That is, bodily --my mind gets older, and stronger, and better seasoned, and more satisfactory."", Says I, ""If a man comes here at ninety, don't he ever set himself back?"", ""Of course he does., He sets himself back to fourteen; tries it a couple of hours, and feels like a fool; sets himself forward to twenty; it ain't much improvement; tries thirty, fifty, eighty, and finally ninety--finds he is more at home and comfortable at the same old figure he is used to than any other way., Or, if his mind begun to fail him on earth at eighty, that's where he finally sticks up here., He sticks at the place where his mind was last at its best, for there's where his enjoyment is best, and his ways most set and established."", ""Does a chap of twenty-five stay always twenty-five, and look it?"", ""If he is a fool, yes., But if he is bright, and ambitious and industrious, the knowledge he gains and the experiences he has, change his ways and thoughts and likings, and make him find his best pleasure in the company of people above that age; so he allows his body to take on that look of as many added years as he needs to make him comfortable and proper in that sort of society; he lets his body go on taking the look of age, according as he progresses, and by and by he will be bald and wrinkled outside, and wise and deep within."", ""Babies the same?"", ""Babies the same., Laws, what asses we used to be, on earth, about these things!, We said we'd be always young in heaven., We didn't say HOW young--we didn't think of that, perhaps--that is, we didn't all think alike, anyway., When I was a boy of seven, I suppose I thought we'd all be twelve, in heaven; when I was twelve, I suppose I thought we'd all be eighteen or twenty in heaven; when I was forty, I begun to go back; I remember I hoped we'd all be about THIRTY years old in heaven., Neither a man nor a boy ever thinks the age he HAS is exactly the best one--he puts the right age a few years older or a few years younger than he is., Then he makes that ideal age the general age of the heavenly people., And he expects everybody TO STICK at that age--stand stock-still--and expects them to enjoy it!--Now just think of the idea of standing still in heaven!, Think of a heaven made up entirely of hoop-rolling, marble-playing cubs of seven years!--or of awkward, diffident, sentimental immaturities of nineteen!--or of vigorous people of thirty, healthy-minded, brimming with ambition, but chained hand and foot to that one age and its limitations like so many helpless galley-slaves!, Think of the dull sameness of a society made up of people all of one age and one set of looks, habits, tastes and feelings., Think how superior to it earth would be, with its variety of types and faces and ages, and the enlivening attrition of the myriad interests that come into pleasant collision in such a variegated society."", ""Look here,"" says I, ""do you know what you're doing?"", ""Well, what am I doing?"", ""You are making heaven pretty comfortable in one way, but you are playing the mischief with it in another."", ...]",1
90,"[Your ancestors skinned him alive, and I am an orphan., Not one drop of my blood flows in that Indian's veins today., I stand here, lone and forlorn, without an ancestor., They skinned him!, I do not object to that, if they needed his fur; but alive, gentlemen-alive!, They skinned him alive--and before company!, That is what rankles., Think how he must have felt; for he was a sensitive person and easily embarrassed., If he had been a bird, it would have been all right, and no violence done to his feelings, because he would have been considered ""dressed."", But he was not a bird, gentlemen, he was a man, and probably one of the most undressed men that ever was., I ask you to put yourselves in his place., I ask it as a favor; I ask it as a tardy act of justice; I ask it in the interest of fidelity to the traditions of your ancestors; I ask it that the world may contemplate, with vision unobstructed by disguising swallow-tails and white cravats, the spectacle which the true New England Society ought to present., Cease to come to these annual orgies in this hollow modern mockery--the surplusage of raiment., Come in character; come in the summer grace, come in the unadorned simplicity, come in the free and joyous costume which your sainted ancestors provided for mine., Later ancestors of mine were the Quakers William Robinson, Marmaduke Stevenson, et al., Your tribe chased them put of the country for their religion's sake; promised them death if they came back; for your ancestors had forsaken the homes they loved, and braved the perils of the sea, the implacable climate, and the savage wilderness, to acquire that highest and most precious of boons, freedom for every man on this broad continent to worship according to the dictates of his own conscience--and they were not going to allow a lot of pestiferous Quakers to interfere with it., Your ancestors broke forever the chains of political slavery, and gave the vote to every man in this wide land, excluding none!--none except those who did not belong to the orthodox church., Your ancestors --yes, they were a hard lot; but, nevertheless, they gave us religious liberty to worship as they required us to worship, and political liberty to vote as the church required; and so I the bereft one, I the forlorn one, am here to do my best to help you celebrate them right., The Quaker woman Elizabeth Hooton was an ancestress of mine., Your people were pretty severe with her you will confess that., But, poor thing!, I believe they changed her opinions before she died, and took her into their fold; and so we have every reason to presume that when she died she went to the same place which your ancestors went to., It is a great pity, for she was a good woman., Roger Williams was an ancestor of mine., I don't really remember what your people did with him., But they banished him to Rhode Island, anyway., And then, I believe, recognizing that this was really carrying harshness to an unjustifiable extreme, they took pity on him and burned him., They were a hard lot!, All those Salem witches were ancestors of mine!, Your people made it tropical for them., Yes, they did; by pressure and the gallows they made such a clean deal with them that there hasn't been a witch and hardly a halter in our family from that day to this, and that is one hundred and eighty-nine years., The first slave brought into New England out of Africa by your progenitors was an ancestor of mine--for I am of a mixed breed, an infinitely shaded and exquisite Mongrel., I'm not one of your sham meerschaums that you can color in a week., No, my complexion is the patient art of eight generations., Well, in my own time, I had acquired a lot of my kin--by purchase, and swapping around, and one way and another --and was getting along very well., Then, with the inborn perversity of your lineage, you got up a war, and took them all away from me., And so, again am I bereft, again am I forlorn; no drop of my blood flows in the veins of any living being who is marketable., O my friends, hear me and reform!, I seek your good, not mine., You have heard the speeches., Disband these New England societies--nurseries of a system of steadily augmenting laudation and hosannaing, which; if persisted in uncurbed, may some day in the remote future beguile you into prevaricating and bragging., Oh, stop, stop, while you are still temperate in your appreciation of your ancestors!, Hear me, I beseech you; get up an auction and sell Plymouth Rock!, The Pilgrims were a simple and ignorant race., They never had seen any good rocks before, or at least any that were not watched, and so they were excusable for hopping ashore in frantic delight and clapping an iron fence around this one., But you, gentlemen, are educated; you are enlightened; you know that in the rich land of your nativity, opulent New England, overflowing with rocks, this one isn't worth, at the outside, more than thirty-five cents., Therefore, sell it, before it is injured by exposure, or at least throw it open to the patent-medicine advertisements, and let it earn its taxes:  Yes, hear your true friend-your only true friend--list to his voice., Disband these societies, hotbeds of vice, of moral decay--perpetuators of ancestral superstition., Here on this board I see water, I see milk, I see the wild and deadly lemonade., These are but steps upon the downward path., Next we shall see tea, then chocolate, then coffee--hotel coffee., A few more years--all too few, I fear--mark my words, we shall have cider!, Gentlemen, pause ere it be too late., You are on the broad road which leads to dissipation, physical ruin, moral decay, gory crime and the gallows!, I beseech you, I implore you, in the name of your anxious friends, in the name of your suffering families, in the name of your impending widows and orphans, stop ere it be too late., Disband these New England societies, renounce these soul-blistering saturnalia, cease from varnishing the rusty reputations of your long-vanished ancestors--the super-high-moral old iron-clads of Cape Cod, the pious buccaneers of Plymouth Rock--go home, and try to learn to behave!, However, chaff and nonsense aside, I think I honor and appreciate your Pilgrim stock as much as you do yourselves, perhaps; and I endorse and adopt a sentiment uttered by a grandfather of mine once--a man of sturdy opinions, of sincere make of mind, and not given to flattery., He said: ""People may talk as they like about that Pilgrim stock, but, after all's said and done, it would be pretty hard to improve on those people; and, as for me, I don't mind coming out flatfooted and saying there ain't any way to improve on them--except having them born in, Missouri!"", In introducing Mr. Clemens, Frank R.  Lawrence, the President           of the Lotos Club, recalled the fact that the first club dinner           in the present club-house, some fourteen years ago, was in           honor of Mark Twain., I wish to begin this time at the beginning, lest I forget it altogether; that is to say, I wish to thank you for this welcome that you are giving, and the welcome which you gave me seven years ago, and which I forgot to thank you for at that time., I also wish to thank you for the welcome you gave me fourteen years ago, which I also forgot to thank you for at the time., I hope you will continue this custom to give me a dinner every seven years before I join the hosts in the other world--I do not know which world., Mr. Lawrence and Mr. Porter have paid me many compliments., It is very difficult to take compliments., I do not care whether you deserve the compliments or not, it is just as difficult to take them., The other night I was at the Engineers' Club, and enjoyed the sufferings of Mr. Carnegie., They were complimenting him there; there it was all compliments, and none of them deserved., They say that you cannot live by bread alone, but I can live on compliments., I do not make any pretence that I dislike compliments., The stronger the better, and I can manage to digest them., I think I have lost so much by not making a collection of compliments, to put them away and take them out again once in a while., When in England I said that I would start to collect compliments, and I began there and I have brought some of them along., The first one of these lies--I wrote them down and preserved them --I think they are mighty good and extremely just., It is one of Hamilton Mabie's compliments., He said that La Salle was the first one to make a voyage of the Mississippi, but Mark Twain was the first to chart, light, and navigate it for the whole world., If that had been published at the time that I issued that book [Life on the Mississippi], it would have been money in my pocket., I tell you, it is a talent by itself to pay compliments gracefully and have them ring true., It's an art by itself., Here is another compliment by Albert Bigelow Paine, my biographer., He is writing four octavo volumes about me, and he has been at my elbow two and one-half years., I just suppose that he does not know me, but says he knows me., He says ""Mark Twain is not merely a great writer, a great philosopher, a great man; he is the supreme expression of the human being, with his strength and his weakness."", What a talent for compression!, It takes a genius in compression to compact as many facts as that., W. D. Howells spoke of me as first of Hartford, and ultimately of the solar system, not to say of the universe:  You know how modest Howells is., If it can be proved that my fame reaches to Neptune and Saturn; that will satisfy even me., You know how modest and retiring Howells seems to be, but deep down he is as vain as I am., Mr. Howells had been granted a degree at Oxford, whose gown was red., He had been invited to an exercise at Columbia, and upon inquiry had been told that it was usual to wear the black gown: Later he had found that three other men wore bright gowns, and he had lamented that he had been one of the black mass, and not a red torch., Edison wrote: ""The average American loves his family., If he has any love left over for some other person, he generally selects Mark Twain."", Now here's the compliment of a little Montana girl which came to me indirectly., She was in a room in which there was a large photograph of me., After gazing at it steadily for a time, she said:  ""We've got a John the Baptist like that."", She also said: ""Only ours has more trimmings."", I suppose she meant the halo., Now here is a gold-miner's compliment., It is forty-two years old., It was my introduction to an audience to which I lectured in a log school-house., There were no ladies there., ...]",1
91,"[It is not any matter when you are called upon to express it; you can get up and do it, and my verdict has already been recorded in my heart and in my head as regards Mr. Jerome and his administration of the criminal affairs of this county., I agree with everything Mr. Choate has said in his letter regarding Mr. Jerome; I agree with everything Mr. Shepard has said; and I agree with everything Mr. Jerome has said in his own commendation., And I thought Mr. Jerome was modest in that., If he had been talking about another officer of this county, he could have painted the joys and sorrows of office and his victories in even stronger language than he did., I voted for Mr. Jerome in those old days, and I should like to vote for him again if he runs for any office., I moved out of New York, and that is the reason, I suppose, I cannot vote for him again., There may be some way, but I have not found it out., But now I am a farmer--a farmer up in Connecticut, and winning laurels., Those people already speak with such high favor, admiration, of my farming, and they say that I am the only man that has ever come to that region who could make two blades of grass grow where only three grew before., Well, I cannot vote for him., You see that., As it stands now, I cannot., I am crippled in that way and to that extent, for I would ever so much like to do it., I am not a Congress, and I cannot distribute pensions, and I don't know any other legitimate way to buy a vote., But if I should think of any legitimate way, I shall make use of it, and then I shall vote for Mr. Jerome., HENRY IRVING   I find my task a very easy one., I have been a dramatist for thirty years., I have had an ambition in all that time to overdo the work of the Spaniard who said he left behind him four hundred dramas when he died., I leave behind me four hundred and fifteen, and am not yet dead., The greatest of all the arts is to write a drama., It is a most difficult thing., It requires the highest talent possible and the rarest gifts., No, there is another talent that ranks with it--for anybody can write a drama--I had four hundred of them--but to get one accepted requires real ability., And I have never had that felicity yet., But human nature is so constructed, we are so persistent, that when we know that we are born to a thing we do not care what the world thinks about it., We go on exploiting that talent year after year, as I have done., I shall go on writing dramas, and some day the impossible may happen, but I am not looking for it., In writing plays the chief thing is novelty., The world grows tired of solid forms in all the arts., I struck a new idea myself years ago., I was not surprised at it., I was always expecting it would happen., A person who has suffered disappointment for many years loses confidence, and I thought I had better make inquiries before I exploited my new idea of doing a drama in the form of a dream, so I wrote to a great authority on knowledge of all kinds, and asked him whether it was new., I could depend upon him., He lived in my dear home in America--that dear home, dearer to me through taxes., He sent me a list of plays in which that old device had been used, and he said that there was also a modern lot., He travelled back to China and to a play dated two thousand six hundred years before the Christian era., He said he would follow it up with a list of the previous plays of the kind, and in his innocence would have carried them back to the Flood., That is the most discouraging thing that has ever happened to me in my dramatic career., I have done a world of good in a silent and private way, and have furnished Sir Henry Irving with plays and plays and plays., What has he achieved through that influence., See where he stands now --on the summit of his art in two worlds and it was I who put him there --that partly put him there., I need not enlarge upon the influence the drama has exerted upon civilization., It has made good morals entertaining., I am to be followed by Mr. Pinero., I conceive that we stand at the head of the profession., He has not written as many plays as I have, but he has lead that God-given talent, which I lack, of working hem off on the manager., I couple his name with this toast, and add the hope that his influence will be supported in exercising his masterly handicraft in that great gift, and that he will long live to continue his fine work., DINNER TO HAMILTON W. MABIE  MR. CHAIRMAN AND GENTLEMEN,--This man knows now how it feels to be the chief guest, and if he has enjoyed it he is the first man I have ever seen in that position that did enjoy it., And I know, by side-remarks which he made to me before his ordeal came upon him, that he was feeling as some of the rest of us have felt under the same circumstances., He was afraid that he would not do himself justice; but he did--to my surprise., It is a most serious thing to be a chief guest on an occasion like this, and it is admirable, it is fine., It is a great compliment to a man that he shall come out of it so gloriously as Mr. Mabie came out of it tonight--to my surprise., He did it well., He appears to be editor of The Outlook, and notwithstanding that, I have every admiration, because when everything is said concerning The Outlook, after all one must admit that it is frank in its delinquencies, that it is outspoken in its departures from fact, that it is vigorous in its mistaken criticisms of men like me., I have lived in this world a long, long time, and I know you must not judge a man by the editorials that he puts in his paper., A man is always better than his printed opinions., A man always reserves to himself on the inside a purity and an honesty and a justice that are a credit to him, whereas the things that he prints are just the reverse., Oh yes, you must not judge a man by what he writes in his paper., Even in an ordinary secular paper a man must observe some care about it; he must be better than the principles which he puts in print., And that is the case with Mr. Mabie., Why, to see what he writes about me and the missionaries you would think he did not have any principles., But that is Mr. Mabie in his public capacity., Mr. Mabie in his private capacity is just as clean a man as I am., In this very room, a month or two ago, some people admired that portrait; some admired this, but the great majority fastened on that, and said, ""There is a portrait that is a beautiful piece of art."", When that portrait is a hundred years old it will suggest what were the manners and customs in our time., Just as they talk about Mr. Mabie to-night, in that enthusiastic way, pointing out the various virtues of the man and the grace of his spirit, and all that, so was that portrait talked about., They were enthusiastic, just as we men have been over the character and the work of Mr. Mabie., And when they were through they said that portrait, fine as it is, that work, beautiful as it is, that piece of humanity on that canvas, gracious and fine as it is, does not rise to those perfections that exist in the man himself., Come up, Mr. Alexander., [The reference was to James W. Alexander, who happened to be sitting --beneath the portrait of himself on the wall.], Now, I should come up and show myself., But he cannot do it, he cannot do it., He was born that way, he was reared in that way., Let his modesty be an example, and I wish some of you had it, too., But that is just what I have been saying --that portrait, fine as it is, is not as fine as the man it represents, and all the things that have been said about Mr. Mabie, and certainly they have been very nobly worded and beautiful, still fall short of the real Mabie., INTRODUCING NYE AND RILEY    I am very glad indeed to introduce these young people to you, and at the same time get acquainted with them myself., I have seen them more than once for a moment, but have not had the privilege of knowing them personally as intimately as I wanted to., I saw them first, a great many years ago, when Mr. Barnum had them, and they were just fresh from Siam., The ligature was their best hold then, the literature became their best hold later, when one of them committed an indiscretion, and they had to cut the old bond to accommodate the sheriff., In that old former time this one was Chang, that one was Eng., The sympathy existing between the two was most extraordinary; it was so fine, so strong, so subtle, that what the one ate the other digested; when one slept, the other snored; if one sold a thing, the other scooped the usufruct., This independent and yet dependent action was observable in all the details of their daily life--I mean this quaint and arbitrary distribution of originating cause and resulting effect between the two --between, I may say, this dynamo and the other always motor, or, in other words, that the one was always the creating force, the other always the utilizing force; no, no, for while it is true that within certain well-defined zones of activity the one was always dynamo and the other always motor, within certain other well-defined zones these positions became exactly reversed., For instance, in moral matters Mr. Chang Riley was always dynamo, Mr. Eng Nye was always motor; for while Mr. Chang Riley had a high--in fact, an abnormally high and fine moral sense, he had no machinery to work it with; whereas, Mr. Eng Nye, who hadn't any moral sense at all, and hasn't yet, was equipped with all the necessary plant for putting a noble deed through, if he could only get the inspiration on reasonable terms outside., In intellectual matters, on the other hand, Mr. Eng Nye was always dynamo, Mr. Chang Riley was always motor; Mr. Eng Nye had a stately intellect, but couldn't make it go; Mr. Chang Riley hadn't, but could., That is to say, that while Mr. Chang Riley couldn't think things himself, he had a marvellous natural grace in setting them down and weaving them together when his pal furnished the raw material., Thus, working together, they made a strong team; laboring together, they could do miracles; but break the circuit, and both were impotent., It has remained so to this day: they must travel together, hoe, and plant, and plough, and reap, and sell their public together, or there's no result., I have made this explanation, this analysis, this vivisection, so to speak, in order that you may enjoy these delightful adventurers understandingly., When Mr. Eng Nye's deep and broad and limpid philosophies flow by in front of you, refreshing all the regions round about with their gracious floods, you will remember that it isn't his water; it's the other man's, and he is only working the pump., And when Mr. Chang Riley enchants your ear, and soothes your spirit, and touches your heart with the sweet and genuine music of his poetry--as sweet and as genuine as any that his friends, the birds and the bees, make about his other friends, the woods and the flowers--you will remember, while placing justice where justice is due, that it isn't his music, but the other man's--he is only turning the crank., I beseech for these visitors a fair field, a singleminded, one-eyed umpire, and a score bulletin barren of goose-eggs if they earn it--and I judge they will and hope they will., Mr. James Whitcomb Chang Riley will now go to the bat., I am very proud to respond to this toast, as it recalls the proudest day of my life., The delightful hospitality shown me at the time of my visit to Oxford I shall cherish until I die., In that long and distinguished career of mine I value that degree above all other honors., When the ship landed even the stevedores gathered on the shore and gave an English cheer., Nothing could surpass in my life the pleasure of those four weeks., No one could pass by me without taking my hand, even the policemen., I've been in all the principal capitals of Christendom in my life, and have always been an object of interest to policemen., ...]",1
92,"[Therefore, everybody had taken the pledge; there wasn't anybody for miles and miles around that had not taken the pledge., ""So you can see what a solitude it was to this young man, who was fond of his grog., And he was just an outcast, because when they found he would not join Father Mathew's Society they ostracized him, and he went about that town three weeks, day and night, in utter loneliness--the only human being in the whole place who ever took grog, and he had to take it privately., ""If you don't know what it is to be ostracized, to be shunned by your fellow-man, may you never know it., Then he recognized that there was something more valuable in this life than grog, and that is the fellowship of your fellow-man., And at last he gave it up, and at nine o'clock one night he went down to the Father Mathew Temperance Society, and with a broken heart he said: 'Put my name down for membership in this society.', ""And then he went away crying, and at earliest dawn the next morning they came for him and routed him out, and they said that new ship of his was ready to sail on a three years' voyage., In a minute he was on board that ship and gone., ""And he said--well, he was not out of sight of that town till he began to repent, but he had made up his mind that he would not take a drink, and so that whole voyage of three years was a three years' agony to that man because he saw all the time the mistake he had made., ""He felt it all through; he had constant reminders of it, because the crew would pass him with their grog, come out on the deck and take it, and there was the torturous Smell of it., ""He went through the whole, three years of suffering, and at last coming into port it was snowy, it was cold, he was stamping through the snow two feet deep on the deck and longing to get home, and there was his crew torturing him to the last minute with hot grog, but at last he had his reward., He really did get to shore at fast, and jumped and ran and bought a jug and rushed to the society's office, and said to the secretary:  ""'Take my name off your membership books, and do it right away!, I have got a three years' thirst on.', ""And the secretary said: 'It is not necessary., You were blackballed!'"", LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,--The remainder of my duties as presiding chairman here this evening are but two--only two., One of them is easy, and the other difficult., That is to say, I must introduce the orator, and then keep still and give him a chance., The name of Henry Watterson carries with it its own explanation., It is like an electric light on top of Madison Square Garden; you touch the button and the light flashes up out of the darkness., You mention the name of Henry Watterson, and your minds are at once illuminated with the splendid radiance of his fame and achievements., A journalist, a soldier, an orator, a statesman, a rebel., Yes, he was a rebel; and, better still, now he is a reconstructed rebel., It is a curious circumstance, a circumstance brought about without any collusion or prearrangement, that he and I, both of whom were rebels related by blood to each other, should be brought here together this evening bearing a tribute in our hands and bowing our heads in reverence to that noble soul who for three years we tried to destroy., I don't know as the fact has ever been mentioned before, but it is a fact, nevertheless., Colonel Watterson and I were both rebels, and we are blood relations., I was a second lieutenant in a Confederate company for a while--oh, I could have stayed on if I had wanted to., I made myself felt, I left tracks all around the country., I could have stayed on, but it was such weather., I never saw such weather to be out-of-doors in, in all my life., The Colonel commanded a regiment, and did his part, I suppose, to destroy the Union., He did not succeed, yet if he had obeyed me he would have done so., I had a plan, and I fully intended to drive General Grant into the Pacific Ocean--if I could get transportation., I told Colonel Watterson about it., I told him what he had to do., What I wanted him to do was to surround the Eastern army and wait until I came up., But he was insubordinate; he stuck on some quibble of military etiquette about a second lieutenant giving orders to a colonel or something like that., And what was the consequence?, The Union was preserved., This is the first time I believe that that secret has ever been revealed., No one outside of the family circle, I think, knew it before; but there the facts are., Watterson saved the Union; yes, he saved the Union., And yet there he sits, and not a step has been taken or a movement made toward granting him a pension., That is the way things are done., It is a case where some blushing ought to be done., You ought to blush, and I ought to blush, and he--well, he's a little out of practice now., ""This is my last appearance on the paid platform., I shall not           retire from the gratis platform until I am buried, and courtesy           will compel me to keep still and not disturb the others., Now,           since I must, I shall say good-bye., I see many faces in this           audience well known to me., They are all my friends, and I feel           that those I don't know are my friends, too., I wish to           consider that you represent the nation, and  that in saying           good-bye to you I am saying good-bye to the nation., In the           great name of humanity, let me say this final word: I offer an           appeal in behalf of that vast, pathetic multitude of fathers,           mothers, and helpless little children., They were sheltered and           happy two days ago., Now they are wandering, forlorn, hopeless,           and homeless, the victims of a great disaster., So I beg of           you, I beg of you, to open your hearts and open your purses and           remember San Francisco, the smitten city."", I wish to deliver a historical address., I've been studying the history of---er--a--let me see--a [then he stopped in confusion, and walked over to Gen. Fred D.  Grant, who sat at the head of the platform., He leaned over an a whisper, and then returned to the front of the stage and continued]., Oh yes!, I've been studying Robert Fulton., I've been studying a biographical sketch of Robert Fulton, the inventor of--er--a --let's see--ah yes, the inventor of the electric telegraph and the Morse sewing--machine., Also, I understand he invented the air--diria--pshaw!, I have it at last--the dirigible balloon., Yes, the dirigible--but it is a difficult word, and I don't see why anybody should marry a couple of words like that when they don't want to be married at all and are likely to quarrel with each other all the time., I should put that couple of words under the ban of the United States Supreme Court, under its decision of a few days ago, and take 'em out and drown 'em., I used to know Fulton., It used to do me good to see him dashing through tile town on a wild broncho., And Fulton was born in---er--a--Well, it doesn't make much difference where he was born, does it?, I remember a man who came to interview me once, to get a sketch of my life., I consulted with a friend--a practical man--before he came, to know how I should treat him., ""Whenever you give the interviewer a fact,"" he said, ""give him another fact that will contradict it., Then he'll go away with a jumble that he can't use at all., Be gentle, be sweet, smile like an idiot--just be natural."", That's what my friend told me to do, and I did it., ""Where were you born?"", asked the interviewer., ""Well-er-a,"" I began, ""I was born in Alabama, or Alaska, or the Sandwich Islands; I don't know where, but right around there somewhere., And you had better put it down before you forget it."", ""But you weren't born in all those places,"" he said., ""Well, I've offered you three places., Take your choice., They're all at the same price."", ""How old are you?"", he asked., ""I shall be nineteen in June,"" I said., ""Why, there's such a discrepancy between your age and your looks,"" he said., ""Oh, that's nothing,"" I said, ""I was born discrepantly."", Then we got to talking about my brother Samuel, and he told me my explanations were confusing., ""I suppose he is dead,"" I said., ""Some said that he was dead and some said that he wasn't."", ""Did you bury him without knowing whether he was dead or not?"", asked the reporter., ""There was a mystery,"" said I., ""We were twins, and one day when we were two weeks old--that is, he was one week old, and I was one week old--we got mixed up in the bath-tub, and one of us drowned., We never could tell which., One of us had a strawberry birthmark on the back of his hand., There it is on my hand., This is the one that was drowned., There's no doubt about it., ...]",1
93,"[There, in his hansom cab, the invalid can go--the poor, sad child of misfortune--and insert his nose between the railings, and breathe the pure, health--giving air of the country and of heaven., And if he is a swell invalid, who isn't obliged to depend upon parks for his country air, he can drive inside--if he owns his vehicle., I drive round and round Hyde Park, and the more I see of the edges of it the more grateful I am that the margin is extensive., And I have been to the Zoological Gardens., What a wonderful place that is!, I never have seen such a curious and interesting variety of wild animals in any garden before--except ""Mabilie."", I never believed before there were so many different kinds of animals in the world as you can find there--and I don't believe it yet., I have been to the British Museum., I would advise you to drop in there some time when you have nothing to do for--five minutes--if you have never been there: It seems to me the noblest monument that this nation has yet erected to her greatness., I say to her, our greatness--as a nation., True, she has built other monuments, and stately ones, as well; but these she has uplifted in honor of two or three colossal demigods who have stalked across the world's stage, destroying tyrants and delivering nations, and whose prodigies will still live in the memories of men ages after their monuments shall have crumbled to dust--I refer to the Wellington and Nelson monuments, and--the Albert memorial., [Sarcasm., The Albert memorial is the finest monument in the world, and celebrates the existence of as commonplace a person as good luck ever lifted out of obscurity.], The library at the British Museum I find particularly astounding., I have read there hours together, and hardly made an impression on it., I revere that library., It is the author's friend., I don't care how mean a book is, it always takes one copy., [A copy of every book printed in Great Britain must by law be sent to the British Museum, a law much complained of by publishers.], And then every day that author goes there to gaze at that book, and is encouraged to go on in the good work., And what a touching sight it is of a Saturday afternoon to see the poor, careworn clergymen gathered together in that vast reading--room cabbaging sermons for Sunday., You will pardon my referring to these things., Everything in this monster city interests me, and I cannot keep from talking, even at the risk of being instructive., People here seem always to express distances by parables., To a stranger it is just a little confusing to be so parabolic--so to speak., I collar a citizen, and I think I am going to get some valuable information out of him., I ask him how far it is to Birmingham, and he says it is twenty-one shillings and sixpence., Now we know that doesn't help a man who is trying to learn., I find myself down-town somewhere, and I want to get some sort of idea where I am--being usually lost when alone--and I stop a citizen and say: ""How far is it to Charing Cross?"", ""Shilling fare in a cab,"" and off he goes., I suppose if I were to ask a Londoner how far it, is from the sublime to the ridiculous, he would try to express it in coin., But I am trespassing upon your time with these geological statistics and historical reflections., I will not longer keep you from your orgies., 'Tis a real pleasure for me to be here, and I thank you for it., The name of the Savage Club is associated in my mind with the kindly interest and the friendly offices which you lavished upon an old friend of mine who came among you a stranger, and you opened your English hearts to him and gave him welcome and a home--Artemus Ward., Asking that you will join me, I give you his memory., I feel exceedingly surreptitious in coming down here without an announcement of any kind., I do not want to see any advertisements around, for the reason that I'm not a lecturer any longer., I reformed long ago, and I break over and commit this sin only just one time this year: and that is moderate, I think, for a person of my disposition., It is not my purpose to lecture any more as long as I live., I never intend to stand up on a platform any more--unless by the request of a sheriff or something like that., First of all, no--second of all--I wish to offer my thanks for the honor done me by naming this last rose of summer of the Mississippi Valley for me, this boat which represents a perished interest, which I fortified long ago, but did not save its life., And, in the first place, I wish to thank the Countess de Rochambeau for the honor she has done me in presiding at this christening., I believe that it is peculiarly appropriate that I should be allowed the privilege of joining my voice with the general voice of St. Louis and Missouri in welcoming to the Mississippi Valley and this part of the continent these illustrious visitors from France., When La Salle came down this river a century and a quarter ago there was nothing on its banks but savages., He opened up this great river, and by his simple act was gathered in this great Louisiana territory., I would have done it myself for half the money., Well, if I made that joke, it is the best one I ever made, and it is in the prettiest language, too.--I never can get quite to that height., But I appreciate that joke, and I shall remember it--and I shall use it when occasion requires., I have had a great many birthdays in my time., I remember the first one very well, and I always think of it with indignation; everything was so crude, unaesthetic, primeval., Nothing like this at all., No proper appreciative preparation made; nothing really ready., Now, for a person born with high and delicate instincts--why, even the cradle wasn't whitewashed--nothing ready at all., I hadn't any hair, I hadn't any teeth, I hadn't any clothes, I had to go to my first banquet just like that., Well, everybody came swarming in., It was the merest little bit of a village--hardly that, just a little hamlet, in the backwoods of Missouri, where nothing ever happened, and the people were all interested, and they all came; they looked me over to see if there was anything fresh in my line., Why, nothing ever happened in that village --I--why, I was the only thing that had really happened there for months and months and months; and although I say it myself that shouldn't, I came the nearest to being a real event that had happened in that village in more than, two years., Well, those people came, they came with that curiosity which is so provincial, with that frankness which also is so provincial, and they examined me all around and gave their opinion., Nobody asked them, and I shouldn't have minded if anybody had paid me a compliment, but nobody did., Their opinions were all just green with prejudice, and I feel those opinions to this day., Well, I stood that as long as--well, you know I was born courteous, and I stood it to the limit., I stood it an hour, and then the worm turned., I was the warm; it was my turn to turn, and I turned., I knew very well the strength of my position; I knew that I was the only spotlessly pure and innocent person in that whole town, and I came out and said so: And they could not say a word., It was so true: They blushed; they were embarrassed., Well, that was the first after-dinner speech I ever made: I think it was after dinner., It's a long stretch between that first birthday speech and this one., That was my cradle-song; and this is my swan-song, I suppose., I am used to swan-songs; I have sung them several, times., This is my seventieth birthday, and I wonder if you all rise to the size of that proposition, realizing all the significance of that phrase, seventieth birthday., The seventieth birthday!, It is the time of life when you arrive at a new and awful dignity; when you may throw aside the decent reserves which have oppressed you for a generation and stand unafraid and unabashed upon your seven-terraced summit and look down and teach--unrebuked., You can tell the world how you got there., It is what they all do., You shall never get tired of telling by what delicate arts and deep moralities you climbed up to that great place., You will explain the process and dwell on the particulars with senile rapture., I have been anxious to explain my own system this long time, and now at last I have the right., I have achieved my seventy years in the usual way: by sticking strictly to a scheme of life which would kill anybody else., It sounds like an exaggeration, but that is really the common rule for attaining to old age., When we examine the programme of any of these garrulous old people we always find that the habits which have preserved them would have decayed us; that the way of life which enabled them to live upon the property of their heirs so long, as Mr. Choate says, would have put us out of commission ahead of time., I will offer here, as a sound maxim, this: That we can't reach old age by another man's road., I will now teach, offering my way of life to whomsoever desires to commit suicide by the scheme which has enabled me to beat the doctor and the hangman for seventy years., Some of the details may sound untrue, but they are not., I am not here to deceive; I am here to teach., We have no permanent habits until we are forty., Then they begin to harden, presently they petrify, then business begins., Since forty I have been regular about going to bed and getting up--and that is one of the main things., I have made it a rule to go to bed when there wasn't anybody left to sit up with; and I have made it a rule to get up when I had to., This has resulted in an unswerving regularity of irregularity., It has saved me sound, but it would injure another person., In the matter of diet--which is another main thing--I have been persistently strict in sticking to the things which didn't agree with me until one or the other of us got the best of it., Until lately I got the best of it myself., But last spring I stopped frolicking with mince-pie after midnight; up to then I had always believed it wasn't loaded., For thirty years I have taken coffee and bread at eight in the morning, and no bite nor sup until seven-thirty in the evening., Eleven hours., That is all right for me, and is wholesome, because I have never had a headache in my life, but headachy people would not reach seventy comfortably by that road, and they would be foolish to try it., And I wish to urge upon you this--which I think is wisdom--that if you find you can't make seventy by any but an uncomfortable road, don't you go., When they take off the Pullman and retire you to the rancid smoker, put on your things, count your checks, and get out at the first way station where there's a cemetery., I have made it a rule never to smoke more than one cigar at a time., ...]",1

Y., Weekly to you--no charge., I am not going to write for it., Like all other, papers that pay one splendidly it circulates among stupid people and the 'canaille.', I have made no arrangement with any New York paper--I will see about that Monday or Tuesday., Love to all  DEAR FOLKS, I suppose we shall be many a league at sea tomorrow night, and goodness knows I shall be unspeakably glad of it., I haven't got anything to write, else I would write it., I have just written myself clear out in letters to the Alta, and I think they are the stupidest letters that were ever written from New York., Corresponding has been a perfect drag ever since I got to the states., If it continues abroad, I don't know what the Tribune and Alta folks will think., I have withdrawn the Sandwich Island book--it would be useless to publish it in these dull publishing times., As for the Frog book, I don't believe that will ever pay anything worth a cent., I published it simply to advertise myself--not with the hope of making anything out of it., Well, I haven't anything to write, except that I am tired of staying in one place--that I am in a fever to get away., Read my Alta letters--they contain everything I could possibly write to you., Tell Zeb and John Leavenworth to write me., They can get plenty of gossip from the pilots., An importing house sent two cases of exquisite champagne aboard the ship for me today--Veuve Clicquot and Lac d'Or., I and my room-mate have set apart every Saturday as a solemn fast day, wherein we will entertain no light matters of frivolous conversation, but only get drunk., (That is a joke.), His mother and sisters are the best and most homelike people I have yet found in a brown stone front., There is no style about them, except in house and furniture., I wish Orion were going on this voyage, for I believe he could not help but be cheerful and jolly., I often wonder if his law business is going satisfactorily to him, but knowing that the dull season is setting in now (it looked like it had already set in before) I have felt as if I could almost answer the question myself--which is to say in plain words, I was afraid to ask., I wish I had gone to Washington in the winter instead of going West., I could have gouged an office out of Bill Stewart for him, and that would atone for the loss of my home visit., ...]",1
95,"[I wouldn't have wanted him there--his appalling energy would have been an insufferable reproach to mild adventurers like you and me., Well, he is welcome to the good time he had--I had a deal better one., My narrative has made Mrs. Clemens wish she could have been there.--When I think over what a splendid good sociable time I had in your house I feel ever so thankful to the wise providence that thwarted our several ably-planned and ingenious attempts to get to Lexington., I am coming again before long, and then she shall be of the party., Now you said that you and Mrs. Howells could run down here nearly any Saturday., Very well then, let us call it next Saturday, for a ""starter."", Can you do that?, By that time it will really be spring and you won't freeze., The birds are already out; a small one paid us a visit yesterday., We entertained it and let it go again, Susie protesting., The spring laziness is already upon me--insomuch that the spirit begins to move me to cease from Mississippi articles and everything else and give myself over to idleness until we go to New Orleans., I have one article already finished, but somehow it doesn't seem as proper a chapter to close with as the one already in your hands., I hope to get in a mood and rattle off a good one to finish with--but just now all my moods are lazy ones., Winnie's literature sings through me yet!, Surely that child has one of these ""futures"" before her., Now try to come--will you?, With the warmest regards of the two of us--                          Yrs ever,  MY DEAR HOWELLS,--An actor named D. H. Harkins has been here to ask me to put upon paper a 5-act play which he has been mapping out in his mind for 3 or 4 years., He sat down and told me his plot all through, in a clear, bright way, and I was a deal taken with it; but it is a line of characters whose fine shading and artistic development requires an abler hand than mine; so I easily perceived that I must not make the attempt., But I liked the man, and thought there was a good deal of stuff in him; and therefore I wanted his play to be written, and by a capable hand, too., So I suggested you, and said I would write and see if you would be willing to undertake it., If you like the idea, he will call upon you in the course of two or three weeks and describe his plot and his characters., Then if it doesn't strike you favorably, of course you can simply decline; but it seems to me well worth while that you should hear what he has to say., You could also ""average"" him while he talks, and judge whether he could play your priest--though I doubt if any man can do that justice., Shan't I write him and say he may call?, If you wish to communicate directly with him instead, his address is ""Larchmont Manor, Westchester Co., N., Y."", Do you know, the chill of that 19th of April seems to be in my bones yet?, I am inert and drowsy all the time., That was villainous weather for a couple of wandering children to be out in., Ys ever  Please do not use my name in any way., Please do not even divulge the fact that I own a machine., I have entirely stopped using the typewriter, for the reason that I never could write a letter with it to anybody without receiving a request by return mail that I would not only describe the machine, but state what progress I had made in the use of it, etc., etc., I don't like to write letters, and so I don't want people to know I own this curiosity-breeding little joker., MY DEAR HOWELLS,--I told Patrick to get some carpenters and box the machine and send it to you--and found that Bliss had sent for the machine and earned it off., I have been talking to you and writing to you as if you were present when I traded the machine to Bliss for a twelve-dollar saddle worth $25 (cheating him outrageously, of course--but conscience got the upper hand again and I told him before I left the premises that I'd pay for the saddle if he didn't like the machine--on condition that he donate said machine to a charity)  This was a little over five weeks ago--so I had long ago concluded that Bliss didn't want the machine and did want the saddle--wherefore I jumped at the chance of shoving the machine off onto you, saddle or no saddle so I got the blamed thing out of my sight., The saddle hangs on Tara's walls down below in the stable, and the machine is at Bliss's grimly pursuing its appointed mission, slowly and implacably rotting away another man's chances for salvation., I have sent Bliss word not to donate it to a charity (though it is a pity to fool away a chance to do a charity an ill turn,) but to let me know when he has got his dose, because I've got another candidate for damnation., You just wait a couple of weeks and if you don't see the Type-Writer come tilting along toward Cambridge with an unsatisfied appetite in its eye, I lose my guess., Don't you be mad about this blunder, Howells--it only comes of a bad memory, and the stupidity which is inseparable from true genius., Nothing intentionally criminal in it., MY DEAR HOWELLS,--I have finished the story and didn't take the chap beyond boyhood., I believe it would be fatal to do it in any shape but autobiographically--like Gil Blas., I perhaps made a mistake in not writing it in the first person., If I went on, now, and took him into manhood, he would just like like all the one-horse men in literature and the reader would conceive a hearty contempt for him., It is not a boy's book, at all., It will only be read by adults., It is only written for adults., Moreover the book is plenty long enough as it stands., It is about 900 pages of MS, and may be 1000 when I shall have finished ""working up"" vague places; so it would make from 130 to 150 pages of the Atlantic --about what the Foregone Conclusion made, isn't it?, I would dearly like to see it in the Atlantic, but I doubt if it would pay the publishers to buy the privilege, or me to sell it., Bret Harte has sold his novel (same size as mine, I should say) to Scribner's Monthly for $6,500 (publication to begin in September, I think,) and he gets a royalty of 7 1/2 per cent from Bliss in book form afterwards., He gets a royalty of ten per cent on it in England (issued in serial numbers) and the same royalty on it in book form afterwards, and is to receive an advance payment of five hundred pounds the day the first No., of the serial appears., If I could do as well, here, and there, with mine, it might possibly pay me, but I seriously doubt it though it is likely I could do better in England than Bret, who is not widely known there., You see I take a vile, mercenary view of things--but then my household expenses are something almost ghastly., By and by I shall take a boy of twelve and run him on through life (in the first person) but not Tom Sawyer--he would not be a good character for it., I wish you would promise to read the MS of Tom Sawyer some time, and see if you don't really decide that I am right in closing with him as a boy --and point out the most glaring defects for me., It is a tremendous favor to ask, and I expect you to refuse and would be ashamed to expect you to do otherwise., But the thing has been so many months in my mind that it seems a relief to snake it out., I don't know any other person whose judgment I could venture to take fully and entirely., Don't hesitate about saying no, for I know how your time is taxed, and I would have honest need to blush if you said yes., Osgood and I are ""going for"" the puppy G---- on infringement of trademark., To win one or two suits of this kind will set literary folks on a firmer bottom., I wish Osgood would sue for stealing Holmes's poem., Wouldn't it be gorgeous to sue R---- for petty larceny?, I will promise to go into court and swear I think him capable of stealing pea-nuts from a blind pedlar., Yrs ever,  MY DEAR HOWELLS,--Just as soon as you consented I realized all the atrocity of my request, and straightway blushed and weakened., I telegraphed my theatrical agent to come here and carry off the MS and copy it., But I will gladly send it to you if you will do as follows: dramatize it, if you perceive that you can, and take, for your remuneration, half of the first $6000 which I receive for its representation on the stage., You could alter the plot entirely, if you chose., I could help in the work, most cheerfully, after you had arranged the plot., I have my eye upon two young girls who can play ""Tom"" and ""Huck."", I believe a good deal of a drama can be made of it., Come--can't you tackle this in the odd hours of your vacation?, or later, if you prefer?, I do wish you could come down once more before your holiday., I'd give anything!, Yrs ever,  MY DEAR HOWELLS,--My plan is this--you are to get Mr. Lowell and Mr. Longfellow to be the first signers of my copyright petition; you must sign it yourself and get Mr. Whittier to do likewise., Then Holmes will sign--he said he would if he didn't have to stand at the head., Then I'm fixed., I will then put a gentlemanly chap under wages and send him personally to every author of distinction in the country, and corral the rest of the signatures., Then I'll have the whole thing lithographed (about a thousand copies) and move upon the President and Congress in person, but in the subordinate capacity of a party who is merely the agent of better and wiser men--men whom the country cannot venture to laugh at., I will ask the President to recommend the thing in his message (and if he should ask me to sit down and frame the paragraph for him I should blush --but still I would frame it.), Next I would get a prime leader in Congress: I would also see that votes enough to carry the measure were privately secured before the bill was offered., This I would try through my leader and my friends there., And then if Europe chose to go on stealing from us, we would say with noble enthusiasm, ""American lawmakers do steal but not from foreign authors--Not from foreign authors!"", You see, what I want to drive into the Congressional mind is the simple fact that the moral law is ""Thou shalt not steal""--no matter what Europe may do., I swear I can't see any use in robbing European authors for the benefit of American booksellers, anyway., If we can ever get this thing through Congress, we can try making copyright perpetual, some day., There would be no sort of use in it, since only one book in a hundred millions outlives the present copyright term--no sort of use except that the writer of that one book have his rights--which is something., If we only had some God in the country's laws, instead of being in such a sweat to get Him into the Constitution, it would be better all around., The only man who ever signed my petition with alacrity, and said that the fact that a thing was right was all-sufficient, was Rev., Dr. Bushnell., I have lost my old petition, (which was brief) but will draft and enclose another--not in the words it ought to be, but in the substance., I want Mr. Lowell to furnish the words (and the ideas too,) if he will do it., Say--Redpath beseeches me to lecture in Boston in November--telegraphs that Beecher's and Nast's withdrawal has put him in the tightest kind of a place., So I guess I'll do that old ""Roughing It"" lecture over again in November and repeat it 2 or 3 times in New York while I am at it., Can I take a carriage after the lecture and go out and stay with you that night, provided you find at that distant time that it will not inconvenience you?, Is Aldrich home yet?, With love to you all                                         Yrs ever,  MY DEAR HOWELLS,--That is a perfectly superb notice., ...]",1
96,"[It was dreadfully conspicuous., The General said a word or so--I replied, and then said, ""But I'll step back, General, I don't want to interrupt your speech."", ""But I'm not going to make any--stay where you are--I'll get you to make it for me."", General Sherman came on the platform wearing the uniform of a full General, and you should have heard the cheers., Gen. Logan was going to introduce me, but I didn't want any more conspicuousness., When the head of the procession passed it was grand to see Sheridan, in his military cloak and his plumed chapeau, sitting as erect and rigid as a statue on his immense black horse--by far the most martial figure I ever saw., And the crowd roared again., It was chilly, and Gen. Deems lent me his overcoat until night., He came a few minutes ago--5.45 P.M., and got it, but brought Gen. Willard, who lent me his for the rest of my stay, and will get another for himself when he goes home to dinner., Mine is much too heavy for this warm weather., I have a seat on the stage at Haverley's Theatre, tonight, where the Army of the Tennessee will receive Gen. Grant, and where Gen. Sherman will make a speech., At midnight I am to attend a meeting of the Owl Club., I love you ever so much, my darling, and am hoping to get a word from you yet., Livy darling, it was a great time., There were perhaps thirty people on the stage of the theatre, and I think I never sat elbow-to-elbow with so many historic names before., Grant, Sherman, Sheridan, Schofield, Pope, Logan, Augur, and so on., What an iron man Grant is!, He sat facing the house, with his right leg crossed over his left and his right boot-sole tilted up at an angle, and his left hand and arm reposing on the arm of his chair--you note that position?, Well, when glowing references were made to other grandees on the stage, those grandees always showed a trifle of nervous consciousness--and as these references came frequently, the nervous change of position and attitude were also frequent., But Grant!--he was under a tremendous and ceaseless bombardment of praise and gratulation, but as true as I'm sitting here he never moved a muscle of his body for a single instant, during 30 minutes!, You could have played him on a stranger for an effigy., Perhaps he never would have moved, but at last a speaker made such a particularly ripping and blood-stirring remark about him that the audience rose and roared and yelled and stamped and clapped an entire minute--Grant sitting as serene as ever--when Gen. Sherman stepped to him, laid his hand affectionately on his shoulder, bent respectfully down and whispered in his ear., Gen. Grant got up and bowed, and the storm of applause swelled into a hurricane., He sat down, took about the same position and froze to it till by and by there was another of those deafening and protracted roars, when Sherman made him get up and bow again., He broke up his attitude once more--the extent of something more than a hair's breadth--to indicate me to Sherman when the house was keeping up a determined and persistent call for me, and poor bewildered Sherman, (who did not know me), was peering abroad over the packed audience for me, not knowing I was only three feet from him and most conspicuously located, (Gen. Sherman was Chairman.), One of the most illustrious individuals on that stage was ""Ole Abe,"" the historic war eagle., He stood on his perch--the old savage-eyed rascal --three or four feet behind Gen. Sherman, and as he had been in nearly every battle that was mentioned by the orators his soul was probably stirred pretty often, though he was too proud to let on., Read Logan's bosh, and try to imagine a burly and magnificent Indian, in General's uniform, striking a heroic attitude and getting that stuff off in the style of a declaiming school-boy., Please put the enclosed scraps in the drawer and I will scrap-book them., I only staid at the Owl Club till 3 this morning and drank little or nothing., Went to sleep without whisky., Ich liebe dish., I've just come to my room, Livy darling, I guess this was the memorable night of my life., By George, I never was so stirred since I was born., I heard four speeches which I can never forget., One by Emory Storrs, one by Gen. Vilas (O, wasn't it wonderful!), one by Gen. Logan (mighty stirring), one by somebody whose name escapes me, and one by that splendid old soul, Col. Bob Ingersoll,--oh, it was just the supremest combination of English words that was ever put together since the world began., My soul, how handsome he looked, as he stood on that table, in the midst of those 500 shouting men, and poured the molten silver from his lips!, Lord, what an organ is human speech when it is played by a master!, All these speeches may look dull in print, but how the lightning glared around them when they were uttered, and how the crowd roared in response!, It was a great night, a memorable night., I am so richly repaid for my journey--and how I did wish with all my whole heart that you were there to be lifted into the very seventh heaven of enthusiasm, as I was., The army songs, the military music, the crashing applause --Lord bless me, it was unspeakable., Out of compliment they placed me last in the list--No., 15--I was to ""hold the crowd""--and bless my life I was in awful terror when No., 14. rose, at a o'clock this morning and killed all the enthusiasm by delivering the flattest, insipidest, silliest of all responses to ""Woman"" that ever a weary multitude listened to., Then Gen. Sherman (Chairman) announced my toast, and the crowd gave me a good round of applause as I mounted on top of the dinner table, but it was only on account of my name, nothing more --they were all tired and wretched., They let my first sentence go in., silence, till I paused and added ""we stand on common ground""--then they burst forth like a hurricane and I saw that I had them!, From that time on, I stopped at the end of each sentence, and let the tornado of applause and laughter sweep around me--and when I closed with ""And if the child is but the prophecy of the man, there are mighty few who will doubt that he succeeded,"" I say it who oughtn't to say it, the house came down with a crash., For two hours and a half, now, I've been shaking hands and listening to congratulations., Gen. Sherman said, ""Lord bless you, my boy, I don't know how you do it--it's a secret that's beyond me--but it was great--give me your hand again."", And do you know, Gen. Grant sat through fourteen speeches like a graven image, but I fetched him!, I broke him up, utterly!, He told me he laughed till the tears came and every bone in his body ached., (And do you know, the biggest part of the success of the speech lay in the fact that the audience saw that for once in his life he had been knocked out of his iron serenity.), Bless your soul, 'twas immense., I never was so proud in my life., Lots and lots of people--hundreds I might say--told me my speech was the triumph of the evening--which was a lie., Ladies, Tom, Dick and Harry --even the policemen--captured me in the halls and shook hands, and scores of army officers said ""We shall always be grateful to you for coming."", General Pope came to bunt me up--I was afraid to speak to him on that theatre stage last night, thinking it might be presumptuous to tackle a man so high up in military history., Gen. Schofield, and other historic men, paid their compliments., Sheridan was ill and could not come, but I'm to go with a General of his staff and see him before I go to Col. Grant's., Gen. Augur--well, I've talked with them all, received invitations from them all--from people living everywhere--and as I said before, it's a memorable night., I wouldn't have missed it for anything in the world., But my sakes, you should have heard Ingersoll's speech on that table!, Half an hour ago he ran across me in the crowded halls and put his arms about me and said ""Mark, if I live a hundred years, I'll always be grateful for your speech--Lord what a supreme thing it was."", But I told him it wasn't any use to talk, he had walked off with the honors of that occasion by something of a majority., Bully boy is Ingersoll--traveled with him in the cars the other day, and you can make up your mind we had a good time., Of course I forgot to go and pay for my hotel car and so secure it, but the army officers told me an hour ago to rest easy, they would go at once, at this unholy hour of the night and compel the railways to do their duty by me, and said ""You don't need to request the Army of the Tennessee to do your desires--you can command its services."", Well, I bummed around that banquet hall from 8 in the evening till 2 in the morning, talking with people and listening to speeches, and I never ate a single bite or took a sup of anything but ice water, so if I seem excited now, it is the intoxication of supreme enthusiasm., By George, it was a grand night, a historical night., And now it is a quarter past 6 A.M.--so good bye and God bless you and the Bays,--[Family word for babies]--my darlings  Show it to Joe if you want to--I saw some of his friends here., MY DEAR INGERSOLL,--Thank you most heartily for the books--I am devouring them--they have found a hungry place, and they content it and satisfy it to a miracle., I wish I could hear you speak these splendid chapters before a great audience--to read them by myself and hear the boom of the applause only in the ear of my imagination, leaves a something wanting --and there is also a still greater lack, your manner, and voice, and presence., The Chicago speech arrived an hour too late, but I was all right anyway, for I found that my memory had been able to correct all the errors., I read it to the Saturday Club (of young girls) and told them to remember that it was doubtful if its superior existed in our language., Truly Yours,  MY DEAR HOWELLS,--If anybody talks, there, I shall claim the right to say a word myself, and be heard among the very earliest--else it would be confoundedly awkward for me--and for the rest, too., But you may read what I say, beforehand, and strike out whatever you choose., Of course I thought it wisest not to be there at all; but Warner took the opposite view, and most strenuously., Speaking of Johnny's conclusion to become an outlaw, reminds me of Susie's newest and very earnest longing--to have crooked teeth and glasses--""like Mamma."", I would like to look into a child's head, once, and see what its processes are., Yrs ever,  MY DEAR HOWELLS,--Am waiting for Patrick to come with the carriage., Mrs. Clemens and I are starting (without the children) to stay indefinitely in Elmira., The wear and tear of settling the house broke her down, and she has been growing weaker and weaker for a fortnight., All that time--in fact ever since I saw you--I have been fighting a life-and-death battle with this infernal book and hoping to get done some day., I required 300 pages of MS, and I have written near 600 since I saw you--and tore it all up except 288., This I was about to tear up yesterday and begin again, when Mrs. Perkins came up to the billiard room and said, ""You will never get any woman to do the thing necessary to save her life by mere persuasion; you see you have wasted your words for three weeks; it is time to use force; she must have a change; take her home and leave the children here."", I said, ""If there is one death that is painfuller than another, may I get it if I don't do that thing."", So I took the 288 pages to Bliss and told him that was the very last line I should ever write on this book., (A book which required 2600 pages of MS, and I have written nearer four thousand, first and last.), I am as soary (and flighty) as a rocket, to-day, with the unutterable joy of getting that Old Man of the Sea off my back, where he has been roosting for more than a year and a half., Next time I make a contract before writing the book, may I suffer the righteous penalty and be burnt, like the injudicious believer., I am mighty glad you are done your book (this is from a man who, above all others, feels how much that sentence means) and am also mighty glad you have begun the next (this is also from a man who knows the felicity of that, and means straightway to enjoy it.), The Undiscovered starts off delightfully--I have read it aloud to Mrs. C. and we vastly enjoyed it., Well, time's about up--must drop a line to Aldrich., Yrs ever,  MY DEAR HOWELLS,--.....I take so much pleasure in my story that I am loth to hurry, not wanting to get it done., Did I ever tell you the plot of it?, It begins at 9 a.m., Jan. 27, 1547, seventeen and a half hours before Henry VIII's death, by the swapping of clothes and place, between the prince of Wales and a pauper boy of the same age and countenance (and half as much learning and still more genius and imagination) and after that, the rightful small King has a rough time among tramps and ruffians in the country parts of Kent, whilst the small bogus King has a gilded and worshipped and dreary and restrained and cussed time of it on the throne--and this all goes on for three weeks--till the midst of the coronation grandeurs in Westminster Abbey, Feb. 20, when the ragged true King forces his way in but cannot prove his genuineness--until the bogus King, by a remembered incident of the first day is able to prove it for him--whereupon clothes are changed and the coronation proceeds under the new and rightful conditions., My idea is to afford a realizing sense of the exceeding severity of the laws of that day by inflicting some of their penalties upon the King himself and allowing him a chance to see the rest of them applied to others--all of which is to account for certain mildnesses which distinguished Edward VI's reign from those that preceded and followed it., ...]",1
97,"[I mean to go to Hot Springs myself and get 30 or 40 years knocked off my age., It's manifestly the place that Ponce de Leon was striking for, but the poor fellow lost the trail., Possibly I may see you, for I shall be in St. Louis a day or two in November., I propose to go down the river and ""note the changes"" once more before I make the long crossing, and perhaps you can come there., Will you?, I want to see all the boys that are left alive., And so Grant Marsh, too, is flourishing yet?, A mighty good fellow, and smart too., When we were taking that wood flat down to the Chambers, which was aground, I soon saw that I was a perfect lubber at piloting such a thing., I saw that I could never hit the Chambers with it, so I resigned in Marsh's favor, and he accomplished the task to my admiration., We should all have gone to the mischief if I had remained in authority., I always had good judgement, more judgement than talent, in fact., No; the nom de plume did not originate in that way., Capt., Sellers used the signature, ""Mark Twain,"" himself, when he used to write up the antiquities in the way of river reminiscences for the New Orleans Picayune., He hated me for burlesquing them in an article in the True Delta; so four years later when he died, I robbed the corpse--that is I confiscated the nom de plume., I have published this vital fact 3,000 times now., But no matter, it is good practice; it is about the only fact that I can tell the same way every time., Very glad, indeed, to hear from you Major, and shall be gladder still to see you in November., MY DEAR SIR,--I found your letter an hour ago among some others which had lain forgotten a couple of weeks, and I at once stole time enough to read Ariadne., Stole is the right word, for the summer ""Vacation"" is the only chance I get for work; so, no minute subtracted from work is borrowed, it is stolen., But this time I do not repent., As a rule, people don't send me books which I can thank them for, and so I say nothing--which looks uncourteous., But I thank you., Ariadne is a beautiful and satisfying story; and true, too--which is the best part of a story; or indeed of any other thing., Even liars have to admit that, if they are intelligent liars; I mean in their private [the word conscientious written but erased] intervals., (I struck that word out because a man's private thought can never be a lie; what he thinks, is to him the truth, always; what he speaks--but these be platitudes.), If you want me to pick some flaws--very well--but I do it unwillingly., I notice one thing--which one may notice also in my books, and in all books whether written by man or God: trifling carelessness of statement or Expression., If I think that you meant that she took the lizard from the water which she had drawn from the well, it is evidence--it is almost proof--that your words were not as clear as they should have been., True, it is only a trifling thing; but so is mist on a mirror., I would have hung the pail on Ariadne's arm., You did not deceive me when you said that she carried it under her arm, for I knew she didn't; still it was not your right to mar my enjoyment of the graceful picture., If the pail had been a portfolio, I wouldn't be making these remarks., The engraver of a fine picture revises, and revises, and revises--and then revises, and revises, and revises; and then repeats., And always the charm of that picture grows, under his hand., It was good enough before--told its story, and was beautiful., True: and a lovely girl is lovely, with freckles; but she isn't at her level best with them., This is not hypercriticism; you have had training enough to know that., So much concerning exactness of statement., In that other not-small matter--selection of the exact single word--you are hard to catch., Still, I should hold that Mrs. Walker considered that there was no occasion for concealment; that ""motive"" implied a deeper mental search than she expended on the matter; that it doesn't reflect the attitude of her mind with precision., Is this hypercriticism?, I shan't dispute it., I only say, that if Mrs. Walker didn't go so far as to have a motive, I had to suggest that when a word is so near the right one that a body can't quite tell whether it is or isn't, it's good politics to strike it out and go for the Thesaurus., That's all., Motive may stand; but you have allowed a snake to scream, and I will not concede that that was the best word., I do not apologize for saying these things, for they are not said in the speck-hunting spirit, but in the spirit of want-to-help-if-I-can., They would be useful to me if said to me once a month, they may be useful to you, said once., I save the other stories for my real vacation--which is nine months long, to my sorrow., I thank you again., Truly Yours  Saturday 29th, by a closely calculated estimate, there were 85 days' work to do on the machine., We can use 4 men, but not constantly., If they could work constantly it would complete the machine in 21 days, of course., They will all be on hand and under wages, and each will get in all the work there is opportunity for, but by how much they can reduce the 85 days toward the 21 days, nobody can tell., To-day I pay Pratt & Whitney $10,000., This squares back indebtedness and everything to date., They began about May or April or March 1886--along there somewhere, and have always kept from a dozen to two dozen master-hands on the machine., That outgo is done; 4 men for a month or two will close up that leak and caulk it., Work on the patents is also kind of drawing toward a conclusion., Love to you both., All well here., And give our love to Ma if she can get the idea., DEAR THEO,--I am here in Twichell's house at work, with the noise of the children and an army of carpenters to help., Of course they don't help, but neither do they hinder., It's like a boiler-factory for racket, and in nailing a wooden ceiling onto the room under me the hammering tickles my feet amazingly sometimes, and jars my table a good deal; but I never am conscious of the racket at all, and I move my feet into position of relief without knowing when I do it., I began here Monday morning, and have done eighty pages since., I was so tired last night that I thought I would lie abed and rest, to-day; but I couldn't resist., I mean to try to knock off tomorrow, but it's doubtful if I do., I want to finish the day the machine finishes, and a week ago the closest calculations for that indicated Oct. 22--but experience teaches me that their calculations will miss fire, as usual., The other day the children were projecting a purchase, Livy and I to furnish the money--a dollar and a half., Jean discouraged the idea., She said: ""We haven't got any money., Children, if you would think, you would remember the machine isn't done."", It's billiards to-night., I wish you were here., With love to you both  P. S.

S.  Don't imagine that I have lost my temper, because I swear., I swear all day, but I do not lose my temper., ...]",1

ROGERS,--I find the Madam ever so much better in health and strength., The air is superb and soothing and wholesome, and the Chalet is remote from noise and people, and just the place to write in., I shall begin work this afternoon., Mrs. Clemens is in great spirits on, account of the benefit which she has received from the electrical treatment in Paris and is bound to take it up again and continue it all the winter, and of course I am perfectly willing., She requires me to drop the lecture platform out of my mind and go straight ahead with Joan until the book is finished., If I should have to go home for even a week she means to go with me--won't consent to be separated again--but she hopes I won't need to go., I tell her all right, ""I won't go unless you send, and then I must."", She keeps the accounts; and as she ciphers it we can't get crowded for money for eight months yet., I didn't know that., But I don't know much anyway., Sincerely yours,  DEAR MR. ROGERS, I drove the quill too hard, and I broke down--in my head., It has now been three days since I laid up., When I wrote you a week ago I had added 10,000 words or thereabout to Joan., Next day I added 1,500 which was a proper enough day's work though not a full one; but during Tuesday and Wednesday I stacked up an aggregate of 6,000 words--and that was a very large mistake., My head hasn't been worth a cent since., However, there's a compensation; for in those two days I reached and passed--successfully--a point which I was solicitous about before I ever began the book: viz., the battle of Patay., Because that would naturally be the next to the last chapter of a work consisting of either two books or one., In the one case one goes right along from that point (as I shall do now); in the other he would add a wind-up chapter and make the book consist of Joan's childhood and military career alone., I shall resume work to-day; and hereafter I will not go at such an intemperate' rate., My head is pretty cobwebby yet., I am hoping that along about this time I shall hear that the machine is beginning its test in the Herald office., I shall be very glad indeed to know the result of it., I wish I could be there., Sincerely yours  DEAR MR. ROGERS,--I seemed to be entirely expecting your letter, and also prepared and resigned; but Lord, it shows how little we know ourselves and how easily we can deceive ourselves., It hit me like a thunder-clap., It knocked every rag of sense out of my head, and I went flying here and there and yonder, not knowing what I was doing, and only one clearly defined thought standing up visible and substantial out of the crazy storm-drift that my dream of ten years was in desperate peril, and out of the 60,000 or 90,000 projects for its rescue that came floating through my skull, not one would hold still long enough for me to examine it and size it up., Have you ever been like that?, Not so much so, I reckon., There was another clearly defined idea--I must be there and see it die., That is, if it must die; and maybe if I were there we might hatch up some next-to-impossible way to make it take up its bed and take a walk., So, at the end of four hours I started, still whirling and walked over to the rue Scribe--4 P. M.--and asked a question or two and was told I should be running a big risk if I took the 9 P. M.  train for London and Southampton; ""better come right along at 6.52 per Havre special and step aboard the New York all easy and comfortable."", Very!, and I about two miles from home, with no packing done., Then it occurred to me that none of these salvation-notions that were whirl-winding through my head could be examined or made available unless at least a month's time could be secured., So I cabled you, and said to myself that I would take the French steamer tomorrow (which will be Sunday)., By bedtime Mrs. Clemens had reasoned me into a fairly rational and contented state of mind; but of course it didn't last long., So I went on thinking--mixing it with a smoke in the dressing room once an hour--until dawn this morning., Result--a sane resolution; no matter what your answer to my cable might be, I would hold still and not sail until I should get an answer to this present letter which I am now writing, or a cable answer from you saying ""Come"" or ""Remain."", I have slept 6 hours, my pond has clarified, and I find the sediment of my 70,000 projects to be of this character:  Don't say I'm wild., For really I'm sane again this morning., I am going right along with Joan, now, and wait untroubled till I hear from you., If you think I can be of the least use, cable me ""Come."", I can write Joan on board ship and lose no time., Also I could discuss my plan with the publisher for a deluxe Joan, time being an object, for some of the pictures could be made over here cheaply and quickly, but would cost much time and money in America., If the meeting should decide to quit business Jan. 4, I'd like to have Stoker stopped from paying in any more money, if Miss Harrison doesn't mind that disagreeable job., And I'll have to write them, too, of course., With love,  DEAR MR. ROGERS,--Notwithstanding your heart is ""old and hard,"" you make a body choke up., I know you ""mean every word you say"" and I do take it ""in the same spirit in which you tender it."", I shall keep your regard while we two live--that I know; for I shall always remember what you have done for me, and that will insure me against ever doing anything that could forfeit it or impair it., I am 59 years old; yet I never had a friend before who put out a hand and tried to pull me ashore when he found me in deep waters., It is six days or seven days ago that I lived through that despairing day, and then through a night without sleep; then settled down next day into my right mind (or thereabouts,) and wrote you., I put in the rest of that day till 7 P. M.  plenty comfortably enough writing a long chapter of my book; then went to a masked ball blacked up as Uncle Remus, taking Clara along; and we had a good time., I have lost no day since and suffered no discomfort to speak of, but drove my troubles out of my mind and had good success in keeping them out--through watchfulness., I have done a good week's work and put the book a good way ahead in the Great Trial, which is the difficult part which requires the most thought and carefulness., I cannot see the end of the Trial yet, but I am on the road., I am creeping surely toward it., ""Why not leave them all to me."", My business bothers?, I take you by the hand!, I jump at the chance!, I ought to be ashamed and I am trying my best to be ashamed--and yet I do jump at the chance in spite of it., I don't want to write Irving and I don't want to write Stoker., It doesn't seem as if I could., But I can suggest something for you to write them; and then if you see that I am unwise, you can write them something quite different., Now this is my idea:       1., To return Stoker's $100 to him and keep his stock., 2., And tell Irving that when luck turns with me I will make good to      him what the salvage from the dead Co. fails to pay him of his $500., P.

grateful to see it grow., Some of that gold comes, like yourself, in a sealed package, and I can't see it and may never have the happiness; but I know its value without that, and by what sum it increases my wealth., I have a Club, a private Club, which is all my own., I appoint the Members myself, and they can't help themselves, because I don't allow them to vote on their own appointment and I don't allow them to resign!, They are all friends whom I have never seen (save one), but who have written friendly letters to me., By the laws of my Club there can be only one Member in each country, and there can be no male Member but myself., Some day I may admit males, but I don't know--they are capricious and inharmonious, and their ways provoke me a good deal., It is a matter which the Club shall decide., I have made four appointments in the past three or four months: You as Member for France, a young Highland girl as Member for Scotland, a Mohammedan girl as Member for Bengal, and a dear and bright young niece of mine as Member for the United States--for I do not represent a country myself, but am merely Member at Large for the Human Race., You must not try to resign, for the laws of the Club do not allow that., You must console yourself by remembering that you are in the best of company; that nobody knows of your membership except myself--that no Member knows another's name, but only her country; that no taxes are levied and no meetings held (but how dearly I should like to attend one!)., One of my Members is a Princess of a royal house, another is the daughter of a village book-seller on the continent of Europe., For the only qualification for Membership is intellect and the spirit of good will; other distinctions, hereditary or acquired, do not count., May I send you the Constitution and Laws of the Club?, I shall be so pleased if I may., It is a document which one of my daughters typewrites for me when I need one for a new Member, and she would give her eyebrows to know what it is all about, but I strangle her curiosity by saying: ""There are much cheaper typewriters than you are, my dear, and if you try to pry into the sacred mysteries of this Club one of your prosperities will perish sure."", My favorite?, It is ""Joan of Arc."", My next is ""Huckleberry Finn,"" but the family's next is ""The Prince and the Pauper."",

Jonathan in his insane debauch; rose immediately refreshed and fine at 10 this morning, but with a strange and haunting sense of having been on a three days' tear with a drunken lunatic., It is years since I have known these sensations., All through the book is the glaze of a resplendent intellect gone mad--a marvelous spectacle., No, not all through the book--the drunk does not come on till the last third, where what I take to be Calvinism and its God begins to show up and shine red and hideous in the glow from the fires of hell, their only right and proper adornment., By God I was ashamed to be in such company., Jonathan seems to hold (as against the Arminian position) that the Man (or his Soul or his Will) never creates an impulse itself, but is moved to action by an impulse back of it., That's sound!, Also, that of two or more things offered it, it infallibly chooses the one which for the moment is most pleasing to ITSELF., Perfectly correct!, An immense admission for a man not otherwise sane., Up to that point he could have written chapters III and IV of my suppressed ""Gospel."", But there we seem to separate., He seems to concede the indisputable and unshakable dominion of Motive and Necessity (call them what he may, these are exterior forces and not under the man's authority, guidance or even suggestion)--then he suddenly flies the logic track and (to all seeming) makes the man and not these exterior forces responsible to God for the man's thoughts, words and acts., It is frank insanity., I think that when he concedes the autocratic dominion of Motive and Necessity he grants, a third position of mine--that a man's mind is a mere machine--an automatic machine--which is handled entirely from the outside, the man himself furnishing it absolutely nothing: not an ounce of its fuel, and not so much as a bare suggestion to that exterior engineer as to what the machine shall do, nor how it shall do it nor when., After that concession, it was time for him to get alarmed and shirk--for he was pointing straight for the only rational and possible next-station on that piece of road the irresponsibility of man to God., And so he shirked., Shirked, and arrived at this handsome result:  Man is commanded to do so-and-so., It has been ordained from the beginning of time that some men shan't and others can't., These are to be blamed: let them be damned., I enjoy the Colonel very much, and shall enjoy the rest of him with an obscene delight., Joe, the whole tribe shout love to you and yours!, DEAR JOE,--I am lost in reverence and admiration!, It is now twenty-four hours that I have been trying to cool down and contemplate with quiet blood this extraordinary spectacle of energy, industry, perseverance, pluck, analytical genius, penetration, this irruption of thunders and fiery splendors from a fair and flowery mountain that nobody had supposed was a sleeping volcano, but I seem to be as excited as ever., Yesterday I read as much as half of the book, not understanding a word but enchanted nevertheless--partly by the wonder of it all, the study, the erudition, the incredible labor, the modesty, the dignity, the majestic exclusiveness of the field and its lofty remoteness from things and contacts sordid and mean and earthy, and partly by the grace and beauty and limpidity of the book's unsurpassable English., Science, always great and worshipful, goes often in hodden grey, but you have clothed her in garments meet for her high degree., You think you get ""poor pay"" for your twenty years?, No, oh no., You have lived in a paradise of the intellect whose lightest joys were beyond the reach of the longest purse in Christendom, you have had daily and nightly emancipation from the world's slaveries and gross interests, you have received a bigger wage than any man in the land, you have dreamed a splendid dream and had it come true, and to-day you could not afford to trade fortunes with anybody--not even with another scientist, for he must divide his spoil with his guild, whereas essentially the world you have discovered is your own and must remain so., It is all just magnificent, Joe!, And no one is prouder or gladder than                Yours always                                 DEAR SIR,--I desire to make a complaint, and I bring it to you, the head of the company, because by experience I know better than to carry it to a subordinate., I have been here a month and a half, and by testimony of friends, reinforced by personal experience I now feel qualified to claim as an established fact that the telegraphic service here is the worst in the world except that Boston., These services are actually slower than was the New York and Hartford service in the days when I last complained to you--which was fifteen or eighteen years ago, when telegraphic time and train time between the mentioned points was exactly the same, to-wit, three hours and a half., Six days ago--it was that raw day which provoked so much comment--my daughter was on her way up from New York, and at noon she telegraphed me from New Haven asking that I meet her with a cloak at Portsmouth., Her telegram reached me four hours and a quarter later--just 15 minutes too late for me to catch my train and meet her., I judge that the telegram traveled about 200 miles., It is the best telegraphic work I have seen since I have been here, and I am mentioning it in this place not as a complaint but as a compliment., I think a compliment ought always to precede a complaint, where one is possible, because it softens resentment and insures for the complaint a courteous and gentle reception., Still, there is a detail or two connected with this matter which ought perhaps to be mentioned., And now, having smoothed the way with the compliment, I will venture them., The head corpse in the York Harbor office sent me that telegram altho (1) he knew it would reach me too late to be of any value; (2) also, that he was going to send it to me by his boy; (3) that the boy would not take the trolley and come the 2 miles in 12 minutes, but would walk; (4) that he would be two hours and a quarter on the road; (5) and that he would collect 25 cents for transportation, for a telegram which the he knew to be worthless before he started it., From these data I infer that the Western Union owes me 75 cents; that is to say, the amount paid for combined wire and land transportation --a recoup provided for in the printed paragraph which heads the telegraph-blank., By these humane and Christian stages we now arrive at the complaint proper., We have had a grave case of illness in the family, and a relative was coming some six hundred miles to help in the sick-room during the convalescing period., It was an anxious time, of course, and I wrote and asked to be notified as to the hour of the expected arrival of this relative in Boston or in York Harbor., Being afraid of the telegraph--which I think ought not to be used in times of hurry and emergency--I asked that the desired message be brought to me by some swift method of transportation., By the milkman, if he was coming this way., But there are always people who think they know more than you do, especially young people; so of course the young fellow in charge of this lady used the telegraph., And at Boston, of all places!, Except York Harbor., The result was as usual; let me employ a statelier and exacter term, and say, historical., The dispatch was handed to the h. c. of the Boston office at 9 this morning., It said, ""Shall bring A. S. to you eleven forty-five this morning."", The distance traveled by the dispatch is forty or fifty miles, I suppose, as the train-time is five minutes short of two hours, and the trains are so slow that they can't give a W.

Hazen, all of Redding, these trustees to form a building Committee to decide on the size and plan of the building needed and to arrange for and supervise the work in such a manner that the fund shall amply provide for the building complete, with necessary furnishings, leaving, if possible, a balance remaining, sufficient for such repairs and additional furnishings as may be required for two years from the time of completion., Will you please draw a document covering these requirements and have it ready by the time I reach New York (April 14th)., Very sincerely,                                           ]",1
101,"[LE JARDIN., The lily?s withered chalice falls
      Around its rod of dusty gold,
      And from the beech trees on the wold
    The last wood-pigeon coos and calls., The gaudy leonine sunflower
      Hangs black and barren on its stalk,
      And down the windy garden walk
    The dead leaves scatter,--hour by hour., Pale privet-petals white as milk
      Are blown into a snowy mass;
      The roses lie upon the grass,
    Like little shreds of crimson silk., LA MER., A white mist drifts across the shrouds,
      A wild moon in this wintry sky
      Gleams like an angry lion?s eye
    Out of a mane of tawny clouds., The muffled steersman at the wheel
      Is but a shadow in the gloom;--
      And in the throbbing engine room
    Leap the long rods of polished steel., The shattered storm has left its trace
      Upon this huge and heaving dome,
      For the thin threads of yellow foam
    Float on the waves like ravelled lace., I fear I cannot picture America as altogether an Elysium--perhaps, from
the ordinary standpoint I know but little about the country., I cannot
give its latitude or longitude; I cannot compute the value of its dry
goods, and I have no very close acquaintance with its politics., These
are matters which may not interest you, and they certainly are not
interesting to me., The first thing that struck me on landing in America was that if the
Americans are not the most well-dressed people in the world, they are
the most comfortably dressed., Men are seen there with the dreadful
chimney-pot hat, but there are very few hatless men; men wear the
shocking swallow-tail coat, but few are to be seen with no coat at all., There is an air of comfort in the appearance of the people which is a
marked contrast to that seen in this country, where, too often, people
are seen in close contact with rags., The next thing particularly noticeable is that everybody seems in a
hurry to catch a train., This is a state of things which is not
favourable to poetry or romance., Had Romeo or Juliet been in a constant
state of anxiety about trains, or had their minds been agitated by the
question of return-tickets, Shakespeare could not have given us those
lovely balcony scenes which are so full of poetry and pathos., America is the noisiest country that ever existed., One is waked up in
the morning, not by the singing of the nightingale, but by the steam
whistle., It is surprising that the sound practical sense of the
Americans does not reduce this intolerable noise., All Art depends upon
exquisite and delicate sensibility, and such continual turmoil must
ultimately be destructive of the musical faculty., There is not so much beauty to be found in American cities as in Oxford,
Cambridge, Salisbury or Winchester, where are lovely relics of a
beautiful age; but still there is a good deal of beauty to be seen in
them now and then, but only where the American has not attempted to
create it., Where the Americans have attempted to produce beauty they
have signally failed., A remarkable characteristic of the Americans is
the manner in which they have applied science to modern life., This is apparent in the most cursory stroll through New York., In England
an inventor is regarded almost as a crazy man, and in too many instances
invention ends in disappointment and poverty., In America an inventor is
honoured, help is forthcoming, and the exercise of ingenuity, the
application of science to the work of man, is there the shortest road to
wealth., There is no country in the world where machinery is so lovely as
in America., I have always wished to believe that the line of strength and the line
of beauty are one., That wish was realised when I contemplated American
machinery., It was not until I had seen the water-works at Chicago that I
realised the wonders of machinery; the rise and fall of the steel rods,
the symmetrical motion of the great wheels is the most beautifully
rhythmic thing I have ever seen., [3] One is impressed in America, but not
favourably impressed, by the inordinate size of everything., The country
seems to try to bully one into a belief in its power by its impressive
bigness., I was disappointed with Niagara--most people must be disappointed with
Niagara., Every American bride is taken there, and the sight of the
stupendous waterfall must be one of the earliest, if not the keenest,
disappointments in American married life., One sees it under bad
conditions, very far away, the point of view not showing the splendour
of the water., To appreciate it really one has to see it from underneath
the fall, and to do that it is necessary to be dressed in a yellow
oil-skin, which is as ugly as a mackintosh--and I hope none of you ever
wears one., It is a consolation to know, however, that such an artist as
Madame Bernhardt has not only worn that yellow, ugly dress, but has been
photographed in it., Perhaps the most beautiful part of America is the West, to reach which,
however, involves a journey by rail of six days, racing along tied to an
ugly tin-kettle of a steam engine., I found but poor consolation for this
journey in the fact that the boys who infest the cars and sell
everything that one can eat--or should not eat--were selling editions of
my poems vilely printed on a kind of grey blotting paper, for the low
price of ten cents., [4] Calling these boys on one side I told them that
though poets like to be popular they desire to be paid, and selling
editions of my poems without giving me a profit is dealing a blow at
literature which must have a disastrous effect on poetical aspirants., The invariable reply that they made was that they themselves made a
profit out of the transaction and that was all they cared about., It is a popular superstition that in America a visitor is invariably
addressed as ?Stranger.?, I was never once addressed as ?Stranger.?, When
I went to Texas I was called ?Captain?, ; when I got to the centre of the
country I was addressed as ?Colonel,?, and, on arriving at the borders of
Mexico, as ?General.?, On the whole, however, ?Sir,?, the old English
method of addressing people is the most common., It is, perhaps, worth while to note that what many people call
Americanisms are really old English expressions which have lingered in
our colonies while they have been lost in our own country., Many people
imagine that the term ?I guess,?, which is so common in America, is
purely an American expression, but it was used by John Locke in his work
on ?The Understanding,?, just as we now use ?I think.?, [5]

It is in the colonies, and not in the mother country, that the old life
of the country really exists., If one wants to realise what English
Puritanism is--not at its worst (when it is very bad), but at its best,
and then it is not very good--I do not think one can find much of it in
England, but much can be found about Boston and Massachusetts., We have
got rid of it., America still preserves it, to be, I hope, a short-lived
curiosity., San Francisco is a really beautiful city., China Town, peopled by Chinese
labourers, is the most artistic town I have ever come across., The
people--strange, melancholy Orientals, whom many people would call
common, and they are certainly very poor--have determined that they will
have nothing about them that is not beautiful., In the Chinese
restaurant, where these navvies meet to have supper in the evening, I
found them drinking tea out of china cups as delicate as the petals of a
rose-leaf, whereas at the gaudy hotels I was supplied with a delf cup an
inch and a half thick., When the Chinese bill was presented it was made
out on rice paper, the account being done in Indian ink as fantastically
as if an artist had been etching little birds on a fan., Salt Lake City contains only two buildings of note, the chief being the
Tabernacle, which is in the shape of a soup-kettle., It is decorated by
the only native artist, and he has treated religious subjects in the
naive spirit of the early Florentine painters, representing people of
our own day in the dress of the period side by side with people of
Biblical history who are clothed in some romantic costume., The building next in importance is called the Amelia Palace, in honour
of one of Brigham Young?s wives., When he died the present president of
the Mormons stood up in the Tabernacle and said that it had been
revealed to him that he was to have the Amelia Palace, and that on this
subject there were to be no more revelations of any kind!, From Salt Lake City one travels over the great plains of Colorado and up
the Rocky Mountains, on the top of which is Leadville, the richest city
in the world., It has also got the reputation of being the roughest, and
every man carries a revolver., I was told that if I went there they
would be sure to shoot me or my travelling manager., I wrote and told
them that nothing that they could do to my travelling manager would
intimidate me., They are miners--men working in metals, so I lectured to
them on the Ethics of Art., I read them passages from the autobiography
of Benvenuto Cellini and they seemed much delighted., I was reproved by
my hearers for not having brought him with me., I explained that he had
been dead for some little time which elicited the enquiry ?Who shot
him??, They afterwards took me to a dancing saloon where I saw the only
rational method of art criticism I have ever come across., Over the piano
was printed a notice:--

The mortality among pianists in that place is marvellous., Then they
asked me to supper, and having accepted, I had to descend a mine in a
rickety bucket in which it was impossible to be graceful., Having got
into the heart of the mountain I had supper, the first course being
whisky, the second whisky and the third whisky., I went to the Theatre to lecture and I was informed that just before I
went there two men had been seized for committing a murder, and in that
theatre they had been brought on to the stage at eight o?clock in the
evening, and then and there tried and executed before a crowded
audience., But I found these miners very charming and not at all rough., Among the more elderly inhabitants of the South I found a melancholy
tendency to date every event of importance by the late war., ?How
beautiful the moon is to-night,?, I once remarked to a gentleman who was
standing next to me., ?Yes,?, was his reply, ?but you should have seen it
before the war.?, So infinitesimal did I find the knowledge of Art, west of the Rocky
Mountains, that an art patron--one who in his day had been a
miner--actually sued the railroad company for damages because the
plaster cast of Venus of Milo, which he had imported from Paris, had
been delivered minus the arms., And, what is more surprising still, he
gained his case and the damages., Pennsylvania, with its rocky gorges and woodland scenery, reminded me of
Switzerland., The prairie reminded me of a piece of blotting-paper., The Spanish and French have left behind them memorials in the beauty of
their names., All the cities that have beautiful names derive them from
the Spanish or the French., The English people give intensely ugly names
to places., One place had such an ugly name that I refused to lecture
there., It was called Grigsville., Supposing I had founded a school of Art
there--fancy ?Early Grigsville.?, Imagine a School of Art teaching
?Grigsville Renaissance.?, As for slang I did not hear much of it, though a young lady who had
changed her clothes after an afternoon dance did say that ?after the
heel kick she shifted her day goods.?, American youths are pale and precocious, or sallow and supercilious, but
American girls are pretty and charming--little oases of pretty
unreasonableness in a vast desert of practical common-sense., Every American girl is entitled to have twelve young men devoted to her., They remain her slaves and she rules them with charming nonchalance., ...]",2
102,"[That is the one sin for
which there is no forgiveness., French songs I cannot possibly allow., People always seem to think that
they are improper, and either look shocked, which is vulgar, or laugh,
which is worse., It has often been made a subject of reproach against artists and men of
letters that they are lacking in wholeness and completeness of nature., As a rule this must necessarily be so., That very concentration of vision
and inversity of purpose which is the characteristic of the artistic
temperament is in itself a mode of limitation., To those who are
preoccupied with the beauty of form nothing else seems of so much
importance., The work of art is to dominate the spectator., The spectator is not to
dominate the work of art., One should sympathise with the joy, the beauty, the colour of life., The
less said about life's sores the better., You can't make people good by act of Parliament--that is something., Art creates an incomparable and unique effect, and having done so passes
on to other things., Nature, on the other hand, forgetting that imitation
can be made the sincerest form of insult, keeps on repeating the effect
until we all become absolutely wearied of it., It is perfectly monstrous the way people go about nowadays saying things
against one behind one's back that are absolutely and entirely true., A true artist takes no notice whatever of the public., The public are to
him non-existent., One should never trust a woman who tells one her real age., A woman who
would tell one that would tell one anything., Nothing is so aggravating as calmness., There is something positively
brutal about the good temper of most modern men., I wonder we women stand
it as well as we do., The truth is a thing I get rid of as soon as possible., Bad habit, by the
way, makes one very unpopular at the club ... with the older members., They call it being conceited., Perhaps it is., My own business always bores me to death., I prefer other people's., Don't be led astray into the paths of virtue--that is the worst of
women., They always want one to be good., And if we are good, when they
meet us they don't love us at all., They like to find us quite
irretrievably bad and to leave us quite unattractively good., Men are such cowards., They outrage every law in the world and are afraid
of the world's tongue., Wicked women bother one., Good women bore one., That is the only
difference between them., To know the principles of the highest art is to know the principles of
all the arts., I don't believe in the existence of Puritan women., I don't think there
is a woman in the world who would not be a little flattered if one made
love to her., It is that which makes women so irresistibly adorable., When I am in trouble eating is the only thing that consoles me., Indeed,
when I am in really great trouble, as anyone who knows me intimately
will tell you, I refuse everything except food and drink., When one is going to lead an entirely new life one requires regular and
wholesome meals., The soul is born old, but grows young., That is the comedy of life., The
body is born young, and grows old., That is life's tragedy., One can survive everything nowadays except death, and live down anything
except a good reputation., The past is of no importance., The present is of no importance., It is
with the future that we have to deal., For the past is what men should
not have been., The present is what men ought not to be., The future is
what artists are., Men become old, but they never become good., By persistently remaining single a man converts himself into a permanent
public temptation., Men should be more careful; this very celibacy leads
weaker vessels astray., I think that in practical life there is something about success, actual
success, that is a little unscrupulous, something about ambition that is
scrupulous always., Every man of ambition has to fight his century with its own weapons., What this century worships is wealth., The god of this century is wealth., To succeed one must have wealth., At all costs one must have wealth., I love scandals about other people, but scandals about myself don't
interest me., They have not got the charm of novelty., Moderation is a fatal thing., Enough is as bad as a meal., More than
enough is as good as a feast., The English can't stand a man who is always saying he is in the right,
but they are very fond of a man who admits he has been in the wrong., It
is one of the best things in them., Life is simply a 'mauvais quart d'heure' made up of exquisite moments., There is the same world for all of us, and good and evil, sin and
innocence, go through it hand in hand., To shut one's eyes to half of
life that one may live securely is as though one blinded oneself that
one might walk with more safety in a land of pit and precipice., Married men are horribly tedious when they are good husbands and
abominably conceited when they are not., Between men and women there is no friendship possible., There is passion,
enmity, worship, love, but no friendship., Everybody is clever nowadays., You can't go anywhere without meeting
clever people., This has become an absolute public nuisance., I don't think man has much capacity for development., He has got as far
as he can, and that is not far, is it?, I am not quite sure that I quite know what pessimism really means., All I
do know is that life cannot be understood without much charity, cannot
be lived without much charity., It is love, and not German philosophy,
that is the explanation of this world, whatever may be the explanation
of the next., I do not approve of anything that that tampers with natural arrogance., Ignorance is like a delicate exotic fruit: touch it, and the blossom is
gone., The whole theory of modern education is radically unsound., Fortunately,
in England, at any rate, education produces no effect whatsoever., If it
did it would prove a serious danger to the upper classes, and probably
lead to acts of violence in Grosvenor Square., No woman should ever be quite accurate about her age., It looks so
calculating., Emotion for the sake of emotion is the aim of art, and emotion for the
sake of emotion is the aim of life and of that practical organisation of
life that we call society., Men of the noblest possible moral character are extremely susceptible to
the influence of the physical charms of others., Modern, no less than
ancient, history supplies us with many most painful examples of what I
refer to., If it were not so, indeed, history would be quite unreadable., I am not in favour of long engagements., They give people the opportunity
of finding out each other's character before marriage, which I think is
never advisable., It is a terrible thing for a man to find out suddenly that all his life
he has been speaking nothing but the truth., The two weak points in our age are its want of principle and its want of
profile., ...]",2
103,"[We live in an age that reads too much to be wise and that thinks too
much to be beautiful., One should absorb the colour of life, but one should never remember its
details., Details are always vulgar., It will be a marvellous thing--the true personality of man--when we see
it., It will grow naturally and simply flowerlike, or as a tree grows., It
will not be at discord., It will never argue or dispute., It will not
prove things., It will know everything, and yet it will not busy itself
about knowledge., It will have wisdom., Its value will not be measured by
material things., It will have nothing, and yet it will have everything,
and whatever one takes from it it will still have, so rich it will be., It will not be always meddling with others or asking them to be like
itself., It will love them because they will be different., And yet, while
it will not meddle with others, it will help all, as a beautiful thing
helps us, by being what it is., The personality of man will be very
wonderful., It will be as wonderful as the personality of a child., Cynicism is merely the art of seeing things as they are instead of as
they ought to be., Three addresses always inspire confidence, even in tradesmen., If one doesn't talk about a thing it has never happened., It is simply
expression that gives reality to things., No man is able who is unable to get on, just as no woman is clever who
can't succeed in obtaining that worst and most necessary of evils, a
husband., The one charm of the past is that it is the past., But women never know
when the curtain has fallen., They always want a sixth act, and as soon
as the interest of the play is entirely over they propose to continue
it., If they were allowed their way every comedy would have a tragic
ending and every tragedy would culminate in a farce., They are charmingly
artificial, but they have no sense of art., Each time that one loves is the only time that one has ever loved., Difference of object does not alter singleness of passion., It merely
intensifies it., The real tragedy of the poor is that they can afford nothing but
self-denial., Beautiful sins, like beautiful things, are the privilege of
the rich., Human life is the one thing worth investigating., Compared to it there is
nothing else of any value., It is true that as one watches life in its
curious crucible of pain and pleasure one cannot wear over one's face a
mask of glass nor keep the sulphurous fumes from troubling the brain and
making the imagination turbid with monstrous fancies and misshapen

there have been either so many people that I have not been able to see
the pictures--which was dreadful, or so many pictures that I have not
been able to see the people--which was worse., All art is quite useless., Beauty, real beauty, ends where an intellectual expression begins., Intellect is in itself a mode of exaggeration and destroys the harmony

sort of fatality that seems to dog, through history, the faltering steps

sacrifice of any mode of passionate experience., Its aim, indeed, is to
be experience itself and not the fruits of experience, bitter or sweet

vulgar profligacy that dulls them, it is to know nothing., But it is to
teach man to concentrate himself upon the moments of a life that is
itself but a moment., Art never expresses anything but itself., It has an independent life,
just as thought has, and develops purely on its own lines., It is not
necessarily realistic in an age of realism nor spiritual in an age of
faith., So far from being the creation of its time it is usually in
direct opposition to it, and the only history that it preserves for us
is the history of its own progress., People who mean well always do badly., They are like the ladies who wear
clothes that don't fit them in order to show their piety., Good
intentions are invariably ungrammatical., Man can believe the impossible, but man can never believe the
improbable., When art is more varied nature will, no doubt, be more varied also., If a man is sufficiently imaginative to produce evidence in support of a
lie he might just as well speak the truth at once., The ancient historians gave us delightful fiction in the form of fact;

fiction., Nature is no great mother who has home us., She is our own creation., It
is in our brain that she quickens to life., Things are because we see

influenced us., To look at a thing is very different from seeing a thing., One does not see anything until one sees its beauty., The proper school to learn art in is not life but art., I won't tell you that the world matters nothing, or the world's voice,

much., I wouldn't marry a man with a future before him for anything under the

forte., I keep science for life., I delight in men over seventy., They always offer one the devotion of a
lifetime., Everybody who is incapable of learning has taken to teaching--that is
really what our enthusiasm for education has come to., Nature hates mind., From the point of view of form the type of all the arts is the art of
the musician., From the point of view of feeling the actor's craft is the
type., Where we differ from each other is purely in accidentals--in dress,
manner, tone of voice, religious opinions, personal appearance, tricks
of habit, and the like., The more we study art the less we care for Nature., What art really
reveals to us is Nature's lack of design, her curious crudities, her
extraordinary monotony, her absolutely unfinished condition...., It is
fortunate for us, however, that nature is so imperfect, as otherwise we
should have had no art at all., Art is our spirited protest, our gallant
attempt to teach Nature her proper place., As for the infinite variety of
nature, that is a pure myth., It is not to be found in Nature herself., It
resides in the imagination or fancy or cultivated blindness of the man
who looks at her., Facts are not merely finding a footing-place in history but they are
usurping the domain of fancy and have invaded the kingdom of romance., Their chilling touch is over everything., They are vulgarising mankind., Ordinary people wait till life discloses to them its secrets, but to the
few, to the elect, the mysteries of life are revealed before the veil is
drawn away., Sometimes this is the effect of art, and chiefly of the art
of literature which deals immediately with the passions and the
intellect., But now and then a complex personality takes the place and
assumes the office of art, is, indeed, in its way a real work of art,
Life having its elaborate masterpieces just as poetry has, or sculpture,
or painting., Thinking is the most unhealthy thing in the world, and people die of it
just as they die of any other disease., A cigarette is the perfect type of a perfect pleasure., It is exquisite
and it leaves one unsatisfied., The aim of the liar is simply to charm, to delight, to give pleasure., He
is the very basis of civilised society., It is quite a mistake to believe, as many people do, that the mind shows
itself in the face., Vice may sometimes write itself in lines and changes
of contour, but that is all., Our faces are really masks given to us to
conceal our minds with., What on earth should we men do going about with purity and innocence?, A
carefully thought-out buttonhole is much more effective., The only difference between a caprice and a lifelong passion is that the
caprice lasts a little longer., People say sometimes that beauty is only superficial., That may be so,
but at least it is not so superficial as thought is., It is the spectator and not life that art really mirrors., Nowadays people know the price of everything and the value of nothing., Conscience and cowardice are really the same things., Conscience is the
trade name of the firm--that is all., In every sphere of life form is the beginning of things., The rhythmic,
harmonious gestures of dancing convey, Plato tells us, both rhythm and
harmony into the mind., ...]",2
105,"[But as a rule the stage is overcrowded with enormous properties, which
are not merely far more expensive and cumbersome than scene-paintings,
but far less beautiful, and far less true., Properties kill perspective., A painted door is more like a real door than a real door is itself, for
the proper conditions of light and shade can be given to it; and the
excessive use of built-up structures always makes the stage too glaring,
for as they have to be lit from behind, as well as from the front, the
gas-jets become the absolute light of the scene instead of the means
merely by which we perceive the conditions of light and shadow which the
painter has desired to show us., So, instead of bemoaning the position of the playwright, it were better
for the critics to exert whatever influence they may possess towards
restoring the scene-painter to his proper position as an artist, and not
allowing him to be built over by the property man, or hammered to death
by the carpenter., I have never seen any reason myself why such artists
as Mr. Beverley, Mr. Walter Hann, and Mr. Telbin should not be entitled
to become Academicians., They have certainly as good a claim as have many
of those R.A.?s whose total inability to paint we can see every May for a
shilling., And lastly, let those critics who hold up for our admiration the
simplicity of the Elizabethan stage remember that they are lauding a
condition of things against which Shakespeare himself, in the spirit of a
true artist, always strongly protested., I have been told that the ambition of every Dramatic Club is to act
_Henry IV_., I am not surprised., The spirit of comedy is as fervent in
this play as is the spirit of chivalry; it is an heroic pageant as well
as an heroic poem, and like most of Shakespeare?s historical dramas it
contains an extraordinary number of thoroughly good acting parts, each of
which is absolutely individual in character, and each of which
contributes to the evolution of the plot., To Oxford belongs the honour of having been the first to present on the
stage this noble play, and the production which I saw last week was in
every way worthy of that lovely town, that mother of sweetness and of
light., For, in spite of the roaring of the young lions at the Union, and
the screaming of the rabbits in the home of the vivisector, in spite of
Keble College, and the tramways, and the sporting prints, Oxford still
remains the most beautiful thing in England, and nowhere else are life
and art so exquisitely blended, so perfectly made one., Indeed, in most
other towns art has often to present herself in the form of a reaction
against the sordid ugliness of ignoble lives, but at Oxford she comes to
us as an exquisite flower born of the beauty of life and expressive of
life?s joy., She finds her home by the Isis as once she did by the
Ilissus; the Magdalen walks and the Magdalen cloisters are as dear to her
as were ever the silver olives of Colonus and the golden gateway of the
house of Pallas: she covers with fanlike tracery the vaulted entrance to
Christ Church Hall, and looks out from the windows of Merton; her feet
have stirred the Cumnor cowslips, and she gathers fritillaries in the
river-fields., To her the clamour of the schools and the dullness of the
lecture-room are a weariness and a vexation of spirit; she seeks not to
define virtue, and cares little for the categories; she smiles on the
swift athlete whose plastic grace has pleased her, and rejoices in the
young Barbarians at their games; she watches the rowers from the reedy
bank and gives myrtle to her lovers, and laurels to her poets, and rue to
those who talk wisely in the street; she makes the earth lovely to all
who dream with Keats; she opens high heaven to all who soar with Shelley;
and turning away her head from pedant, proctor and Philistine, she has
welcomed to her shrine a band of youthful actors, knowing that they have
sought with much ardour for the stern secret of Melpomene, and caught
with much gladness the sweet laughter of Thalia., And to me this ardour
and this gladness were the two most fascinating qualities of the Oxford
performance, as indeed they are qualities which are necessary to any fine
dramatic production., For without quick and imaginative observation of
life the most beautiful play becomes dull in presentation, and what is
not conceived in delight by the actor can give no delight at all to
others., I know that there are many who consider that Shakespeare is more for the
study than for the stage., With this view I do not for a moment agree., Shakespeare wrote the plays to be acted, and we have no right to alter
the form which he himself selected for the full expression of his work., Indeed, many of the beauties of that work can be adequately conveyed to
us only through the actor?s art., As I sat in the Town Hall of Oxford the
other night, the majesty of the mighty lines of the play seemed to me to
gain new music from the clear young voices that uttered them, and the
ideal grandeur of the heroism to be made more real to the spectators by
the chivalrous bearing, the noble gesture and the fine passion of its
exponents., Even the dresses had their dramatic value., Their
arch?ological accuracy gave us, immediately on the rise of the curtain, a
perfect picture of the time., As the knights and nobles moved across the
stage in the flowing robes of peace and in the burnished steel of battle,
we needed no dreary chorus to tell us in what age or land the play?s
action was passing, for the fifteenth century in all the dignity and
grace of its apparel was living actually before us, and the delicate
harmonies of colour struck from the first a dominant note of beauty which
added to the intellectual realism of arch?ology the sensuous charm of
art., I have rarely seen a production better stage-managed., Indeed, I hope
that the University will take some official notice of this delightful
work of art., Why should not degrees be granted for good acting?, Are
they not given to those who misunderstand Plato and who mistranslate
Aristotle?, And should the artist be passed over?, No., To Prince Hal,
Hotspur and Falstaff, D.C.L., ?s should be gracefully offered., I feel sure
they would be gracefully accepted., To the rest of the company the
crimson or the sheepskin hood might be assigned _honoris caus?_ to the
eternal confusion of the Philistine, and the rage of the industrious and
the dull., Thus would Oxford confer honour on herself, and the artist be
placed in his proper position., However, whether or not Convocation
recognizes the claims of culture, I hope that the Oxford Dramatic Society
will produce every summer for us some noble play like _Henry IV_., For,
in plays of this kind, plays which deal with bygone times, there is
always this peculiar charm, that they combine in one exquisite
presentation the passions that are living with the picturesqueness that
is dead., And when we have the modern spirit given to us in an antique
form, the very remoteness of that form can be made a method of increased
realism., This was Shakespeare?s own attitude towards the ancient world,
this is the attitude we in this century should adopt towards his plays,
and with a feeling akin to this it seemed to me that these brilliant
young Oxonians were working., If it was so, their aim is the right one., For while we look to the dramatist to give romance to realism, we ask of
the actor to give realism to romance., In spite of its somewhat alarming title this book may be highly
recommended to every one., As for the authorities the author quotes, they
are almost numberless, and range from Socrates down to Artemus Ward., He
tells us of the wicked bachelor who spoke of marriage as ?a very harmless
amusement?, and advised a young friend of his to ?marry early and marry
often?, ; of Dr. Johnson who proposed that marriage should be arranged by
the Lord Chancellor, without the parties concerned having any choice in
the matter; of the Sussex labourer who asked, ?Why should I give a woman
half my victuals for cooking the other half??, and of Lord Verulam who
thought that unmarried men did the best public work., And, indeed,
marriage is the one subject on which all women agree and all men
disagree., Our author, however, is clearly of the same opinion as the
Scotch lassie who, on her father warning her what a solemn thing it was
to get married, answered, ?I ken that, father, but it?s a great deal
solemner to be single.?, He may be regarded as the champion of the
married life., Indeed, he has a most interesting chapter on marriage-made
men, and though he dissents, and we think rightly, from the view recently
put forward by a lady or two on the Women?s Rights platform that Solomon
owed all his wisdom to the number of his wives, still he appeals to
Bismarck, John Stuart Mill, Mahommed, and Lord Beaconsfield, as instances
of men whose success can be traced to the influence of the women they
married., Archbishop Whately once defined woman as ?a creature that does
not reason and pokes the fire from the top,?, but since his day the higher
education of women has considerably altered their position., Women have
always had an emotional sympathy with those they love; Girton and Newnham
have rendered intellectual sympathy also possible., In our day it is best
for a man to be married, and men must give up the tyranny in married life
which was once so dear to them, and which, we are afraid, lingers still,
here and there., ?Do you wish to be my wife, Mabel??, said a little boy., ?Yes,?, incautiously answered Mabel., ?Then pull off my boots.?, On marriage vows our author has, too, very sensible views and very
amusing stories., He tells of a nervous bridegroom who, confusing the
baptismal and marriage ceremonies, replied when asked if he consented to
take the bride for his wife: ?I renounce them all?, ; of a Hampshire rustic
who, when giving the ring, said solemnly to the bride: ?With my body I
thee wash up, and with all my hurdle goods I thee and thou?, ; of another
who when asked whether he would take his partner to be his wedded wife,
replied with shameful indecision: ?Yes, I?m willin?, ; but I?d a sight
rather have her sister?, ; and of a Scotch lady who, on the occasion of her
daughter?s wedding, was asked by an old friend whether she might
congratulate her on the event, and answered: ?Yes, yes, upon the whole it
is very satisfactory; it is true Jeannie hates her gudeman, but then
there?s always a something!?, Indeed, the good stories contained in this
book are quite endless and make it very pleasant reading, while the good
advice is on all points admirable., Most young married people nowadays start in life with a dreadful
collection of ormolu inkstands covered with sham onyxes, or with a
perfect museum of salt-cellars., We strongly recommend this book as one
of the best of wedding presents., It is a complete handbook to an earthly
Paradise, and its author may be regarded as the Murray of matrimony and
the Baedeker of bliss., Books, I fancy, may be conveniently divided into three classes:

1., Books to read, such as Cicero?s _Letters_, Suetonius, Vasari?s _Lives
of the Painters_, the _Autobiography of Benvenuto Cellini_, Sir John
Mandeville, Marco Polo, St. Simon?s _Memoirs_, Mommsen, and (till we get
a better one) Grote?s _History of Greece_., 2., Books to re-read, such as Plato and Keats: in the sphere of poetry,
the masters not the minstrels; in the sphere of philosophy, the seers not
the _savants_., 3., Books not to read at all, such as Thomson?s _Seasons_, Rogers?s
_Italy_, Paley?s _Evidences_, all the Fathers except St. Augustine, all
John Stuart Mill except the essay on _Liberty_, all Voltaire?s plays
without any exception, Butler?s _Analogy_, Grant?s _Aristotle_, Hume?s
_England_, Lewes?s _History of Philosophy_, all argumentative books and
all books that try to prove anything., The third class is by far the most important., To tell people what to
read is, as a rule, either useless or harmful; for, the appreciation of
literature is a question of temperament not of teaching; to Parnassus
there is no primer and nothing that one can learn is ever worth learning., But to tell people what not to read is a very different matter, and I
venture to recommend it as a mission to the University Extension Scheme., Indeed, it is one that is eminently needed in this age of ours, an age
that reads so much, that it has no time to admire, and writes so much,
that it has no time to think., Whoever will select out of the chaos of
our modern curricula ?The Worst Hundred Books,?, and publish a list of
them, will confer on the rising generation a real and lasting benefit., After expressing these views I suppose I should not offer any suggestions
at all with regard to ?The Best Hundred Books,?, but I hope you will allow
me the pleasure of being inconsistent, as I am anxious to put in a claim
for a book that has been strangely omitted by most of the excellent
judges who have contributed to your columns., I mean the _Greek
Anthology_., The beautiful poems contained in this collection seem to me
to hold the same position with regard to Greek dramatic literature as do
the delicate little figurines of Tanagra to the Phidian marbles, and to
be quite as necessary for the complete understanding of the Greek spirit., I am also amazed to find that Edgar Allan Poe has been passed over., Surely this marvellous lord of rhythmic expression deserves a place?, If,
in order to make room for him, it be necessary to elbow out some one
else, I should elbow out Southey, and I think that Baudelaire might be
most advantageously substituted for Keble., No doubt, both in the _Curse of Kehama_ and in the _Christian Year_ there
are poetic qualities of a certain kind, but absolute catholicity of taste
is not without its dangers., It is only an auctioneer who should admire
all schools of art., Of the many collections of letters that have appeared in this century
few, if any, can rival for fascination of style and variety of incident
the letters of George Sand which have recently been translated into
English by M. Ledos de Beaufort., They extend over a space of more than
sixty years, from 1812 to 1876, in fact, and comprise the first letters
of Aurore Dupin, a child of eight years old, as well as the last letters
of George Sand, a woman of seventy-two., The very early letters, those of
the child and of the young married woman, possess, of course, merely a
psychological interest; but from 1831, the date of Madame Dudevant?s
separation from her husband and her first entry into Paris life, the
interest becomes universal, and the literary and political history of
France is mirrored in every page., For George Sand was an indefatigable correspondent; she longs in one of
her letters, it is true, for ?a planet where reading and writing are
absolutely unknown,?, but still she had a real pleasure in letter-writing., Her greatest delight was the communication of ideas, and she is always in
the heart of the battle., She discusses pauperism with Louis Napoleon in
his prison at Ham, and liberty with Armand Barbes in his dungeon at
Vincennes; she writes to Lamennais on philosophy, to Mazzini on
socialism, to Lamartine on democracy, and to Ledru-Rollin on justice., Her letters reveal to us not merely the life of a great novelist but the
soul of a great woman, of a woman who was one with all the noblest
movements of her day and whose sympathy with humanity was boundless
absolutely., ...]",2
106,"[We may not at first gain from his works that artistic unity of
impression which is Tourgenieff?s chief charm, but once that we have
mastered the details the whole seems to have the grandeur and the
simplicity of an epic., Dostoieffski differs widely from both his rivals., He is not so fine an artist as Tourgenieff, for he deals more with the
facts than with the effects of life; nor has he Tolstoi?s largeness of
vision and epic dignity; but he has qualities that are distinctively and
absolutely his own, such as a fierce intensity of passion and
concentration of impulse, a power of dealing with the deepest mysteries
of psychology and the most hidden springs of life, and a realism that is
pitiless in its fidelity, and terrible because it is true., Some time ago
we had occasion to draw attention to his marvellous novel _Crime and
Punishment_, where in the haunt of impurity and vice a harlot and an
assassin meet together to read the story of Dives and Lazarus, and the
outcast girl leads the sinner to make atonement for his sin; nor is the
book entitled _Injury and Insult_ at all inferior to that great
masterpiece., Mean and ordinary though the surroundings of the story may
seem, the heroine Natasha is like one of the noble victims of Greek
tragedy; she is Antigone with the passion of Ph?dra, and it is impossible
to approach her without a feeling of awe., Greek also is the gloom of
Nemesis that hangs over each character, only it is a Nemesis that does
not stand outside of life, but is part of our own nature and of the same
material as life itself., Ale?sha, the beautiful young lad whom Natasha
follows to her doom, is a second Tito Melema, and has all Tito?s charm
and grace and fascination., Yet he is different., He would never have
denied Baldassare in the Square at Florence, nor lied to Romola about
Tessa., He has a magnificent, momentary sincerity, a boyish
unconsciousness of all that life signifies, an ardent enthusiasm for all
that life cannot give., There is nothing calculating about him., He never
thinks evil, he only does it., From a psychological point of view he is
one of the most interesting characters of modern fiction, as from an
artistic he is one of the most attractive., As we grow to know him he
stirs strange questions for us, and makes us feel that it is not the
wicked only who do wrong, nor the bad alone who work evil., And by what a subtle objective method does Dostoieffski show us his
characters!, He never tickets them with a list nor labels them with a
description., We grow to know them very gradually, as we know people whom
we meet in society, at first by little tricks of manner, personal
appearance, fancies in dress, and the like; and afterwards by their deeds
and words; and even then they constantly elude us, for though
Dostoieffski may lay bare for us the secrets of their nature, yet he
never explains his personages away; they are always surprising us by
something that they say or do, and keep to the end the eternal mystery of
life., Irrespective of its value as a work of art, this novel possesses a deep
autobiographical interest also, as the character of Vania, the poor
student who loves Natasha through all her sin and shame, is
Dostoieffski?s study of himself., Goethe once had to delay the completion
of one of his novels till experience had furnished him with new
situations, but almost before he had arrived at manhood Dostoieffski knew
life in its most real forms; poverty and suffering, pain and misery,
prison, exile, and love, were soon familiar to him, and by the lips of
Vania he has told his own story., This note of personal feeling, this
harsh reality of actual experience, undoubtedly gives the book something
of its strange fervour and terrible passion, yet it has not made it
egotistic; we see things from every point of view, and we feel, not that
fiction has been trammelled by fact, but that fact itself has become
ideal and imaginative., Pitiless, too, though Dostoieffski is in his
method as an artist, as a man he is full of human pity for all, for those
who do evil as well as for those who suffer it, for the selfish no less
than for those whose lives are wrecked for others and whose sacrifice is
in vain., Since _Adam Bede_ and _Le P?re Goriot_ no more powerful novel
has been written than _Insult and Injury_., To convey ideas through the medium of images has always been the aim of
those who are artists as well as thinkers in literature, and it is to a
desire to give a sensuous environment to intellectual concepts that we
owe Mr. Pater?s last volume., For these Imaginary or, as we should prefer
to call them, Imaginative Portraits of his, form a series of philosophic
studies in which the philosophy is tempered by personality, and the
thought shown under varying conditions of mood and manner, the very
permanence of each principle gaining something through the change and
colour of the life through which it finds expression., The most
fascinating of all these pictures is undoubtedly that of Sebastian Van
Storck., The account of Watteau is perhaps a little too fanciful, and the
description of him as one who was ?always a seeker after something in the
world, that is there in no satisfying measure, or not at all,?, seems to
us more applicable to him who saw Mona Lisa sitting among the rocks than
the gay and debonair _peintre des f?tes galantes_., But Sebastian, the
grave young Dutch philosopher, is charmingly drawn., From the first
glimpse we get of him, skating over the water-meadows with his plume of
squirrel?s tail and his fur muff, in all the modest pleasantness of
boyhood, down to his strange death in the desolate house amid the sands
of the Helder, we seem to see him, to know him, almost to hear the low
music of his voice., He is a dreamer, as the common phrase goes, and yet
he is poetical in this sense, that his theorems shape life for him,
directly., Early in youth he is stirred by a fine saying of Spinoza, and
sets himself to realize the ideal of an intellectual disinterestedness,
separating himself more and more from the transient world of sensation,
accident and even affection, till what is finite and relative becomes of
no interest to him, and he feels that as nature is but a thought of his,
so he himself is but a passing thought of God., This conception, of the
power of a mere metaphysical abstraction over the mind of one so
fortunately endowed for the reception of the sensible world, is
exceedingly delightful, and Mr. Pater has never written a more subtle
psychological study, the fact that Sebastian dies in an attempt to save
the life of a little child giving to the whole story a touch of poignant
pathos and sad irony., _Denys l?Auxerrois_ is suggested by a figure found, or said to be found,
on some old tapestries in Auxerre, the figure of a ?flaxen and flowery
creature, sometimes well-nigh naked among the vine-leaves, sometimes
muffled in skins against the cold, sometimes in the dress of a monk, but
always with a strong impress of real character and incident from the
veritable streets?, of the town itself., From this strange design Mr.
Pater has fashioned a curious medi?val myth of the return of Dionysus
among men, a myth steeped in colour and passion and old romance, full of
wonder and full of worship, Denys himself being half animal and half god,
making the world mad with a new ecstasy of living, stirring the artists
simply by his visible presence, drawing the marvel of music from reed and
pipe, and slain at last in a stage-play by those who had loved him., In
its rich affluence of imagery this story is like a picture by Mantegna,
and indeed Mantegna might have suggested the description of the pageant
in which Denys rides upon a gaily-painted chariot, in soft silken raiment
and, for head-dress, a strange elephant scalp with gilded tusks., If _Denys l?Auxerrois_ symbolizes the passion of the senses and
_Sebastian Van Storck_ the philosophic passion, as they certainly seem to
do, though no mere formula or definition can adequately express the
freedom and variety of the life that they portray, the passion for the
imaginative world of art is the basis of the story of _Duke Carl of
Rosenmold_., Duke Carl is not unlike the late King of Bavaria, in his
love of France, his admiration for the _Grand Monarque_ and his fantastic
desire to amaze and to bewilder, but the resemblance is possibly only a
chance one., In fact Mr. Pater?s young hero is the precursor of the
_Aufkl?rung_ of the last century, the German precursor of Herder and
Lessing and Goethe himself, and finds the forms of art ready to his hand
without any national spirit to fill them or make them vital and
responsive., He too dies, trampled to death by the soldiers of the
country he so much admired, on the night of his marriage with a peasant
girl, the very failure of his life lending him a certain melancholy grace
and dramatic interest., On the whole, then, this is a singularly attractive book., Mr. Pater is
an intellectual impressionist., He does not weary us with any definite
doctrine or seek to suit life to any formal creed., He is always looking
for exquisite moments and, when he has found them, he analyses them with
delicate and delightful art and then passes on, often to the opposite
pole of thought or feeling, knowing that every mood has its own quality
and charm and is justified by its mere existence., He has taken the
sensationalism of Greek philosophy and made it a new method of art
criticism., As for his style, it is curiously ascetic., Now and then, we
come across phrases with a strange sensuousness of expression, as when he
tells us how Denys l?Auxerrois, on his return from a long journey, ?ate
flesh for the first time, tearing the hot, red morsels with his delicate
fingers in a kind of wild greed,?, but such passages are rare., Asceticism
is the keynote of Mr. Pater?s prose; at times it is almost too severe in
its self-control and makes us long for a little more freedom., For
indeed, the danger of such prose as his is that it is apt to become
somewhat laborious., Here and there, one is tempted to say of Mr. Pater
that he is ?a seeker after something in language, that is there in no
satisfying measure, or not at all.?, The continual preoccupation with
phrase and epithet has its drawbacks as well as its virtues., And yet,
when all is said, what wonderful prose it is, with its subtle
preferences, its fastidious purity, its rejection of what is common or
ordinary!, Mr. Pater has the true spirit of selection, the true art of
omission., If he be not among the greatest prose writers of our
literature he is, at least, our greatest artist in prose; and though it
may be admitted that the best style is that which seems an unconscious
result rather than a conscious aim, still in these latter days when
violent rhetoric does duty for eloquence and vulgarity usurps the name of
nature, we should be grateful for a style that deliberately aims at
perfection of form, that seeks to produce its effect by artistic means
and sets before itself an ideal of grave and chastened beauty., The Princess Christian?s translation of the _Memoirs of Wilhelmine_,
_Margravine of Baireuth_, is a most fascinating and delightful book., The
Margravine and her brother, Frederick the Great, were, as the Princess
herself points out in an admirably written introduction, ?among the first
of those questioning minds that strove after spiritual freedom?, in the
last century., ?They had studied,?, says the Princess, ?the English
philosophers, Newton, Locke, and Shaftesbury, and were roused to
enthusiasm by the writings of Voltaire and Rousseau., Their whole lives
bore the impress of the influence of French thought on the burning
questions of the day., In the eighteenth century began that great
struggle of philosophy against tyranny and worn-out abuses which
culminated in the French Revolution., The noblest minds were engaged in
the struggle, and, like most reformers, they pushed their conclusions to
extremes, and too often lost sight of the need of a due proportion in
things., The Margravine?s influence on the intellectual development of
her country is untold., She formed at Baireuth a centre of culture and
learning which had before been undreamt of in Germany.?, The historical value of these _Memoirs_ is, of course, well known., Carlyle speaks of them as being ?by far the best authority?, on the early
life of Frederick the Great., But considered merely as the autobiography
of a clever and charming woman, they are no less interesting, and even
those who care nothing for eighteenth-century politics, and look upon
history itself as an unattractive form of fiction, cannot fail to be
fascinated by the Margravine?s wit, vivacity and humour, by her keen
powers of observation, and by her brilliant and assertive egotism., Not
that her life was by any means a happy one., Her father, to quote the
Princess Christian, ?ruled his family with the same harsh despotism with
which he ruled his country, taking pleasure in making his power felt by
all in the most galling manner,?, and the Margravine and her brother ?had
much to suffer, not only from his ungovernable temper, but also from the
real privations to which they were subjected.?, Indeed, the picture the
Margravine gives of the King is quite extraordinary., ?He despised all
learning,?, she writes, ?and wished me to occupy myself with nothing but
needlework and household duties or details., Had he found me writing or
reading, he would probably have whipped me.?, He ?considered music a
capital offence, and maintained that every one should devote himself to
one object: men to the military service, and women to their household
duties., Science and the arts he counted among the ?seven deadly sins.??, Sometimes he took to religion, ?and then,?, says the Margravine, ?we lived
like trappists, to the great grief of my brother and myself., Every
afternoon the King preached a sermon, to which we had to listen as
attentively as if it proceeded from an Apostle., My brother and I were
often seized with such an intense sense of the ridiculous that we burst
out laughing, upon which an apostolic curse was poured out on our heads,
which we had to accept with a show of humility and penitence.?, Economy
and soldiers were his only topics of conversation; his chief social
amusement was to make his guests intoxicated; and as for his temper, the
accounts the Margravine gives of it would be almost incredible if they
were not amply corroborated from other sources., Suetonius has written of
the strange madness that comes on kings, but even in his melodramatic
chronicles there is hardly anything that rivals what the Margravine has
to tell us., Here is one of her pictures of family life at a Royal Court
in the last century, and it is not by any means the worst scene she
describes:

Yet, as the Princess Christian remarks, ?despite the almost cruel
treatment Wilhelmine received from her father, it is noticeable that
throughout her memoirs she speaks of him with the greatest affection., She makes constant reference to his ?good heart??, ; and says that his
faults ?were more those of temper than of nature.?, Nor could all the
misery and wretchedness of her home life dull the brightness of her
intellect., What would have made others morbid, made her satirical., Instead of weeping over her own personal tragedies, she laughs at the
general comedy of life., Here, for instance, is her description of Peter
the Great and his wife, who arrived at Berlin in 1718:

Nor are the Margravine?s descriptions of her reception as a bride in the
principality of Baireuth less amusing., Hof was the first town she came
to, and a deputation of nobles was waiting there to welcome her., This is
her account of them:

As for Baireuth itself, and its petty Court, the picture she gives of it
is exceedingly curious., Her father-in-law, the reigning Margrave, was a
narrow-minded mediocrity, whose conversation ?resembled that of a sermon
read aloud for the purpose of sending the listener to sleep,?, and he had
only two topics, Telemachus, and Amelot de la Houssaye?s _Roman History_., The Ministers, from Baron von Stein, who always said ?yes?, to everything,
to Baron von Voit, who always said ?no,?, were not by any means an
intellectual set of men., ?Their chief amusement,?, says the Margravine,
?was drinking from morning till night,?, ...]",2
107,"[Sappho was undoubtedly a far more flawless and perfect artist., She
stirred the whole antique world more than Mrs. Browning ever stirred our
modern age., Never had Love such a singer., Even in the few lines that
remain to us the passion seems to scorch and burn., But, as unjust Time,
who has crowned her with the barren laurels of fame, has twined with them
the dull poppies of oblivion, let us turn from the mere memory of a
poetess to one whose song still remains to us as an imperishable glory to
our literature; to her who heard the cry of the children from dark mine
and crowded factory, and made England weep over its little ones; who, in
the feigned sonnets from the Portuguese, sang of the spiritual mystery of
Love, and of the intellectual gifts that Love brings to the soul; who had
faith in all that is worthy, and enthusiasm for all that is great, and
pity for all that suffers; who wrote the _Vision of Poets_ and _Casa
Guidi Windows_ and _Aurora Leigh_., As one, to whom I owe my love of poetry no less than my love of country,
said of her:

She lives indeed, and not alone in the heart of Shakespeare?s England,
but in the heart of Dante?s Italy also., To Greek literature she owed her
scholarly culture, but modern Italy created her human passion for
Liberty., When she crossed the Alps she became filled with a new ardour,
and from that fine, eloquent mouth, that we can still see in her
portraits, broke forth such a noble and majestic outburst of lyrical song
as had not been heard from woman?s lips for more than two thousand years., It is pleasant to think that an English poetess was to a certain extent a
real factor in bringing about that unity of Italy that was Dante?s dream,
and if Florence drove her great singer into exile, she at least welcomed
within her walls the later singer that England had sent to her., If one were asked the chief qualities of Mrs. Browning?s work, one would
say, as Mr. Swinburne said of Byron?s, its sincerity and its strength., Faults it, of course, possesses., ?She would rhyme moon to table,?, used
to be said of her in jest; and certainly no more monstrous rhymes are to
be found in all literature than some of those we come across in Mrs.
Browning?s poems., But her ruggedness was never the result of
carelessness., It was deliberate, as her letters to Mr. Horne show very
clearly., She refused to sandpaper her muse., She disliked facile
smoothness and artificial polish., In her very rejection of art she was
an artist., She intended to produce a certain effect by certain means,
and she succeeded; and her indifference to complete assonance in rhyme
often gives a splendid richness to her verse, and brings into it a
pleasurable element of surprise., In philosophy she was a Platonist, in politics an Opportunist., She
attached herself to no particular party., She loved the people when they
were king-like, and kings when they showed themselves to be men., Of the
real value and motive of poetry she had a most exalted idea., ?Poetry,?, she says, in the preface of one of her volumes, ?has been as serious a
thing to me as life itself; and life has been a very serious thing., There has been no playing at skittles for me in either., I never mistook
pleasure for the final cause of poetry, nor leisure for the hour of the
poet., I have done my work so far, not as mere hand and head work apart
from the personal being, but as the completest expression of that being
to which I could attain.?, It certainly is her completest expression, and through it she realizes
her fullest perfection., ?The poet,?, she says elsewhere, ?is at once
richer and poorer than he used to be; he wears better broadcloth, but
speaks no more oracles.?, These words give us the keynote to her view of
the poet?s mission., He was to utter Divine oracles, to be at once
inspired prophet and holy priest; and as such we may, I think, without
exaggeration, conceive her., She was a Sibyl delivering a message to the
world, sometimes through stammering lips, and once at least with blinded
eyes, yet always with the true fire and fervour of lofty and unshaken
faith, always with the great raptures of a spiritual nature, the high
ardours of an impassioned soul., As we read her best poems we feel that,
though Apollo?s shrine be empty and the bronze tripod overthrown, and the
vale of Delphi desolate, still the Pythia is not dead., In our own age
she has sung for us, and this land gave her new birth., Indeed, Mrs.
Browning is the wisest of the Sibyls, wiser even than that mighty figure
whom Michael Angelo has painted on the roof of the Sistine Chapel at
Rome, poring over the scroll of mystery, and trying to decipher the
secrets of Fate; for she realized that, while knowledge is power,
suffering is part of knowledge., To her influence, almost as much as to the higher education of women, I
would be inclined to attribute the really remarkable awakening of woman?s
song that characterizes the latter half of our century in England., No
country has ever had so many poetesses at once., Indeed, when one
remembers that the Greeks had only nine muses, one is sometimes apt to
fancy that we have too many., And yet the work done by women in the
sphere of poetry is really of a very high standard of excellence., In
England we have always been prone to underrate the value of tradition in
literature., In our eagerness to find a new voice and a fresh mode of
music, we have forgotten how beautiful Echo may be., We look first for
individuality and personality, and these are, indeed, the chief
characteristics of the masterpieces of our literature, either in prose or
verse; but deliberate culture and a study of the best models, if united
to an artistic temperament and a nature susceptible of exquisite
impressions, may produce much that is admirable, much that is worthy of
praise., It would be quite impossible to give a complete catalogue of all
the women who since Mrs. Browning?s day have tried lute and lyre., Mrs.
Pfeiffer, Mrs. Hamilton King, Mrs. Augusta Webster, Graham Tomson, Miss
Mary Robinson, Jean Ingelow, Miss May Kendall, Miss Nesbit, Miss May
Probyn, Mrs. Craik, Mrs. Meynell, Miss Chapman, and many others have done
really good work in poetry, either in the grave Dorian mode of thoughtful
and intellectual verse, or in the light and graceful forms of old French
song, or in the romantic manner of antique ballad, or in that ?moment?s
monument,?, as Rossetti called it, the intense and concentrated sonnet., Occasionally one is tempted to wish that the quick, artistic faculty that
women undoubtedly possess developed itself somewhat more in prose and
somewhat less in verse., Poetry is for our highest moods, when we wish to
be with the gods, and in our poetry nothing but the very best should
satisfy us; but prose is for our daily bread, and the lack of good prose
is one of the chief blots on our culture., French prose, even in the
hands of the most ordinary writers, is always readable, but English prose
is detestable., We have a few, a very few, masters, such as they are., We
have Carlyle, who should not be imitated; and Mr. Pater, who, through the
subtle perfection of his form, is inimitable absolutely; and Mr. Froude,
who is useful; and Matthew Arnold, who is a model; and Mr. George
Meredith, who is a warning; and Mr. Lang, who is the divine amateur; and
Mr. Stevenson, who is the humane artist; and Mr. Ruskin, whose rhythm and
colour and fine rhetoric and marvellous music of words are entirely
unattainable., But the general prose that one reads in magazines and in
newspapers is terribly dull and cumbrous, heavy in movement and uncouth
or exaggerated in expression., Possibly some day our women of letters
will apply themselves more definitely to prose., Their light touch, and exquisite ear, and delicate sense of balance and
proportion would be of no small service to us., I can fancy women
bringing a new manner into our literature., However, we have to deal here with women as poetesses, and it is
interesting to note that, though Mrs. Browning?s influence undoubtedly
contributed very largely to the development of this new song-movement, if
I may so term it, still there seems to have been never a time during the
last three hundred years when the women of this kingdom did not
cultivate, if not the art, at least the habit, of writing poetry., Who the first English poetess was I cannot say., I believe it was the
Abbess Juliana Berners, who lived in the fifteenth century; but I have no
doubt that Mr. Freeman would be able at a moment?s notice to produce some
wonderful Saxon or Norman poetess, whose works cannot be read without a
glossary, and even with its aid are completely unintelligible., For my
own part, I am content with the Abbess Juliana, who wrote
enthusiastically about hawking; and after her I would mention Anne Askew,
who in prison and on the eve of her fiery martyrdom wrote a ballad that
has, at any rate, a pathetic and historical interest., Queen Elizabeth?s
?most sweet and sententious ditty?, on Mary Stuart is highly praised by
Puttenham, a contemporary critic, as an example of ?Exargasia, or the
Gorgeous in Literature,?, which somehow seems a very suitable epithet for
such a great Queen?s poems., The term she applies to the unfortunate
Queen of Scots, ?the daughter of debate,?, has, of course, long since
passed into literature., The Countess of Pembroke, Sir Philip Sidney?s
sister, was much admired as a poetess in her day., In 1613 the ?learned, virtuous, and truly noble ladie,?, Elizabeth Carew,
published a _Tragedie of Marian_, _the Faire Queene of Jewry_, and a few
years later the ?noble ladie Diana Primrose?, wrote _A Chain of Pearl_,
which is a panegyric on the ?peerless graces?, of Gloriana., Mary Morpeth,
the friend and admirer of Drummond of Hawthornden; Lady Mary Wroth, to
whom Ben Jonson dedicated _The Alchemist_; and the Princess Elizabeth,
the sister of Charles I., should also be mentioned., After the Restoration women applied themselves with still greater ardour
to the study of literature and the practice of poetry., Margaret, Duchess
of Newcastle, was a true woman of letters, and some of her verses are
extremely pretty and graceful., Mrs. Aphra Behn was the first
Englishwoman who adopted literature as a regular profession., Mrs.
Katharine Philips, according to Mr. Gosse, invented sentimentality., As
she was praised by Dryden, and mourned by Cowley, let us hope she may be
forgiven., Keats came across her poems at Oxford when he was writing
_Endymion_, and found in one of them ?a most delicate fancy of the
Fletcher kind?, ; but I fear nobody reads the Matchless Orinda now., Of
Lady Winchelsea?s _Nocturnal Reverie_ Wordsworth said that, with the
exception of Pope?s _Windsor Forest_, it was the only poem of the period
intervening between _Paradise Lost_ and Thomson?s _Seasons_ that
contained a single new image of external nature., Lady Rachel Russell,
who may be said to have inaugurated the letter-writing literature of
England; Eliza Haywood, who is immortalized by the badness of her work,
and has a niche in _The Dunciad_; and the Marchioness of Wharton, whose
poems Waller said he admired, are very remarkable types, the finest of
them being, of course, the first named, who was a woman of heroic mould
and of a most noble dignity of nature., Indeed, though the English poetesses up to the time of Mrs. Browning
cannot be said to have produced any work of absolute genius, they are
certainly interesting figures, fascinating subjects for study., Amongst
them we find Lady Mary Wortley Montague, who had all the caprice of
Cleopatra, and whose letters are delightful reading; Mrs. Centlivre, who
wrote one brilliant comedy; Lady Anne Barnard, whose _Auld Robin Gray_
was described by Sir Walter Scott as ?worth all the dialogues Corydon and
Phillis have together spoken from the days of Theocritus downwards,?, and
is certainly a very beautiful and touching poem; Esther Vanhomrigh and
Hester Johnson, the Vanessa and the Stella of Dean Swift?s life; Mrs.
Thrale, the friend of the great lexicographer; the worthy Mrs. Barbauld;
the excellent Miss Hannah More; the industrious Joanna Baillie; the
admirable Mrs. Chapone, whose _Ode to Solitude_ always fills me with the
wildest passion for society, and who will at least be remembered as the
patroness of the establishment at which Becky Sharp was educated; Miss
Anna Seward, who was called ?The Swan of Lichfield?, ; poor L. E. L. whom
Disraeli described in one of his clever letters to his sister as ?the
personification of Brompton?pink satin dress, white satin shoes, red
cheeks, snub nose, and her hair _?, la_ Sappho?, ; Mrs. Ratcliffe, who
introduced the romantic novel, and has consequently much to answer for;
the beautiful Duchess of Devonshire, of whom Gibbon said that she was
?made for something better than a Duchess?, ; the two wonderful sisters,
Lady Dufferin and Mrs. Norton; Mrs. Tighe, whose _Psyche_ Keats read with
pleasure; Constantia Grierson, a marvellous blue-stocking in her time;
Mrs. Hemans; pretty, charming ?Perdita,?, who flirted alternately with
poetry and the Prince Regent, played divinely in the _Winter?s Tale_, was
brutally attacked by Gifford, and has left us a pathetic little poem on a
Snowdrop; and Emily Bront?, whose poems are instinct with tragic power,
and seem often on the verge of being great., Old fashions in literature are not so pleasant as old fashions in dress., I like the costume of the age of powder better than the poetry of the age
of Pope., But if one adopts the historical standpoint?and this is,
indeed, the only standpoint from which we can ever form a fair estimate
of work that is not absolutely of the highest order?we cannot fail to see
that many of the English poetesses who preceded Mrs. Browning were women
of no ordinary talent, and that if the majority of them looked upon
poetry simply as a department of _belles lettres_, so in most cases did
their contemporaries., Since Mrs. Browning?s day our woods have become
full of singing birds, and if I venture to ask them to apply themselves
more to prose and less to song, it is not that I like poetical prose, but
that I love the prose of poets., There are certain problems in arch?ology that seem to possess a real
romantic interest, and foremost among these is the question of the
so-called Venus of Melos., Who is she, this marble mutilated goddess whom
Gautier loved, to whom Heine bent his knee?, What sculptor wrought her,
and for what shrine?, Whose hands walled her up in that rude niche where
the Melian peasant found her?, What symbol of her divinity did she carry?, Was it apple of gold or shield of bronze?, Where is her city and what was
her name among gods and men?, The last writer on this fascinating subject
is Mr. Stillman, who in a most interesting book recently published in
America, claims that the work of art in question is no sea-born and
foam-born Aphrodite, but the very Victory Without Wings that once stood
in the little chapel outside the gates of the Acropolis at Athens., ...]",2
108,"[When we get to Cicero?s discussions on

spark of ethereal fire just kindled., ., ., ., The character of girls must
depend upon their reading as much as upon the company they keep., Besides
the intrinsic pleasure to be derived from solid knowledge, a woman ought
to consider it as her best resource against poverty.?, This is a somewhat
caustic aphorism: ?A romantic woman is a troublesome friend, as she
expects you to be as impudent as herself, and is mortified at what she
calls coldness and insensibility.?, And this is admirable: ?The art of
life is not to estrange oneself from society, and yet not to pay too dear
for it.?, This, too, is good: ?Vanity, like curiosity, is wanted as a
stimulus to exertion; indolence would certainly get the better of us if
it were not for these two powerful principles?, ; and there is a keen touch
of humour in the following: ?Nothing is so gratifying as the idea that
virtue and philanthropy are becoming fashionable.?, Dr. James Martineau,
in a letter to Mrs. Ross, gives us a pleasant picture of the old lady
returning from market ?weighted by her huge basket, with the shank of a
leg of mutton thrust out to betray its contents,?, and talking divinely
about philosophy, poets, politics, and every intellectual topic of the
day., She was a woman of admirable good sense, a type of Roman matron,
and quite as careful as were the Roman matrons to keep up the purity of
her native tongue., Mrs. Taylor, however, was more or less limited to Norwich., Mrs. Austin
was for the world., In London, Paris, and Germany, she ruled and
dominated society, loved by every one who knew her., ?She is ?My best and
brightest?, to Lord Jeffrey; ?Dear, fair and wise?, to Sydney Smith; ?My
great ally?, to Sir James Stephen; ?Sunlight through waste weltering
chaos?, to Thomas Carlyle (while he needed her aid); ?La petite m?re du
genre humain?, to Michael Chevalier; ?Liebes M?tterlein?, to John Stuart
Mill; and ?My own Professorin?, to Charles Buller, to whom she taught
German, as well as to the sons of Mr. James Mill.?, Jeremy Bentham, when
on his deathbed, gave her a ring with his portrait and some of his hair
let in behind., ?There, my dear,?, he said, ?it is the only ring I ever
gave a woman.?, She corresponded with Guizot, Barthelemy de St. Hilaire,
the Grotes, Dr. Whewell, the Master of Trinity, Nassau Senior, the
Duchesse d?Orl?ans, Victor Cousin, and many other distinguished people., Her translation of Ranke?s _History of the Popes_ is admirable; indeed,
all her literary work was thoroughly well done, and her edition of her
husband?s _Province of Jurisprudence_ deserves the very highest praise., Two people more unlike than herself and her husband it would have been
difficult to find., He was habitually grave and despondent; she was
brilliantly handsome, fond of society, in which she shone, and ?with an
almost superabundance of energy and animal spirits,?, Mrs. Ross tells us., She married him because she thought him perfect, but he never produced
the work of which he was worthy, and of which she knew him to be worthy., Her estimate of him in the preface to the _Jurisprudence_ is wonderfully
striking and simple., ?He was never sanguine., He was intolerant of any
imperfection., He was always under the control of severe love of truth., He lived and died a poor man.?, She was terribly disappointed in him, but
she loved him., Some years after his death, she wrote to M. Guizot:

The most interesting letters in the book are certainly those to M.
Guizot, with whom she maintained the closest intellectual friendship; but
there is hardly one of them that does not contain something clever, or
thoughtful, or witty, while those addressed to her, in turn, are very
interesting., Carlyle writes her letters full of lamentations, the wail
of a Titan in pain, superbly exaggerated for literary effect., Henri Beyle (Stendhal), the great, I am often tempted to think the
greatest of French novelists, writes her a charming letter about
_nuances_., ?It seems to me,?, he says, ?that except when they read
Shakespeare, Byron, or Sterne, no Englishman understands ?_nuances_?, ; we
adore them., A fool says to a woman ?I love you?, ; the words mean nothing,
he might as well say ?Olli Batachor?, ; it is the _nuance_ which gives
force to the meaning.?, In 1839 Mrs. Austin writes to Victor Cousin: ?I
have seen young Gladstone, a distinguished Tory who wants to re-establish
education based on the Church in quite a Catholic form?, ; and we find her
corresponding with Mr. Gladstone on the subject of education., ?If you
are strong enough to provide motives and checks,?, she says to him, ?you
may do two blessed acts?reform your clergy and teach your people., As it
is, how few of them conceive what it is to teach a people?!, Mr.
Gladstone replies at great length, and in many letters, from which we may
quote this passage:

Lord Jeffrey has a very curious and suggestive letter on popular
education, in which he denies, or at least doubts, the effect of this
education on morals., He, however, supports it on the ground ?that it
will increase the enjoyment of individuals,?, which is certainly a very
sensible claim., Humboldt writes to her about an old Indian language
which was preserved by a parrot, the tribe who spoke it having been
exterminated, and about ?young Darwin,?, who had just published his first
book., Here are some extracts from her own letters:

In politics Mrs. Austin was a philosophical Tory., Radicalism she
detested, and she and most of her friends seem to have regarded it as
moribund., ?The Radical party is evidently effete,?, she writes to M.
Victor Cousin; the probable ?leader of the Tory party?, is Mr. Gladstone., ?The people must be instructed, must be guided, must be, in short,
governed,?, she writes elsewhere; and in a letter to Dr. Whewell, she says
that the state of things in France fills ?me with the deepest anxiety on
one point,?the point on which the permanency of our institutions and our
salvation as a nation turn., Are our higher classes able to keep the lead
of the rest?, If they are, we are safe; if not, I agree with my poor dear
Charles Buller?_our_ turn must come., Now Cambridge and Oxford must
really look to this.?, The belief in the power of the Universities to
stem the current of democracy is charming., She grew to regard Carlyle as
?one of the dissolvents of the age?as mischievous as his extravagances
will let him be?, ; speaks of Kingsley and Maurice as ?pernicious?, ; and
talks of John Stuart Mill as a ?demagogue.?, She was no _doctrinaire_., ?One ounce of education demanded is worth a pound imposed., It is no use
to give the meat before you give the hunger.?, She was delighted at a
letter of St. Hilaire?s, in which he said, ?We have a system and no
results; you have results and no system.?, Yet she had a deep sympathy
with the wants of the people., She was horrified at something Babbage
told her of the population of some of the manufacturing towns who are
_worked out_ before they attain to thirty years of age., ?But I am
persuaded that the remedy will not, cannot come from the people,?, she
adds., Many of her letters are concerned with the question of the higher
education of women., She discusses Buckle?s lecture on ?The Influence of
Women upon the Progress of Knowledge,?, admits to M. Guizot that women?s
intellectual life is largely coloured by the emotions, but adds: ?One is
not precisely a fool because one?s opinions are greatly influenced by
one?s affections., The opinions of men are often influenced by worse
things.?, Dr. Whewell consults her about lecturing women on Plato, being
slightly afraid lest people should think it ridiculous; Comte writes her
elaborate letters on the relation of women to progress; and Mr. Gladstone
promises that Mrs. Gladstone will carry out at Hawarden the suggestions
contained in one of her pamphlets., She was always very practical, and
never lost her admiration for plain sewing., All through the book we come across interesting and amusing things., She
gets St. Hilaire to order a large, sensible bonnet for her in Paris,
which was at once christened the ?Aristotelian,?, and was supposed to be
the only useful bonnet in England., Grote has to leave Paris after the
_coup d?, ?tat_, he tells her, because he cannot bear to see the
establishment of a Greek tyrant., Alfred de Vigny, Macaulay, John
Stirling, Southey, Alexis de Tocqueville, Hallam, and Jean Jacques Amp?re
all contribute to these pleasant pages., She seems to have inspired the
warmest feelings of friendship in those who knew her., Guizot writes to
her: ?Madame de Sta?l used to say that the best thing in the world was a
serious Frenchman., I turn the compliment, and say that the best thing in
the world is an affectionate Englishman., How much more an Englishwoman!, Given equal qualities, a woman is always more charming than a man.?, Lucie Austin, afterwards Lady Duff Gordon, was born in 1821., Her chief
playfellow was John Stuart Mill, and Jeremy Bentham?s garden was her
playground., ...]",2

mutterin?, and thunderin?, of a still evening., And he had a way of
standin?, quite still by the rock there in t?, path under Rydal, and folks
could hear sounds like a wild beast coming from the rocks, and childer
were scared fit to be dead a?most.?, But the corroboration comes in strange guise., Mr. Rawnsley asked one of
the Dalesmen about Wordsworth?s dress and habits., This was the reply:
?Wudsworth wore a Jem Crow, never seed him in a boxer in my life,?a Jem
Crow and an old blue cloak was his rig, and _as for his habits_, _he had
noan_; niver knew him with a pot i?, his hand, or a pipe i?, his mouth., But he was a gre?t skater, for a?, that?noan better in these parts?why, he
could cut his own na?me upo?, the ice, could Mr., Wudsworth.?, Skating
seems to have been Wordsworth?s one form of amusement., He was ?over
feckless i?, his hands?, ?could not drive or ride?, ?not a bit of fish in
him,?, and ?nowt of a mountaineer.?, But he could skate., The rapture of
the time when, as a boy, on Esthwaite?s frozen lake, he had

was continued, Mr. Rawnsley tells us, into manhood?s later day; and Mr.
Rawnsley found many proofs that the skill the poet had gained, when

was of such a kind as to astonish the natives among whom he dwelt., The
recollection of a fall he once had, when his skate caught on a stone,
still lingers in the district., A boy had been sent to sweep the snow
from the White Moss Tarn for him., ?Did Mr. Wudsworth gie ye owt??, he was
asked, when he returned from his labour., ?Na, but I seed him tumlle,
though!?, was the answer., ?He was a ter?ble girt skater, was Wudsworth
now,?, says one of Mr. Rawnsley?s informants; ?he would put one hand i?, his breast (he wore a frill shirt i?, them days), and t?, other hand i?, his
waistband, same as shepherds does to keep their hands warm, and he would
stand up straight and sway and swing away grandly.?, Of his poetry they did not think much, and whatever was good in it they
ascribed to his wife, his sister, and Hartley Coleridge., He wrote
poetry, they said, ?because he couldn?t help it?because it was his
hobby?, ?for sheer love, and not for money., They could not understand his
doing work ?for nowt,?, and held his occupation in somewhat light esteem
because it did not bring in ?a deal o?, brass to the pocket.?, ?Did you
ever read his poetry, or see any books about in the farmhouses??, asked
Mr. Rawnsley., The answer was curious: ?Ay, ay, time or two., But ya?re
weel aware there?s potry and potry., There?s potry wi?, a li?le bit
pleasant in it, and potry sic as a man can laugh at or the childer
understand, and some as takes a deal of mastery to make out what?s said,
and a deal of Wudsworth?s was this sort, ye kna., You could tell fra the
man?s faace his potry would niver have no laugh in it., His potry was
quite different work from li?le Hartley., Hartley ?ud goa running along
beside o?, the brooks and mak his, and goa in the first oppen door and
write what he had got upo?, paper., But Wudsworth?s potry was real hard
stuff, and bided a deal of makking, and he?d keep it in his head for long
enough., Eh, but it?s queer, mon, different ways folks hes of making
potry now., ., ., ., Not but what Mr. Wudsworth didn?t stand very high, and
was a well-spoken man enough.?, The best criticism on Wordsworth that Mr.
Rawnsley heard was this: ?He was an open-air man, and a great critic of
trees.?, There are many useful and well-written essays in Professor Knight?s
volume, but Mr. Rawnsley?s is far the most interesting of all., It gives
us a graphic picture of the poet as he appeared in outward semblance and
manner to those about whom he wrote., Mr. Swinburne once set his age on fire by a volume of very perfect and
very poisonous poetry., Then he became revolutionary and pantheistic, and
cried out against those that sit in high places both in heaven and on
earth., Then he invented Marie Stuart and laid upon us the heavy burden
of _Bothwell_., Then he retired to the nursery and wrote poems about
children of a somewhat over-subtle character., He is now extremely
patriotic, and manages to combine with his patriotism a strong affection
for the Tory party., He has always been a great poet., But he has his
limitations, the chief of which is, curiously enough, the entire lack of
any sense of limit., His song is nearly always too loud for his subject., His magnificent rhetoric, nowhere more magnificent than in the volume
that now lies before us, conceals rather than reveals., It has been said
of him, and with truth, that he is a master of language, but with still
greater truth it may be said that Language is his master., Words seem to
dominate him., Alliteration tyrannizes over him., Mere sound often
becomes his lord., He is so eloquent that whatever he touches becomes
unreal., Let us turn to the poem on the Armada:

Somehow we seem to have heard all this before., Does it come from the
fact that of all the poets who ever lived Mr. Swinburne is the one who is
the most limited in imagery?, It must be admitted that he is so., He has
wearied us with his monotony., ?Fire?, and the ?Sea?, are the two words
ever on his lips., We must confess also that this shrill
singing?marvellous as it is?leaves us out of breath., Here is a passage
from a poem called _A Word with the Wind_:

Verse of this kind may be justly praised for the sustained strength and
vigour of its metrical scheme., Its purely technical excellence is
extraordinary., But is it more than an oratorical _tour de force_?, Does
it really convey much?, Does it charm?, Could we return to it again and
again with renewed pleasure?, We think not., It seems to us empty., Of course, we must not look to these poems for any revelation of human
life., To be at one with the elements seems to be Mr. Swinburne?s aim., He seeks to speak with the breath of wind and wave., The roar of the fire
is ever in his ears., He puts his clarion to the lips of Spring and bids
her blow, and the Earth wakes from her dreams and tells him her secret., He is the first lyric poet who has tried to make an absolute surrender of
his own personality, and he has succeeded., We hear the song, but we
never know the singer., We never even get near to him., Out of the
thunder and splendour of words he himself says nothing., ...]",2
110,"[Better to accept a country-house as a gift than to be in debt
to one?s landlady!, On the whole, the patron was an excellent
institution, if not for poetry at least for the poets; ., ., ., every poet
longs for a M?cenas., The two things the Greeks valued most in actors were grace of gesture and
music of voice., Indeed, to gain these virtues their actors used to
subject themselves to a regular course of gymnastics and a particular
regime of diet, health being to the Greeks not merely a quality of art,
but a condition of its production., One should not be too severe on English novels: they are the only
relaxation of the intellectually unemployed., Most modern novels are more remarkable for their crime than for their
culture., Not that a tramp?s mode of life is at all unsuited to the development of
the poetic faculty., Far from it!, He, if any one, should possess that
freedom of mood which is so essential to the artist, for he has no taxes
to pay and no relations to worry him., The man who possesses a permanent
address, and whose name is to be found in the Directory, is necessarily
limited and localized., Only the tramp has absolute liberty of living., Was not Homer himself a vagrant, and did not Thespis go about in a
caravan?, In art as in life the law of heredity holds good., _On est toujours fils
de quelqu?un_., He has succeeded in studying a fine poet without stealing from him?a very
difficult thing to do., Morocco is a sort of paradox among countries, for though it lies westward
of Piccadilly, yet it is purely Oriental in character, and though it is
but three hours?, sail from Europe, yet it makes you feel (to use the
forcible expression of an American writer) as if you had been taken up by
the scruff of the neck and set down in the Old Testament., As children themselves are the perfect flowers of life, so a collection
of the best poems written on children should be the most perfect of all
anthologies., No English poet has written of children with more love and grace and
delicacy [than Herrick]., His _Ode on the Birth of Our Saviour_, his poem
_To His Saviour_, _A Child_: _A Present by a Child_, his _Graces for
Children_, and his many lovely epitaphs on children are all of them
exquisite works of art, simple, sweet and sincere., As the cross-benches form a refuge for those who have no minds to make
up, so those who cannot make up their minds always take to Homeric
studies., Many of our leaders have sulked in their tents with Achilles
after some violent political crisis and, enraged at the fickleness of
fortune, more than one has given up to poetry what was obviously meant
for party., There are two ways of misunderstanding a poem., One is to misunderstand
it and the other to praise it for qualities it does not possess., Most modern calendars mar the sweet simplicity of our lives by reminding
us that each day that passes is the anniversary of some perfectly
uninteresting event., It is true that such aphorisms as

can hardly be said to belong to the very highest order of poetry, still,
they are preferable, on the whole, to the date of Hannah More?s birth, or
of the burning down of Exeter Change, or of the opening of the Great
Exhibition; and though it would be dangerous to make calendars the basis
of Culture, we should all be much improved if we began each day with a
fine passage of English poetry., Even the most uninteresting poet cannot survive bad editing., Prefixed to the Calendar is an introductory note ., ., ., displaying that
intimate acquaintance with Sappho?s lost poems which is the privilege
only of those who are not acquainted with Greek literature., Mediocre critics are usually safe in their generalities; it is in their
reasons and examples that they come so lamentably to grief., All premature panegyrics bring their own punishment upon themselves., No one survives being over-estimated., Henry Wadsworth Longfellow was one of the first true men of letters
America produced, and as such deserves a high place in any history of
American civilization., To a land out of breath in its greed for gain he
showed the example of a life devoted entirely to the study of literature;
his lectures, though not by any means brilliant, were still productive of
much good; he had a most charming and gracious personality, and he wrote
some pretty poems., But his poems are not of the kind that call for
intellectual analysis or for elaborate description or, indeed, for any
serious discussion at all., Though the _Psalm of Life_ be shouted from Maine to California, that
would not make it true poetry., Longfellow has no imitators, for of echoes themselves there are no echoes
and it is only style that makes a school., Poe?s marvellous lines _To Helen_, a poem as beautiful as a Greek gem and
as musical as Apollo?s lute., Good novelists are much rarer than good sons, and none of us would part
readily with Micawber and Mrs. Nickleby., Still, the fact remains that a
man who was affectionate and loving to his children, generous and
warm-hearted to his friends, and whose books are the very bacchanalia of
benevolence, pilloried his parents to make the groundlings laugh, and
this fact every biographer of Dickens should face and, if possible,
explain., No age ever borrows the slang of its predecessor., What we do not know about Shakespeare is a most fascinating subject, and
one that would fill a volume, but what we do know about him is so meagre
and inadequate that when it is collected together the result is rather
depressing., They show a want of knowledge that must be the result of years of study., Rossetti?s was a great personality, and personalities such as his do not
easily survive shilling primers., We are sorry to find an English dramatic critic misquoting Shakespeare,
as we had always been of opinion that this was a privilege reserved
specially for our English actors., Biographies of this kind rob life of much of its dignity and its wonder,
add to death itself a new terror, and make one wish that all art were
anonymous., A pillar of fire to the few who knew him, and of cloud to the many who
knew him not, Dante Gabriel Rossetti lived apart from the gossip and
tittle-tattle of a shallow age., He never trafficked with the merchants
for his soul, nor brought his wares into the market-place for the idle to
gape at., Passionate and romantic though he was, yet there was in his
nature something of high austerity., He loved seclusion, and hated
notoriety, and would have shuddered at the idea that within a few years
after his death he was to make his appearance in a series of popular
biographies, sandwiched between the author of _Pickwick_ and the Great
Lexicographer., We sincerely hope that a few more novels like these will be published, as
the public will then find out that a bad book is very dear at a shilling., The only form of fiction in which real characters do not seem out of
place is history., In novels they are detestable., Shilling literature is always making demands on our credulity without
ever appealing to our imagination., Pathology is rapidly becoming the basis of sensational literature, and in
art, as in politics, there is a great future for monsters., It is only mediocrities and old maids who consider it a grievance to be
misunderstood., As truly religious people are resigned to everything, even to mediocre
poetry, there is no reason at all why Madame Guyon?s verses should not be
popular with a large section of the community., A simile committing suicide is always a depressing spectacle., Such novels as _Scamp_ are possibly more easy to write than they are to
read., We have no doubt that when Bailey wrote to Lord Houghton that
common-sense and gentleness were Keats?s two special characteristics the
worthy Archdeacon meant extremely well, but we prefer the real Keats,
with his passionate wilfulness, his fantastic moods and his fine
inconsistence., Part of Keats?s charm as a man is his fascinating
incompleteness., The Apostolic dictum, that women should not be suffered to teach, is no
longer applicable to a society such as ours, with its solidarity of
interests, its recognition of natural rights, and its universal
education, however suitable it may have been to the Greek cities under
Roman rule., Nothing in the United States struck me more than the fact
that the remarkable intellectual progress of that country is very largely
due to the efforts of American women, who edit many of the most powerful
magazines and newspapers, take part in the discussion of every question
of public interest, and exercise an important influence upon the growth
and tendencies of literature and art., Indeed, the women of America are
the one class in the community that enjoys that leisure which is so
necessary for culture., The men are, as a rule, so absorbed in business,
that the task of bringing some element of form into the chaos of daily
life is left almost entirely to the opposite sex, and an eminent
Bostonian once assured me that in the twentieth century the whole culture
of his country would be in petticoats., By that time, however, it is
probable that the dress of the two sexes will be assimilated, as
similarity of costume always follows similarity of pursuits., The aim of social comedy, in Menander no less than in Sheridan, is to
mirror the manners, not to reform the morals, of its day, and the censure
of the Puritan, whether real or affected, is always out of place in
literary criticism, and shows a want of recognition of the essential
distinction between art and life., After all, it is only the Philistine
who thinks of blaming Jack Absolute for his deception, Bob Acres for his
cowardice, and Charles Surface for his extravagance, and there is very
little use in airing one?s moral sense at the expense of one?s artistic
appreciation., The _?neid_ bears almost the same relation to the _Iliad_ that the
_Idylls of the King_ do to the old Celtic romances of Arthur., Like them
it is full of felicitous modernisms, of exquisite literary echoes and of
delicate and delightful pictures; as Lord Tennyson loves England so did
Virgil love Rome; the pageants of history and the purple of empire are
equally dear to both poets; but neither of them has the grand simplicity
or the large humanity of the early singers, and, as a hero, ?neas is no
less a failure than Arthur., There is always a certain amount of danger in any attempt to cultivate
impossible virtues., As far as the serious presentation of life is concerned, what we require
is more imaginative treatment, greater freedom from theatric language and
theatric convention., It may be questioned, also, whether the consistent
reward of virtue and punishment of wickedness be really the healthiest
ideal for an art that claims to mirror nature., True originality is to be found rather in the use made of a model than in
the rejection of all models and masters., _Dans l?art comme dans la
nature on est toujours fils de quelqu?un_, and we should not quarrel with
the reed if it whispers to us the music of the lyre., A little child once
asked me if it was the nightingale who taught the linnets how to sing., In France they have had one great genius, Balzac, who invented the modern
method of looking at life; and one great artist, Flaubert, who is the
impeccable master of style; and to the influence of these two men we may
trace almost all contemporary French fiction., But in England we have had
no schools worth speaking of., The fiery torch lit by the Bront?s has not
been passed on to other hands; Dickens has influenced only journalism;
Thackeray?s delightful superficial philosophy, superb narrative power,
and clever social satire have found no echoes; nor has Trollope left any
direct successors behind him?a fact which is not much to be regretted,
however, as, admirable though Trollope undoubtedly is for rainy
afternoons and tedious railway journeys, from the point of view of
literature he is merely the perpetual curate of Pudlington Parva., George Meredith?s style is chaos illumined by brilliant flashes of
lightning., As a writer he has mastered everything, except language; as a
novelist he can do everything, except tell a story; as an artist he is
everything, except articulate., Too strange to be popular, too individual
to have imitators, the author of _Richard Feverel_ stands absolutely
alone., It is easy to disarm criticism, but he has disarmed the disciple., He gives us his philosophy through the medium of wit, and is never so
pathetic as when he is humorous., To turn truth into a paradox is not
difficult, but George Meredith makes all his paradoxes truths, and no
Theseus can thread his labyrinth, no ?dipus solve his secret., The most perfect and the most poisonous of all modern French poets once
remarked that a man can live for three days without bread, but that no
one can live for three days without poetry., This, however, can hardly be
said to be a popular view, or one that commends itself to that curiously
uncommon quality which is called common-sense., I fancy that most people,
if they do not actually prefer a salmis to a sonnet, certainly like their
culture to repose on a basis of good cookery., A cynical critic once remarked that no great poet is intelligible and no
little poet worth understanding, but that otherwise poetry is an
admirable thing., This, however, seems to us a somewhat harsh view of the
subject., Little poets are an extremely interesting study., The best of
them have often some new beauty to show us, and though the worst of them
may bore yet they rarely brutalize., It is a curious thing that when minor poets write choruses to a play they
should always consider it necessary to adopt the style and language of a
bad translator., We fear that Mr. Bohn has much to answer for., In one sonnet he makes a distinct attempt to be original and the result
is extremely depressing., ...]",2

cried Lord Henry, laughing; and the two young men went out into the
garden together and ensconced themselves on a long bamboo seat that
stood in the shade of a tall laurel bush., The sunlight slipped over
the polished leaves., In the grass, white daisies were tremulous., After a pause, Lord Henry pulled out his watch., ""I am afraid I must be
going, Basil,"" he murmured, ""and before I go, I insist on your
answering a question I put to you some time ago."", ""What is that?"", said the painter, keeping his eyes fixed on the ground., ""You know quite well."", ""I do not, Harry."", ""Well, I will tell you what it is., I want you to explain to me why you
won't exhibit Dorian Gray's picture., I want the real reason."", ""I told you the real reason."", ""No, you did not., You said it was because there was too much of
yourself in it., Now, that is childish."", ""Harry,"" said Basil Hallward, looking him straight in the face, ""every
portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist, not
of the sitter., The sitter is merely the accident, the occasion., It is
not he who is revealed by the painter; it is rather the painter who, on
the coloured canvas, reveals himself., The reason I will not exhibit
this picture is that I am afraid that I have shown in it the secret of
my own soul."", Lord Henry laughed., ""And what is that?"", he asked., ""I will tell you,"" said Hallward; but an expression of perplexity came
over his face., ""I am all expectation, Basil,"" continued his companion, glancing at him., ""Oh, there is really very little to tell, Harry,"" answered the painter;
""and I am afraid you will hardly understand it., Perhaps you will
hardly believe it."", Lord Henry smiled, and leaning down, plucked a pink-petalled daisy from
the grass and examined it., ""I am quite sure I shall understand it,"" he
replied, gazing intently at the little golden, white-feathered disk,
""and as for believing things, I can believe anything, provided that it
is quite incredible."", The wind shook some blossoms from the trees, and the heavy
lilac-blooms, with their clustering stars, moved to and fro in the
languid air., A grasshopper began to chirrup by the wall, and like a
blue thread a long thin dragon-fly floated past on its brown gauze
wings., Lord Henry felt as if he could hear Basil Hallward's heart
beating, and wondered what was coming., ""The story is simply this,"" said the painter after some time., ""Two
months ago I went to a crush at Lady Brandon's., You know we poor
artists have to show ourselves in society from time to time, just to
remind the public that we are not savages., With an evening coat and a
white tie, as you told me once, anybody, even a stock-broker, can gain
a reputation for being civilized., Well, after I had been in the room
about ten minutes, talking to huge overdressed dowagers and tedious
academicians, I suddenly became conscious that some one was looking at
me., I turned half-way round and saw Dorian Gray for the first time., When our eyes met, I felt that I was growing pale., A curious sensation
of terror came over me., I knew that I had come face to face with some
one whose mere personality was so fascinating that, if I allowed it to
do so, it would absorb my whole nature, my whole soul, my very art
itself., I did not want any external influence in my life., You know
yourself, Harry, how independent I am by nature., I have always been my
own master; had at least always been so, till I met Dorian Gray., Then--but I don't know how to explain it to you., Something seemed to
tell me that I was on the verge of a terrible crisis in my life., I had
a strange feeling that fate had in store for me exquisite joys and
exquisite sorrows., I grew afraid and turned to quit the room., It was
not conscience that made me do so:  it was a sort of cowardice., I take
no credit to myself for trying to escape."", ""Conscience and cowardice are really the same things, Basil., Conscience is the trade-name of the firm., That is all."", ""I don't believe that, Harry, and I don't believe you do either., However, whatever was my motive--and it may have been pride, for I used
to be very proud--I certainly struggled to the door., There, of course,
I stumbled against Lady Brandon., 'You are not going to run away so
soon, Mr., Hallward?', she screamed out., You know her curiously shrill
voice?"", ""Yes; she is a peacock in everything but beauty,"" said Lord Henry,
pulling the daisy to bits with his long nervous fingers., ""I could not get rid of her., She brought me up to royalties, and
people with stars and garters, and elderly ladies with gigantic tiaras
and parrot noses., She spoke of me as her dearest friend., I had only
met her once before, but she took it into her head to lionize me., I
believe some picture of mine had made a great success at the time, at
least had been chattered about in the penny newspapers, which is the
nineteenth-century standard of immortality., Suddenly I found myself
face to face with the young man whose personality had so strangely
stirred me., We were quite close, almost touching., Our eyes met again., It was reckless of me, but I asked Lady Brandon to introduce me to him., Perhaps it was not so reckless, after all., It was simply inevitable., We would have spoken to each other without any introduction., I am sure
of that., Dorian told me so afterwards., He, too, felt that we were
destined to know each other."", ""And how did Lady Brandon describe this wonderful young man?"", asked his
companion., ""I know she goes in for giving a rapid _precis_ of all her
guests., I remember her bringing me up to a truculent and red-faced old
gentleman covered all over with orders and ribbons, and hissing into my
ear, in a tragic whisper which must have been perfectly audible to
everybody in the room, the most astounding details., I simply fled., I
like to find out people for myself., But Lady Brandon treats her guests
exactly as an auctioneer treats his goods., She either explains them
entirely away, or tells one everything about them except what one wants
to know."", ""Poor Lady Brandon!, You are hard on her, Harry!"", said Hallward
listlessly., ""My dear fellow, she tried to found a _salon_, and only succeeded in
opening a restaurant., How could I admire her?, But tell me, what did
she say about Mr. Dorian Gray?"", ""Oh, something like, 'Charming boy--poor dear mother and I absolutely
inseparable., Quite forget what he does--afraid he--doesn't do
anything--oh, yes, plays the piano--or is it the violin, dear Mr., Gray?', Neither of us could help laughing, and we became friends at
once."", ""Laughter is not at all a bad beginning for a friendship, and it is far
the best ending for one,"" said the young lord, plucking another daisy., Hallward shook his head., ""You don't understand what friendship is,
Harry,"" he murmured--""or what enmity is, for that matter., You like
every one; that is to say, you are indifferent to every one."", ""How horribly unjust of you!"", ...]",2
112,"[There is some answer to you, but I cannot find it., Don't
speak., Let me think., Or, rather, let me try not to think."", For nearly ten minutes he stood there, motionless, with parted lips and
eyes strangely bright., He was dimly conscious that entirely fresh
influences were at work within him., Yet they seemed to him to have
come really from himself., The few words that Basil's friend had said
to him--words spoken by chance, no doubt, and with wilful paradox in
them--had touched some secret chord that had never been touched before,
but that he felt was now vibrating and throbbing to curious pulses., Music had stirred him like that., Music had troubled him many times., But music was not articulate., It was not a new world, but rather
another chaos, that it created in us., Words!, Mere words!, How
terrible they were!, How clear, and vivid, and cruel!, One could not
escape from them., And yet what a subtle magic there was in them!, They
seemed to be able to give a plastic form to formless things, and to
have a music of their own as sweet as that of viol or of lute., Mere
words!, Was there anything so real as words?, Yes; there had been things in his boyhood that he had not understood., He understood them now., Life suddenly became fiery-coloured to him., It seemed to him that he had been walking in fire., Why had he not
known it?, With his subtle smile, Lord Henry watched him., He knew the precise
psychological moment when to say nothing., He felt intensely
interested., He was amazed at the sudden impression that his words had
produced, and, remembering a book that he had read when he was sixteen,
a book which had revealed to him much that he had not known before, he
wondered whether Dorian Gray was passing through a similar experience., He had merely shot an arrow into the air., Had it hit the mark?, How
fascinating the lad was!, Hallward painted away with that marvellous bold touch of his, that had
the true refinement and perfect delicacy that in art, at any rate comes
only from strength., He was unconscious of the silence., ""Basil, I am tired of standing,"" cried Dorian Gray suddenly., ""I must
go out and sit in the garden., The air is stifling here."", ""My dear fellow, I am so sorry., When I am painting, I can't think of
anything else., But you never sat better., You were perfectly still., And I have caught the effect I wanted--the half-parted lips and the
bright look in the eyes., I don't know what Harry has been saying to
you, but he has certainly made you have the most wonderful expression., I suppose he has been paying you compliments., You mustn't believe a
word that he says."", ""He has certainly not been paying me compliments., Perhaps that is the
reason that I don't believe anything he has told me."", ""You know you believe it all,"" said Lord Henry, looking at him with his
dreamy languorous eyes., ""I will go out to the garden with you., It is
horribly hot in the studio., Basil, let us have something iced to
drink, something with strawberries in it."", ""Certainly, Harry., Just touch the bell, and when Parker comes I will
tell him what you want., I have got to work up this background, so I
will join you later on., Don't keep Dorian too long., I have never been
in better form for painting than I am to-day., This is going to be my
masterpiece., It is my masterpiece as it stands."", Lord Henry went out to the garden and found Dorian Gray burying his
face in the great cool lilac-blossoms, feverishly drinking in their
perfume as if it had been wine., He came close to him and put his hand
upon his shoulder., ""You are quite right to do that,"" he murmured., ""Nothing can cure the soul but the senses, just as nothing can cure the
senses but the soul."", The lad started and drew back., He was bareheaded, and the leaves had
tossed his rebellious curls and tangled all their gilded threads., There was a look of fear in his eyes, such as people have when they are
suddenly awakened., His finely chiselled nostrils quivered, and some
hidden nerve shook the scarlet of his lips and left them trembling., ""Yes,"" continued Lord Henry, ""that is one of the great secrets of
life--to cure the soul by means of the senses, and the senses by means
of the soul., You are a wonderful creation., You know more than you
think you know, just as you know less than you want to know."", Dorian Gray frowned and turned his head away., He could not help liking
the tall, graceful young man who was standing by him., His romantic,
olive-coloured face and worn expression interested him., There was
something in his low languid voice that was absolutely fascinating., His cool, white, flowerlike hands, even, had a curious charm., They
moved, as he spoke, like music, and seemed to have a language of their
own., But he felt afraid of him, and ashamed of being afraid., Why had
it been left for a stranger to reveal him to himself?, He had known
Basil Hallward for months, but the friendship between them had never
altered him., Suddenly there had come some one across his life who
seemed to have disclosed to him life's mystery., And, yet, what was
there to be afraid of?, He was not a schoolboy or a girl., It was
absurd to be frightened., ""Let us go and sit in the shade,"" said Lord Henry., ""Parker has brought
out the drinks, and if you stay any longer in this glare, you will be
quite spoiled, and Basil will never paint you again., You really must
not allow yourself to become sunburnt., It would be unbecoming."", ""What can it matter?"", cried Dorian Gray, laughing, as he sat down on
the seat at the end of the garden., ""It should matter everything to you, Mr., Gray."", ""Why?"", ""Because you have the most marvellous youth, and youth is the one thing
worth having."", ""I don't feel that, Lord Henry."", ""No, you don't feel it now., Some day, when you are old and wrinkled
and ugly, when thought has seared your forehead with its lines, and
passion branded your lips with its hideous fires, you will feel it, you
will feel it terribly., Now, wherever you go, you charm the world., Will it always be so?, ... You have a wonderfully beautiful face, Mr.
Gray., Don't frown., ...]",2
113,"[""Yes, Basil?"", ""Remember what I asked you, when we were in the garden this morning."", ""I have forgotten it."", ""I trust you."", ""I wish I could trust myself,"" said Lord Henry, laughing., ""Come, Mr.
Gray, my hansom is outside, and I can drop you at your own place., Good-bye, Basil., It has been a most interesting afternoon."", As the door closed behind them, the painter flung himself down on a
sofa, and a look of pain came into his face., At half-past twelve next day Lord Henry Wotton strolled from Curzon
Street over to the Albany to call on his uncle, Lord Fermor, a genial
if somewhat rough-mannered old bachelor, whom the outside world called
selfish because it derived no particular benefit from him, but who was
considered generous by Society as he fed the people who amused him., His father had been our ambassador at Madrid when Isabella was young
and Prim unthought of, but had retired from the diplomatic service in a
capricious moment of annoyance on not being offered the Embassy at
Paris, a post to which he considered that he was fully entitled by
reason of his birth, his indolence, the good English of his dispatches,
and his inordinate passion for pleasure., The son, who had been his
father's secretary, had resigned along with his chief, somewhat
foolishly as was thought at the time, and on succeeding some months
later to the title, had set himself to the serious study of the great
aristocratic art of doing absolutely nothing., He had two large town
houses, but preferred to live in chambers as it was less trouble, and
took most of his meals at his club., He paid some attention to the
management of his collieries in the Midland counties, excusing himself
for this taint of industry on the ground that the one advantage of
having coal was that it enabled a gentleman to afford the decency of
burning wood on his own hearth., In politics he was a Tory, except when
the Tories were in office, during which period he roundly abused them
for being a pack of Radicals., He was a hero to his valet, who bullied
him, and a terror to most of his relations, whom he bullied in turn., Only England could have produced him, and he always said that the
country was going to the dogs., His principles were out of date, but
there was a good deal to be said for his prejudices., When Lord Henry entered the room, he found his uncle sitting in a rough
shooting-coat, smoking a cheroot and grumbling over _The Times_., ""Well,
Harry,"" said the old gentleman, ""what brings you out so early?, I
thought you dandies never got up till two, and were not visible till
five."", ""Pure family affection, I assure you, Uncle George., I want to get
something out of you."", ""Money, I suppose,"" said Lord Fermor, making a wry face., ""Well, sit
down and tell me all about it., Young people, nowadays, imagine that
money is everything."", ""Yes,"" murmured Lord Henry, settling his button-hole in his coat; ""and
when they grow older they know it., But I don't want money., It is only
people who pay their bills who want that, Uncle George, and I never pay
mine., Credit is the capital of a younger son, and one lives charmingly
upon it., Besides, I always deal with Dartmoor's tradesmen, and
consequently they never bother me., What I want is information:  not
useful information, of course; useless information."", ""Well, I can tell you anything that is in an English Blue Book, Harry,
although those fellows nowadays write a lot of nonsense., When I was in
the Diplomatic, things were much better., But I hear they let them in
now by examination., What can you expect?, Examinations, sir, are pure
humbug from beginning to end., If a man is a gentleman, he knows quite
enough, and if he is not a gentleman, whatever he knows is bad for him."", ""Mr. Dorian Gray does not belong to Blue Books, Uncle George,"" said
Lord Henry languidly., ""Mr. Dorian Gray?, Who is he?"", asked Lord Fermor, knitting his bushy
white eyebrows., ""That is what I have come to learn, Uncle George., Or rather, I know
who he is., He is the last Lord Kelso's grandson., His mother was a
Devereux, Lady Margaret Devereux., I want you to tell me about his
mother., What was she like?, Whom did she marry?, You have known nearly
everybody in your time, so you might have known her., I am very much
interested in Mr. Gray at present., I have only just met him."", ""Kelso's grandson!"", echoed the old gentleman., ""Kelso's grandson!, ...
Of course...., I knew his mother intimately., I believe I was at her
christening., She was an extraordinarily beautiful girl, Margaret
Devereux, and made all the men frantic by running away with a penniless
young fellow--a mere nobody, sir, a subaltern in a foot regiment, or
something of that kind., Certainly., I remember the whole thing as if
it happened yesterday., The poor chap was killed in a duel at Spa a few
months after the marriage., There was an ugly story about it., They
said Kelso got some rascally adventurer, some Belgian brute, to insult
his son-in-law in public--paid him, sir, to do it, paid him--and that
the fellow spitted his man as if he had been a pigeon., The thing was
hushed up, but, egad, Kelso ate his chop alone at the club for some
time afterwards., He brought his daughter back with him, I was told,
and she never spoke to him again., Oh, yes; it was a bad business., The
girl died, too, died within a year., So she left a son, did she?, I had
forgotten that., What sort of boy is he?, If he is like his mother, he
must be a good-looking chap."", ""He is very good-looking,"" assented Lord Henry., ""I hope he will fall into proper hands,"" continued the old man., ""He
should have a pot of money waiting for him if Kelso did the right thing
by him., His mother had money, too., All the Selby property came to
her, through her grandfather., Her grandfather hated Kelso, thought him
a mean dog., He was, too., Came to Madrid once when I was there., Egad,
I was ashamed of him., The Queen used to ask me about the English noble
who was always quarrelling with the cabmen about their fares., They
made quite a story of it., I didn't dare show my face at Court for a
month., I hope he treated his grandson better than he did the jarvies."", ""I don't know,"" answered Lord Henry., ""I fancy that the boy will be
well off., He is not of age yet., He has Selby, I know., He told me so., And ... his mother was very beautiful?"", ""Margaret Devereux was one of the loveliest creatures I ever saw,
Harry., What on earth induced her to behave as she did, I never could
understand., She could have married anybody she chose., Carlington was
mad after her., She was romantic, though., All the women of that family
were., The men were a poor lot, but, egad!, the women were wonderful., Carlington went on his knees to her., ...]",2
114,"[""How late you
are, Harry!"", he murmured., ""I am afraid it is not Harry, Mr. Gray,"" answered a shrill voice., He glanced quickly round and rose to his feet., ""I beg your pardon., I
thought--""

""You thought it was my husband., It is only his wife., You must let me
introduce myself., I know you quite well by your photographs., I think
my husband has got seventeen of them."", ""Not seventeen, Lady Henry?"", ""Well, eighteen, then., And I saw you with him the other night at the
opera."", She laughed nervously as she spoke, and watched him with her
vague forget-me-not eyes., She was a curious woman, whose dresses
always looked as if they had been designed in a rage and put on in a
tempest., She was usually in love with somebody, and, as her passion
was never returned, she had kept all her illusions., She tried to look
picturesque, but only succeeded in being untidy., Her name was
Victoria, and she had a perfect mania for going to church., ""That was at Lohengrin, Lady Henry, I think?"", ""Yes; it was at dear Lohengrin., I like Wagner's music better than
anybody's., It is so loud that one can talk the whole time without other
people hearing what one says., That is a great advantage, don't you
think so, Mr., Gray?"", The same nervous staccato laugh broke from her thin lips, and her
fingers began to play with a long tortoise-shell paper-knife., Dorian smiled and shook his head:  ""I am afraid I don't think so, Lady
Henry., I never talk during music--at least, during good music., If one
hears bad music, it is one's duty to drown it in conversation."", ""Ah!, that is one of Harry's views, isn't it, Mr. Gray?, I always hear
Harry's views from his friends., It is the only way I get to know of
them., But you must not think I don't like good music., I adore it, but
I am afraid of it., It makes me too romantic., I have simply worshipped
pianists--two at a time, sometimes, Harry tells me., I don't know what
it is about them., Perhaps it is that they are foreigners., They all
are, ain't they?, Even those that are born in England become foreigners
after a time, don't they?, It is so clever of them, and such a
compliment to art., Makes it quite cosmopolitan, doesn't it?, You have
never been to any of my parties, have you, Mr. Gray?, You must come., I
can't afford orchids, but I spare no expense in foreigners., They make
one's rooms look so picturesque., But here is Harry!, Harry, I came in
to look for you, to ask you something--I forget what it was--and I
found Mr. Gray here., We have had such a pleasant chat about music., We
have quite the same ideas., No; I think our ideas are quite different., But he has been most pleasant., I am so glad I've seen him."", ""I am charmed, my love, quite charmed,"" said Lord Henry, elevating his
dark, crescent-shaped eyebrows and looking at them both with an amused
smile., ""So sorry I am late, Dorian., I went to look after a piece of
old brocade in Wardour Street and had to bargain for hours for it., Nowadays people know the price of everything and the value of nothing."", ""I am afraid I must be going,"" exclaimed Lady Henry, breaking an
awkward silence with her silly sudden laugh., ""I have promised to drive
with the duchess., Good-bye, Mr. Gray., Good-bye, Harry., You are
dining out, I suppose?, So am I., Perhaps I shall see you at Lady
Thornbury's."", ""I dare say, my dear,"" said Lord Henry, shutting the door behind her
as, looking like a bird of paradise that had been out all night in the
rain, she flitted out of the room, leaving a faint odour of
frangipanni., Then he lit a cigarette and flung himself down on the
sofa., ""Never marry a woman with straw-coloured hair, Dorian,"" he said after a
few puffs., ""Why, Harry?"", ""Because they are so sentimental."", ""But I like sentimental people."", ""Never marry at all, Dorian., Men marry because they are tired; women,
because they are curious:  both are disappointed."", ""I don't think I am likely to marry, Harry., I am too much in love., That is one of your aphorisms., I am putting it into practice, as I do
everything that you say."", ""Who are you in love with?"", asked Lord Henry after a pause., ""With an actress,"" said Dorian Gray, blushing., Lord Henry shrugged his shoulders., ""That is a rather commonplace
_debut_."", ""You would not say so if you saw her, Harry."", ""Who is she?"", ""Her name is Sibyl Vane."", ""Never heard of her."", ""No one has., People will some day, however., She is a genius."", ""My dear boy, no woman is a genius., Women are a decorative sex., They
never have anything to say, but they say it charmingly., Women
represent the triumph of matter over mind, just as men represent the
triumph of mind over morals."", ""Harry, how can you?"", ""My dear Dorian, it is quite true., I am analysing women at present, so
I ought to know., The subject is not so abstruse as I thought it was., I find that, ultimately, there are only two kinds of women, the plain
and the coloured., The plain women are very useful., If you want to
gain a reputation for respectability, you have merely to take them down
to supper., The other women are very charming., ...]",2
115,"[The others write the poetry that they
dare not realize."", ""I wonder is that really so, Harry?"", said Dorian Gray, putting some
perfume on his handkerchief out of a large, gold-topped bottle that
stood on the table., ""It must be, if you say it., And now I am off., Imogen is waiting for me., Don't forget about to-morrow., Good-bye."", As he left the room, Lord Henry's heavy eyelids drooped, and he began
to think., Certainly few people had ever interested him so much as
Dorian Gray, and yet the lad's mad adoration of some one else caused
him not the slightest pang of annoyance or jealousy., He was pleased by
it., It made him a more interesting study., He had been always
enthralled by the methods of natural science, but the ordinary
subject-matter of that science had seemed to him trivial and of no
import., And so he had begun by vivisecting himself, as he had ended by
vivisecting others., Human life--that appeared to him the one thing
worth investigating., Compared to it there was nothing else of any
value., It was true that as one watched life in its curious crucible of
pain and pleasure, one could not wear over one's face a mask of glass,
nor keep the sulphurous fumes from troubling the brain and making the
imagination turbid with monstrous fancies and misshapen dreams., There
were poisons so subtle that to know their properties one had to sicken
of them., There were maladies so strange that one had to pass through
them if one sought to understand their nature., And, yet, what a great
reward one received!, How wonderful the whole world became to one!, To
note the curious hard logic of passion, and the emotional coloured life
of the intellect--to observe where they met, and where they separated,
at what point they were in unison, and at what point they were at
discord--there was a delight in that!, What matter what the cost was?, One could never pay too high a price for any sensation., He was conscious--and the thought brought a gleam of pleasure into his
brown agate eyes--that it was through certain words of his, musical
words said with musical utterance, that Dorian Gray's soul had turned
to this white girl and bowed in worship before her., To a large extent
the lad was his own creation., He had made him premature., That was
something., Ordinary people waited till life disclosed to them its
secrets, but to the few, to the elect, the mysteries of life were
revealed before the veil was drawn away., Sometimes this was the effect
of art, and chiefly of the art of literature, which dealt immediately
with the passions and the intellect., But now and then a complex
personality took the place and assumed the office of art, was indeed,
in its way, a real work of art, life having its elaborate masterpieces,
just as poetry has, or sculpture, or painting., Yes, the lad was premature., He was gathering his harvest while it was
yet spring., The pulse and passion of youth were in him, but he was
becoming self-conscious., It was delightful to watch him., With his
beautiful face, and his beautiful soul, he was a thing to wonder at., It was no matter how it all ended, or was destined to end., He was like
one of those gracious figures in a pageant or a play, whose joys seem
to be remote from one, but whose sorrows stir one's sense of beauty,
and whose wounds are like red roses., Soul and body, body and soul--how mysterious they were!, There was
animalism in the soul, and the body had its moments of spirituality., The senses could refine, and the intellect could degrade., Who could
say where the fleshly impulse ceased, or the psychical impulse began?, How shallow were the arbitrary definitions of ordinary psychologists!, And yet how difficult to decide between the claims of the various
schools!, Was the soul a shadow seated in the house of sin?, Or was the
body really in the soul, as Giordano Bruno thought?, The separation of
spirit from matter was a mystery, and the union of spirit with matter
was a mystery also., He began to wonder whether we could ever make psychology so absolute a
science that each little spring of life would be revealed to us., As it
was, we always misunderstood ourselves and rarely understood others., Experience was of no ethical value., It was merely the name men gave to
their mistakes., Moralists had, as a rule, regarded it as a mode of
warning, had claimed for it a certain ethical efficacy in the formation
of character, had praised it as something that taught us what to follow
and showed us what to avoid., But there was no motive power in
experience., It was as little of an active cause as conscience itself., All that it really demonstrated was that our future would be the same
as our past, and that the sin we had done once, and with loathing, we
would do many times, and with joy., It was clear to him that the experimental method was the only method by
which one could arrive at any scientific analysis of the passions; and
certainly Dorian Gray was a subject made to his hand, and seemed to
promise rich and fruitful results., His sudden mad love for Sibyl Vane
was a psychological phenomenon of no small interest., There was no
doubt that curiosity had much to do with it, curiosity and the desire
for new experiences, yet it was not a simple, but rather a very complex
passion., What there was in it of the purely sensuous instinct of
boyhood had been transformed by the workings of the imagination,
changed into something that seemed to the lad himself to be remote from
sense, and was for that very reason all the more dangerous., It was the
passions about whose origin we deceived ourselves that tyrannized most
strongly over us., Our weakest motives were those of whose nature we
were conscious., It often happened that when we thought we were
experimenting on others we were really experimenting on ourselves., While Lord Henry sat dreaming on these things, a knock came to the
door, and his valet entered and reminded him it was time to dress for
dinner., He got up and looked out into the street., The sunset had
smitten into scarlet gold the upper windows of the houses opposite., The panes glowed like plates of heated metal., The sky above was like a
faded rose., He thought of his friend's young fiery-coloured life and
wondered how it was all going to end., When he arrived home, about half-past twelve o'clock, he saw a telegram
lying on the hall table., He opened it and found it was from Dorian
Gray., It was to tell him that he was engaged to be married to Sibyl
Vane., ""Mother, Mother, I am so happy!"", whispered the girl, burying her face
in the lap of the faded, tired-looking woman who, with back turned to
the shrill intrusive light, was sitting in the one arm-chair that their
dingy sitting-room contained., ""I am so happy!"", she repeated, ""and you
must be happy, too!"", Mrs. Vane winced and put her thin, bismuth-whitened hands on her
daughter's head., ""Happy!"", she echoed, ""I am only happy, Sibyl, when I
see you act., You must not think of anything but your acting., Mr.
Isaacs has been very good to us, and we owe him money."", The girl looked up and pouted., ""Money, Mother?"", she cried, ""what does
money matter?, Love is more than money."", ""Mr. Isaacs has advanced us fifty pounds to pay off our debts and to
get a proper outfit for James., You must not forget that, Sibyl., Fifty
pounds is a very large sum., Mr. Isaacs has been most considerate."", ""He is not a gentleman, Mother, and I hate the way he talks to me,""
said the girl, rising to her feet and going over to the window., ""I don't know how we could manage without him,"" answered the elder
woman querulously., Sibyl Vane tossed her head and laughed., ""We don't want him any more,
Mother., Prince Charming rules life for us now."", Then she paused., A
rose shook in her blood and shadowed her cheeks., Quick breath parted
the petals of her lips., They trembled., Some southern wind of passion
swept over her and stirred the dainty folds of her dress., ""I love
him,"" she said simply., ""Foolish child!, ...]",2
116,"[""Show him to me., Which is he?, Point him out., I must see him!"", he exclaimed; but at
that moment the Duke of Berwick's four-in-hand came between, and when
it had left the space clear, the carriage had swept out of the park., ""He is gone,"" murmured Sibyl sadly., ""I wish you had seen him."", ""I wish I had, for as sure as there is a God in heaven, if he ever does
you any wrong, I shall kill him."", She looked at him in horror., He repeated his words., They cut the air
like a dagger., The people round began to gape., A lady standing close
to her tittered., ""Come away, Jim; come away,"" she whispered., He followed her doggedly
as she passed through the crowd., He felt glad at what he had said., When they reached the Achilles Statue, she turned round., There was
pity in her eyes that became laughter on her lips., She shook her head
at him., ""You are foolish, Jim, utterly foolish; a bad-tempered boy,
that is all., How can you say such horrible things?, You don't know
what you are talking about., You are simply jealous and unkind., Ah!, I
wish you would fall in love., Love makes people good, and what you said
was wicked."", ""I am sixteen,"" he answered, ""and I know what I am about., Mother is no
help to you., She doesn't understand how to look after you., I wish now
that I was not going to Australia at all., I have a great mind to chuck
the whole thing up., I would, if my articles hadn't been signed."", ""Oh, don't be so serious, Jim., You are like one of the heroes of those
silly melodramas Mother used to be so fond of acting in., I am not
going to quarrel with you., I have seen him, and oh!, to see him is
perfect happiness., We won't quarrel., I know you would never harm any
one I love, would you?"", ""Not as long as you love him, I suppose,"" was the sullen answer., ""I shall love him for ever!"", she cried., ""And he?"", ""For ever, too!"", ""He had better."", She shrank from him., Then she laughed and put her hand on his arm., He
was merely a boy., At the Marble Arch they hailed an omnibus, which left them close to
their shabby home in the Euston Road., It was after five o'clock, and
Sibyl had to lie down for a couple of hours before acting., Jim
insisted that she should do so., He said that he would sooner part with
her when their mother was not present., She would be sure to make a
scene, and he detested scenes of every kind., In Sybil's own room they parted., There was jealousy in the lad's
heart, and a fierce murderous hatred of the stranger who, as it seemed
to him, had come between them., Yet, when her arms were flung round his
neck, and her fingers strayed through his hair, he softened and kissed
her with real affection., There were tears in his eyes as he went
downstairs., His mother was waiting for him below., She grumbled at his
unpunctuality, as he entered., He made no answer, but sat down to his
meagre meal., The flies buzzed round the table and crawled over the
stained cloth., Through the rumble of omnibuses, and the clatter of
street-cabs, he could hear the droning voice devouring each minute that
was left to him., After some time, he thrust away his plate and put his head in his
hands., He felt that he had a right to know., It should have been told
to him before, if it was as he suspected., Leaden with fear, his mother
watched him., Words dropped mechanically from her lips., A tattered
lace handkerchief twitched in her fingers., When the clock struck six,
he got up and went to the door., Then he turned back and looked at her., Their eyes met., In hers he saw a wild appeal for mercy., It enraged
him., ""Mother, I have something to ask you,"" he said., Her eyes wandered
vaguely about the room., She made no answer., ""Tell me the truth., I
have a right to know., Were you married to my father?"", She heaved a deep sigh., It was a sigh of relief., The terrible moment,
the moment that night and day, for weeks and months, she had dreaded,
had come at last, and yet she felt no terror., Indeed, in some measure
it was a disappointment to her., The vulgar directness of the question
called for a direct answer., The situation had not been gradually led
up to., It was crude., It reminded her of a bad rehearsal., ""No,"" she answered, wondering at the harsh simplicity of life., ""My father was a scoundrel then!"", cried the lad, clenching his fists., She shook her head., ""I knew he was not free., We loved each other very
much., If he had lived, he would have made provision for us., Don't
speak against him, my son., He was your father, and a gentleman., Indeed, he was highly connected."", An oath broke from his lips., ""I don't care for myself,"" he exclaimed,
""but don't let Sibyl...., It is a gentleman, isn't it, who is in love
with her, or says he is?, ...]",2
117,"[He escorted them to their box with a sort of
pompous humility, waving his fat jewelled hands and talking at the top
of his voice., Dorian Gray loathed him more than ever., He felt as if
he had come to look for Miranda and had been met by Caliban., Lord
Henry, upon the other hand, rather liked him., At least he declared he
did, and insisted on shaking him by the hand and assuring him that he
was proud to meet a man who had discovered a real genius and gone
bankrupt over a poet., Hallward amused himself with watching the faces
in the pit., The heat was terribly oppressive, and the huge sunlight
flamed like a monstrous dahlia with petals of yellow fire., The youths
in the gallery had taken off their coats and waistcoats and hung them
over the side., They talked to each other across the theatre and shared
their oranges with the tawdry girls who sat beside them., Some women
were laughing in the pit., Their voices were horribly shrill and
discordant., The sound of the popping of corks came from the bar., ""What a place to find one's divinity in!"", said Lord Henry., ""Yes!"", answered Dorian Gray., ""It was here I found her, and she is
divine beyond all living things., When she acts, you will forget
everything., These common rough people, with their coarse faces and
brutal gestures, become quite different when she is on the stage., They
sit silently and watch her., They weep and laugh as she wills them to
do., She makes them as responsive as a violin., She spiritualizes them,
and one feels that they are of the same flesh and blood as one's self."", ""The same flesh and blood as one's self!, Oh, I hope not!"", exclaimed
Lord Henry, who was scanning the occupants of the gallery through his
opera-glass., ""Don't pay any attention to him, Dorian,"" said the painter., ""I
understand what you mean, and I believe in this girl., Any one you love
must be marvellous, and any girl who has the effect you describe must
be fine and noble., To spiritualize one's age--that is something worth
doing., If this girl can give a soul to those who have lived without
one, if she can create the sense of beauty in people whose lives have
been sordid and ugly, if she can strip them of their selfishness and
lend them tears for sorrows that are not their own, she is worthy of
all your adoration, worthy of the adoration of the world., This
marriage is quite right., I did not think so at first, but I admit it
now., The gods made Sibyl Vane for you., Without her you would have
been incomplete."", ""Thanks, Basil,"" answered Dorian Gray, pressing his hand., ""I knew that
you would understand me., Harry is so cynical, he terrifies me., But
here is the orchestra., It is quite dreadful, but it only lasts for
about five minutes., Then the curtain rises, and you will see the girl
to whom I am going to give all my life, to whom I have given everything
that is good in me."", A quarter of an hour afterwards, amidst an extraordinary turmoil of
applause, Sibyl Vane stepped on to the stage., Yes, she was certainly
lovely to look at--one of the loveliest creatures, Lord Henry thought,
that he had ever seen., There was something of the fawn in her shy
grace and startled eyes., A faint blush, like the shadow of a rose in a
mirror of silver, came to her cheeks as she glanced at the crowded
enthusiastic house., She stepped back a few paces and her lips seemed
to tremble., Basil Hallward leaped to his feet and began to applaud., Motionless, and as one in a dream, sat Dorian Gray, gazing at her., Lord Henry peered through his glasses, murmuring, ""Charming!, charming!"", The scene was the hall of Capulet's house, and Romeo in his pilgrim's
dress had entered with Mercutio and his other friends., The band, such
as it was, struck up a few bars of music, and the dance began., Through
the crowd of ungainly, shabbily dressed actors, Sibyl Vane moved like a
creature from a finer world., Her body swayed, while she danced, as a
plant sways in the water., The curves of her throat were the curves of
a white lily., Her hands seemed to be made of cool ivory., Yet she was curiously listless., She showed no sign of joy when her
eyes rested on Romeo., The few words she had to speak--

    Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,
        Which mannerly devotion shows in this;
    For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch,
        And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss--

with the brief dialogue that follows, were spoken in a thoroughly
artificial manner., The voice was exquisite, but from the point of view
of tone it was absolutely false., It was wrong in colour., It took away
all the life from the verse., It made the passion unreal., Dorian Gray grew pale as he watched her., He was puzzled and anxious., Neither of his friends dared to say anything to him., She seemed to
them to be absolutely incompetent., They were horribly disappointed., Yet they felt that the true test of any Juliet is the balcony scene of
the second act., They waited for that., If she failed there, there was
nothing in her., She looked charming as she came out in the moonlight., That could not
be denied., But the staginess of her acting was unbearable, and grew
worse as she went on., Her gestures became absurdly artificial., She
overemphasized everything that she had to say., The beautiful passage--

    Thou knowest the mask of night is on my face,
    Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
    For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night--

was declaimed with the painful precision of a schoolgirl who has been
taught to recite by some second-rate professor of elocution., When she
leaned over the balcony and came to those wonderful lines--

        Although I joy in thee,
    I have no joy of this contract to-night:
    It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden;
    Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be
    Ere one can say, ""It lightens."", Sweet, good-night!, This bud of love by summer's ripening breath
    May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet--

she spoke the words as though they conveyed no meaning to her., It was
not nervousness., Indeed, so far from being nervous, she was absolutely
self-contained., It was simply bad art., She was a complete failure., Even the common uneducated audience of the pit and gallery lost their
interest in the play., They got restless, and began to talk loudly and
to whistle., The Jew manager, who was standing at the back of the
dress-circle, stamped and swore with rage., The only person unmoved was
the girl herself., When the second act was over, there came a storm of hisses, and Lord
Henry got up from his chair and put on his coat., ""She is quite
beautiful, Dorian,"" he said, ""but she can't act., Let us go."", ""I am going to see the play through,"" answered the lad, in a hard
bitter voice., ""I am awfully sorry that I have made you waste an
evening, Harry., I apologize to you both."", ""My dear Dorian, I should think Miss Vane was ill,"" interrupted
Hallward., ""We will come some other night."", ""I wish she were ill,"" he rejoined., ""But she seems to me to be simply
callous and cold., She has entirely altered., Last night she was a
great artist., ...]",2
118,"[The fascination that she had exercised over him
would return., They would be happy together., His life with her would
be beautiful and pure., He got up from his chair and drew a large screen right in front of the
portrait, shuddering as he glanced at it., ""How horrible!"", he murmured
to himself, and he walked across to the window and opened it., When he
stepped out on to the grass, he drew a deep breath., The fresh morning
air seemed to drive away all his sombre passions., He thought only of
Sibyl., A faint echo of his love came back to him., He repeated her
name over and over again., The birds that were singing in the
dew-drenched garden seemed to be telling the flowers about her., It was long past noon when he awoke., His valet had crept several times
on tiptoe into the room to see if he was stirring, and had wondered
what made his young master sleep so late., Finally his bell sounded,
and Victor came in softly with a cup of tea, and a pile of letters, on
a small tray of old Sevres china, and drew back the olive-satin
curtains, with their shimmering blue lining, that hung in front of the
three tall windows., ""Monsieur has well slept this morning,"" he said, smiling., ""What o'clock is it, Victor?"", asked Dorian Gray drowsily., ""One hour and a quarter, Monsieur."", How late it was!, He sat up, and having sipped some tea, turned over
his letters., One of them was from Lord Henry, and had been brought by
hand that morning., He hesitated for a moment, and then put it aside., The others he opened listlessly., They contained the usual collection
of cards, invitations to dinner, tickets for private views, programmes
of charity concerts, and the like that are showered on fashionable
young men every morning during the season., There was a rather heavy
bill for a chased silver Louis-Quinze toilet-set that he had not yet
had the courage to send on to his guardians, who were extremely
old-fashioned people and did not realize that we live in an age when
unnecessary things are our only necessities; and there were several
very courteously worded communications from Jermyn Street money-lenders
offering to advance any sum of money at a moment's notice and at the
most reasonable rates of interest., After about ten minutes he got up, and throwing on an elaborate
dressing-gown of silk-embroidered cashmere wool, passed into the
onyx-paved bathroom., The cool water refreshed him after his long
sleep., He seemed to have forgotten all that he had gone through., A
dim sense of having taken part in some strange tragedy came to him once
or twice, but there was the unreality of a dream about it., As soon as he was dressed, he went into the library and sat down to a
light French breakfast that had been laid out for him on a small round
table close to the open window., It was an exquisite day., The warm air
seemed laden with spices., A bee flew in and buzzed round the
blue-dragon bowl that, filled with sulphur-yellow roses, stood before
him., He felt perfectly happy., Suddenly his eye fell on the screen that he had placed in front of the
portrait, and he started., ""Too cold for Monsieur?"", asked his valet, putting an omelette on the
table., ""I shut the window?"", Dorian shook his head., ""I am not cold,"" he murmured., Was it all true?, Had the portrait really changed?, Or had it been
simply his own imagination that had made him see a look of evil where
there had been a look of joy?, Surely a painted canvas could not alter?, The thing was absurd., It would serve as a tale to tell Basil some day., It would make him smile., And, yet, how vivid was his recollection of the whole thing!, First in
the dim twilight, and then in the bright dawn, he had seen the touch of
cruelty round the warped lips., He almost dreaded his valet leaving the
room., He knew that when he was alone he would have to examine the
portrait., He was afraid of certainty., When the coffee and cigarettes
had been brought and the man turned to go, he felt a wild desire to
tell him to remain., As the door was closing behind him, he called him
back., The man stood waiting for his orders., Dorian looked at him for
a moment., ""I am not at home to any one, Victor,"" he said with a sigh., The man bowed and retired., Then he rose from the table, lit a cigarette, and flung himself down on
a luxuriously cushioned couch that stood facing the screen., The screen
was an old one, of gilt Spanish leather, stamped and wrought with a
rather florid Louis-Quatorze pattern., He scanned it curiously,
wondering if ever before it had concealed the secret of a man's life., Should he move it aside, after all?, Why not let it stay there?, What
was the use of knowing?, If the thing was true, it was terrible., If it
was not true, why trouble about it?, But what if, by some fate or
deadlier chance, eyes other than his spied behind and saw the horrible
change?, What should he do if Basil Hallward came and asked to look at
his own picture?, Basil would be sure to do that., No; the thing had to
be examined, and at once., Anything would be better than this dreadful
state of doubt., He got up and locked both doors., At least he would be alone when he
looked upon the mask of his shame., Then he drew the screen aside and
saw himself face to face., It was perfectly true., The portrait had
altered., As he often remembered afterwards, and always with no small wonder, he
found himself at first gazing at the portrait with a feeling of almost
scientific interest., That such a change should have taken place was
incredible to him., And yet it was a fact., Was there some subtle
affinity between the chemical atoms that shaped themselves into form
and colour on the canvas and the soul that was within him?, Could it be
that what that soul thought, they realized?--that what it dreamed, they
made true?, Or was there some other, more terrible reason?, He
shuddered, and felt afraid, and, going back to the couch, lay there,
gazing at the picture in sickened horror., One thing, however, he felt that it had done for him., It had made him
conscious how unjust, how cruel, he had been to Sibyl Vane., It was not
too late to make reparation for that., She could still be his wife., His unreal and selfish love would yield to some higher influence, would
be transformed into some nobler passion, and the portrait that Basil
Hallward had painted of him would be a guide to him through life, would
be to him what holiness is to some, and conscience to others, and the
fear of God to us all., There were opiates for remorse, drugs that
could lull the moral sense to sleep., But here was a visible symbol of
the degradation of sin., Here was an ever-present sign of the ruin men
brought upon their souls., Three o'clock struck, and four, and the half-hour rang its double
chime, but Dorian Gray did not stir., He was trying to gather up the
scarlet threads of life and to weave them into a pattern; to find his
way through the sanguine labyrinth of passion through which he was
wandering., He did not know what to do, or what to think., Finally, he
went over to the table and wrote a passionate letter to the girl he had
loved, imploring her forgiveness and accusing himself of madness., He
covered page after page with wild words of sorrow and wilder words of
pain., There is a luxury in self-reproach., When we blame ourselves, we
feel that no one else has a right to blame us., It is the confession,
not the priest, that gives us absolution., ...]",2
119,"[""We are only at the beginning of our friendship, Dorian,"" answered Lord
Henry, shaking him by the hand., ""Good-bye., I shall see you before
nine-thirty, I hope., Remember, Patti is singing."", As he closed the door behind him, Dorian Gray touched the bell, and in
a few minutes Victor appeared with the lamps and drew the blinds down., He waited impatiently for him to go., The man seemed to take an
interminable time over everything., As soon as he had left, he rushed to the screen and drew it back., No;
there was no further change in the picture., It had received the news
of Sibyl Vane's death before he had known of it himself., It was
conscious of the events of life as they occurred., The vicious cruelty
that marred the fine lines of the mouth had, no doubt, appeared at the
very moment that the girl had drunk the poison, whatever it was., Or
was it indifferent to results?, Did it merely take cognizance of what
passed within the soul?, He wondered, and hoped that some day he would
see the change taking place before his very eyes, shuddering as he
hoped it., Poor Sibyl!, What a romance it had all been!, She had often mimicked
death on the stage., Then Death himself had touched her and taken her
with him., How had she played that dreadful last scene?, Had she cursed
him, as she died?, No; she had died for love of him, and love would
always be a sacrament to him now., She had atoned for everything by the
sacrifice she had made of her life., He would not think any more of
what she had made him go through, on that horrible night at the
theatre., When he thought of her, it would be as a wonderful tragic
figure sent on to the world's stage to show the supreme reality of
love., A wonderful tragic figure?, Tears came to his eyes as he
remembered her childlike look, and winsome fanciful ways, and shy
tremulous grace., He brushed them away hastily and looked again at the
picture., He felt that the time had really come for making his choice., Or had
his choice already been made?, Yes, life had decided that for
him--life, and his own infinite curiosity about life., Eternal youth,
infinite passion, pleasures subtle and secret, wild joys and wilder
sins--he was to have all these things., The portrait was to bear the
burden of his shame: that was all., A feeling of pain crept over him as he thought of the desecration that
was in store for the fair face on the canvas., Once, in boyish mockery
of Narcissus, he had kissed, or feigned to kiss, those painted lips
that now smiled so cruelly at him., Morning after morning he had sat
before the portrait wondering at its beauty, almost enamoured of it, as
it seemed to him at times., Was it to alter now with every mood to
which he yielded?, Was it to become a monstrous and loathsome thing, to
be hidden away in a locked room, to be shut out from the sunlight that
had so often touched to brighter gold the waving wonder of its hair?, The pity of it!, the pity of it!, For a moment, he thought of praying that the horrible sympathy that
existed between him and the picture might cease., It had changed in
answer to a prayer; perhaps in answer to a prayer it might remain
unchanged., And yet, who, that knew anything about life, would
surrender the chance of remaining always young, however fantastic that
chance might be, or with what fateful consequences it might be fraught?, Besides, was it really under his control?, Had it indeed been prayer
that had produced the substitution?, Might there not be some curious
scientific reason for it all?, If thought could exercise its influence
upon a living organism, might not thought exercise an influence upon
dead and inorganic things?, Nay, without thought or conscious desire,
might not things external to ourselves vibrate in unison with our moods
and passions, atom calling to atom in secret love or strange affinity?, But the reason was of no importance., He would never again tempt by a
prayer any terrible power., If the picture was to alter, it was to
alter., That was all., Why inquire too closely into it?, For there would be a real pleasure in watching it., He would be able to
follow his mind into its secret places., This portrait would be to him
the most magical of mirrors., As it had revealed to him his own body,
so it would reveal to him his own soul., And when winter came upon it,
he would still be standing where spring trembles on the verge of
summer., When the blood crept from its face, and left behind a pallid
mask of chalk with leaden eyes, he would keep the glamour of boyhood., Not one blossom of his loveliness would ever fade., Not one pulse of
his life would ever weaken., Like the gods of the Greeks, he would be
strong, and fleet, and joyous., What did it matter what happened to the
coloured image on the canvas?, He would be safe., That was everything., He drew the screen back into its former place in front of the picture,
smiling as he did so, and passed into his bedroom, where his valet was
already waiting for him., An hour later he was at the opera, and Lord
Henry was leaning over his chair., As he was sitting at breakfast next morning, Basil Hallward was shown
into the room., ""I am so glad I have found you, Dorian,"" he said gravely., ""I called
last night, and they told me you were at the opera., Of course, I knew
that was impossible., But I wish you had left word where you had really
gone to., I passed a dreadful evening, half afraid that one tragedy
might be followed by another., I think you might have telegraphed for
me when you heard of it first., I read of it quite by chance in a late
edition of _The Globe_ that I picked up at the club., I came here at once
and was miserable at not finding you., I can't tell you how
heart-broken I am about the whole thing., I know what you must suffer., But where were you?, Did you go down and see the girl's mother?, For a
moment I thought of following you there., They gave the address in the
paper., Somewhere in the Euston Road, isn't it?, But I was afraid of
intruding upon a sorrow that I could not lighten., Poor woman!, What a
state she must be in!, And her only child, too!, What did she say about
it all?"", ""My dear Basil, how do I know?"", murmured Dorian Gray, sipping some
pale-yellow wine from a delicate, gold-beaded bubble of Venetian glass
and looking dreadfully bored., ""I was at the opera., You should have
come on there., I met Lady Gwendolen, Harry's sister, for the first
time., We were in her box., She is perfectly charming; and Patti sang
divinely., Don't talk about horrid subjects., If one doesn't talk about
a thing, it has never happened., It is simply expression, as Harry
says, that gives reality to things., I may mention that she was not the
woman's only child., There is a son, a charming fellow, I believe., ...]",2
120,"[""It was a very disappointing confession."", ""Why, what did you expect, Dorian?, You didn't see anything else in the
picture, did you?, There was nothing else to see?"", ""No; there was nothing else to see., Why do you ask?, But you mustn't
talk about worship., It is foolish., You and I are friends, Basil, and
we must always remain so."", ""You have got Harry,"" said the painter sadly., ""Oh, Harry!"", cried the lad, with a ripple of laughter., ""Harry spends
his days in saying what is incredible and his evenings in doing what is
improbable., Just the sort of life I would like to lead., But still I
don't think I would go to Harry if I were in trouble., I would sooner
go to you, Basil."", ""You will sit to me again?"", ""Impossible!"", ""You spoil my life as an artist by refusing, Dorian., No man comes
across two ideal things., Few come across one."", ""I can't explain it to you, Basil, but I must never sit to you again., There is something fatal about a portrait., It has a life of its own., I will come and have tea with you., That will be just as pleasant."", ""Pleasanter for you, I am afraid,"" murmured Hallward regretfully., ""And
now good-bye., I am sorry you won't let me look at the picture once
again., But that can't be helped., I quite understand what you feel
about it."", As he left the room, Dorian Gray smiled to himself., Poor Basil!, How
little he knew of the true reason!, And how strange it was that,
instead of having been forced to reveal his own secret, he had
succeeded, almost by chance, in wresting a secret from his friend!, How
much that strange confession explained to him!, The painter's absurd
fits of jealousy, his wild devotion, his extravagant panegyrics, his
curious reticences--he understood them all now, and he felt sorry., There seemed to him to be something tragic in a friendship so coloured
by romance., He sighed and touched the bell., The portrait must be hidden away at
all costs., He could not run such a risk of discovery again., It had
been mad of him to have allowed the thing to remain, even for an hour,
in a room to which any of his friends had access., When his servant entered, he looked at him steadfastly and wondered if
he had thought of peering behind the screen., The man was quite
impassive and waited for his orders., Dorian lit a cigarette and walked
over to the glass and glanced into it., He could see the reflection of
Victor's face perfectly., It was like a placid mask of servility., There was nothing to be afraid of, there., Yet he thought it best to be
on his guard., Speaking very slowly, he told him to tell the house-keeper that he
wanted to see her, and then to go to the frame-maker and ask him to
send two of his men round at once., It seemed to him that as the man
left the room his eyes wandered in the direction of the screen., Or was
that merely his own fancy?, After a few moments, in her black silk dress, with old-fashioned thread
mittens on her wrinkled hands, Mrs., Leaf bustled into the library., He
asked her for the key of the schoolroom., ""The old schoolroom, Mr., Dorian?"", she exclaimed., ""Why, it is full of
dust., I must get it arranged and put straight before you go into it., It is not fit for you to see, sir., It is not, indeed."", ""I don't want it put straight, Leaf., I only want the key."", ""Well, sir, you'll be covered with cobwebs if you go into it., Why, it
hasn't been opened for nearly five years--not since his lordship died."", He winced at the mention of his grandfather., He had hateful memories
of him., ""That does not matter,"" he answered., ""I simply want to see
the place--that is all., Give me the key."", ""And here is the key, sir,"" said the old lady, going over the contents
of her bunch with tremulously uncertain hands., ""Here is the key., I'll
have it off the bunch in a moment., But you don't think of living up
there, sir, and you so comfortable here?"", ""No, no,"" he cried petulantly., ""Thank you, Leaf., That will do."", She lingered for a few moments, and was garrulous over some detail of
the household., He sighed and told her to manage things as she thought
best., She left the room, wreathed in smiles., As the door closed, Dorian put the key in his pocket and looked round
the room., His eye fell on a large, purple satin coverlet heavily
embroidered with gold, a splendid piece of late seventeenth-century
Venetian work that his grandfather had found in a convent near Bologna., Yes, that would serve to wrap the dreadful thing in., It had perhaps
served often as a pall for the dead., Now it was to hide something that
had a corruption of its own, worse than the corruption of death
itself--something that would breed horrors and yet would never die., What the worm was to the corpse, his sins would be to the painted image
on the canvas., They would mar its beauty and eat away its grace., They
would defile it and make it shameful., And yet the thing would still
live on., It would be always alive., He shuddered, and for a moment he regretted that he had not told Basil
the true reason why he had wished to hide the picture away., Basil
would have helped him to resist Lord Henry's influence, and the still
more poisonous influences that came from his own temperament., The love
that he bore him--for it was really love--had nothing in it that was
not noble and intellectual., It was not that mere physical admiration
of beauty that is born of the senses and that dies when the senses
tire., It was such love as Michelangelo had known, and Montaigne, and
Winckelmann, and Shakespeare himself., Yes, Basil could have saved him., But it was too late now., The past could always be annihilated., Regret, denial, or forgetfulness could do that., ...]",2
121,"[Summer followed summer, and the yellow
jonquils bloomed and died many times, and nights of horror repeated the
story of their shame, but he was unchanged., No winter marred his face
or stained his flowerlike bloom., How different it was with material
things!, Where had they passed to?, Where was the great crocus-coloured
robe, on which the gods fought against the giants, that had been worked
by brown girls for the pleasure of Athena?, Where the huge velarium
that Nero had stretched across the Colosseum at Rome, that Titan sail
of purple on which was represented the starry sky, and Apollo driving a
chariot drawn by white, gilt-reined steeds?, He longed to see the
curious table-napkins wrought for the Priest of the Sun, on which were
displayed all the dainties and viands that could be wanted for a feast;
the mortuary cloth of King Chilperic, with its three hundred golden
bees; the fantastic robes that excited the indignation of the Bishop of
Pontus and were figured with ""lions, panthers, bears, dogs, forests,
rocks, hunters--all, in fact, that a painter can copy from nature""; and
the coat that Charles of Orleans once wore, on the sleeves of which
were embroidered the verses of a song beginning ""_Madame, je suis tout
joyeux_,"" the musical accompaniment of the words being wrought in gold
thread, and each note, of square shape in those days, formed with four
pearls., He read of the room that was prepared at the palace at Rheims
for the use of Queen Joan of Burgundy and was decorated with ""thirteen
hundred and twenty-one parrots, made in broidery, and blazoned with the
king's arms, and five hundred and sixty-one butterflies, whose wings
were similarly ornamented with the arms of the queen, the whole worked
in gold."", Catherine de Medicis had a mourning-bed made for her of
black velvet powdered with crescents and suns., Its curtains were of
damask, with leafy wreaths and garlands, figured upon a gold and silver
ground, and fringed along the edges with broideries of pearls, and it
stood in a room hung with rows of the queen's devices in cut black
velvet upon cloth of silver., Louis XIV had gold embroidered caryatides
fifteen feet high in his apartment., The state bed of Sobieski, King of
Poland, was made of Smyrna gold brocade embroidered in turquoises with
verses from the Koran., Its supports were of silver gilt, beautifully
chased, and profusely set with enamelled and jewelled medallions., It
had been taken from the Turkish camp before Vienna, and the standard of
Mohammed had stood beneath the tremulous gilt of its canopy., And so, for a whole year, he sought to accumulate the most exquisite
specimens that he could find of textile and embroidered work, getting
the dainty Delhi muslins, finely wrought with gold-thread palmates and
stitched over with iridescent beetles' wings; the Dacca gauzes, that
from their transparency are known in the East as ""woven air,"" and
""running water,"" and ""evening dew""; strange figured cloths from Java;
elaborate yellow Chinese hangings; books bound in tawny satins or fair
blue silks and wrought with _fleurs-de-lis_, birds and images; veils of
_lacis_ worked in Hungary point; Sicilian brocades and stiff Spanish
velvets; Georgian work, with its gilt coins, and Japanese _Foukousas_,
with their green-toned golds and their marvellously plumaged birds., He had a special passion, also, for ecclesiastical vestments, as indeed
he had for everything connected with the service of the Church., In the
long cedar chests that lined the west gallery of his house, he had
stored away many rare and beautiful specimens of what is really the
raiment of the Bride of Christ, who must wear purple and jewels and
fine linen that she may hide the pallid macerated body that is worn by
the suffering that she seeks for and wounded by self-inflicted pain., He possessed a gorgeous cope of crimson silk and gold-thread damask,
figured with a repeating pattern of golden pomegranates set in
six-petalled formal blossoms, beyond which on either side was the
pine-apple device wrought in seed-pearls., The orphreys were divided
into panels representing scenes from the life of the Virgin, and the
coronation of the Virgin was figured in coloured silks upon the hood., This was Italian work of the fifteenth century., Another cope was of
green velvet, embroidered with heart-shaped groups of acanthus-leaves,
from which spread long-stemmed white blossoms, the details of which
were picked out with silver thread and coloured crystals., The morse
bore a seraph's head in gold-thread raised work., The orphreys were
woven in a diaper of red and gold silk, and were starred with
medallions of many saints and martyrs, among whom was St. Sebastian., He had chasubles, also, of amber-coloured silk, and blue silk and gold
brocade, and yellow silk damask and cloth of gold, figured with
representations of the Passion and Crucifixion of Christ, and
embroidered with lions and peacocks and other emblems; dalmatics of
white satin and pink silk damask, decorated with tulips and dolphins
and _fleurs-de-lis_; altar frontals of crimson velvet and blue linen; and
many corporals, chalice-veils, and sudaria., In the mystic offices to
which such things were put, there was something that quickened his
imagination., For these treasures, and everything that he collected in his lovely
house, were to be to him means of forgetfulness, modes by which he
could escape, for a season, from the fear that seemed to him at times
to be almost too great to be borne., Upon the walls of the lonely
locked room where he had spent so much of his boyhood, he had hung with
his own hands the terrible portrait whose changing features showed him
the real degradation of his life, and in front of it had draped the
purple-and-gold pall as a curtain., For weeks he would not go there,
would forget the hideous painted thing, and get back his light heart,
his wonderful joyousness, his passionate absorption in mere existence., Then, suddenly, some night he would creep out of the house, go down to
dreadful places near Blue Gate Fields, and stay there, day after day,
until he was driven away., On his return he would sit in front of the
picture, sometimes loathing it and himself, but filled, at other
times, with that pride of individualism that is half the
fascination of sin, and smiling with secret pleasure at the misshapen
shadow that had to bear the burden that should have been his own., After a few years he could not endure to be long out of England, and
gave up the villa that he had shared at Trouville with Lord Henry, as
well as the little white walled-in house at Algiers where they had more
than once spent the winter., He hated to be separated from the picture
that was such a part of his life, and was also afraid that during his
absence some one might gain access to the room, in spite of the
elaborate bars that he had caused to be placed upon the door., He was quite conscious that this would tell them nothing., It was true
that the portrait still preserved, under all the foulness and ugliness
of the face, its marked likeness to himself; but what could they learn
from that?, He would laugh at any one who tried to taunt him., He had
not painted it., What was it to him how vile and full of shame it
looked?, Even if he told them, would they believe it?, Yet he was afraid., Sometimes when he was down at his great house in
Nottinghamshire, entertaining the fashionable young men of his own rank
who were his chief companions, and astounding the county by the wanton
luxury and gorgeous splendour of his mode of life, he would suddenly
leave his guests and rush back to town to see that the door had not
been tampered with and that the picture was still there., What if it
should be stolen?, The mere thought made him cold with horror., Surely
the world would know his secret then., Perhaps the world already
suspected it., For, while he fascinated many, there were not a few who distrusted him., He was very nearly blackballed at a West End club of which his birth
and social position fully entitled him to become a member, and it was
said that on one occasion, when he was brought by a friend into the
smoking-room of the Churchill, the Duke of Berwick and another
gentleman got up in a marked manner and went out., Curious stories
became current about him after he had passed his twenty-fifth year., It
was rumoured that he had been seen brawling with foreign sailors in a
low den in the distant parts of Whitechapel, and that he consorted with
thieves and coiners and knew the mysteries of their trade., His
extraordinary absences became notorious, and, when he used to reappear
again in society, men would whisper to each other in corners, or pass
him with a sneer, or look at him with cold searching eyes, as though
they were determined to discover his secret., Of such insolences and attempted slights he, of course, took no notice,
and in the opinion of most people his frank debonair manner, his
charming boyish smile, and the infinite grace of that wonderful youth
that seemed never to leave him, were in themselves a sufficient answer
to the calumnies, for so they termed them, that were circulated about
him., It was remarked, however, that some of those who had been most
intimate with him appeared, after a time, to shun him., Women who had
wildly adored him, and for his sake had braved all social censure and
set convention at defiance, were seen to grow pallid with shame or
horror if Dorian Gray entered the room., Yet these whispered scandals only increased in the eyes of many his
strange and dangerous charm., His great wealth was a certain element of
security., Society--civilized society, at least--is never very ready to
believe anything to the detriment of those who are both rich and
fascinating., It feels instinctively that manners are of more
importance than morals, and, in its opinion, the highest respectability
is of much less value than the possession of a good _chef_., And, after
all, it is a very poor consolation to be told that the man who has
given one a bad dinner, or poor wine, is irreproachable in his private
life., Even the cardinal virtues cannot atone for half-cold _entrees_, as
Lord Henry remarked once, in a discussion on the subject, and there is
possibly a good deal to be said for his view., For the canons of good
society are, or should be, the same as the canons of art., Form is
absolutely essential to it., It should have the dignity of a ceremony,
as well as its unreality, and should combine the insincere character of
a romantic play with the wit and beauty that make such plays delightful
to us., Is insincerity such a terrible thing?, I think not., It is
merely a method by which we can multiply our personalities., Such, at any rate, was Dorian Gray's opinion., He used to wonder at the
shallow psychology of those who conceive the ego in man as a thing
simple, permanent, reliable, and of one essence., To him, man was a
being with myriad lives and myriad sensations, a complex multiform
creature that bore within itself strange legacies of thought and
passion, and whose very flesh was tainted with the monstrous maladies
of the dead., He loved to stroll through the gaunt cold picture-gallery
of his country house and look at the various portraits of those whose
blood flowed in his veins., Here was Philip Herbert, described by
Francis Osborne, in his Memoires on the Reigns of Queen Elizabeth and
King James, as one who was ""caressed by the Court for his handsome
face, which kept him not long company."", Was it young Herbert's life
that he sometimes led?, Had some strange poisonous germ crept from body
to body till it had reached his own?, Was it some dim sense of that
ruined grace that had made him so suddenly, and almost without cause,
give utterance, in Basil Hallward's studio, to the mad prayer that had
so changed his life?, Here, in gold-embroidered red doublet, jewelled
surcoat, and gilt-edged ruff and wristbands, stood Sir Anthony Sherard,
with his silver-and-black armour piled at his feet., What had this
man's legacy been?, Had the lover of Giovanna of Naples bequeathed him
some inheritance of sin and shame?, Were his own actions merely the
dreams that the dead man had not dared to realize?, Here, from the
fading canvas, smiled Lady Elizabeth Devereux, in her gauze hood, pearl
stomacher, and pink slashed sleeves., A flower was in her right hand,
and her left clasped an enamelled collar of white and damask roses., On
a table by her side lay a mandolin and an apple., There were large
green rosettes upon her little pointed shoes., He knew her life, and
the strange stories that were told about her lovers., Had he something
of her temperament in him?, These oval, heavy-lidded eyes seemed to
look curiously at him., What of George Willoughby, with his powdered
hair and fantastic patches?, How evil he looked!, The face was
saturnine and swarthy, and the sensual lips seemed to be twisted with
disdain., Delicate lace ruffles fell over the lean yellow hands that
were so overladen with rings., He had been a macaroni of the eighteenth
century, and the friend, in his youth, of Lord Ferrars., What of the
second Lord Beckenham, the companion of the Prince Regent in his
wildest days, and one of the witnesses at the secret marriage with Mrs.
Fitzherbert?, How proud and handsome he was, with his chestnut curls
and insolent pose!, What passions had he bequeathed?, The world had
looked upon him as infamous., He had led the orgies at Carlton House., The star of the Garter glittered upon his breast., Beside him hung the
portrait of his wife, a pallid, thin-lipped woman in black., Her blood,
also, stirred within him., How curious it all seemed!, And his mother
with her Lady Hamilton face and her moist, wine-dashed lips--he knew
what he had got from her., He had got from her his beauty, and his
passion for the beauty of others., She laughed at him in her loose
Bacchante dress., ...]",2
122,"[As Dorian Gray was lighting a half-burned candle that was
standing on the mantelshelf, he saw that the whole place was covered
with dust and that the carpet was in holes., A mouse ran scuffling
behind the wainscoting., There was a damp odour of mildew., ""So you think that it is only God who sees the soul, Basil?, Draw that
curtain back, and you will see mine."", The voice that spoke was cold and cruel., ""You are mad, Dorian, or
playing a part,"" muttered Hallward, frowning., ""You won't?, Then I must do it myself,"" said the young man, and he tore
the curtain from its rod and flung it on the ground., An exclamation of horror broke from the painter's lips as he saw in the
dim light the hideous face on the canvas grinning at him., There was
something in its expression that filled him with disgust and loathing., Good heavens!, it was Dorian Gray's own face that he was looking at!, The horror, whatever it was, had not yet entirely spoiled that
marvellous beauty., There was still some gold in the thinning hair and
some scarlet on the sensual mouth., The sodden eyes had kept something
of the loveliness of their blue, the noble curves had not yet
completely passed away from chiselled nostrils and from plastic throat., Yes, it was Dorian himself., But who had done it?, He seemed to
recognize his own brushwork, and the frame was his own design., The
idea was monstrous, yet he felt afraid., He seized the lighted candle,
and held it to the picture., In the left-hand corner was his own name,
traced in long letters of bright vermilion., It was some foul parody, some infamous ignoble satire., He had never
done that., Still, it was his own picture., He knew it, and he felt as
if his blood had changed in a moment from fire to sluggish ice., His
own picture!, What did it mean?, Why had it altered?, He turned and
looked at Dorian Gray with the eyes of a sick man., His mouth twitched,
and his parched tongue seemed unable to articulate., He passed his hand
across his forehead., It was dank with clammy sweat., The young man was leaning against the mantelshelf, watching him with
that strange expression that one sees on the faces of those who are
absorbed in a play when some great artist is acting., There was neither
real sorrow in it nor real joy., There was simply the passion of the
spectator, with perhaps a flicker of triumph in his eyes., He had taken
the flower out of his coat, and was smelling it, or pretending to do so., ""What does this mean?"", cried Hallward, at last., His own voice sounded
shrill and curious in his ears., ""Years ago, when I was a boy,"" said Dorian Gray, crushing the flower in
his hand, ""you met me, flattered me, and taught me to be vain of my
good looks., One day you introduced me to a friend of yours, who
explained to me the wonder of youth, and you finished a portrait of me
that revealed to me the wonder of beauty., In a mad moment that, even
now, I don't know whether I regret or not, I made a wish, perhaps you
would call it a prayer....""

""I remember it!, Oh, how well I remember it!, No!, the thing is
impossible., The room is damp., Mildew has got into the canvas., The
paints I used had some wretched mineral poison in them., I tell you the
thing is impossible."", ""Ah, what is impossible?"", murmured the young man, going over to the
window and leaning his forehead against the cold, mist-stained glass., ""You told me you had destroyed it."", ""I was wrong., It has destroyed me."", ""I don't believe it is my picture."", ""Can't you see your ideal in it?"", said Dorian bitterly., ""My ideal, as you call it...""

""As you called it."", ""There was nothing evil in it, nothing shameful., You were to me such
an ideal as I shall never meet again., This is the face of a satyr."", ""It is the face of my soul."", ""Christ!, what a thing I must have worshipped!, It has the eyes of a
devil."", ""Each of us has heaven and hell in him, Basil,"" cried Dorian with a
wild gesture of despair., Hallward turned again to the portrait and gazed at it., ""My God!, If it
is true,"" he exclaimed, ""and this is what you have done with your life,
why, you must be worse even than those who talk against you fancy you
to be!"", He held the light up again to the canvas and examined it., The
surface seemed to be quite undisturbed and as he had left it., It was
from within, apparently, that the foulness and horror had come., Through some strange quickening of inner life the leprosies of sin were
slowly eating the thing away., The rotting of a corpse in a watery
grave was not so fearful., His hand shook, and the candle fell from its socket on the floor and
lay there sputtering., He placed his foot on it and put it out., Then
he flung himself into the rickety chair that was standing by the table
and buried his face in his hands., ""Good God, Dorian, what a lesson!, What an awful lesson!"", There was no
answer, but he could hear the young man sobbing at the window., ""Pray,
Dorian, pray,"" he murmured., ""What is it that one was taught to say in
one's boyhood?, 'Lead us not into temptation., Forgive us our sins., Wash away our iniquities.', Let us say that together., The prayer of
your pride has been answered., The prayer of your repentance will be
answered also., I worshipped you too much., I am punished for it., You
worshipped yourself too much., We are both punished."", Dorian Gray turned slowly around and looked at him with tear-dimmed
eyes., ""It is too late, Basil,"" he faltered., ""It is never too late, Dorian., Let us kneel down and try if we cannot
remember a prayer., Isn't there a verse somewhere, 'Though your sins be
as scarlet, yet I will make them as white as snow'?"", ""Those words mean nothing to me now."", ""Hush!, ...]",2
123,"[He may not have intended
it, the result was the same."", ""Murder!, Good God, Dorian, is that what you have come to?, I shall not
inform upon you., It is not my business., Besides, without my stirring
in the matter, you are certain to be arrested., Nobody ever commits a
crime without doing something stupid., But I will have nothing to do
with it."", ""You must have something to do with it., Wait, wait a moment; listen to
me., Only listen, Alan., All I ask of you is to perform a certain
scientific experiment., You go to hospitals and dead-houses, and the
horrors that you do there don't affect you., If in some hideous
dissecting-room or fetid laboratory you found this man lying on a
leaden table with red gutters scooped out in it for the blood to flow
through, you would simply look upon him as an admirable subject., You
would not turn a hair., You would not believe that you were doing
anything wrong., On the contrary, you would probably feel that you were
benefiting the human race, or increasing the sum of knowledge in the
world, or gratifying intellectual curiosity, or something of that kind., What I want you to do is merely what you have often done before., Indeed, to destroy a body must be far less horrible than what you are
accustomed to work at., And, remember, it is the only piece of evidence
against me., If it is discovered, I am lost; and it is sure to be
discovered unless you help me."", ""I have no desire to help you., You forget that., I am simply
indifferent to the whole thing., It has nothing to do with me."", ""Alan, I entreat you., Think of the position I am in., Just before you
came I almost fainted with terror., You may know terror yourself some
day., No!, don't think of that., Look at the matter purely from the
scientific point of view., You don't inquire where the dead things on
which you experiment come from., Don't inquire now., I have told you
too much as it is., But I beg of you to do this., We were friends once,
Alan."", ""Don't speak about those days, Dorian--they are dead."", ""The dead linger sometimes., The man upstairs will not go away., He is
sitting at the table with bowed head and outstretched arms., Alan!, Alan!, If you don't come to my assistance, I am ruined., Why, they will
hang me, Alan!, Don't you understand?, They will hang me for what I
have done."", ""There is no good in prolonging this scene., I absolutely refuse to do
anything in the matter., It is insane of you to ask me."", ""You refuse?"", ""Yes."", ""I entreat you, Alan."", ""It is useless."", The same look of pity came into Dorian Gray's eyes., Then he stretched
out his hand, took a piece of paper, and wrote something on it., He
read it over twice, folded it carefully, and pushed it across the
table., Having done this, he got up and went over to the window., Campbell looked at him in surprise, and then took up the paper, and
opened it., As he read it, his face became ghastly pale and he fell
back in his chair., A horrible sense of sickness came over him., He
felt as if his heart was beating itself to death in some empty hollow., After two or three minutes of terrible silence, Dorian turned round and
came and stood behind him, putting his hand upon his shoulder., ""I am so sorry for you, Alan,"" he murmured, ""but you leave me no
alternative., I have a letter written already., Here it is., You see
the address., If you don't help me, I must send it., If you don't help
me, I will send it., You know what the result will be., But you are
going to help me., It is impossible for you to refuse now., I tried to
spare you., You will do me the justice to admit that., You were stern,
harsh, offensive., You treated me as no man has ever dared to treat
me--no living man, at any rate., I bore it all., Now it is for me to
dictate terms."", Campbell buried his face in his hands, and a shudder passed through him., ""Yes, it is my turn to dictate terms, Alan., You know what they are., The thing is quite simple., Come, don't work yourself into this fever., The thing has to be done., Face it, and do it."", A groan broke from Campbell's lips and he shivered all over., The
ticking of the clock on the mantelpiece seemed to him to be dividing
time into separate atoms of agony, each of which was too terrible to be
borne., He felt as if an iron ring was being slowly tightened round his
forehead, as if the disgrace with which he was threatened had already
come upon him., The hand upon his shoulder weighed like a hand of lead., It was intolerable., It seemed to crush him., ""Come, Alan, you must decide at once."", ""I cannot do it,"" he said, mechanically, as though words could alter
things., ""You must., You have no choice., Don't delay."", He hesitated a moment., ""Is there a fire in the room upstairs?"", ""Yes, there is a gas-fire with asbestos."", ""I shall have to go home and get some things from the laboratory."", ...]",2
124,"[I
didn't go to the club., I walked about., I forget what I did.... How
inquisitive you are, Harry!, You always want to know what one has been
doing., I always want to forget what I have been doing., I came in at
half-past two, if you wish to know the exact time., I had left my
latch-key at home, and my servant had to let me in., If you want any
corroborative evidence on the subject, you can ask him."", Lord Henry shrugged his shoulders., ""My dear fellow, as if I cared!, Let us go up to the drawing-room., No sherry, thank you, Mr. Chapman., Something has happened to you, Dorian., Tell me what it is., You are
not yourself to-night."", ""Don't mind me, Harry., I am irritable, and out of temper., I shall
come round and see you to-morrow, or next day., Make my excuses to Lady
Narborough., I shan't go upstairs., I shall go home., I must go home."", ""All right, Dorian., I dare say I shall see you to-morrow at tea-time., The duchess is coming."", ""I will try to be there, Harry,"" he said, leaving the room., As he
drove back to his own house, he was conscious that the sense of terror
he thought he had strangled had come back to him., Lord Henry's casual
questioning had made him lose his nerve for the moment, and he wanted
his nerve still., Things that were dangerous had to be destroyed., He
winced., He hated the idea of even touching them., Yet it had to be done., He realized that, and when he had locked the
door of his library, he opened the secret press into which he had
thrust Basil Hallward's coat and bag., A huge fire was blazing., He
piled another log on it., The smell of the singeing clothes and burning
leather was horrible., It took him three-quarters of an hour to consume
everything., At the end he felt faint and sick, and having lit some
Algerian pastilles in a pierced copper brazier, he bathed his hands and
forehead with a cool musk-scented vinegar., Suddenly he started., His eyes grew strangely bright, and he gnawed
nervously at his underlip., Between two of the windows stood a large
Florentine cabinet, made out of ebony and inlaid with ivory and blue
lapis., He watched it as though it were a thing that could fascinate
and make afraid, as though it held something that he longed for and yet
almost loathed., His breath quickened., A mad craving came over him., He lit a cigarette and then threw it away., His eyelids drooped till
the long fringed lashes almost touched his cheek., But he still watched
the cabinet., At last he got up from the sofa on which he had been
lying, went over to it, and having unlocked it, touched some hidden
spring., A triangular drawer passed slowly out., His fingers moved
instinctively towards it, dipped in, and closed on something., It was a
small Chinese box of black and gold-dust lacquer, elaborately wrought,
the sides patterned with curved waves, and the silken cords hung with
round crystals and tasselled in plaited metal threads., He opened it., Inside was a green paste, waxy in lustre, the odour curiously heavy and
persistent., He hesitated for some moments, with a strangely immobile smile upon his
face., Then shivering, though the atmosphere of the room was terribly
hot, he drew himself up and glanced at the clock., It was twenty
minutes to twelve., He put the box back, shutting the cabinet doors as
he did so, and went into his bedroom., As midnight was striking bronze blows upon the dusky air, Dorian Gray,
dressed commonly, and with a muffler wrapped round his throat, crept
quietly out of his house., In Bond Street he found a hansom with a good
horse., He hailed it and in a low voice gave the driver an address., The man shook his head., ""It is too far for me,"" he muttered., ""Here is a sovereign for you,"" said Dorian., ""You shall have another if
you drive fast."", ""All right, sir,"" answered the man, ""you will be there in an hour,"" and
after his fare had got in he turned his horse round and drove rapidly
towards the river., A cold rain began to fall, and the blurred street-lamps looked ghastly
in the dripping mist., The public-houses were just closing, and dim men
and women were clustering in broken groups round their doors., From
some of the bars came the sound of horrible laughter., In others,
drunkards brawled and screamed., Lying back in the hansom, with his hat pulled over his forehead, Dorian
Gray watched with listless eyes the sordid shame of the great city, and
now and then he repeated to himself the words that Lord Henry had said
to him on the first day they had met, ""To cure the soul by means of the
senses, and the senses by means of the soul."", Yes, that was the
secret., He had often tried it, and would try it again now., There were
opium dens where one could buy oblivion, dens of horror where the
memory of old sins could be destroyed by the madness of sins that were
new., The moon hung low in the sky like a yellow skull., From time to time a
huge misshapen cloud stretched a long arm across and hid it., The
gas-lamps grew fewer, and the streets more narrow and gloomy., Once the
man lost his way and had to drive back half a mile., A steam rose from
the horse as it splashed up the puddles., The sidewindows of the hansom
were clogged with a grey-flannel mist., ""To cure the soul by means of the senses, and the senses by means of
the soul!"", How the words rang in his ears!, His soul, certainly, was
sick to death., Was it true that the senses could cure it?, Innocent
blood had been spilled., What could atone for that?, Ah!, for that there
was no atonement; but though forgiveness was impossible, forgetfulness
was possible still, and he was determined to forget, to stamp the thing
out, to crush it as one would crush the adder that had stung one., Indeed, what right had Basil to have spoken to him as he had done?, Who
had made him a judge over others?, He had said things that were
dreadful, horrible, not to be endured., On and on plodded the hansom, going slower, it seemed to him, at each
step., He thrust up the trap and called to the man to drive faster., The hideous hunger for opium began to gnaw at him., His throat burned
and his delicate hands twitched nervously together., He struck at the
horse madly with his stick., The driver laughed and whipped up., He
laughed in answer, and the man was silent., The way seemed interminable, and the streets like the black web of some
sprawling spider., The monotony became unbearable, and as the mist
thickened, he felt afraid., Then they passed by lonely brickfields., ...]",2

Charming."", ""Ah!, don't remind me of that,"" cried Dorian Gray., ""Our host is rather horrid this evening,"" answered the duchess,
colouring., ""I believe he thinks that Monmouth married me on purely
scientific principles as the best specimen he could find of a modern
butterfly."", ""Well, I hope he won't stick pins into you, Duchess,"" laughed Dorian., ""Oh!, my maid does that already, Mr. Gray, when she is annoyed with me."", ""And what does she get annoyed with you about, Duchess?"", ""For the most trivial things, Mr. Gray, I assure you., Usually because
I come in at ten minutes to nine and tell her that I must be dressed by
half-past eight."", ""How unreasonable of her!, You should give her warning."", ""I daren't, Mr. Gray., Why, she invents hats for me., You remember the
one I wore at Lady Hilstone's garden-party?, You don't, but it is nice
of you to pretend that you do., Well, she made it out of nothing., All
good hats are made out of nothing."", ""Like all good reputations, Gladys,"" interrupted Lord Henry., ""Every
effect that one produces gives one an enemy., To be popular one must be
a mediocrity."", ""Not with women,"" said the duchess, shaking her head; ""and women rule
the world., I assure you we can't bear mediocrities., We women, as some
one says, love with our ears, just as you men love with your eyes, if
you ever love at all."", ""It seems to me that we never do anything else,"" murmured Dorian., ""Ah!, then, you never really love, Mr. Gray,"" answered the duchess with
mock sadness., ""My dear Gladys!"", cried Lord Henry., ""How can you say that?, Romance
lives by repetition, and repetition converts an appetite into an art., Besides, each time that one loves is the only time one has ever loved., Difference of object does not alter singleness of passion., It merely
intensifies it., We can have in life but one great experience at best,
and the secret of life is to reproduce that experience as often as
possible."", ""Even when one has been wounded by it, Harry?"", asked the duchess after
a pause., ""Especially when one has been wounded by it,"" answered Lord Henry., The duchess turned and looked at Dorian Gray with a curious expression
in her eyes., ""What do you say to that, Mr., Gray?"", she inquired., Dorian hesitated for a moment., Then he threw his head back and
laughed., ""I always agree with Harry, Duchess."", ""Even when he is wrong?"", ""Harry is never wrong, Duchess."", ""And does his philosophy make you happy?"", ""I have never searched for happiness., Who wants happiness?, I have

that charms one., A mist makes things wonderful."", ""One may lose one's way."", ""All ways end at the same point, my dear Gladys."", ""What is that?"", ""Disillusion."", ""It was my _debut_ in life,"" she sighed., ""It came to you crowned."", ""I am tired of strawberry leaves."", ""They become you."", ""Only in public."", ""You would miss them,"" said Lord Henry., ""I will not part with a petal."", ""Monmouth has ears."", ""Old age is dull of hearing."", ""Has he never been jealous?"", ""I wish he had been."", He glanced about as if in search of something., ""What are you looking
for?"", she inquired., ""The button from your foil,"" he answered., ""You have dropped it."", She laughed., ""I have still the mask."", ""It makes your eyes lovelier,"" was his reply., She laughed again., Her teeth showed like white seeds in a scarlet
fruit., Upstairs, in his own room, Dorian Gray was lying on a sofa, with terror
in every tingling fibre of his body., Life had suddenly become too
hideous a burden for him to bear., The dreadful death of the unlucky
beater, shot in the thicket like a wild animal, had seemed to him to
pre-figure death for himself also., He had nearly swooned at what Lord
Henry had said in a chance mood of cynical jesting., At five o'clock he rang his bell for his servant and gave him orders to
pack his things for the night-express to town, and to have the brougham
at the door by eight-thirty., He was determined not to sleep another
night at Selby Royal., It was an ill-omened place., Death walked there
in the sunlight., The grass of the forest had been spotted with blood., Then he wrote a note to Lord Henry, telling him that he was going up to
town to consult his doctor and asking him to entertain his guests in
his absence., As he was putting it into the envelope, a knock came to
the door, and his valet informed him that the head-keeper wished to see
him., He frowned and bit his lip., ""Send him in,"" he muttered, after
some moments' hesitation., As soon as the man entered, Dorian pulled his chequebook out of a
drawer and spread it out before him., ""I suppose you have come about the unfortunate accident of this
morning, Thornton?"", he said, taking up a pen., ""Yes, sir,"" answered the gamekeeper., ""Was the poor fellow married?, Had he any people dependent on him?"", asked Dorian, looking bored., ""If so, I should not like them to be left
in want, and will send them any sum of money you may think necessary."", ""We don't know who he is, sir., That is what I took the liberty of
coming to you about."", ""Don't know who he is?"", said Dorian, listlessly., ""What do you mean?, Wasn't he one of your men?"", ""No, sir., Never saw him before., Seems like a sailor, sir."", The pen dropped from Dorian Gray's hand, and he felt as if his heart
had suddenly stopped beating., ""A sailor?"", he cried out., ""Did you say
a sailor?"", ""Yes, sir., He looks as if he had been a sort of sailor; tattooed on
both arms, and that kind of thing."", ""Was there anything found on him?"", said Dorian, leaning forward and
looking at the man with startled eyes., ""Anything that would tell his
name?"", ""Some money, sir--not much, and a six-shooter., There was no name of any
kind., A decent-looking man, sir, but rough-like., A sort of sailor we
think."", Dorian started to his feet., A terrible hope fluttered past him., He
clutched at it madly., ""Where is the body?"", he exclaimed., ""Quick!, I
must see it at once."", ""It is in an empty stable in the Home Farm, sir., The folk don't like
to have that sort of thing in their houses., They say a corpse brings
bad luck."", ""The Home Farm!, Go there at once and meet me., Tell one of the grooms
to bring my horse round., No., Never mind., I'll go to the stables
myself., It will save time."", In less than a quarter of an hour, Dorian Gray was galloping down the
long avenue as hard as he could go., The trees seemed to sweep past him
in spectral procession, and wild shadows to fling themselves across his
path., Once the mare swerved at a white gate-post and nearly threw him., He lashed her across the neck with his crop., She cleft the dusky air
like an arrow., The stones flew from her hoofs., At last he reached the Home Farm., Two men were loitering in the yard., He leaped from the saddle and threw the reins to one of them., In the
farthest stable a light was glimmering., ...]",2
127,"[You have set yourself to
music., Your days are your sonnets."", Dorian rose up from the piano and passed his hand through his hair., ""Yes, life has been exquisite,"" he murmured, ""but I am not going to
have the same life, Harry., And you must not say these extravagant
things to me., You don't know everything about me., I think that if you
did, even you would turn from me., You laugh., Don't laugh."", ""Why have you stopped playing, Dorian?, Go back and give me the
nocturne over again., Look at that great, honey-coloured moon that
hangs in the dusky air., She is waiting for you to charm her, and if
you play she will come closer to the earth., You won't?, Let us go to
the club, then., It has been a charming evening, and we must end it
charmingly., There is some one at White's who wants immensely to know
you--young Lord Poole, Bournemouth's eldest son., He has already copied
your neckties, and has begged me to introduce him to you., He is quite
delightful and rather reminds me of you."", ""I hope not,"" said Dorian with a sad look in his eyes., ""But I am tired
to-night, Harry., I shan't go to the club., It is nearly eleven, and I
want to go to bed early."", ""Do stay., You have never played so well as to-night., There was
something in your touch that was wonderful., It had more expression
than I had ever heard from it before."", ""It is because I am going to be good,"" he answered, smiling., ""I am a
little changed already."", ""You cannot change to me, Dorian,"" said Lord Henry., ""You and I will
always be friends."", ""Yet you poisoned me with a book once., I should not forgive that., Harry, promise me that you will never lend that book to any one., It
does harm."", ""My dear boy, you are really beginning to moralize., You will soon be
going about like the converted, and the revivalist, warning people
against all the sins of which you have grown tired., You are much too
delightful to do that., Besides, it is no use., You and I are what we
are, and will be what we will be., As for being poisoned by a book,
there is no such thing as that., Art has no influence upon action., It
annihilates the desire to act., It is superbly sterile., The books that
the world calls immoral are books that show the world its own shame., That is all., But we won't discuss literature., Come round to-morrow., I
am going to ride at eleven., We might go together, and I will take you
to lunch afterwards with Lady Branksome., She is a charming woman, and
wants to consult you about some tapestries she is thinking of buying., Mind you come., Or shall we lunch with our little duchess?, She says
she never sees you now., Perhaps you are tired of Gladys?, I thought
you would be., Her clever tongue gets on one's nerves., Well, in any
case, be here at eleven."", ""Must I really come, Harry?"", ""Certainly., The park is quite lovely now., I don't think there have
been such lilacs since the year I met you."", ""Very well., I shall be here at eleven,"" said Dorian., ""Good night,
Harry."", As he reached the door, he hesitated for a moment, as if he
had something more to say., Then he sighed and went out., It was a lovely night, so warm that he threw his coat over his arm and
did not even put his silk scarf round his throat., As he strolled home,
smoking his cigarette, two young men in evening dress passed him., He
heard one of them whisper to the other, ""That is Dorian Gray."", He
remembered how pleased he used to be when he was pointed out, or stared
at, or talked about., He was tired of hearing his own name now., Half
the charm of the little village where he had been so often lately was
that no one knew who he was., He had often told the girl whom he had
lured to love him that he was poor, and she had believed him., He had
told her once that he was wicked, and she had laughed at him and
answered that wicked people were always very old and very ugly., What a
laugh she had!--just like a thrush singing., And how pretty she had
been in her cotton dresses and her large hats!, She knew nothing, but
she had everything that he had lost., When he reached home, he found his servant waiting up for him., He sent
him to bed, and threw himself down on the sofa in the library, and
began to think over some of the things that Lord Henry had said to him., Was it really true that one could never change?, He felt a wild longing
for the unstained purity of his boyhood--his rose-white boyhood, as
Lord Henry had once called it., He knew that he had tarnished himself,
filled his mind with corruption and given horror to his fancy; that he
had been an evil influence to others, and had experienced a terrible
joy in being so; and that of the lives that had crossed his own, it had
been the fairest and the most full of promise that he had brought to
shame., But was it all irretrievable?, Was there no hope for him?, Ah!, in what a monstrous moment of pride and passion he had prayed that
the portrait should bear the burden of his days, and he keep the
unsullied splendour of eternal youth!, All his failure had been due to
that., Better for him that each sin of his life had brought its sure
swift penalty along with it., There was purification in punishment., Not ""Forgive us our sins"" but ""Smite us for our iniquities"" should be
the prayer of man to a most just God., The curiously carved mirror that Lord Henry had given to him, so many
years ago now, was standing on the table, and the white-limbed Cupids
laughed round it as of old., He took it up, as he had done on that
night of horror when he had first noted the change in the fatal
picture, and with wild, tear-dimmed eyes looked into its polished
shield., Once, some one who had terribly loved him had written to him a
mad letter, ending with these idolatrous words: ""The world is changed
because you are made of ivory and gold., The curves of your lips
rewrite history."", The phrases came back to his memory, and he repeated
them over and over to himself., Then he loathed his own beauty, and
flinging the mirror on the floor, crushed it into silver splinters
beneath his heel., It was his beauty that had ruined him, his beauty
and the youth that he had prayed for., But for those two things, his
life might have been free from stain., His beauty had been to him but a
mask, his youth but a mockery., ...]",2

   You have the eyes of one I used to know,

   Else will the world think very little of thee;
   It is its test of power; yet see thou show?st
   A smiling mask of friendship to all men,

   And do foul murder., DUCHESS [_coming down a few steps_.], Murder did you say?, Murder is hungry, and still cries for more,
   And Death, his brother, is not satisfied,
   But walks the house, and will not go away,
   Unless he has a comrade!, Tarry, Death,
   For I will give thee a most faithful lackey
   To travel with thee!, Murder, call no more,
   For thou shalt eat thy fill., There is a storm
   Will break upon this house before the morning,
   So horrible, that the white moon already
   Turns grey and sick with terror, the low wind
   Goes moaning round the house, and the high stars
   Run madly through the vaulted firmament,
   As though the night wept tears of liquid fire
   For what the day shall look upon., Oh, weep,
   Thou lamentable heaven!, Weep thy fill!, Though sorrow like a cataract drench the fields,
   And make the earth one bitter lake of tears,
   It would not be enough., [_A peal of thunder_.], Do you not hear,
   There is artillery in the Heaven to-night., Vengeance is wakened up, and has unloosed
   His dogs upon the world, and in this matter
   Which lies between us two, let him who draws
   The thunder on his head beware the ruin
   Which the forked flame brings after., [_A flash of lightning followed by a peal of thunder_.], GUIDO

   Away!, away!, [_Exit the_ DUCHESS, _who as she lifts the crimson curtain looks back for
a moment at_ GUIDO, _but he makes no sign_., _More thunder_.], Now is life fallen in ashes at my feet
   And noble love self-slain; and in its place
   Crept murder with its silent bloody feet., And she who wrought it?Oh!, and yet she loved me,
   And for my sake did do this dreadful thing., I have been cruel to her: Beatrice!, Beatrice, I say, come back., [_Begins to ascend staircase_, _when the noise of Soldiers is heard_.], Ah!, what is that?, Torches ablaze, and noise of hurrying feet., Pray God they have not seized her., [_Noise grows louder_.], Beatrice!, There is yet time to escape., Come down, come out!, [_The voice of the_ DUCHESS _outside_.], This way went he, the man who slew my lord., [_Down the staircase comes hurrying a confused body of Soldiers_; GUIDO
_is not seen at first_, _till the_ DUCHESS _surrounded by Servants
carrying torches appears at the top of the staircase_, _and points to_

from his hand and showing it to the Captain of the Guard in sight of the

                                  SCENE

_The Court of Justice_: _the walls are hung with stamped grey velvet_:
_above the hangings the wall is red_, _and gilt symbolical figures bear
up the roof_, _which is made of red beams with grey soffits and
moulding_: _a canopy of white satin flowered with gold is set for the
Duchess_: _below it a long bench with red cloth for the Judges_: _below
that a table for the clerks of the court., Two soldiers stand on each
side of the canopy_, _and two soldiers guard the door_; _the citizens
have some of them collected in the Court_; _others are coming in greeting
one another_; _two tipstaffs in violet keep order with long white wands_., FIRST CITIZEN

   Good morrow, neighbour Anthony., SECOND CITIZEN

   Good morrow, neighbour Dominick., FIRST CITIZEN

   This is a strange day for Padua, is it not?, ?the Duke being dead., SECOND CITIZEN

   I tell you, neighbour Dominick, I have not known such a day since the
   last Duke died., FIRST CITIZEN

   They will try him first, and sentence him afterwards, will they not,
   neighbour Anthony?, SECOND CITIZEN

   Nay, for he might ?scape his punishment then; but they will condemn
   him first so that he gets his deserts, and give him trial afterwards
   so that no injustice is done., FIRST CITIZEN

   Well, well, it will go hard with him I doubt not., SECOND CITIZEN

   Surely it is a grievous thing to shed a Duke?s blood., THIRD CITIZEN

   They say a Duke has blue blood., SECOND CITIZEN

   I think our Duke?s blood was black like his soul., FIRST CITIZEN

   Have a watch, neighbour Anthony, the officer is looking at thee., SECOND CITIZEN

   I care not if he does but look at me; he cannot whip me with the
   lashes of his eye., THIRD CITIZEN

   What think you of this young man who stuck the knife into the Duke?, SECOND CITIZEN

   Why, that he is a well-behaved, and a well-meaning, and a
   well-favoured lad, and yet wicked in that he killed the Duke., THIRD CITIZEN

   ?Twas the first time he did it: may be the law will not be hard on
   him, as he did not do it before., SECOND CITIZEN

   True., TIPSTAFF

   Silence, knave., SECOND CITIZEN

   Am I thy looking-glass, Master Tipstaff, that thou callest me knave?, FIRST CITIZEN

   Here be one of the household coming., Well, Dame Lucy, thou art of the
   Court, how does thy poor mistress the Duchess, with her sweet face?, MISTRESS LUCY

   O well-a-day!, O miserable day!, O day!, O misery!, Why it is just
   nineteen years last June, at Michaelmas, since I was married to my
   husband, and it is August now, and here is the Duke murdered; there is
   a coincidence for you!, SECOND CITIZEN

   Why, if it is a coincidence, they may not kill the young man: there is
   no law against coincidences., FIRST CITIZEN

   But how does the Duchess?, MISTRESS LUCY

   Well well, I knew some harm would happen to the house: six weeks ago
   the cakes were all burned on one side, and last Saint Martin even as
   ever was, there flew into the candle a big moth that had wings, and
   a?most scared me., FIRST CITIZEN

   But come to the Duchess, good gossip: what of her?, MISTRESS LUCY

   Marry, it is time you should ask after her, poor lady; she is
   distraught almost., Why, she has not slept, but paced the chamber all
   night long., I prayed her to have a posset, or some aqua-vit?, and to
   get to bed and sleep a little for her health?s sake, but she answered
   me she was afraid she might dream., That was a strange answer, was it
   not?, SECOND CITIZEN

   These great folk have not much sense, so Providence makes it up to
   them in fine clothes., MISTRESS LUCY

   Well, well, God keep murder from us, I say, as long as we are alive., [_Enter_ LORD MORANZONE _hurriedly_.], MORANZONE

   Is the Duke dead?, SECOND CITIZEN

   He has a knife in his heart, which they say is not healthy for any
   man., MORANZONE

   Who is accused of having killed him?, SECOND CITIZEN

   Why, the prisoner, sir., MORANZONE

   But who is the prisoner?, SECOND CITIZEN

   Why, he that is accused of the Duke?s murder., MORANZONE

   I mean, what is his name?, SECOND CITIZEN

   Faith, the same which his godfathers gave him: what else should it be?, TIPSTAFF

   Guido Ferranti is his name, my lord., MORANZONE

   I almost knew thine answer ere you gave it., [_Aside_.], Yet it is strange he should have killed the Duke,
   Seeing he left me in such different mood., It is most likely when he saw the man,
   This devil who had sold his father?s life,
   That passion from their seat within his heart
   Thrust all his boyish theories of love,
   And in their place set vengeance; yet I marvel
   That he escaped not., [_Turning again to the crowd_.], How was he taken?, Tell me., THIRD CITIZEN

   Marry, sir, he was taken by the heels., MORANZONE

   But who seized him?, ...]",2
131,"[FIRST SOLDIER

   Is that so?, SECOND SOLDIER

   Ay, and did much entreat the Lord Justice, but he would not., FIRST SOLDIER

   I had thought, Pietro, that the Duchess was omnipotent., SECOND SOLDIER

   True, she is well-favoured; I know none so comely., THE SOLDIERS

   Ha!, ha!, ha!, FIRST SOLDIER

   I meant I had thought our Duchess could do anything., SECOND SOLDIER

   Nay, for he is now given over to the Justices, and they will see that
   justice be done; they and stout Hugh the headsman; but when his head
   is off, why then the Duchess can pardon him if she likes; there is no
   law against that., FIRST SOLDIER

   I do not think that stout Hugh, as you call him, will do the business
   for him after all., This Guido is of gentle birth, and so by the law
   can drink poison first, if it so be his pleasure., THIRD SOLDIER

   And if he does not drink it?, FIRST SOLDIER

   Why, then, they will kill him., [_Knocking comes at the door_.], FIRST SOLDIER

   See who that is., [_Third Soldier goes over and looks through the wicket_.], THIRD SOLDIER

   It is a woman, sir., FIRST SOLDIER

   Is she pretty?, THIRD SOLDIER

   I can?t tell., She is masked, lieutenant., FIRST SOLDIER

   It is only very ugly or very beautiful women who ever hide their
   faces., Let her in., [_Soldier opens the door_, _and the_ DUCHESS _masked and cloaked

   Are you the officer on guard?, FIRST SOLDIER [_coming forward_]

   I am, madam., DUCHESS

   I must see the prisoner alone., FIRST SOLDIER

   I am afraid that is impossible., [_The_ DUCHESS _hands him a ring_,
   _he looks at and returns it to her with a bow and makes a sign to the
   Soldiers_.], Stand without there., [_Exeunt the Soldiers_.], DUCHESS

   Officer, your men are somewhat rough., FIRST SOLDIER

   They mean no harm., DUCHESS

   I shall be going back in a few minutes., As I pass through the
   corridor do not let them try and lift my mask., FIRST SOLDIER

   You need not be afraid, madam., DUCHESS

   I have a particular reason for wishing my face not to be seen., FIRST SOLDIER

   Madam, with this ring you can go in and out as you please; it is the
   Duchess?s own ring., DUCHESS

   Leave us., [_The Soldier turns to go out_.], A moment, sir., For what
   hour is ., ., ., FIRST SOLDIER

   At twelve o?clock, madam, we have orders to lead him out; but I dare
   say he won?t wait for us; he?s more like to take a drink out of that
   poison yonder., Men are afraid of the headsman., DUCHESS

   Is that poison?, FIRST SOLDIER

   Ay, madam, and very sure poison too., DUCHESS

   You may go, sir., FIRST SOLDIER

   By Saint James, a pretty hand!, I wonder who she is., Some woman who
   loved him, perhaps., [_Exit_.], DUCHESS [_taking her mark off_]

   At last!, He can escape now in this cloak and vizard,
   We are of a height almost: they will not know him;
   As for myself what matter?, So that he does not curse me as he goes,
   I care but little: I wonder will he curse me., He has the right., It is eleven now;
   They will not come till twelve., [_Goes over to the table_.], So this is poison., Is it not strange that in this liquor here
   There lies the key to all philosophies?, [_Takes the cup up_.], It smells of poppies., I remember well
   That, when I was a child in Sicily,
   I took the scarlet poppies from the corn,
   And made a little wreath, and my grave uncle,
   Don John of Naples, laughed: I did not know
   That they had power to stay the springs of life,
   To make the pulse cease beating, and to chill
   The blood in its own vessels, till men come
   And with a hook hale the poor body out,
   And throw it in a ditch: the body, ay,?, What of the soul?, that goes to heaven or hell., Where will mine go?, [_Takes the torch from the wall_, _and goes over to the bed_.], How peacefully here he sleeps,
   Like a young schoolboy tired out with play:
   I would that I could sleep so peacefully,
   But I have dreams., [_Bending over him_.], Poor boy: what if I kissed him?, No, no, my lips would burn him like a fire., He has had enough of Love., Still that white neck
   Will ?scape the headsman: I have seen to that:
   He will get hence from Padua to-night,
   And that is well., You are very wise, Lord Justices,
   And yet you are not half so wise as I am,
   And that is well., O God!, how I have loved you,
   And what a bloody flower did Love bear!, [_Comes back to the table_.], What if I drank these juices, and so ceased?, Were it not better than to wait till Death
   Come to my bed with all his serving men,
   Remorse, disease, old age, and misery?, I wonder does one suffer much: I think
   That I am very young to die like this,
   But so it must be., Why, why should I die?, He will escape to-night, and so his blood
   Will not be on my head., No, I must die;
   I have been guilty, therefore I must die;
   He loves me not, and therefore I must die:
   I would die happier if he would kiss me,
   But he will not do that., I did not know him., I thought he meant to sell me to the Judge;
   That is not strange; we women never know
   Our lovers till they leave us., [_Bell begins to toll_.], Thou vile bell,
   That like a bloodhound from thy brazen throat
   Call?st for this man?s life, cease!, thou shalt not get it., He stirs?I must be quick:  [_Takes up cup_.], O Love, Love, Love,
   I did not think that I would pledge thee thus!, [_Drinks poison_, _and sets the cup down on the table behind her_: _the
noise wakens_ GUIDO, _who starts up_, _and does not see what she has
done_., _There is silence for a minute_, _each looking at the other_.], I do not come to ask your pardon now,
   Seeing I know I stand beyond all pardon;
   Enough of that: I have already, sir,
   Confessed my sin to the Lords Justices;
   They would not listen to me: and some said
   I did invent a tale to save your life;
   You have trafficked with me; others said
   That women played with pity as with men;
   Others that grief for my slain Lord and husband
   Had robbed me of my wits: they would not hear me,
   And, when I sware it on the holy book,
   They bade the doctor cure me., They are ten,
   Ten against one, and they possess your life., They call me Duchess here in Padua., I do not know, sir; if I be the Duchess,
   I wrote your pardon, and they would not take it;
   They call it treason, say I taught them that;
   Maybe I did., Within an hour, Guido,
   They will be here, and drag you from the cell,
   And bind your hands behind your back, and bid you
   Kneel at the block: I am before them there;
   Here is the signet ring of Padua,
   ?Twill bring you safely through the men on guard;

quite approve of your being here., Jack., May I ask why?, Algernon., My dear fellow, the way you flirt with Gwendolen is perfectly

propose to her., Algernon., I thought you had come up for pleasure?, ., ., ., I call that
business., Jack., How utterly unromantic you are!, Algernon., I really don't see anything romantic in proposing., It is very
romantic to be in love., But there is nothing romantic about a definite
proposal., Why, one may be accepted., One usually is, I believe., Then
the excitement is all over., The very essence of romance is uncertainty., If ever I get married, I'll certainly try to forget the fact., Jack., I have no doubt about that, dear Algy., The Divorce Court was
specially invented for people whose memories are so curiously
constituted., Algernon., Oh!, there is no use speculating on that subject., Divorces are
made in Heaven--[Jack puts out his hand to take a sandwich., Algernon at
once interferes.], Please don't touch the cucumber sandwiches., They are
ordered specially for Aunt Augusta., [Takes one and eats it.], Jack., Well, you have been eating them all the time., Algernon., That is quite a different matter., She is my aunt., [Takes
plate from below.], Have some bread and butter., The bread and butter is
for Gwendolen., Gwendolen is devoted to bread and butter., Jack., [Advancing to table and helping himself.], And very good bread and
butter it is too., Algernon., Well, my dear fellow, you need not eat as if you were going to
eat it all., You behave as if you were married to her already., You are
not married to her already, and I don't think you ever will be., Jack., Why on earth do you say that?, Algernon., Well, in the first place girls never marry the men they flirt
with., Girls don't think it right., Jack., Oh, that is nonsense!, Algernon., It isn't., It is a great truth., It accounts for the
extraordinary number of bachelors that one sees all over the place., In
the second place, I don't give my consent., Jack., Your consent!, Algernon., My dear fellow, Gwendolen is my first cousin., And before I
allow you to marry her, you will have to clear up the whole question of

Cecily!, I don't know any one of the name of Cecily., [Enter Lane.], Algernon., Bring me that cigarette case Mr. Worthing left in the smoking-
room the last time he dined here., Lane., Yes, sir., [Lane goes out.], Jack., Do you mean to say you have had my cigarette case all this time?, I
wish to goodness you had let me know., I have been writing frantic
letters to Scotland Yard about it., I was very nearly offering a large
reward., Algernon., Well, I wish you would offer one., I happen to be more than
usually hard up., Jack., There is no good offering a large reward now that the thing is
found., [Enter Lane with the cigarette case on a salver., Algernon takes it at

from curiously bad health., Algernon., Yes; poor Bunbury is a dreadful invalid., Lady Bracknell., Well, I must say, Algernon, that I think it is high time
that Mr. Bunbury made up his mind whether he was going to live or to die., This shilly-shallying with the question is absurd., Nor do I in any way
approve of the modern sympathy with invalids., I consider it morbid., Illness of any kind is hardly a thing to be encouraged in others., Health
is the primary duty of life., I am always telling that to your poor
uncle, but he never seems to take much notice ., ., ., as far as any
improvement in his ailment goes., I should be much obliged if you would
ask Mr. Bunbury, from me, to be kind enough not to have a relapse on
Saturday, for I rely on you to arrange my music for me., It is my last
reception, and one wants something that will encourage conversation,
particularly at the end of the season when every one has practically said
whatever they had to say, which, in most cases, was probably not much., Algernon., I'll speak to Bunbury, Aunt Augusta, if he is still conscious,
and I think I can promise you he'll be all right by Saturday., Of course
the music is a great difficulty., You see, if one plays good music,
people don't listen, and if one plays bad music people don't talk., But
I'll run over the programme I've drawn out, if you will kindly come into
the next room for a moment., Lady Bracknell., Thank you, Algernon., It is very thoughtful of you., [Rising, and following Algernon.], I'm sure the programme will be
delightful, after a few expurgations., French songs I cannot possibly
allow., People always seem to think that they are improper, and either
look shocked, which is vulgar, or laugh, which is worse., But German
sounds a thoroughly respectable language, and indeed, I believe is so., Gwendolen, you will accompany me., Gwendolen., Certainly, mamma., [Lady Bracknell and Algernon go into the music-room, Gwendolen remains
behind.], Jack., Charming day it has been, Miss Fairfax., Gwendolen., Pray don't talk to me about the weather, Mr. Worthing., Whenever people talk to me about the weather, I always feel quite certain
that they mean something else., And that makes me so nervous., Jack., I do mean something else., Gwendolen., I thought so., In fact, I am never wrong., Jack., And I would like to be allowed to take advantage of Lady
Bracknell's temporary absence ., ., ., Gwendolen., I would certainly advise you to do so., Mamma has a way of
coming back suddenly into a room that I have often had to speak to her
about., Jack., [Nervously.], Miss Fairfax, ever since I met you I have admired
you more than any girl ., ., ., I have ever met since ., ., ., I met you., Gwendolen., Yes, I am quite well aware of the fact., And I often wish
that in public, at any rate, you had been more demonstrative., For me you
have always had an irresistible fascination., Even before I met you I was
far from indifferent to you., [Jack looks at her in amazement.], We live,
as I hope you know, Mr. Worthing, in an age of ideals., The fact is
constantly mentioned in the more expensive monthly magazines, and has
reached the provincial pulpits, I am told; and my ideal has always been
to love some one of the name of Ernest., There is something in that name
that inspires absolute confidence., The moment Algernon first mentioned
to me that he had a friend called Ernest, I knew I was destined to love
you., Jack., You really love me, Gwendolen?, Gwendolen., Passionately!, Jack., Darling!, You don't know how happy you've made me., Gwendolen., My own Ernest!, Jack., But you don't really mean to say that you couldn't love me if my
name wasn't Ernest?, Gwendolen., But your name is Ernest., Jack., Yes, I know it is., But supposing it was something else?, Do you
mean to say you couldn't love me then?, Gwendolen., [Glibly.], Ah!, that is clearly a metaphysical speculation,
and like most metaphysical speculations has very little reference at all
to the actual facts of real life, as we know them., Jack., Personally, darling, to speak quite candidly, I don't much care
about the name of Ernest ., ., ., I don't think the name suits me at all., ...]",2

Algy, I suppose I shouldn't talk about your own aunt in that way before

only thing that makes me put up with them at all., Relations are simply a
tedious pack of people, who haven't got the remotest knowledge of how to
live, nor the smallest instinct about when to die., Jack., Oh, that is nonsense!, Algernon., It isn't!, Jack., Well, I won't argue about the matter., You always want to argue
about things., Algernon., That is exactly what things were originally made for., Jack., Upon my word, if I thought that, I'd shoot myself ., ., ., [A pause.], You don't think there is any chance of Gwendolen becoming like her mother

in civilised life should be., Jack., I am sick to death of cleverness., Everybody is clever nowadays., You can't go anywhere without meeting clever people., The thing has
become an absolute public nuisance., I wish to goodness we had a few
fools left., Algernon., We have., Jack., I should extremely like to meet them., What do they talk about?, Algernon., The fools?, Oh!, about the clever people, of course., Jack., What fools!, Algernon., By the way, did you tell Gwendolen the truth about your being
Ernest in town, and Jack in the country?, Jack., [In a very patronising manner.], My dear fellow, the truth isn't
quite the sort of thing one tells to a nice, sweet, refined girl., What
extraordinary ideas you have about the way to behave to a woman!, Algernon., The only way to behave to a woman is to make love to her, if
she is pretty, and to some one else, if she is plain., Jack., Oh, that is nonsense., Algernon., What about your brother?, What about the profligate Ernest?, Jack., Oh, before the end of the week I shall have got rid of him., I'll
say he died in Paris of apoplexy., Lots of people die of apoplexy, quite
suddenly, don't they?, Algernon., Yes, but it's hereditary, my dear fellow., It's a sort of
thing that runs in families., You had much better say a severe chill., Jack., You are sure a severe chill isn't hereditary, or anything of that
kind?, Algernon., Of course it isn't!, Jack., Very well, then., My poor brother Ernest to carried off suddenly,
in Paris, by a severe chill., That gets rid of him., Algernon., But I thought you said that ., ., ., Miss Cardew was a little too
much interested in your poor brother Ernest?, Won't she feel his loss a
good deal?, Jack., Oh, that is all right., Cecily is not a silly romantic girl, I am
glad to say., She has got a capital appetite, goes long walks, and pays
no attention at all to her lessons., Algernon., I would rather like to see Cecily., Jack., I will take very good care you never do., She is excessively

first train on Monday morning., I have a business appointment that I am
anxious ., ., ., to miss?, Cecily., Couldn't you miss it anywhere but in London?, Algernon., No: the appointment is in London., Cecily., Well, I know, of course, how important it is not to keep a
business engagement, if one wants to retain any sense of the beauty of
life, but still I think you had better wait till Uncle Jack arrives., I
know he wants to speak to you about your emigrating., Algernon., About my what?, Cecily., Your emigrating., He has gone up to buy your outfit., Algernon., I certainly wouldn't let Jack buy my outfit., He has no taste
in neckties at all., Cecily., I don't think you will require neckties., ...]",2
136,"[Ernest
has just been telling me about his poor invalid friend Mr. Bunbury whom
he goes to visit so often., And surely there must be much good in one who
is kind to an invalid, and leaves the pleasures of London to sit by a bed
of pain., Jack., Oh!, he has been talking about Bunbury, has he?, Cecily., Yes, he has told me all about poor Mr. Bunbury, and his terrible
state of health., Jack., Bunbury!, Well, I won't have him talk to you about Bunbury or
about anything else., It is enough to drive one perfectly frantic., Algernon., Of course I admit that the faults were all on my side., But I
must say that I think that Brother John's coldness to me is peculiarly
painful., I expected a more enthusiastic welcome, especially considering
it is the first time I have come here., Cecily., Uncle Jack, if you don't shake hands with Ernest I will never
forgive you., Jack., Never forgive me?, Cecily., Never, never, never!, Jack., Well, this is the last time I shall ever do it., [Shakes with
Algernon and glares.], Chasuble., It's pleasant, is it not, to see so perfect a reconciliation?, I think we might leave the two brothers together., Miss Prism., Cecily, you will come with us., Cecily., Certainly, Miss Prism., My little task of reconciliation is
over., Chasuble., You have done a beautiful action to-day, dear child., Miss Prism., We must not be premature in our judgments., Cecily., I feel very happy., [They all go off except Jack and Algernon.], Jack., You young scoundrel, Algy, you must get out of this place as soon
as possible., I don't allow any Bunburying here., [Enter Merriman.], Merriman., I have put Mr. Ernest's things in the room next to yours, sir., I suppose that is all right?, Jack., What?, Merriman., Mr. Ernest's luggage, sir., I have unpacked it and put it in
the room next to your own., Jack., His luggage?, Merriman., Yes, sir., Three portmanteaus, a dressing-case, two hat-boxes,
and a large luncheon-basket., Algernon., I am afraid I can't stay more than a week this time., Jack., Merriman, order the dog-cart at once., Mr. Ernest has been
suddenly called back to town., Merriman., Yes, sir., [Goes back into the house.], Algernon., What a fearful liar you are, Jack., I have not been called
back to town at all., Jack., Yes, you have., Algernon., I haven't heard any one call me., Jack., Your duty as a gentleman calls you back., Algernon., My duty as a gentleman has never interfered with my pleasures
in the smallest degree., Jack., I can quite understand that., Algernon., Well, Cecily is a darling., Jack., You are not to talk of Miss Cardew like that., I don't like it., Algernon., Well, I don't like your clothes., You look perfectly
ridiculous in them., Why on earth don't you go up and change?, It is
perfectly childish to be in deep mourning for a man who is actually
staying for a whole week with you in your house as a guest., I call it
grotesque., Jack., You are certainly not staying with me for a whole week as a guest
or anything else., You have got to leave ., ., ., by the four-five train., Algernon., I certainly won't leave you so long as you are in mourning., It
would be most unfriendly., If I were in mourning you would stay with me,
I suppose., I should think it very unkind if you didn't., Jack., ...]",2

mentioning who I am., My father is Lord Bracknell., You have never heard
of papa, I suppose?, Cecily., I don't think so., Gwendolen., Outside the family circle, papa, I am glad to say, is
entirely unknown., I think that is quite as it should be., The home seems
to me to be the proper sphere for the man., And certainly once a man
begins to neglect his domestic duties he becomes painfully effeminate,
does he not?, And I don't like that., It makes men so very attractive., Cecily, mamma, whose views on education are remarkably strict, has
brought me up to be extremely short-sighted; it is part of her system; so
do you mind my looking at you through my glasses?, Cecily., Oh!, not at all, Gwendolen., I am very fond of being looked at., Gwendolen., [After examining Cecily carefully through a lorgnette.], You
are here on a short visit, I suppose., Cecily., Oh no!, I live here., Gwendolen., [Severely.], Really?, Your mother, no doubt, or some female
relative of advanced years, resides here also?, Cecily., Oh no!, I have no mother, nor, in fact, any relations., Gwendolen., Indeed?, Cecily., My dear guardian, with the assistance of Miss Prism, has the
arduous task of looking after me., Gwendolen., Your guardian?, Cecily., Yes, I am Mr. Worthing's ward., Gwendolen., Oh!, It is strange he never mentioned to me that he had a
ward., How secretive of him!, He grows more interesting hourly., I am not
sure, however, that the news inspires me with feelings of unmixed
delight., [Rising and going to her.], I am very fond of you, Cecily; I
have liked you ever since I met you!, But I am bound to state that now
that I know that you are Mr. Worthing's ward, I cannot help expressing a
wish you were--well, just a little older than you seem to be--and not
quite so very alluring in appearance., In fact, if I may speak candidly--

Cecily., Pray do!, I think that whenever one has anything unpleasant to
say, one should always be quite candid., Gwendolen., Well, to speak with perfect candour, Cecily, I wish that you
were fully forty-two, and more than usually plain for your age., Ernest
has a strong upright nature., He is the very soul of truth and honour., Disloyalty would be as impossible to him as deception., But even men of
the noblest possible moral character are extremely susceptible to the
influence of the physical charms of others., Modern, no less than Ancient
History, supplies us with many most painful examples of what I refer to., If it were not so, indeed, History would be quite unreadable., Cecily., I beg your pardon, Gwendolen, did you say Ernest?, Gwendolen., Yes., Cecily., Oh, but it is not Mr. Ernest Worthing who is my guardian., It is
his brother--his elder brother., Gwendolen., [Sitting down again.], Ernest never mentioned to me that he
had a brother., Cecily., I am sorry to say they have not been on good terms for a long
time., Gwendolen., Ah!, that accounts for it., And now that I think of it I have
never heard any man mention his brother., The subject seems distasteful
to most men., Cecily, you have lifted a load from my mind., I was growing
almost anxious., It would have been terrible if any cloud had come across
a friendship like ours, would it not?, Of course you are quite, quite
sure that it is not Mr. Ernest Worthing who is your guardian?, Cecily., Quite sure., [A pause.], In fact, I am going to be his., Gwendolen., [Inquiringly.], I beg your pardon?, Cecily., [Rather shy and confidingly.], Dearest Gwendolen, there is no
reason why I should make a secret of it to you., ...]",2
138,"[Well, the only small satisfaction I have in the whole of this
wretched business is that your friend Bunbury is quite exploded., You
won't be able to run down to the country quite so often as you used to
do, dear Algy., And a very good thing too., Algernon., Your brother is a little off colour, isn't he, dear Jack?, You
won't be able to disappear to London quite so frequently as your wicked
custom was., And not a bad thing either., Jack., As for your conduct towards Miss Cardew, I must say that your
taking in a sweet, simple, innocent girl like that is quite inexcusable., To say nothing of the fact that she is my ward., Algernon., I can see no possible defence at all for your deceiving a
brilliant, clever, thoroughly experienced young lady like Miss Fairfax., To say nothing of the fact that she is my cousin., Jack., I wanted to be engaged to Gwendolen, that is all., I love her., Algernon., Well, I simply wanted to be engaged to Cecily., I adore her., Jack., There is certainly no chance of your marrying Miss Cardew., Algernon., I don't think there is much likelihood, Jack, of you and Miss
Fairfax being united., Jack., Well, that is no business of yours., Algernon., If it was my business, I wouldn't talk about it., [Begins to
eat muffins.], It is very vulgar to talk about one's business., Only
people like stock-brokers do that, and then merely at dinner parties., Jack., How can you sit there, calmly eating muffins when we are in this
horrible trouble, I can't make out., You seem to me to be perfectly
heartless., Algernon., Well, I can't eat muffins in an agitated manner., The butter
would probably get on my cuffs., One should always eat muffins quite
calmly., It is the only way to eat them., Jack., I say it's perfectly heartless your eating muffins at all, under
the circumstances., Algernon., When I am in trouble, eating is the only thing that consoles
me., Indeed, when I am in really great trouble, as any one who knows me
intimately will tell you, I refuse everything except food and drink., At
the present moment I am eating muffins because I am unhappy., Besides, I
am particularly fond of muffins., [Rising.], Jack., [Rising.], Well, that is no reason why you should eat them all in
that greedy way., [Takes muffins from Algernon.], Algernon., [Offering tea-cake.], I wish you would have tea-cake instead., I don't like tea-cake., Jack., Good heavens!, I suppose a man may eat his own muffins in his own
garden., Algernon., But you have just said it was perfectly heartless to eat
muffins., Jack., I said it was perfectly heartless of you, under the circumstances., That is a very different thing., Algernon., That may be., But the muffins are the same., [He seizes the
muffin-dish from Jack.], Jack., Algy, I wish to goodness you would go., Algernon., You can't possibly ask me to go without having some dinner., It's absurd., I never go without my dinner., No one ever does, except
vegetarians and people like that., Besides I have just made arrangements
with Dr. Chasuble to be christened at a quarter to six under the name of
Ernest., Jack., My dear fellow, the sooner you give up that nonsense the better., I
made arrangements this morning with Dr. Chasuble to be christened myself
at 5.30, and I naturally will take the name of Ernest., Gwendolen would
wish it., We can't both be christened Ernest., It's absurd., Besides, I
have a perfect right to be christened if I like., There is no evidence at
all that I have ever been christened by anybody., I should think it
extremely probable I never was, and so does Dr. Chasuble., It is entirely
different in your case., You have been christened already., Algernon., Yes, but I have not been christened for years., Jack., Yes, but you have been christened., That is the important thing., Algernon., Quite so., So I know my constitution can stand it., If you are
not quite sure about your ever having been christened, I must say I think
it rather dangerous your venturing on it now., It might make you very
unwell., You can hardly have forgotten that some one very closely
connected with you was very nearly carried off this week in Paris by a
severe chill., Jack., Yes, but you said yourself that a severe chill was not hereditary., Algernon., It usen't to be, I know--but I daresay it is now., ...]",2

brief space of time., I remember recommending one to young Lady Lancing,
and after three months her own husband did not know her., Jack., And after six months nobody knew her., Lady Bracknell., [Glares at Jack for a few moments., Then bends, with a
practised smile, to Cecily.], Kindly turn round, sweet child., [Cecily
turns completely round.], No, the side view is what I want., [Cecily

social possibilities in your profile., The two weak points in our age are
its want of principle and its want of profile., The chin a little higher,
dear., Style largely depends on the way the chin is worn., They are worn
very high, just at present., Algernon!, Algernon., Yes, Aunt Augusta!, Lady Bracknell., There are distinct social possibilities in Miss Cardew's

people who can't get into it do that., [To Cecily.], Dear child, of
course you know that Algernon has nothing but his debts to depend upon., But I do not approve of mercenary marriages., When I married Lord

consent., Algernon., Thank you, Aunt Augusta., Lady Bracknell., Cecily, you may kiss me!, Cecily., [Kisses her.], Thank you, Lady Bracknell., Lady Bracknell., You may also address me as Aunt Augusta for the future., Cecily., Thank you, Aunt Augusta., Lady Bracknell., The marriage, I think, had better take place quite soon., Algernon., Thank you, Aunt Augusta., Cecily., Thank you, Aunt Augusta., Lady Bracknell., To speak frankly, I am not in favour of long
engagements., They give people the opportunity of finding out each
other's character before marriage, which I think is never advisable., Jack., I beg your pardon for interrupting you, Lady Bracknell, but this
engagement is quite out of the question., I am Miss Cardew's guardian,
and she cannot marry without my consent until she comes of age., That
consent I absolutely decline to give., Lady Bracknell., Upon what grounds may I ask?, Algernon is an extremely,
I may almost say an ostentatiously, eligible young man., He has nothing,
but he looks everything., What more can one desire?, Jack., It pains me very much to have to speak frankly to you, Lady
Bracknell, about your nephew, but the fact is that I do not approve at
all of his moral character., I suspect him of being untruthful., [Algernon
and Cecily look at him in indignant amazement.], Lady Bracknell., Untruthful!, My nephew Algernon?, Impossible!, He is an
Oxonian., Jack., I fear there can be no possible doubt about the matter., This
afternoon during my temporary absence in London on an important question
of romance, he obtained admission to my house by means of the false
pretence of being my brother., Under an assumed name he drank, I've just
been informed by my butler, an entire pint bottle of my Perrier-Jouet,
Brut, '89; wine I was specially reserving for myself., Continuing his
disgraceful deception, he succeeded in the course of the afternoon in
alienating the affections of my only ward., He subsequently stayed to
tea, and devoured every single muffin., And what makes his conduct all
the more heartless is, that he was perfectly well aware from the first
that I have no brother, that I never had a brother, and that I don't
intend to have a brother, not even of any kind., I distinctly told him so
myself yesterday afternoon., Lady Bracknell., Ahem!, Mr. Worthing, after careful consideration I have
decided entirely to overlook my nephew's conduct to you., Jack., That is very generous of you, Lady Bracknell., My own decision,
however, is unalterable., I decline to give my consent., Lady Bracknell., [To Cecily.], Come here, sweet child., [Cecily goes

what the General's Christian name was., But I have no doubt he had one., He was eccentric, I admit., But only in later years., And that was the
result of the Indian climate, and marriage, and indigestion, and other
things of that kind., Jack., Algy!, Can't you recollect what our father's Christian name was?, Algernon., My dear boy, we were never even on speaking terms., He died
before I was a year old., Jack., His name would appear in the Army Lists of the period, I suppose,

have no other name!, Jack., Gwendolen, it is a terrible thing for a man to find out suddenly
that all his life he has been speaking nothing but the truth., Can you
forgive me?, Gwendolen., I can., For I feel that you are sure to change., Jack., My own one!, Chasuble., [To Miss Prism.], Laetitia!, [Embraces her]

Miss Prism., [Enthusiastically.], Frederick!, At last!, Algernon., Cecily!, [Embraces her.], At last!, Jack., Gwendolen!, [Embraces her.], At last!, Lady Bracknell., My nephew, you seem to be displaying signs of
triviality., Jack., On the contrary, Aunt Augusta, I've now realised for the first
time in my life the vital Importance of Being Earnest., HISTORICAL criticism nowhere occurs as an isolated fact in the
civilisation or literature of any people., It is part of that complex
working towards freedom which may be described as the revolt against
authority., It is merely one facet of that speculative spirit of an
innovation, which in the sphere of action produces democracy and
revolution, and in that of thought is the parent of philosophy and
physical science; and its importance as a factor of progress is based not
so much on the results it attains, as on the tone of thought which it
represents, and the method by which it works., Being thus the resultant of forces essentially revolutionary, it is not
to be found in the ancient world among the material despotisms of Asia or
the stationary civilisation of Egypt., The clay cylinders of Assyria and
Babylon, the hieroglyphics of the pyramids, form not history but the
material for history., The Chinese annals, ascending as they do to the barbarous forest life of
the nation, are marked with a soberness of judgment, a freedom from
invention, which is almost unparalleled in the writings of any people;
but the protective spirit which is the characteristic of that people
proved as fatal to their literature as to their commerce., Free criticism
is as unknown as free trade., While as regards the Hindus, their acute,
analytical and logical mind is directed rather to grammar, criticism and
philosophy than to history or chronology., Indeed, in history their
imagination seems to have run wild, legend and fact are so indissolubly
mingled together that any attempt to separate them seems vain., If we
except the identification of the Greek Sandracottus with the Indian
Chandragupta, we have really no clue by which we can test the truth of
their writings or examine their method of investigation., It is among the Hellenic branch of the Indo-Germanic race that history
proper is to be found, as well as the spirit of historical criticism;
among that wonderful offshoot of the primitive Aryans, whom we call by
the name of Greeks and to whom, as has been well said, we owe all that
moves in the world except the blind forces of nature., For, from the day when they left the chill table-lands of Tibet and
journeyed, a nomad people, to ?gean shores, the characteristic of their
nature has been the search for light, and the spirit of historical
criticism is part of that wonderful Aufkl?rung or illumination of the
intellect which seems to have burst on the Greek race like a great flood
of light about the sixth century B.C., _L?esprit d?un si?cle ne na?t pas et ne meurt pas ?, jour fixe_, and the
first critic is perhaps as difficult to discover as the first man., It is
from democracy that the spirit of criticism borrows its intolerance of
dogmatic authority, from physical science the alluring analogies of law
and order, from philosophy the conception of an essential unity
underlying the complex manifestations of phenomena., It appears first
rather as a changed attitude of mind than as a principle of research, and
its earliest influences are to be found in the sacred writings., For men begin to doubt in questions of religion first, and then in
matters of more secular interest; and as regards the nature of the spirit
of historical criticism itself in its ultimate development, it is not
confined merely to the empirical method of ascertaining whether an event
happened or not, but is concerned also with the investigation into the
causes of events, the general relations which phenomena of life hold to
one another, and in its ultimate development passes into the wider
question of the philosophy of history., Now, while the workings of historical criticism in these two spheres of
sacred and uninspired history are essentially manifestations of the same
spirit, yet their methods are so different, the canons of evidence so
entirely separate, and the motives in each case so unconnected, that it
will be necessary for a clear estimation of the progress of Greek
thought, that we should consider these two questions entirely apart from
one another., I shall then in both cases take the succession of writers
in their chronological order as representing the rational order?not that
the succession of time is always the succession of ideas, or that
dialectics moves ever in the straight line in which Hegel conceives its
advance., In Greek thought, as elsewhere, there are periods of stagnation
and apparent retrogression, yet their intellectual development, not
merely in the question of historical criticism, but in their art, their
poetry and their philosophy, seems so essentially normal, so free from
all disturbing external influences, so peculiarly rational, that in
following in the footsteps of time we shall really be progressing in the
order sanctioned by reason., AT an early period in their intellectual development the Greeks reached
that critical point in the history of every civilised nation, when
speculative invades the domain of revealed truth, when the spiritual
ideas of the people can no longer be satisfied by the lower, material
conceptions of their inspired writers, and when men find it impossible to
pour the new wine of free thought into the old bottles of a narrow and a
trammelling creed., From their Aryan ancestors they had received the fatal legacy of a
mythology stained with immoral and monstrous stories which strove to hide
the rational order of nature in a chaos of miracles, and to mar by
imputed wickedness the perfection of God?s nature?a very shirt of Nessos
in which the Heracles of rationalism barely escaped annihilation., Now
while undoubtedly the speculations of Thales, and the alluring analogies
of law and order afforded by physical science, were most important forces
in encouraging the rise of the spirit of scepticism, yet it was on its
ethical side that the Greek mythology was chiefly open to attack., It is difficult to shake the popular belief in miracles, but no man will
admit sin and immorality as attributes of the Ideal he worships; so the
first symptoms of a new order of thought are shown in the passionate
outcries of Xenophanes and Heraclitos against the evil things said by
Homer of the sons of God; and in the story told of Pythagoras, how that
he saw tortured in Hell the ?two founders of Greek theology,?, we can
recognise the rise of the Aufkl?rung as clearly as we see the Reformation
foreshadowed in the _Inferno_ of Dante., Any honest belief, then, in the plain truth of these stories soon
succumbed before the destructive effects of the _a priori_ ethical
criticism of this school; but the orthodox party, as is its custom, found
immediately a convenient shelter under the ?gis of the doctrine of
metaphors and concealed meanings., To this allegorical school the tale of the fight around the walls of Troy
was a mystery, behind which, as behind a veil, were hidden certain moral
and physical truths., The contest between Athena and Ares was that
eternal contest between rational thought and the brute force of
ignorance; the arrows which rattled in the quiver of the ?Far Darter?, were no longer the instruments of vengeance shot from the golden bow of
the child of God, but the common rays of the sun, which was itself
nothing but a mere inert mass of burning metal., Modern investigation, with the ruthlessness of Philistine analysis, has
ultimately brought Helen of Troy down to a symbol of the dawn., There
were Philistines among the Greeks also who saw in the _????, ????, ?_ a mere
metaphor for atmospheric power., ...]",2
141,"[Aristotle meets the whole simply by an appeal to facts., If the theory of
the periodic decay of all created things, he urges, be scientific, it
must be universal, and so true of all the other states as well as of the
ideal., Besides, a state usually changes into its contrary and not to the
form next to it; so the ideal state would not change into Timocracy;
while Oligarchy, more often than Tyranny, succeeds Democracy., Plato,
besides, says nothing of what a Tyranny would change to., According to
the cycle theory it ought to pass into the ideal state again, but as a
fact one Tyranny is changed into another as at Sicyon, or into a
Democracy as at Syracuse, or into an Aristocracy as at Carthage., The
example of Sicily, too, shows that an Oligarchy is often followed by a
Tyranny, as at Leontini and Gela., Besides, it is absurd to represent
greed as the chief motive of decay, or to talk of avarice as the root of
Oligarchy, when in nearly all true oligarchies money-making is forbidden
by law., And finally the Platonic theory neglects the different kinds of
democracies and of tyrannies., Now nothing can be more important than this passage in Aristotle?s
_Politics_ (_v._ 12., ), which may he said to mark an era in the evolution
of historical criticism., For there is nothing on which Aristotle insists
so strongly as that the generalisations from facts ought to be added to
the data of the _a priori_ method?a principle which we know to be true
not merely of deductive speculative politics but of physics also: for are
not the residual phenomena of chemists a valuable source of improvement
in theory?, His own method is essentially historical though by no means empirical., On the contrary, this far-seeing thinker, rightly styled _il maestro di
color che sanno_, may be said to have apprehended clearly that the true
method is neither exclusively empirical nor exclusively speculative, but
rather a union of both in the process called Analysis or the
Interpretation of Facts, which has been defined as the application to
facts of such general conceptions as may fix the important
characteristics of the phenomena, and present them permanently in their
true relations., He too was the first to point out, what even in our own
day is incompletely appreciated, that nature, including the development
of man, is not full of incoherent episodes like a bad tragedy, that
inconsistency and anomaly are as impossible in the moral as they are in
the physical world, and that where the superficial observer thinks he
sees a revolution the philosophical critic discerns merely the gradual
and rational evolution of the inevitable results of certain antecedents., And while admitting the necessity of a psychological basis for the
philosophy of history, he added to it the important truth that man, to be
apprehended in his proper position in the universe as well as in his
natural powers, must be studied from below in the hierarchical
progression of higher function from the lower forms of life., The
important maxim, that to obtain a clear conception of anything we must
?study it in its growth from the very beginning,?, is formally set down in
the opening of the _Politics_, where, indeed, we shall find the other
characteristic features of the modern Evolutionary theory, such as the
?Differentiation of Function?, and the ?Survival of the Fittest?, explicitly set forth., What a valuable step this was in the improvement of the method of
historical criticism it is needless to point out., By it, one may say,
the true thread was given to guide one?s steps through the bewildering
labyrinth of facts., For history (to use terms with which Aristotle has
made us familiar) may be looked at from two essentially different
standpoints; either as a work of art whose _????, ?_ or final cause is
external to it and imposed on it from without; or as an organism
containing the law of its own development in itself, and working out its
perfection merely by the fact of being what it is., Now, if we adopt the
former, which we may style the theological view, we shall be in continual
danger of tripping into the pitfall of some _a priori_ conclusion?that
bourne from which, it has been truly said, no traveller ever returns., The latter is the only scientific theory and was apprehended in its
fulness by Aristotle, whose application of the inductive method to
history, and whose employment of the evolutionary theory of humanity,
show that he was conscious that the philosophy of history is nothing
separate from the facts of history but is contained in them, and that the
rational law of the complex phenomena of life, like the ideal in the
world of thought, is to be reached through the facts, not superimposed on
them?_????, ?????, ?_ not _????, ?????_., And finally, in estimating the enormous debt which the science of
historical criticism owes to Aristotle, we must not pass over his
attitude towards those two great difficulties in the formation of a
philosophy of history on which I have touched above., I mean the
assertion of extra-natural interference with the normal development of
the world and of the incalculable influence exercised by the power of
free will., Now, as regards the former, he may be said to have neglected it entirely., The special acts of providence proceeding from God?s immediate government
of the world, which Herodotus saw as mighty landmarks in history, would
have been to him essentially disturbing elements in that universal reign
of law, the extent of whose limitless empire he of all the great thinkers
of antiquity was the first explicitly to recognise., Standing aloof from the popular religion as well as from the deeper
conceptions of Herodotus and the Tragic School, he no longer thought of
God as of one with fair limbs and treacherous face haunting wood and
glade, nor would he see in him a jealous judge continually interfering in
the world?s history to bring the wicked to punishment and the proud to a
fall., God to him was the incarnation of the pure Intellect, a being
whose activity was the contemplation of his own perfection, one whom
Philosophy might imitate but whom prayers could never move, to the
sublime indifference of whose passionless wisdom what were the sons of
men, their desires or their sins?, While, as regards the other difficulty
and the formation of a philosophy of history, the conflict of free will
with general laws appears first in Greek thought in the usual theological
form in which all great ideas seem to be cradled at their birth., It was such legends as those of ?dipus and Adrastus, exemplifying the
struggles of individual humanity against the overpowering force of
circumstances and necessity, which gave to the early Greeks those same
lessons which we of modern days draw, in somewhat less artistic fashion,
from the study of statistics and the laws of physiology., In Aristotle, of course, there is no trace of supernatural influence., The Furies, which drive their victim into sin first and then punishment,
are no longer ?viper-tressed goddesses with eyes and mouth aflame,?, but
those evil thoughts which harbour within the impure soul., In this, as in
all other points, to arrive at Aristotle is to reach the pure atmosphere
of scientific and modern thought., But while he rejected pure necessitarianism in its crude form as
essentially a _reductio ad absurdum_ of life, he was fully conscious of
the fact that the will is not a mysterious and ultimate unit of force
beyond which we cannot go and whose special characteristic is
inconsistency, but a certain creative attitude of the mind which is, from
the first, continually influenced by habits, education and circumstance;
so absolutely modifiable, in a word, that the good and the bad man alike
seem to lose the power of free will; for the one is morally unable to
sin, the other physically incapacitated for reformation., And of the influence of climate and temperature in forming the nature of
man (a conception perhaps pressed too far in modern days when the ?race
theory?, is supposed to be a sufficient explanation of the Hindoo, and the
latitude and longitude of a country the best guide to its morals {57})
Aristotle is completely unaware., I do not allude to such smaller points
as the oligarchical tendencies of a horse-breeding country and the
democratic influence of the proximity of the sea (important though they
are for the consideration of Greek history), but rather to those wider
views in the seventh book of his _Politics_, where he attributes the
happy union in the Greek character of intellectual attainments with the
spirit of progress to the temperate climate they enjoyed, and points out
how the extreme cold of the north dulls the mental faculties of its
inhabitants and renders them incapable of social organisation or extended
empire; while to the enervating heat of eastern countries was due that
want of spirit and bravery which then, as now, was the characteristic of
the population in that quarter of the globe., Thucydides has shown the causal connection between political revolutions
and the fertility of the soil, but goes a step farther and points out the
psychological influences on a people?s character exercised by the various
extremes of climate?in both cases the first appearance of a most valuable
form of historical criticism., To the development of Dialectic, as to God, intervals of time are of no
account., From Plato and Aristotle we pass direct to Polybius., The progress of thought from the philosopher of the Academe to the
Arcadian historian may be best illustrated by a comparison of the method
by which each of the three writers, whom I have selected as the highest
expression of the rationalism of his respective age, attained to his
ideal state: for the latter conception may be in a measure regarded as
representing the most spiritual principle which they could discern in
history., Now, Plato created his on _a priori_ principles; Aristotle formed his by
an analysis of existing constitutions; Polybius found his realised for
him in the actual world of fact., Aristotle criticised the deductive
speculations of Plato by means of inductive negative instances, but
Polybius will not take the ?Cloud City?, of the _Republic_ into account at
all., He compares it to an athlete who has never run on ?Constitution
Hill,?, to a statue so beautiful that it is entirely removed from the
ordinary conditions of humanity, and consequently from the canons of
criticism., The Roman state had attained in his eyes, by means of the mutual
counteraction of three opposing forces, {59} that stable equilibrium in
politics which was the ideal of all the theoretical writers of antiquity., And in connection with this point it will be convenient to notice here
how much truth there is contained in the accusation often brought against
the ancients that they knew nothing of the idea of Progress, for the
meaning of many of their speculations will be hidden from us if we do not
try and comprehend first what their aim was, and secondly why it was so., Now, like all wide generalities, this statement is at least inaccurate., The prayer of Plato?s ideal City?_??, ??????, ???????, ?_, _???, ??, ????????, ?????????????, ???, ????, ????????, ????????, ?_, might be written as a text
over the door of the last Temple to Humanity raised by the disciples of
Fourier and Saint-Simon, but it is certainly true that their ideal
principle was order and permanence, not indefinite progress., For,
setting aside the artistic prejudices which would have led the Greeks to
reject this idea of unlimited improvement, we may note that the modern
conception of progress rests partly on the new enthusiasm and worship of
humanity, partly on the splendid hopes of material improvements in
civilisation which applied science has held out to us, two influences
from which ancient Greek thought seems to have been strangely free., For
the Greeks marred the perfect humanism of the great men whom they
worshipped, by imputing to them divinity and its supernatural powers;
while their science was eminently speculative and often almost mystic in
its character, aiming at culture and not utility, at higher spirituality
and more intense reverence for law, rather than at the increased
facilities of locomotion and the cheap production of common things about
which our modern scientific school ceases not to boast., And lastly, and
perhaps chiefly, we must remember that the ?plague spot of all Greek
states,?, as one of their own writers has called it, was the terrible
insecurity to life and property which resulted from the factions and
revolutions which ceased not to trouble Greece at all times, raising a
spirit of fanaticism such as religion raised in the middle ages of
Europe., These considerations, then, will enable us to understand first how it was
that, radical and unscrupulous reformers as the Greek political theorists
were, yet, their end once attained, no modern conservatives raised such
outcry against the slightest innovation., Even acknowledged improvements
in such things as the games of children or the modes of music were
regarded by them with feelings of extreme apprehension as the herald of
the _drapeau rouge_ of reform., And secondly, it will show us how it was
that Polybius found his ideal in the commonwealth of Rome, and Aristotle,
like Mr., Bright, in the middle classes., Polybius, however, is not
content merely with pointing out his ideal state, but enters at
considerable length into the question of those general laws whose
consideration forms the chief essential of the philosophy of history., He starts by accepting the general principle that all things are fated to
decay (which I noticed in the case of Plato), and that ?as iron produces
rust and as wood breeds the animals that destroy it, so every state has
in it the seeds of its own corruption.?, He is not, however, content to
rest there, but proceeds to deal with the more immediate causes of
revolutions, which he says are twofold in nature, either external or
internal., Now, the former, depending as they do on the synchronous
conjunction of other events outside the sphere of scientific estimation,
are from their very character incalculable; but the latter, though
assuming many forms, always result from the over-great preponderance of
any single element to the detriment of the others, the rational law lying
at the base of all varieties of political changes being that stability
can result only from the statical equilibrium produced by the
counteraction of opposing parts, since the more simple a constitution is
the more it is insecure., Plato had pointed out before how the extreme
liberty of a democracy always resulted in despotism, but Polybius
analyses the law and shows the scientific principles on which it rests., The doctrine of the instability of pure constitutions forms an important
era in the philosophy of history., Its special applicability to the
politics of our own day has been illustrated in the rise of the great
Napoleon, when the French state had lost those divisions of caste and
prejudice, of landed aristocracy and moneyed interest, institutions in
which the vulgar see only barriers to Liberty but which are indeed the
only possible defences against the coming of that periodic Sirius of
politics, the _????????, ??, ???????????, ?????_., There is a principle which Tocqueville never wearies of explaining, and
which has been subsumed by Mr. Herbert Spencer under that general law
common to all organic bodies which we call the Instability of the
Homogeneous., The various manifestations of this law, as shown in the
normal, regular revolutions and evolutions of the different forms of
government, {63a} are expounded with great clearness by Polybius, who
claimed for his theory, in the Thucydidean spirit, that it is a _?????, ??, ??, ?_, not a mere _????????, ??, ??, ????????, ?_, and that a knowledge of it
will enable the impartial observer {63b} to discover at any time what
period of its constitutional evolution any particular state has already
reached and into what form it will be next differentiated, though
possibly the exact time of the changes may be more or less uncertain., {63c}

Now in this necessarily incomplete account of the laws of political
revolutions as expounded by Polybius enough perhaps has been said to show
what is his true position in the rational development of the ?Idea?, which
I have called the Philosophy of History, because it is the unifying of
history., Seen darkly as it is through the glass of religion in the pages
of Herodotus, more metaphysical than scientific with Thucydides, Plato
strove to seize it by the eagle-flight of speculation, to reach it with
the eager grasp of a soul impatient of those slower and surer inductive
methods which Aristotle, in his trenchant criticism of his greater
master, showed were more brilliant than any vague theory, if the test of
brilliancy is truth., What then is the position of Polybius?, Does any new method remain for
him?, ...]",2
142,"[Wearied of the dull monotony of the pontifical annals, which dwelt on
little else but the rise and fall in provisions and the eclipses of the
sun, Cato wrote out a history with his own hand for the instruction of
his child, to which he gave the name of Origines, and before his time
some aristocratic families had written histories in Greek much in the
same spirit in which the Germans of the eighteenth century used French as
the literary language., But the first regular Roman historian is Sallust., Between the extravagant eulogies passed on this author by the French
(such as De Closset), and Dr. Mommsen?s view of him as merely a political
pamphleteer, it is perhaps difficult to reach the _via media_ of
unbiassed appreciation., He has, at any rate, the credit of being a
purely rationalistic historian, perhaps the only one in Roman literature., Cicero had a good many qualifications for a scientific historian, and (as
he usually did) thought very highly of his own powers., On passages of
ancient legend, however, he is rather unsatisfactory, for while he is too
sensible to believe them he is too patriotic to reject them., And this is
really the attitude of Livy, who claims for early Roman legend a certain
uncritical homage from the rest of the subject world., His view in his
history is that it is not worth while to examine the truth of these
stories., In his hands the history of Rome unrolls before our eyes like some
gorgeous tapestry, where victory succeeds victory, where triumph treads
on the heels of triumph, and the line of heroes seems never to end., It
is not till we pass behind the canvas and see the slight means by which
the effect is produced that we apprehend the fact that like most
picturesque writers Livy is an indifferent critic., As regards his
attitude towards the credibility of early Roman history he is quite as
conscious as we are of its mythical and unsound nature., He will not, for
instance, decide whether the Horatii were Albans or Romans; who was the
first dictator; how many tribunes there were, and the like., His method,
as a rule, is merely to mention all the accounts and sometimes to decide
in favour of the most probable, but usually not to decide at all., No
canons of historical criticism will ever discover whether the Roman women
interviewed the mother of Coriolanus of their own accord or at the
suggestion of the senate; whether Remus was killed for jumping over his
brother?s wall or because they quarrelled about birds; whether the
ambassadors found Cincinnatus ploughing or only mending a hedge., Livy
suspends his judgment over these important facts and history when
questioned on their truth is dumb., If he does select between two
historians he chooses the one who is nearer to the facts he describes., But he is no critic, only a conscientious writer., It is mere vain waste
to dwell on his critical powers, for they do not exist., * * * * *

In the case of Tacitus imagination has taken the place of history., The
past lives again in his pages, but through no laborious criticism; rather
through a dramatic and psychological faculty which he specially
possessed., In the philosophy of history he has no belief., He can never make up his
mind what to believe as regards God?s government of the world., There is
no method in him and none elsewhere in Roman literature., Nations may not have missions but they certainly have functions., And the
function of ancient Italy was not merely to give us what is statical in
our institutions and rational in our law, but to blend into one elemental
creed the spiritual aspirations of Aryan and of Semite., Italy was not a
pioneer in intellectual progress, nor a motive power in the evolution of
thought., The owl of the goddess of Wisdom traversed over the whole land
and found nowhere a resting-place., The dove, which is the bird of
Christ, flew straight to the city of Rome and the new reign began., It
was the fashion of early Italian painters to represent in medi?val
costume the soldiers who watched over the tomb of Christ, and this, which
was the result of the frank anachronism of all true art, may serve to us
as an allegory., For it was in vain that the Middle Ages strove to guard
the buried spirit of progress., When the dawn of the Greek spirit arose,
the sepulchre was empty, the grave-clothes laid aside., Humanity had
risen from the dead., The study of Greek, it has been well said, implies the birth of
criticism, comparison and research., At the opening of that education of
modern by ancient thought which we call the Renaissance, it was the words
of Aristotle which sent Columbus sailing to the New World, while a
fragment of Pythagorean astronomy set Copernicus thinking on that train
of reasoning which has revolutionised the whole position of our planet in
the universe., Then it was seen that the only meaning of progress is a
return to Greek modes of thought., The monkish hymns which obscured the
pages of Greek manuscripts were blotted out, the splendours of a new
method were unfolded to the world, and out of the melancholy sea of
medi?valism rose the free spirit of man in all that splendour of glad
adolescence, when the bodily powers seem quickened by a new vitality,
when the eye sees more clearly than its wont and the mind apprehends what
was beforetime hidden from it., To herald the opening of the sixteenth
century, from the little Venetian printing press came forth all the great
authors of antiquity, each bearing on the title-page the words _?????, ?, ?????????, ???????, ???, ???????, ?_; words which may serve to remind us with
what wondrous prescience Polybius saw the world?s fate when he foretold
the material sovereignty of Roman institutions and exemplified in himself
the intellectual empire of Greece., The course of the study of the spirit of historical criticism has not
been a profitless investigation into modes and forms of thought now
antiquated and of no account., The only spirit which is entirely removed
from us is the medi?val; the Greek spirit is essentially modern., The
introduction of the comparative method of research which has forced
history to disclose its secrets belongs in a measure to us., Ours, too,
is a more scientific knowledge of philology and the method of survival., Nor did the ancients know anything of the doctrine of averages or of
crucial instances, both of which methods have proved of such importance
in modern criticism, the one adding a most important proof of the
statical elements of history, and exemplifying the influences of all
physical surroundings on the life of man; the other, as in the single
instance of the Moulin Quignon skull, serving to create a whole new
science of prehistoric arch?ology and to bring us back to a time when man
was coeval with the stone age, the mammoth and the woolly rhinoceros., But, except these, we have added no new canon or method to the science of
historical criticism., Across the drear waste of a thousand years the
Greek and the modern spirit join hands., In the torch race which the Greek boys ran from the Cerameician field of
death to the home of the goddess of Wisdom, not merely he who first
reached the goal but he also who first started with the torch aflame
received a prize., In the Lampadephoria of civilisation and free thought
let us not forget to render due meed of honour to those who first lit
that sacred flame, the increasing splendour of which lights our footsteps
to the far-off divine event of the attainment of perfect truth., THE ENGLISH RENAISSANCE OF ART


?The English Renaissance of Art?, was delivered as a lecture for the first
time in the Chickering Hall, New York, on January 9, 1882., A portion of
it was reported in the _New York Tribune_ on the following day and in
other American papers subsequently., Since then this portion has been
reprinted, more or less accurately, from time to time, in unauthorised
editions., There are in existence no less than four copies of the lecture, the
earliest of which is entirely in the author?s handwriting., The others
are type-written and contain many corrections and additions made by the
author in manuscript., These have all been collated and the text here
given contains, as nearly as possible, the lecture in the original form
as delivered by the author during his tour in the United States., AMONG the many debts which we owe to the supreme ?sthetic faculty of
Goethe is that he was the first to teach us to define beauty in terms the
most concrete possible, to realise it, I mean, always in its special
manifestations., So, in the lecture which I have the honour to deliver
before you, I will not try to give you any abstract definition of
beauty?any such universal formula for it as was sought for by the
philosophy of the eighteenth century?still less to communicate to you
that which in its essence is incommunicable, the virtue by which a
particular picture or poem affects us with a unique and special joy; but
rather to point out to you the general ideas which characterise the great
English Renaissance of Art in this century, to discover their source, as
far as that is possible, and to estimate their future as far as that is
possible., I call it our English Renaissance because it is indeed a sort of new
birth of the spirit of man, like the great Italian Renaissance of the
fifteenth century, in its desire for a more gracious and comely way of
life, its passion for physical beauty, its exclusive attention to form,
its seeking for new subjects for poetry, new forms of art, new
intellectual and imaginative enjoyments: and I call it our romantic
movement because it is our most recent expression of beauty., It has been described as a mere revival of Greek modes of thought, and
again as a mere revival of medi?val feeling., Rather I would say that to
these forms of the human spirit it has added whatever of artistic value
the intricacy and complexity and experience of modern life can give:
taking from the one its clearness of vision and its sustained calm, from
the other its variety of expression and the mystery of its vision., For
what, as Goethe said, is the study of the ancients but a return to the
real world (for that is what they did); and what, said Mazzini, is
medi?valism but individuality?, It is really from the union of Hellenism, in its breadth, its sanity of
purpose, its calm possession of beauty, with the adventive, the
intensified individualism, the passionate colour of the romantic spirit,
that springs the art of the nineteenth century in England, as from the
marriage of Faust and Helen of Troy sprang the beautiful boy Euphorion., Such expressions as ?classical?, and ?romantic?, are, it is true, often apt
to become the mere catchwords of schools., We must always remember that
art has only one sentence to utter: there is for her only one high law,
the law of form or harmony?yet between the classical and romantic spirit
we may say that there lies this difference at least, that the one deals
with the type and the other with the exception., In the work produced
under the modern romantic spirit it is no longer the permanent, the
essential truths of life that are treated of; it is the momentary
situation of the one, the momentary aspect of the other that art seeks to
render., In sculpture, which is the type of one spirit, the subject
predominates over the situation; in painting, which is the type of the
other, the situation predominates over the subject., There are two spirits, then: the Hellenic spirit and the spirit of
romance may be taken as forming the essential elements of our conscious
intellectual tradition, of our permanent standard of taste., As regards
their origin, in art as in politics there is but one origin for all
revolutions, a desire on the part of man for a nobler form of life, for a
freer method and opportunity of expression., Yet, I think that in
estimating the sensuous and intellectual spirit which presides over our
English Renaissance, any attempt to isolate it in any way from in the
progress and movement and social life of the age that has produced it
would be to rob it of its true vitality, possibly to mistake its true
meaning., And in disengaging from the pursuits and passions of this
crowded modern world those passions and pursuits which have to do with
art and the love of art, we must take into account many great events of
history which seem to be the most opposed to any such artistic feeling., Alien then from any wild, political passion, or from the harsh voice of a
rude people in revolt, as our English Renaissance must seem, in its
passionate cult of pure beauty, its flawless devotion to form, its
exclusive and sensitive nature, it is to the French Revolution that we
must look for the most primary factor of its production, the first
condition of its birth: that great Revolution of which we are all the
children though the voices of some of us be often loud against it; that
Revolution to which at a time when even such spirits as Coleridge and
Wordsworth lost heart in England, noble messages of love blown across
seas came from your young Republic., It is true that our modern sense of the continuity of history has shown
us that neither in politics nor in nature are there revolutions ever but
evolutions only, and that the prelude to that wild storm which swept over
France in 1789 and made every king in Europe tremble for his throne, was
first sounded in literature years before the Bastille fell and the Palace
was taken., The way for those red scenes by Seine and Loire was paved by
that critical spirit of Germany and England which accustomed men to bring
all things to the test of reason or utility or both, while the discontent
of the people in the streets of Paris was the echo that followed the life
of Emile and of Werther., For Rousseau, by silent lake and mountain, had
called humanity back to the golden age that still lies before us and
preached a return to nature, in passionate eloquence whose music still
lingers about our keen northern air., And Goethe and Scott had brought
romance back again from the prison she had lain in for so many
centuries?and what is romance but humanity?, Yet in the womb of the Revolution itself, and in the storm and terror of
that wild time, tendencies were hidden away that the artistic Renaissance
bent to her own service when the time came?a scientific tendency first,
which has borne in our own day a brood of somewhat noisy Titans, yet in
the sphere of poetry has not been unproductive of good., I do not mean
merely in its adding to enthusiasm that intellectual basis which in its
strength, or that more obvious influence about which Wordsworth was
thinking when he said very nobly that poetry was merely the impassioned
expression in the face of science, and that when science would put on a
form of flesh and blood the poet would lend his divine spirit to aid the
transfiguration., Nor do I dwell much on the great cosmical emotion and
deep pantheism of science to which Shelley has given its first and
Swinburne its latest glory of song, but rather on its influence on the
artistic spirit in preserving that close observation and the sense of
limitation as well as of clearness of vision which are the
characteristics of the real artist., The great and golden rule of art as well as of life, wrote William Blake,
is that the more distinct, sharp and defined the boundary line, the more
perfect is the work of art; and the less keen and sharp the greater is
the evidence of weak imitation, plagiarism and bungling., ?Great
inventors in all ages knew this?Michael Angelo and Albert Durer are known
by this and by this alone?, ; and another time he wrote, with all the
simple directness of nineteenth-century prose, ?to generalise is to be an
idiot.?, And this love of definite conception, this clearness of vision, this
artistic sense of limit, is the characteristic of all great work and
poetry; of the vision of Homer as of the vision of Dante, of Keats and
William Morris as of Chaucer and Theocritus., It lies at the base of all
noble, realistic and romantic work as opposed to the colourless and empty
abstractions of our own eighteenth-century poets and of the classical
dramatists of France, or of the vague spiritualities of the German
sentimental school: opposed, too, to that spirit of transcendentalism
which also was root and flower itself of the great Revolution, underlying
the impassioned contemplation of Wordsworth and giving wings and fire to
the eagle-like flight of Shelley, and which in the sphere of philosophy,
though displaced by the materialism and positiveness of our day,
bequeathed two great schools of thought, the school of Newman to Oxford,
the school of Emerson to America., Yet is this spirit of
transcendentalism alien to the spirit of art., For the artist can accept
no sphere of life in exchange for life itself., For him there is no
escape from the bondage of the earth: there is not even the desire of
escape., He is indeed the only true realist: symbolism, which is the essence of
the transcendental spirit, is alien to him., The metaphysical mind of
Asia will create for itself the monstrous, many-breasted idol of Ephesus,
but to the Greek, pure artist, that work is most instinct with spiritual
life which conforms most clearly to the perfect facts of physical life., ?The storm of revolution,?, as Andre Chenier said, ?blows out the torch of
poetry.?, It is not for some little time that the real influence of such
a wild cataclysm of things is felt: at first the desire for equality
seems to have produced personalities of more giant and Titan stature than
the world had ever known before., Men heard the lyre of Byron and the
legions of Napoleon; it was a period of measureless passions and of
measureless despair; ambition, discontent, were the chords of life and
art; the age was an age of revolt: a phase through which the human spirit
must pass, but one in which it cannot rest., For the aim of culture is
not rebellion but peace, the valley perilous where ignorant armies clash
by night being no dwelling-place meet for her to whom the gods have
assigned the fresh uplands and sunny heights and clear, untroubled air., And soon that desire for perfection, which lay at the base of the
Revolution, found in a young English poet its most complete and flawless
realisation., ...]",2
143,"[But indeed, in looking through the history of costume, seeking
an answer to the questions we have propounded, there is little that is
either beautiful or appropriate., One of the earliest forms is the Greek
drapery which is exquisite for young girls., And then, I think we may be
pardoned a little enthusiasm over the dress of the time of Charles I., so
beautiful indeed, that in spite of its invention being with the Cavaliers
it was copied by the Puritans., And the dress for the children of that
time must not be passed over., It was a very golden age of the little
ones., I do not think that they have ever looked so lovely as they do in
the pictures of that time., The dress of the last century in England is
also peculiarly gracious and graceful., There is nothing bizarre or
strange about it, but it is full of harmony and beauty., In these days,
when we have suffered dreadfully from the incursions of the modern
milliner, we hear ladies boast that they do not wear a dress more than
once., In the old days, when the dresses were decorated with beautiful
designs and worked with exquisite embroidery, ladies rather took a pride
in bringing out the garment and wearing it many times and handing it down
to their daughters?a process that would, I think, be quite appreciated by
a modern husband when called upon to settle his wife?s bills., And how shall men dress?, Men say that they do not particularly care how
they dress, and that it is little matter., I am bound to reply that I do
not think that you do., In all my journeys through the country, the only
well-dressed men that I saw?and in saying this I earnestly deprecate the
polished indignation of your Fifth Avenue dandies?were the Western
miners., Their wide-brimmed hats, which shaded their faces from the sun
and protected them from the rain, and the cloak, which is by far the most
beautiful piece of drapery ever invented, may well be dwelt on with
admiration., Their high boots, too, were sensible and practical., They
wore only what was comfortable, and therefore beautiful., As I looked at
them I could not help thinking with regret of the time when these
picturesque miners would have made their fortunes and would go East to
assume again all the abominations of modern fashionable attire., Indeed,
so concerned was I that I made some of them promise that when they again
appeared in the more crowded scenes of Eastern civilisation they would
still continue to wear their lovely costume., But I do not believe they
will., Now, what America wants to-day is a school of rational art., Bad art is a
great deal worse than no art at all., You must show your workmen
specimens of good work so that they come to know what is simple and true
and beautiful., To that end I would have you have a museum attached to
these schools?not one of those dreadful modern institutions where there
is a stuffed and very dusty giraffe, and a case or two of fossils, but a
place where there are gathered examples of art decoration from various
periods and countries., Such a place is the South Kensington Museum in
London, whereon we build greater hopes for the future than on any other
one thing., There I go every Saturday night, when the museum is open
later than usual, to see the handicraftsman, the wood-worker, the
glass-blower and the worker in metals., And it is here that the man of
refinement and culture comes face to face with the workman who ministers
to his joy., He comes to know more of the nobility of the workman, and
the workman, feeling the appreciation, comes to know more of the nobility
of his work., You have too many white walls., More colour is wanted., You should have
such men as Whistler among you to teach you the beauty and joy of colour., Take Mr. Whistler?s ?Symphony in White,?, which you no doubt have imagined
to be something quite bizarre., It is nothing of the sort., Think of a
cool grey sky flecked here and there with white clouds, a grey ocean and
three wonderfully beautiful figures robed in white, leaning over the
water and dropping white flowers from their fingers., Here is no
extensive intellectual scheme to trouble you, and no metaphysics of which
we have had quite enough in art., But if the simple and unaided colour
strike the right key-note, the whole conception is made clear., I regard
Mr. Whistler?s famous Peacock Room as the finest thing in colour and art
decoration which the world has known since Correggio painted that
wonderful room in Italy where the little children are dancing on the
walls., Mr. Whistler finished another room just before I came away?a
breakfast room in blue and yellow., The ceiling was a light blue, the
cabinet-work and the furniture were of a yellow wood, the curtains at the
windows were white and worked in yellow, and when the table was set for
breakfast with dainty blue china nothing can be conceived at once so
simple and so joyous., The fault which I have observed in most of your rooms is that there is
apparent no definite scheme of colour., Everything is not attuned to a
key-note as it should be., The apartments are crowded with pretty things
which have no relation to one another., Again, your artists must decorate
what is more simply useful., In your art schools I found no attempt to
decorate such things as the vessels for water., I know of nothing uglier
than the ordinary jug or pitcher., A museum could be filled with the
different kinds of water vessels which are used in hot countries., Yet we
continue to submit to the depressing jug with the handle all on one side., I do not see the wisdom of decorating dinner-plates with sunsets and
soup-plates with moonlight scenes., I do not think it adds anything to
the pleasure of the canvas-back duck to take it out of such glories., Besides, we do not want a soup-plate whose bottom seems to vanish in the
distance., One feels neither safe nor comfortable under such conditions., In fact, I did not find in the art schools of the country that the
difference was explained between decorative and imaginative art., The conditions of art should be simple., A great deal more depends upon
the heart than upon the head., Appreciation of art is not secured by any
elaborate scheme of learning., Art requires a good healthy atmosphere., The motives for art are still around about us as they were round about
the ancients., And the subjects are also easily found by the earnest
sculptor and the painter., Nothing is more picturesque and graceful than
a man at work., The artist who goes to the children?s playground, watches
them at their sport and sees the boy stoop to tie his shoe, will find the
same themes that engaged the attention of the ancient Greeks, and such
observation and the illustrations which follow will do much to correct
that foolish impression that mental and physical beauty are always
divorced., To you, more than perhaps to any other country, has Nature been generous
in furnishing material for art workers to work in., You have marble
quarries where the stone is more beautiful in colour than any the Greeks
ever had for their beautiful work, and yet day after day I am confronted
with the great building of some stupid man who has used the beautiful
material as if it were not precious almost beyond speech., Marble should
not be used save by noble workmen., There is nothing which gave me a
greater sense of barrenness in travelling through the country than the
entire absence of wood carving on your houses., Wood carving is the
simplest of the decorative arts., In Switzerland the little barefooted
boy beautifies the porch of his father?s house with examples of skill in
this direction., Why should not American boys do a great deal more and
better than Swiss boys?, There is nothing to my mind more coarse in conception and more vulgar in
execution than modern jewellery., This is something that can easily be
corrected., Something better should be made out of the beautiful gold
which is stored up in your mountain hollows and strewn along your river
beds., When I was at Leadville and reflected that all the shining silver
that I saw coming from the mines would be made into ugly dollars, it made
me sad., It should be made into something more permanent., The golden
gates at Florence are as beautiful to-day as when Michael Angelo saw
them., We should see more of the workman than we do., We should not be content
to have the salesman stand between us?the salesman who knows nothing of
what he is selling save that he is charging a great deal too much for it., And watching the workman will teach that most important lesson?the
nobility of all rational workmanship., I said in my last lecture that art would create a new brotherhood among
men by furnishing a universal language., I said that under its beneficent
influences war might pass away., Thinking this, what place can I ascribe
to art in our education?, If children grow up among all fair and lovely
things, they will grow to love beauty and detest ugliness before they
know the reason why., If you go into a house where everything is coarse,
you find things chipped and broken and unsightly., Nobody exercises any
care., If everything is dainty and delicate, gentleness and refinement of
manner are unconsciously acquired., When I was in San Francisco I used to
visit the Chinese Quarter frequently., There I used to watch a great
hulking Chinese workman at his task of digging, and used to see him every
day drink his tea from a little cup as delicate in texture as the petal
of a flower, whereas in all the grand hotels of the land, where thousands
of dollars have been lavished on great gilt mirrors and gaudy columns, I
have been given my coffee or my chocolate in cups an inch and a quarter
thick., I think I have deserved something nicer., The art systems of the past have been devised by philosophers who looked
upon human beings as obstructions., They have tried to educate boys?, minds before they had any., How much better it would be in these early
years to teach children to use their hands in the rational service of
mankind., I would have a workshop attached to every school, and one hour
a day given up to the teaching of simple decorative arts., It would be a
golden hour to the children., And you would soon raise up a race of
handicraftsmen who would transform the face of your country., I have seen
only one such school in the United States, and this was in Philadelphia
and was founded by my friend Mr. Leyland., I stopped there yesterday and
have brought some of the work here this afternoon to show you., Here are
two disks of beaten brass: the designs on them are beautiful, the
workmanship is simple, and the entire result is satisfactory., The work
was done by a little boy twelve years old., This is a wooden bowl
decorated by a little girl of thirteen., The design is lovely and the
colouring delicate and pretty., ...]",2

But, you will say, modern dress, that is bad., If you cannot paint black
cloth you could not have painted silken doublet., Ugly dress is better
for art?facts of vision, not of the object., What is a picture?, Primarily, a picture is a beautifully coloured
surface, merely, with no more spiritual message or meaning for you than
an exquisite fragment of Venetian glass or a blue tile from the wall of
Damascus., It is, primarily, a purely decorative thing, a delight to look
at., All arch?ological pictures that make you say ?How curious!?, all
sentimental pictures that make you say, ?How sad!?, all historical
pictures that make you say ?How interesting!?, all pictures that do not
immediately give you such artistic joy as to make you say ?How
beautiful!?, are bad pictures., * * * * *

We never know what an artist is going to do., Of course not., The artist
is not a specialist., All such divisions as animal painters, landscape
painters, painters of Scotch cattle in an English mist, painters of
English cattle in a Scotch mist, racehorse painters, bull-terrier
painters, all are shallow., If a man is an artist he can paint
everything., The object of art is to stir the most divine and remote of the chords
which make music in our soul; and colour is indeed, of itself a mystical
presence on things, and tone a kind of sentinel., Am I pleading, then, for mere technique?, No., As long as there are any
signs of technique at all, the picture is unfinished., What is finish?, A
picture is finished when all traces of work, and of the means employed to
bring about the result, have disappeared., In the case of handicraftsmen?the weaver, the potter, the smith?on their
work are the traces of their hand., But it is not so with the painter; it
is not so with the artist., Art should have no sentiment about it but its beauty, no technique except
what you cannot observe., One should be able to say of a picture not that
it is ?well painted,?, but that it is ?not painted.?, What is the difference between absolutely decorative art and a painting?, Decorative art emphasises its material: imaginative art annihilates it., Tapestry shows its threads as part of its beauty: a picture annihilates
its canvas: it shows nothing of it., Porcelain emphasises its glaze:
water-colours reject the paper., A picture has no meaning but its beauty, no message but its joy., That is
the first truth about art that you must never lose sight of., A picture
is a purely decorative thing., LONDON MODELS


_English Illustrated Magazine_, January 1889., PROFESSIONAL models are a purely modern invention., To the Greeks, for
instance, they were quite unknown., Mr. Mahaffy, it is true, tells us
that Pericles used to present peacocks to the great ladies of Athenian
society in order to induce them to sit to his friend Phidias, and we know
that Polygnotus introduced into his picture of the Trojan women the face
of Elpinice, the celebrated sister of the great Conservative leader of
the day, but these _grandes dames_ clearly do not come under our
category., As for the old masters, they undoubtedly made constant studies
from their pupils and apprentices, and even their religious pictures are
full of the portraits of their friends and relations, but they do not
seem to have had the inestimable advantage of the existence of a class of
people whose sole profession is to pose., In fact the model, in our sense
of the word, is the direct creation of Academic Schools., Every country now has its own models, except America., In New York, and
even in Boston, a good model is so great a rarity that most of the
artists are reduced to painting Niagara and millionaires., In Europe,
however, it is different., Here we have plenty of models, and of every
nationality., The Italian models are the best., The natural grace of
their attitudes, as well as the wonderful picturesqueness of their
colouring, makes them facile?often too facile?subjects for the painter?s
brush., The French models, though not so beautiful as the Italian,
possess a quickness of intellectual sympathy, a capacity, in fact, of
understanding the artist, which is quite remarkable., They have also a
great command over the varieties of facial expression, are peculiarly
dramatic, and can chatter the _argot_ of the _atelier_ as cleverly as the
critic of the _Gil Blas_., The English models form a class entirely by
themselves., They are not so picturesque as the Italian, nor so clever as
the French, and they have absolutely no tradition, so to speak, of their
order., Now and then some old veteran knocks at the studio door, and
proposes to sit as Ajax defying the lightning, or as King Lear upon the
blasted heath., One of them some time ago called on a popular painter
who, happening at the moment to require his services, engaged him, and
told him to begin by kneeling down in the attitude of prayer., ?Shall I
be Biblical or Shakespearean, sir??, asked the veteran., ?Well?Shakespearean,?, answered the artist, wondering by what subtle
_nuance_ of expression the model would convey the difference., ?All
right, sir,?, said the professor of posing, and he solemnly knelt down and
began to wink with his left eye!, This class, however, is dying out., As
a rule the model, nowadays, is a pretty girl, from about twelve to
twenty-five years of age, who knows nothing about art, cares less, and is
merely anxious to earn seven or eight shillings a day without much
trouble., English models rarely look at a picture, and never venture on
any ?sthetic theories., In fact, they realise very completely Mr.
Whistler?s idea of the function of an art critic, for they pass no
criticisms at all., They accept all schools of art with the grand
catholicity of the auctioneer, and sit to a fantastic young impressionist
as readily as to a learned and laborious academician., They are neither
for the Whistlerites nor against them; the quarrel between the school of
facts and the school of effects touches them not; idealistic and
naturalistic are words that convey no meaning to their ears; they merely
desire that the studio shall be warm, and the lunch hot, for all charming
artists give their models lunch., As to what they are asked to do they are equally indifferent., On Monday
they will don the rags of a beggar-girl for Mr. Pumper, whose pathetic
pictures of modern life draw such tears from the public, and on Tuesday
they will pose in a peplum for Mr. Phoebus, who thinks that all really
artistic subjects are necessarily B.C., They career gaily through all
centuries and through all costumes, and, like actors, are interesting
only when they are not themselves., They are extremely good-natured, and
very accommodating., ?What do you sit for??, said a young artist to a
model who had sent him in her card (all models, by the way, have cards
and a small black bag)., ?Oh, for anything you like, sir,?, said the girl,
?landscape if necessary!?, Intellectually, it must be acknowledged, they are Philistines, but
physically they are perfect?at least some are., Though none of them can
talk Greek, many can look Greek, which to a nineteenth-century painter is
naturally of great importance., If they are allowed, they chatter a great
deal, but they never say anything., Their observations are the only
_banalit?s_ heard in Bohemia., However, though they cannot appreciate the
artist as artist, they are quite ready to appreciate the artist as a man., They are very sensitive to kindness, respect and generosity., A beautiful
model who had sat for two years to one of our most distinguished English
painters, got engaged to a street vendor of penny ices., On her marriage the painter sent her a pretty wedding present, and
received in return a nice letter of thanks with the following remarkable
postscript: ?Never eat the green ices!?, When they are tired a wise artist gives them a rest., Then they sit in a
chair and read penny dreadfuls, till they are roused from the tragedy of
literature to take their place again in the tragedy of art., A few of
them smoke cigarettes., This, however, is regarded by the other models as
showing a want of seriousness, and is not generally approved of., They
are engaged by the day and by the half-day., The tariff is a shilling an
hour, to which great artists usually add an omnibus fare., The two best
things about them are their extraordinary prettiness, and their extreme
respectability., As a class they are very well behaved, particularly
those who sit for the figure, a fact which is curious or natural
according to the view one takes of human nature., They usually marry
well, and sometimes they marry the artist., For an artist to marry his
model is as fatal as for a _gourmet_ to marry his cook: the one gets no
sittings, and the other gets no dinners., On the whole the English female models are very na?ve, very natural, and
very good-humoured., The virtues which the artist values most in them are
prettiness and punctuality., Every sensible model consequently keeps a
diary of her engagements, and dresses neatly., The bad season is, of
course, the summer, when the artists are out of town., However, of late
years some artists have engaged their models to follow them, and the wife
of one of our most charming painters has often had three or four models
under her charge in the country, so that the work of her husband and his
friends should not be interrupted., In France the models migrate _en
masse_ to the little seaport villages or forest hamlets where the
painters congregate., The English models, however, wait patiently in
London, as a rule, till the artists come back., Nearly all of them live
with their parents, and help to support the house., They have every
qualification for being immortalised in art except that of beautiful
hands., The hands of the English model are nearly always coarse and red., ...]",2

their political dealings: and in politics the man who is personally
honourable and refined will not scruple to do anything for his party., {86}  Polybius, xii., 25., {124}  As an instance of the inaccuracy of published reports of this
lecture, it may be mentioned that all unauthorised versions give this

Prince., He was gilded all over with thin leaves of fine gold, for eyes
he had two bright sapphires, and a large red ruby glowed on his
sword-hilt., He was very much admired indeed., ?He is as beautiful as a weathercock,?, remarked one of the Town Councillors who wished to gain a reputation for
having artistic tastes; ?only not quite so useful,?, he added, fearing
lest people should think him unpractical, which he really was not., ?Why can?t you be like the Happy Prince??, asked a sensible mother of her
little boy who was crying for the moon., ?The Happy Prince never dreams
of crying for anything.?, ?I am glad there is some one in the world who is quite happy,?, muttered a
disappointed man as he gazed at the wonderful statue., ?He looks just like an angel,?, said the Charity Children as they came out
of the cathedral in their bright scarlet cloaks and their clean white
pinafores., ?How do you know??, said the Mathematical Master, ?you have never seen
one.?, ?Ah!, but we have, in our dreams,?, answered the children; and the
Mathematical Master frowned and looked very severe, for he did not
approve of children dreaming., One night there flew over the city a little Swallow., His friends had
gone away to Egypt six weeks before, but he had stayed behind, for he was
in love with the most beautiful Reed., He had met her early in the spring
as he was flying down the river after a big yellow moth, and had been so
attracted by her slender waist that he had stopped to talk to her., ?Shall I love you??, said the Swallow, who liked to come to the point at
once, and the Reed made him a low bow., So he flew round and round her,
touching the water with his wings, and making silver ripples., ...]",2
146,"[?Here indeed is the true lover,?, said the Nightingale., ?What I sing of,
he suffers?what is joy to me, to him is pain., Surely Love is a wonderful
thing., It is more precious than emeralds, and dearer than fine opals., Pearls and pomegranates cannot buy it, nor is it set forth in the
marketplace., It may not be purchased of the merchants, nor can it be
weighed out in the balance for gold.?, ?The musicians will sit in their gallery,?, said the young Student, ?and
play upon their stringed instruments, and my love will dance to the sound
of the harp and the violin., She will dance so lightly that her feet will
not touch the floor, and the courtiers in their gay dresses will throng
round her., But with me she will not dance, for I have no red rose to
give her?, ; and he flung himself down on the grass, and buried his face in
his hands, and wept., ?Why is he weeping??, asked a little Green Lizard, as he ran past him with
his tail in the air., ?Why, indeed??, said a Butterfly, who was fluttering about after a
sunbeam., ?Why, indeed??, whispered a Daisy to his neighbour, in a soft, low voice., ?He is weeping for a red rose,?, said the Nightingale., ?For a red rose??, they cried; ?how very ridiculous!?, and the little
Lizard, who was something of a cynic, laughed outright., But the Nightingale understood the secret of the Student?s sorrow, and
she sat silent in the oak-tree, and thought about the mystery of Love., Suddenly she spread her brown wings for flight, and soared into the air., She passed through the grove like a shadow, and like a shadow she sailed
across the garden., In the centre of the grass-plot was standing a beautiful Rose-tree, and
when she saw it she flew over to it, and lit upon a spray., ?Give me a red rose,?, she cried, ?and I will sing you my sweetest song.?, But the Tree shook its head., ?My roses are white,?, it answered; ?as white as the foam of the sea, and
whiter than the snow upon the mountain., But go to my brother who grows
round the old sun-dial, and perhaps he will give you what you want.?, So the Nightingale flew over to the Rose-tree that was growing round the
old sun-dial., ?Give me a red rose,?, she cried, ?and I will sing you my sweetest song.?, But the Tree shook its head., ?My roses are yellow,?, it answered; ?as yellow as the hair of the
mermaiden who sits upon an amber throne, and yellower than the daffodil
that blooms in the meadow before the mower comes with his scythe., But go
to my brother who grows beneath the Student?s window, and perhaps he will
give you what you want.?, So the Nightingale flew over to the Rose-tree that was growing beneath
the Student?s window., ?Give me a red rose,?, she cried, ?and I will sing you my sweetest song.?, But the Tree shook its head., ?My roses are red,?, it answered, ?as red as the feet of the dove, and
redder than the great fans of coral that wave and wave in the
ocean-cavern., But the winter has chilled my veins, and the frost has
nipped my buds, and the storm has broken my branches, and I shall have no
roses at all this year.?, ?One red rose is all I want,?, cried the Nightingale, ?only one red rose!, Is there no way by which I can get it??, ?There is a way,?, answered the Tree; ?but it is so terrible that I dare
not tell it to you.?, ?Tell it to me,?, said the Nightingale, ?I am not afraid.?, ?If you want a red rose,?, said the Tree, ?you must build it out of music
by moonlight, and stain it with your own heart?s-blood., You must sing to
me with your breast against a thorn., All night long you must sing to me,
and the thorn must pierce your heart, and your life-blood must flow into
my veins, and become mine.?, ?Death is a great price to pay for a red rose,?, cried the Nightingale,
?and Life is very dear to all., It is pleasant to sit in the green wood,
and to watch the Sun in his chariot of gold, and the Moon in her chariot
of pearl., Sweet is the scent of the hawthorn, and sweet are the
bluebells that hide in the valley, and the heather that blows on the
hill., Yet Love is better than Life, and what is the heart of a bird
compared to the heart of a man??, So she spread her brown wings for flight, and soared into the air., She
swept over the garden like a shadow, and like a shadow she sailed through
the grove., The young Student was still lying on the grass, where she had left him,
and the tears were not yet dry in his beautiful eyes., ?Be happy,?, cried the Nightingale, ?be happy; you shall have your red
rose., I will build it out of music by moonlight, and stain it with my
own heart?s-blood., All that I ask of you in return is that you will be a
true lover, for Love is wiser than Philosophy, though she is wise, and
mightier than Power, though he is mighty., Flame-coloured are his wings,
and coloured like flame is his body., His lips are sweet as honey, and
his breath is like frankincense.?, The Student looked up from the grass, and listened, but he could not
understand what the Nightingale was saying to him, for he only knew the
things that are written down in books., But the Oak-tree understood, and felt sad, for he was very fond of the
little Nightingale who had built her nest in his branches., ?Sing me one last song,?, he whispered; ?I shall feel very lonely when you
are gone.?, So the Nightingale sang to the Oak-tree, and her voice was like water
bubbling from a silver jar., When she had finished her song the Student got up, and pulled a note-book
and a lead-pencil out of his pocket., ?She has form,?, he said to himself, as he walked away through the
grove?, ?that cannot be denied to her; but has she got feeling?, I am
afraid not., In fact, she is like most artists; she is all style, without
any sincerity., She would not sacrifice herself for others., She thinks
merely of music, and everybody knows that the arts are selfish., Still,
it must be admitted that she has some beautiful notes in her voice., What
a pity it is that they do not mean anything, or do any practical good.?, And he went into his room, and lay down on his little pallet-bed, and
began to think of his love; and, after a time, he fell asleep., And when the Moon shone in the heavens the Nightingale flew to the
Rose-tree, and set her breast against the thorn., All night long she sang
with her breast against the thorn, and the cold crystal Moon leaned down
and listened., All night long she sang, and the thorn went deeper and
deeper into her breast, and her life-blood ebbed away from her., She sang first of the birth of love in the heart of a boy and a girl., And on the top-most spray of the Rose-tree there blossomed a marvellous
rose, petal following petal, as song followed song., Pale was it, at
first, as the mist that hangs over the river?pale as the feet of the
morning, and silver as the wings of the dawn., As the shadow of a rose in
a mirror of silver, as the shadow of a rose in a water-pool, so was the
rose that blossomed on the topmost spray of the Tree., But the Tree cried to the Nightingale to press closer against the thorn., ?Press closer, little Nightingale,?, cried the Tree, ?or the Day will come
before the rose is finished.?, So the Nightingale pressed closer against the thorn, and louder and
louder grew her song, for she sang of the birth of passion in the soul of
a man and a maid., And a delicate flush of pink came into the leaves of the rose, like the
flush in the face of the bridegroom when he kisses the lips of the bride., ...]",2
147,"[said the Miller, ?and
wondered how you were getting on.?, ?, ?That was kind of you,?, said Hans; ?I was half afraid you had forgotten
me.?, ?, ?Hans, I am surprised at you,?, said the Miller; ?friendship never
forgets., That is the wonderful thing about it, but I am afraid you don?t
understand the poetry of life., How lovely your primroses are looking,
by-the-bye!?, ?, ?They are certainly very lovely,?, said Hans, ?and it is a most lucky
thing for me that I have so many., I am going to bring them into the
market and sell them to the Burgomaster?s daughter, and buy back my
wheelbarrow with the money.?, ?, ?Buy back your wheelbarrow?, You don?t mean to say you have sold it?, What a very stupid thing to do!?, ?, ?Well, the fact is,?, said Hans, ?that I was obliged to., You see the
winter was a very bad time for me, and I really had no money at all to
buy bread with., So I first sold the silver buttons off my Sunday coat,
and then I sold my silver chain, and then I sold my big pipe, and at last
I sold my wheelbarrow., But I am going to buy them all back again now.?, ??Hans,?, said the Miller, ?I will give you my wheelbarrow., It is not in
very good repair; indeed, one side is gone, and there is something wrong
with the wheel-spokes; but in spite of that I will give it to you., I
know it is very generous of me, and a great many people would think me
extremely foolish for parting with it, but I am not like the rest of the
world., I think that generosity is the essence of friendship, and,
besides, I have got a new wheelbarrow for myself., Yes, you may set your
mind at ease, I will give you my wheelbarrow.?, ?, ?Well, really, that is generous of you,?, said little Hans, and his funny
round face glowed all over with pleasure., ?I can easily put it in
repair, as I have a plank of wood in the house.?, ?, ?A plank of wood!?, said the Miller; ?why, that is just what I want for
the roof of my barn., There is a very large hole in it, and the corn will
all get damp if I don?t stop it up., How lucky you mentioned it!, It is
quite remarkable how one good action always breeds another., I have given
you my wheelbarrow, and now you are going to give me your plank., Of
course, the wheelbarrow is worth far more than the plank, but true,
friendship never notices things like that., Pray get it at once, and I
will set to work at my barn this very day.?, ??Certainly,?, cried little Hans, and he ran into the shed and dragged the
plank out., ?, ?It is not a very big plank,?, said the Miller, looking at it, ?and I am
afraid that after I have mended my barn-roof there won?t be any left for
you to mend the wheelbarrow with; but, of course, that is not my fault., And now, as I have given you my wheelbarrow, I am sure you would like to
give me some flowers in return., Here is the basket, and mind you fill it
quite full.?, ?, ?Quite full??, said little Hans, rather sorrowfully, for it was really a
very big basket, and he knew that if he filled it he would have no
flowers left for the market and he was very anxious to get his silver
buttons back., ?, ?Well, really,?, answered the Miller, ?as I have given you my
wheelbarrow, I don?t think that it is much to ask you for a few flowers., I may be wrong, but I should have thought that friendship, true
friendship, was quite free from selfishness of any kind.?, ?, ?My dear friend, my best friend,?, cried little Hans, ?you are welcome to
all the flowers in my garden., I would much sooner have your good opinion
than my silver buttons, any day?, ; and he ran and plucked all his pretty
primroses, and filled the Miller?s basket., ?, ?Good-bye, little Hans,?, said the Miller, as he went up the hill with
the plank on his shoulder, and the big basket in his hand., ??Good-bye,?, said little Hans, and he began to dig away quite merrily, he
was so pleased about the wheelbarrow., ?The next day he was nailing up some honeysuckle against the porch, when
he heard the Miller?s voice calling to him from the road., So he jumped
off the ladder, and ran down the garden, and looked over the wall., ?There was the Miller with a large sack of flour on his back., ?, ?Dear little Hans,?, said the Miller, ?would you mind carrying this sack
of flour for me to market??, ?, ?Oh, I am so sorry,?, said Hans, ?but I am really very busy to-day., I
have got all my creepers to nail up, and all my flowers to water, and all
my grass to roll.?, ?, ?Well, really,?, said the Miller, ?I think that, considering that I am
going to give you my wheelbarrow, it is rather unfriendly of you to
refuse.?, ?, ?Oh, don?t say that,?, cried little Hans, ?I wouldn?t be unfriendly for
the whole world?, ; and he ran in for his cap, and trudged off with the big
sack on his shoulders., ?It was a very hot day, and the road was terribly dusty, and before Hans
had reached the sixth milestone he was so tired that he had to sit down
and rest., However, he went on bravely, and as last he reached the
market., After he had waited there some time, he sold the sack of flour
for a very good price, and then he returned home at once, for he was
afraid that if he stopped too late he might meet some robbers on the way., ?, ?It has certainly been a hard day,?, said little Hans to himself as he
was going to bed, ?but I am glad I did not refuse the Miller, for he is
my best friend, and, besides, he is going to give me his wheelbarrow.?, ?Early the next morning the Miller came down to get the money for his
sack of flour, but little Hans was so tired that he was still in bed., ?, ?Upon my word,?, said the Miller, ?you are very lazy., Really,
considering that I am going to give you my wheelbarrow, I think you might
work harder., Idleness is a great sin, and I certainly don?t like any of
my friends to be idle or sluggish., You must not mind my speaking quite
plainly to you., Of course I should not dream of doing so if I were not
your friend., But what is the good of friendship if one cannot say
exactly what one means?, Anybody can say charming things and try to
please and to flatter, but a true friend always says unpleasant things,
and does not mind giving pain., Indeed, if he is a really true friend he
prefers it, for he knows that then he is doing good.?, ...]",2
148,"[exclaimed a small Fire-balloon, ?why not?, It is a most
joyful occasion, and when I soar up into the air I intend to tell the
stars all about it., You will see them twinkle when I talk to them about
the pretty bride.?, ?Ah!, what a trivial view of life!?, said the Rocket; ?but it is only what
I expected., There is nothing in you; you are hollow and empty., Why,
perhaps the Prince and Princess may go to live in a country where there
is a deep river, and perhaps they may have one only son, a little
fair-haired boy with violet eyes like the Prince himself; and perhaps
some day he may go out to walk with his nurse; and perhaps the nurse may
go to sleep under a great elder-tree; and perhaps the little boy may fall
into the deep river and be drowned., What a terrible misfortune!, Poor
people, to lose their only son!, It is really too dreadful!, I shall
never get over it.?, ?But they have not lost their only son,?, said the Roman Candle; ?no
misfortune has happened to them at all.?, ?I never said that they had,?, replied the Rocket; ?I said that they
might., If they had lost their only son there would be no use in saying
anything more about the matter., I hate people who cry over spilt milk., But when I think that they might lose their only son, I certainly am very
much affected.?, ?You certainly are!?, cried the Bengal Light., ?In fact, you are the most
affected person I ever met.?, ?You are the rudest person I ever met,?, said the Rocket, ?and you cannot
understand my friendship for the Prince.?, ?Why, you don?t even know him,?, growled the Roman Candle., ?I never said I knew him,?, answered the Rocket., ?I dare say that if I
knew him I should not be his friend at all., It is a very dangerous thing
to know one?s friends.?, ?You had really better keep yourself dry,?, said the Fire-balloon., ?That
is the important thing.?, ?Very important for you, I have no doubt,?, answered the Rocket, ?but I
shall weep if I choose?, ; and he actually burst into real tears, which
flowed down his stick like rain-drops, and nearly drowned two little
beetles, who were just thinking of setting up house together, and were
looking for a nice dry spot to live in., ?He must have a truly romantic nature,?, said the Catherine Wheel, ?for he
weeps when there is nothing at all to weep about?, ; and she heaved a deep
sigh, and thought about the deal box., But the Roman Candle and the Bengal Light were quite indignant, and kept
saying, ?Humbug!, humbug!?, at the top of their voices., They were
extremely practical, and whenever they objected to anything they called
it humbug., Then the moon rose like a wonderful silver shield; and the stars began to
shine, and a sound of music came from the palace., The Prince and Princess were leading the dance., They danced so
beautifully that the tall white lilies peeped in at the window and
watched them, and the great red poppies nodded their heads and beat time., Then ten o?clock struck, and then eleven, and then twelve, and at the
last stroke of midnight every one came out on the terrace, and the King
sent for the Royal Pyrotechnist., ?Let the fireworks begin,?, said the King; and the Royal Pyrotechnist made
a low bow, and marched down to the end of the garden., He had six
attendants with him, each of whom carried a lighted torch at the end of a
long pole., It was certainly a magnificent display., Whizz!, Whizz!, went the Catherine Wheel, as she spun round and round., Boom!, Boom!, went the Roman Candle., Then the Squibs danced all over the
place, and the Bengal Lights made everything look scarlet., ?Good-bye,?, cried the Fire-balloon, as he soared away, dropping tiny blue sparks., Bang!, Bang!, answered the Crackers, who were enjoying themselves
immensely., Every one was a great success except the Remarkable Rocket., He was so damp with crying that he could not go off at all., The best
thing in him was the gunpowder, and that was so wet with tears that it
was of no use., All his poor relations, to whom he would never speak,
except with a sneer, shot up into the sky like wonderful golden flowers
with blossoms of fire., Huzza!, Huzza!, cried the Court; and the little
Princess laughed with pleasure., ?I suppose they are reserving me for some grand occasion,?, said the
Rocket; ?no doubt that is what it means,?, and he looked more supercilious
than ever., The next day the workmen came to put everything tidy., ?This is evidently
a deputation,?, said the Rocket; ?I will receive them with becoming
dignity?, so he put his nose in the air, and began to frown severely as if
he were thinking about some very important subject., But they took no
notice of him at all till they were just going away., Then one of them
caught sight of him., ?Hallo!?, he cried, ?what a bad rocket!?, and he
threw him over the wall into the ditch., ?BAD Rocket?, BAD Rocket??, he said, as he whirled through the air;
?impossible!, GRAND Rocket, that is what the man said., BAD and GRAND
sound very much the same, indeed they often are the same?, ; and he fell
into the mud., ?It is not comfortable here,?, he remarked, ?but no doubt it is some
fashionable watering-place, and they have sent me away to recruit my
health., My nerves are certainly very much shattered, and I require
rest.?, Then a little Frog, with bright jewelled eyes, and a green mottled coat,
swam up to him., ?A new arrival, I see!?, said the Frog., ?Well, after all there is nothing
like mud., Give me rainy weather and a ditch, and I am quite happy., Do
you think it will be a wet afternoon?, I am sure I hope so, but the sky
is quite blue and cloudless., What a pity!?, ?Ahem!, ...]",2

of that work of art are quite appalling., The police should interfere., At luncheon I saw by the glare in his eye that he was going to propose
again, and I just managed to check him in time by assuring him that I was
a bimetallist., Fortunately I don?t know what bimetallism means., And I
don?t believe anybody else does either., But the observation crushed
Tommy for ten minutes., He looked quite shocked., And then Tommy is so
annoying in the way he proposes., If he proposed at the top of his voice,
I should not mind so much., That might produce some effect on the public., But he does it in a horrid confidential way., When Tommy wants to be
romantic he talks to one just like a doctor., I am very fond of Tommy,
but his methods of proposing are quite out of date., I wish, Gertrude,
you would speak to him, and tell him that once a week is quite often
enough to propose to any one, and that it should always be done in a

before him., MABEL CHILTERN., Oh!, I wouldn?t marry a man with a future before him for
anything under the sun., LADY CHILTERN., Mabel!, MABEL CHILTERN., I know, dear., You married a man with a future, didn?t
you?, But then Robert was a genius, and you have a noble,
self-sacrificing character., You can stand geniuses., I have no character
at all, and Robert is the only genius I could ever bear., As a rule, I
think they are quite impossible., Geniuses talk so much, don?t they?, Such a bad habit!, And they are always thinking about themselves, when I
want them to be thinking about me., I must go round now and rehearse at
Lady Basildon?s., You remember, we are having tableaux, don?t you?, The
Triumph of something, I don?t know what!, I hope it will be triumph of
me., Only triumph I am really interested in at present., [_Kisses_ LADY
CHILTERN _and goes out_; _then comes running back_.], Oh, Gertrude, do
you know who is coming to see you?, That dreadful Mrs. Cheveley, in a
most lovely gown., Did you ask her?, LADY CHILTERN., [_Rising_.], Mrs. Cheveley!, ...]",2

and I don?t think I shall go anywhere afterwards., Robert, of course,
will have to be in the House., But there is nothing interesting on., LADY MARKBY., Dining at home by yourselves?, Is that quite prudent?, Ah,
I forgot, your husband is an exception., Mine is the general rule, and
nothing ages a woman so rapidly as having married the general rule., [_Exit_ LADY MARKBY.], MRS. CHEVELEY., Wonderful woman, Lady Markby, isn?t she?, Talks more and
says less than anybody I ever met., She is made to be a public speaker., Much more so than her husband, though he is a typical Englishman, always
dull and usually violent., LADY CHILTERN., [_Makes no answer_, _but remains standing_., _There is a
pause_., _Then the eyes of the two women meet_., LADY CHILTERN _looks
stern and pale_., MRS. CHEVELEY _seem rather amused_.], Mrs. Cheveley, I
think it is right to tell you quite frankly that, had I known who you
really were, I should not have invited you to my house last night., MRS. CHEVELEY [_With an impertinent smile_.], Really?, LADY CHILTERN., I could not have done so., MRS. CHEVELEY., I see that after all these years you have not changed a
bit, Gertrude., LADY CHILTERN., I never change., MRS. CHEVELEY [_Elevating her eyebrows_.], Then life has taught you
nothing?, LADY CHILTERN., It has taught me that a person who has once been guilty
of a dishonest and dishonourable action may be guilty of it a second
time, and should be shunned., MRS. CHEVELEY., Would you apply that rule to every one?, LADY CHILTERN., Yes, to every one, without exception., MRS. CHEVELEY., Then I am sorry for you, Gertrude, very sorry for you., LADY CHILTERN., You see now, I was sure, that for many reasons any
further acquaintance between us during your stay in London is quite
impossible?, MRS. CHEVELEY [_Leaning back in her chair_.], Do you know, Gertrude, I
don?t mind your talking morality a bit., Morality is simply the attitude
we adopt towards people whom we personally dislike., You dislike me., I
am quite aware of that., And I have always detested you., And yet I have
come here to do you a service., LADY CHILTERN., [_Contemptuously_.], Like the service you wished to
render my husband last night, I suppose., Thank heaven, I saved him from
that., MRS. CHEVELEY., [_Starting to her feet_.], It was you who made him write
that insolent letter to me?, It was you who made him break his promise?, LADY CHILTERN., Yes., MRS. CHEVELEY., Then you must make him keep it., I give you till
to-morrow morning?no more., If by that time your husband does not
solemnly bind himself to help me in this great scheme in which I am
interested?, LADY CHILTERN., This fraudulent speculation?, MRS. CHEVELEY., Call it what you choose., I hold your husband in the
hollow of my hand, and if you are wise you will make him do what I tell
him., LADY CHILTERN., [_Rising and going towards her_.], You are impertinent., What has my husband to do with you?, With a woman like you?, MRS. CHEVELEY [_With a bitter laugh_.], In this world like meets with
like., It is because your husband is himself fraudulent and dishonest
that we pair so well together., Between you and him there are chasms., He
and I are closer than friends., We are enemies linked together., The same
sin binds us., LADY CHILTERN., How dare you class my husband with yourself?, How dare
you threaten him or me?, Leave my house., You are unfit to enter it., [SIR ROBERT CHILTERN _enters from behind_., _He hears his wife?s last
words_, _and sees to whom they are addressed_., _He grows deadly pale_.], MRS. CHEVELEY., Your house!, A house bought with the price of dishonour., A house, everything in which has been paid for by fraud., [_Turns round
and sees_ SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.], Ask him what the origin of his fortune
is!, Get him to tell you how he sold to a stockbroker a Cabinet secret., Learn from him to what you owe your position., LADY CHILTERN., It is not true!, Robert!, It is not true!, MRS. CHEVELEY., ...]",2

heartrending., LORD CAVERSHAM., Well, sir, I suppose I have a right to sneeze when I
choose?, LORD GORING., [_Apologetically_.], Quite so, father., I was merely
expressing sympathy., LORD CAVERSHAM., Oh, damn sympathy., There is a great deal too much of
that sort of thing going on nowadays., LORD GORING., I quite agree with you, father., If there was less sympathy
in the world there would be less trouble in the world., LORD CAVERSHAM., [_Going towards the smoking-room_.], That is a paradox,
sir., I hate paradoxes., LORD GORING., So do I, father., Everybody one meets is a paradox
nowadays., It is a great bore., It makes society so obvious., LORD CAVERSHAM., [_Turning round_, _and looking at his son beneath his
bushy eyebrows_.], Do you always really understand what you say, sir?, LORD GORING., [_After some hesitation_.], Yes, father, if I listen

CYRIL (_coming in through the open window from the terrace_)., My dear
Vivian, don?t coop yourself up all day in the library., It is a perfectly
lovely afternoon., The air is exquisite., There is a mist upon the woods,
like the purple bloom upon a plum., Let us go and lie on the grass and
smoke cigarettes and enjoy Nature., VIVIAN., Enjoy Nature!, I am glad to say that I have entirely lost that
faculty., People tell us that Art makes us love Nature more than we loved
her before; that it reveals her secrets to us; and that after a careful
study of Corot and Constable we see things in her that had escaped our
observation., ...]",2
162,"[Wordsworth went to the lakes,
but he was never a lake poet., He found in stones the sermons he had
already hidden there., He went moralising about the district, but his
good work was produced when he returned, not to Nature but to poetry., Poetry gave him ?Laodamia,?, and the fine sonnets, and the great Ode, such
as it is., Nature gave him ?Martha Ray?, and ?Peter Bell,?, and the address
to Mr. Wilkinson?s spade., CYRIL., I think that view might be questioned., I am rather inclined to
believe in ?the impulse from a vernal wood,?, though of course the
artistic value of such an impulse depends entirely on the kind of
temperament that receives it, so that the return to Nature would come to
mean simply the advance to a great personality., You would agree with
that, I fancy., However, proceed with your article., VIVIAN (_reading_)., ?Art begins with abstract decoration, with purely
imaginative and pleasurable work dealing with what is unreal and
non-existent., This is the first stage., Then Life becomes fascinated
with this new wonder, and asks to be admitted into the charmed circle., Art takes life as part of her rough material, recreates it, and
refashions it in fresh forms, is absolutely indifferent to fact, invents,
imagines, dreams, and keeps between herself and reality the impenetrable
barrier of beautiful style, of decorative or ideal treatment., The third
stage is when Life gets the upper hand, and drives Art out into the
wilderness., That is the true decadence, and it is from this that we are
now suffering., ?Take the case of the English drama., At first in the hands of the monks
Dramatic Art was abstract, decorative and mythological., Then she
enlisted Life in her service, and using some of life?s external forms,
she created an entirely new race of beings, whose sorrows were more
terrible than any sorrow man has ever felt, whose joys were keener than
lover?s joys, who had the rage of the Titans and the calm of the gods,
who had monstrous and marvellous sins, monstrous and marvellous virtues., To them she gave a language different from that of actual use, a language
full of resonant music and sweet rhythm, made stately by solemn cadence,
or made delicate by fanciful rhyme, jewelled with wonderful words, and
enriched with lofty diction., She clothed her children in strange raiment
and gave them masks, and at her bidding the antique world rose from its
marble tomb., A new C?sar stalked through the streets of risen Rome, and
with purple sail and flute-led oars another Cleopatra passed up the river
to Antioch., Old myth and legend and dream took shape and substance., History was entirely re-written, and there was hardly one of the
dramatists who did not recognise that the object of Art is not simple
truth but complex beauty., In this they were perfectly right., Art itself
is really a form of exaggeration; and selection, which is the very spirit
of art, is nothing more than an intensified mode of over-emphasis., ?But Life soon shattered the perfection of the form., Even in Shakespeare
we can see the beginning of the end., It shows itself by the gradual
breaking-up of the blank-verse in the later plays, by the predominance
given to prose, and by the over-importance assigned to characterisation., The passages in Shakespeare?and they are many?where the language is
uncouth, vulgar, exaggerated, fantastic, obscene even, are entirely due
to Life calling for an echo of her own voice, and rejecting the
intervention of beautiful style, through which alone should life be
suffered to find expression., Shakespeare is not by any means a flawless
artist., He is too fond of going directly to life, and borrowing life?s
natural utterance., He forgets that when Art surrenders her imaginative
medium she surrenders everything., Goethe says, somewhere?, In der Beschr?nkung zeigt Fsich erst der Meister,

?It is in working within limits that the master reveals himself,?, and the
limitation, the very condition of any art is style., However, we need not
linger any longer over Shakespeare?s realism., _The Tempest_ is the most
perfect of palinodes., All that we desired to point out was, that the
magnificent work of the Elizabethan and Jacobean artists contained within
itself the seeds of its own dissolution, and that, if it drew some of its
strength from using life as rough material, it drew all its weakness from
using life as an artistic method., As the inevitable result of this
substitution of an imitative for a creative medium, this surrender of an
imaginative form, we have the modern English melodrama., The characters
in these plays talk on the stage exactly as they would talk off it; they
have neither aspirations nor aspirates; they are taken directly from life
and reproduce its vulgarity down to the smallest detail; they present the
gait, manner, costume and accent of real people; they would pass
unnoticed in a third-class railway carriage., And yet how wearisome the
plays are!, They do not succeed in producing even that impression of
reality at which they aim, and which is their only reason for existing., As a method, realism is a complete failure., ?What is true about the drama and the novel is no less true about those
arts that we call the decorative arts., The whole history of these arts
in Europe is the record of the struggle between Orientalism, with its
frank rejection of imitation, its love of artistic convention, its
dislike to the actual representation of any object in Nature, and our own
imitative spirit., Wherever the former has been paramount, as in
Byzantium, Sicily and Spain, by actual contact, or in the rest of Europe
by the influence of the Crusades, we have had beautiful and imaginative
work in which the visible things of life are transmuted into artistic
conventions, and the things that Life has not are invented and fashioned
for her delight., But wherever we have returned to Life and Nature, our
work has always become vulgar, common and uninteresting., Modern
tapestry, with its a?rial effects, its elaborate perspective, its broad
expanses of waste sky, its faithful and laborious realism, has no beauty
whatsoever., The pictorial glass of Germany is absolutely detestable., We
are beginning to weave possible carpets in England, but only because we
have returned to the method and spirit of the East., Our rugs and carpets
of twenty years ago, with their solemn depressing truths, their inane
worship of Nature, their sordid reproductions of visible objects, have
become, even to the Philistine, a source of laughter., A cultured
Mahomedan once remarked to us, ?You Christians are so occupied in
misinterpreting the fourth commandment that you have never thought of
making an artistic application of the second.?, He was perfectly right,
and the whole truth of the matter is this: The proper school to learn art
in is not Life but Art.?, And now let me read you a passage which seems to me to settle the
question very completely., ?It was not always thus., We need not say anything about the poets, for
they, with the unfortunate exception of Mr. Wordsworth, have been really
faithful to their high mission, and are universally recognised as being
absolutely unreliable., But in the works of Herodotus, who, in spite of
the shallow and ungenerous attempts of modern sciolists to verify his
history, may justly be called the ?Father of Lies?, ; in the published
speeches of Cicero and the biographies of Suetonius; in Tacitus at his
best; in Pliny?s _Natural History_; in Hanno?s _Periplus_; in all the
early chronicles; in the Lives of the Saints; in Froissart and Sir Thomas
Malory; in the travels of Marco Polo; in Olaus Magnus, and Aldrovandus,
and Conrad Lycosthenes, with his magnificent _Prodigiorum et Ostentorum
Chronicon_; in the autobiography of Benvenuto Cellini; in the memoirs of
Casanova; in Defoe?s _History of the Plague_; in Boswell?s _Life of
Johnson_; in Napoleon?s despatches, and in the works of our own Carlyle,
whose _French Revolution_ is one of the most fascinating historical
novels ever written, facts are either kept in their proper subordinate
position, or else entirely excluded on the general ground of dulness., Now, everything is changed., Facts are not merely finding a footing-place
in history, but they are usurping the domain of Fancy, and have invaded
the kingdom of Romance., Their chilling touch is over everything., They
are vulgarising mankind., The crude commercialism of America, its
materialising spirit, its indifference to the poetical side of things,
and its lack of imagination and of high unattainable ideals, are entirely
due to that country having adopted for its national hero a man who,
according to his own confession, was incapable of telling a lie, and it
is not too much to say that the story of George Washington and the
cherry-tree has done more harm, and in a shorter space of time, than any
other moral tale in the whole of literature.?, CYRIL., My dear boy!, VIVIAN., I assure you it is the case, and the amusing part of the whole
thing is that the story of the cherry-tree is an absolute myth., However,
you must not think that I am too despondent about the artistic future
either of America or of our own country., Listen to this:?, ?That some change will take place before this century has drawn to its
close we have no doubt whatsoever., Bored by the tedious and improving
conversation of those who have neither the wit to exaggerate nor the
genius to romance, tired of the intelligent person whose reminiscences
are always based upon memory, whose statements are invariably limited by
probability, and who is at any time liable to be corroborated by the
merest Philistine who happens to be present, Society sooner or later must
return to its lost leader, the cultured and fascinating liar., Who he was
who first, without ever having gone out to the rude chase, told the
wandering cavemen at sunset how he had dragged the Megatherium from the
purple darkness of its jasper cave, or slain the Mammoth in single combat
and brought back its gilded tusks, we cannot tell, and not one of our
modern anthropologists, for all their much-boasted science, has had the
ordinary courage to tell us., Whatever was his name or race, he certainly
was the true founder of social intercourse., For the aim of the liar is
simply to charm, to delight, to give pleasure., He is the very basis of
civilised society, and without him a dinner-party, even at the mansions
of the great, is as dull as a lecture at the Royal Society, or a debate
at the Incorporated Authors, or one of Mr. Burnand?s farcical comedies., ?Nor will he be welcomed by society alone., Art, breaking from the
prison-house of realism, will run to greet him, and will kiss his false,
beautiful lips, knowing that he alone is in possession of the great
secret of all her manifestations, the secret that Truth is entirely and
absolutely a matter of style; while Life?poor, probable, uninteresting
human life?tired of repeating herself for the benefit of Mr. Herbert
Spencer, scientific historians, and the compilers of statistics in
general, will follow meekly after him, and try to reproduce, in her own
simple and untutored way, some of the marvels of which he talks., ?No doubt there will always be critics who, like a certain writer in the
_Saturday Review_, will gravely censure the teller of fairy tales for his
defective knowledge of natural history, who will measure imaginative work
by their own lack of any imaginative faculty, and will hold up their
ink-stained hands in horror if some honest gentleman, who has never been
farther than the yew-trees of his own garden, pens a fascinating book of
travels like Sir John Mandeville, or, like great Raleigh, writes a whole
history of the world, without knowing anything whatsoever about the past., To excuse themselves they will try and shelter under the shield of him
who made Prospero the magician, and gave him Caliban and Ariel as his
servants, who heard the Tritons blowing their horns round the coral reefs
of the Enchanted Isle, and the fairies singing to each other in a wood
near Athens, who led the phantom kings in dim procession across the misty
Scottish heath, and hid Hecate in a cave with the weird sisters., They
will call upon Shakespeare?they always do?and will quote that hackneyed
passage forgetting that this unfortunate aphorism about Art holding the
mirror up to Nature, is deliberately said by Hamlet in order to convince
the bystanders of his absolute insanity in all art-matters.?, CYRIL., Ahem!, Another cigarette, please., VIVIAN., My dear fellow, whatever you may say, it is merely a dramatic
utterance, and no more represents Shakespeare?s real views upon art than
the speeches of Iago represent his real views upon morals., But let me
get to the end of the passage:

?Art finds her own perfection within, and not outside of, herself., She
is not to be judged by any external standard of resemblance., She is a
veil, rather than a mirror., She has flowers that no forests know of,
birds that no woodland possesses., She makes and unmakes many worlds, and
can draw the moon from heaven with a scarlet thread., Hers are the ?forms
more real than living man,?, and hers the great archetypes of which things
that have existence are but unfinished copies., Nature has, in her eyes,
no laws, no uniformity., She can work miracles at her will, and when she
calls monsters from the deep they come., ...]",2
163,"[Art never expresses anything but
itself., It has an independent life, just as Thought has, and develops
purely on its own lines., It is not necessarily realistic in an age of
realism, nor spiritual in an age of faith., So far from being the
creation of its time, it is usually in direct opposition to it, and the
only history that it preserves for us is the history of its own progress., Sometimes it returns upon its footsteps, and revives some antique form,
as happened in the archaistic movement of late Greek Art, and in the
pre-Raphaelite movement of our own day., At other times it entirely
anticipates its age, and produces in one century work that it takes
another century to understand, to appreciate and to enjoy., In no case
does it reproduce its age., To pass from the art of a time to the time
itself is the great mistake that all historians commit., The second doctrine is this., All bad art comes from returning to Life
and Nature, and elevating them into ideals., Life and Nature may
sometimes be used as part of Art?s rough material, but before they are of
any real service to art they must be translated into artistic
conventions., The moment Art surrenders its imaginative medium it
surrenders everything., As a method Realism is a complete failure, and
the two things that every artist should avoid are modernity of form and
modernity of subject-matter., To us, who live in the nineteenth century,
any century is a suitable subject for art except our own., The only
beautiful things are the things that do not concern us., It is, to have
the pleasure of quoting myself, exactly because Hecuba is nothing to us
that her sorrows are so suitable a motive for a tragedy., Besides, it is
only the modern that ever becomes old-fashioned., M. Zola sits down to
give us a picture of the Second Empire., Who cares for the Second Empire
now?, It is out of date., Life goes faster than Realism, but Romanticism
is always in front of Life., The third doctrine is that Life imitates Art far more than Art imitates
Life., This results not merely from Life?s imitative instinct, but from
the fact that the self-conscious aim of Life is to find expression, and
that Art offers it certain beautiful forms through which it may realise
that energy., It is a theory that has never been put forward before, but
it is extremely fruitful, and throws an entirely new light upon the
history of Art., It follows, as a corollary from this, that external Nature also imitates
Art., The only effects that she can show us are effects that we have
already seen through poetry, or in paintings., This is the secret of
Nature?s charm, as well as the explanation of Nature?s weakness., The final revelation is that Lying, the telling of beautiful untrue
things, is the proper aim of Art., But of this I think I have spoken at
sufficient length., And now let us go out on the terrace, where ?droops
the milk-white peacock like a ghost,?, while the evening star ?washes the
dusk with silver.?, At twilight nature becomes a wonderfully suggestive
effect, and is not without loveliness, though perhaps its chief use is to
illustrate quotations from the poets., Come!, We have talked long enough., PEN, PENCIL AND POISON
A STUDY IN GREEN


IT has constantly been made a subject of reproach against artists and men
of letters that they are lacking in wholeness and completeness of nature., As a rule this must necessarily be so., That very concentration of vision
and intensity of purpose which is the characteristic of the artistic
temperament is in itself a mode of limitation., To those who are
preoccupied with the beauty of form nothing else seems of much
importance., Yet there are many exceptions to this rule., Rubens served
as ambassador, and Goethe as state councillor, and Milton as Latin
secretary to Cromwell., Sophocles held civic office in his own city; the
humourists, essayists, and novelists of modern America seem to desire
nothing better than to become the diplomatic representatives of their
country; and Charles Lamb?s friend, Thomas Griffiths Wainewright, the
subject of this brief memoir, though of an extremely artistic
temperament, followed many masters other than art, being not merely a
poet and a painter, an art-critic, an antiquarian, and a writer of prose,
an amateur of beautiful things, and a dilettante of things delightful,
but also a forger of no mean or ordinary capabilities, and as a subtle
and secret poisoner almost without rival in this or any age., This remarkable man, so powerful with ?pen, pencil and poison,?, as a
great poet of our own day has finely said of him, was born at Chiswick,
in 1794., His father was the son of a distinguished solicitor of Gray?s
Inn and Hatton Garden., His mother was the daughter of the celebrated Dr.
Griffiths, the editor and founder of the _Monthly Review_, the partner in
another literary speculation of Thomas Davis, that famous bookseller of
whom Johnson said that he was not a bookseller, but ?a gentleman who
dealt in books,?, the friend of Goldsmith and Wedgwood, and one of the
most well-known men of his day., Mrs. Wainewright died, in giving him
birth, at the early age of twenty-one, and an obituary notice in the
_Gentleman?s Magazine_ tells us of her ?amiable disposition and numerous
accomplishments,?, and adds somewhat quaintly that ?she is supposed to
have understood the writings of Mr. Locke as well as perhaps any person
of either sex now living.?, His father did not long survive his young
wife, and the little child seems to have been brought up by his
grandfather, and, on the death of the latter in 1803, by his uncle George
Edward Griffiths, whom he subsequently poisoned., His boyhood was passed
at Linden House, Turnham Green, one of those many fine Georgian mansions
that have unfortunately disappeared before the inroads of the suburban
builder, and to its lovely gardens and well-timbered park he owed that
simple and impassioned love of nature which never left him all through
his life, and which made him so peculiarly susceptible to the spiritual
influences of Wordsworth?s poetry., He went to school at Charles Burney?s
academy at Hammersmith., Mr. Burney was the son of the historian of
music, and the near kinsman of the artistic lad who was destined to turn
out his most remarkable pupil., He seems to have been a man of a good
deal of culture, and in after years Mr. Wainewright often spoke of him
with much affection as a philosopher, an arch?ologist, and an admirable
teacher who, while he valued the intellectual side of education, did not
forget the importance of early moral training., It was under Mr. Burney
that he first developed his talent as an artist, and Mr. Hazlitt tells us
that a drawing-book which he used at school is still extant, and displays
great talent and natural feeling., Indeed, painting was the first art
that fascinated him., It was not till much later that he sought to find
expression by pen or poison., Before this, however, he seems to have been carried away by boyish dreams
of the romance and chivalry of a soldier?s life, and to have become a
young guardsman., But the reckless dissipated life of his companions
failed to satisfy the refined artistic temperament of one who was made
for other things., In a short time he wearied of the service., ?Art,?, he
tells us, in words that still move many by their ardent sincerity and
strange fervour, ?Art touched her renegade; by her pure and high
influence the noisome mists were purged; my feelings, parched, hot, and
tarnished, were renovated with cool, fresh bloom, simple, beautiful to
the simple-hearted.?, But Art was not the only cause of the change., ?The
writings of Wordsworth,?, he goes on to say, ?did much towards calming the
confusing whirl necessarily incident to sudden mutations., I wept over
them tears of happiness and gratitude.?, He accordingly left the army,
with its rough barrack-life and coarse mess-room tittle-tattle, and
returned to Linden House, full of this new-born enthusiasm for culture., A severe illness, in which, to use his own words, he was ?broken like a
vessel of clay,?, prostrated him for a time., His delicately strung
organisation, however indifferent it might have been to inflicting pain
on others, was itself most keenly sensitive to pain., He shrank from
suffering as a thing that mars and maims human life, and seems to have
wandered through that terrible valley of melancholia from which so many
great, perhaps greater, spirits have never emerged., But he was
young?only twenty-five years of age?and he soon passed out of the ?dead
black waters,?, as he called them, into the larger air of humanistic
culture., As he was recovering from the illness that had led him almost
to the gates of death, he conceived the idea of taking up literature as
an art., ?I said with John Woodvil,?, he cries, ?it were a life of gods to
dwell in such an element,?, to see and hear and write brave things:?, ?These high and gusty relishes of life
    Have no allayings of mortality.?, It is impossible not to feel that in this passage we have the utterance
of a man who had a true passion for letters., ?To see and hear and write
brave things,?, this was his aim., Scott, the editor of the _London Magazine_, struck by the young man?s
genius, or under the influence of the strange fascination that he
exercised on every one who knew him, invited him to write a series of
articles on artistic subjects, and under a series of fanciful pseudonym
he began to contribute to the literature of his day., _Janus
Weathercock_, _Egomet Bonmot_, and _Van Vinkvooms_, were some of the
grotesque masks under which he choose to hide his seriousness or to
reveal his levity., A mask tells us more than a face., These disguises
intensified his personality., In an incredibly short time he seems to
have made his mark., Charles Lamb speaks of ?kind, light-hearted
Wainewright,?, whose prose is ?capital.?, We hear of him entertaining
Macready, John Forster, Maginn, Talfourd, Sir Wentworth Dilke, the poet
John Clare, and others, at _a petit-d?ner_., Like Disraeli, he determined
to startle the town as a dandy, and his beautiful rings, his antique
cameo breast-pin, and his pale lemon-coloured kid gloves, were well
known, and indeed were regarded by Hazlitt as being the signs of a new
manner in literature: while his rich curly hair, fine eyes, and exquisite
white hands gave him the dangerous and delightful distinction of being
different from others., There was something in him of Balzac?s Lucien de
Rubempr?., At times he reminds us of Julien Sorel., De Quincey saw him
once., It was at a dinner at Charles Lamb?s., ?Amongst the company, all
literary men, sat a murderer,?, he tells us, and he goes on to describe
how on that day he had been ill, and had hated the face of man and woman,
and yet found himself looking with intellectual interest across the table
at the young writer beneath whose affectations of manner there seemed to
him to lie so much unaffected sensibility, and speculates on ?what sudden
growth of another interest?, would have changed his mood, had he known of
what terrible sin the guest to whom Lamb paid so much attention was even
then guilty., His life-work falls naturally under the three heads suggested by Mr.
Swinburne, and it may be partly admitted that, if we set aside his
achievements in the sphere of poison, what he has actually left to us
hardly justifies his reputation., But then it is only the Philistine who seeks to estimate a personality by
the vulgar test of production., This young dandy sought to be somebody,
rather than to do something., He recognised that Life itself is in art,
and has its modes of style no less than the arts that seek to express it., ...]",2
164,"[The mode of thought that Cardinal Newman represented?if that
can be called a mode of thought which seeks to solve intellectual
problems by a denial of the supremacy of the intellect?may not, cannot, I
think, survive., But the world will never weary of watching that troubled
soul in its progress from darkness to darkness., The lonely church at
Littlemore, where ?the breath of the morning is damp, and worshippers are
few,?, will always be dear to it, and whenever men see the yellow
snapdragon blossoming on the wall of Trinity they will think of that
gracious undergraduate who saw in the flower?s sure recurrence a prophecy
that he would abide for ever with the Benign Mother of his days?a
prophecy that Faith, in her wisdom or her folly, suffered not to be
fulfilled., Yes; autobiography is irresistible., Poor, silly, conceited
Mr. Secretary Pepys has chattered his way into the circle of the
Immortals, and, conscious that indiscretion is the better part of valour,
bustles about among them in that ?shaggy purple gown with gold buttons
and looped lace?, which he is so fond of describing to us, perfectly at
his ease, and prattling, to his own and our infinite pleasure, of the
Indian blue petticoat that he bought for his wife, of the ?good hog?s
hars-let,?, and the ?pleasant French fricassee of veal?, that he loved to
eat, of his game of bowls with Will Joyce, and his ?gadding after
beauties,?, and his reciting of _Hamlet_ on a Sunday, and his playing of
the viol on week days, and other wicked or trivial things., Even in
actual life egotism is not without its attractions., When people talk to
us about others they are usually dull., When they talk to us about
themselves they are nearly always interesting, and if one could shut them
up, when they become wearisome, as easily as one can shut up a book of
which one has grown wearied, they would be perfect absolutely., ERNEST., There is much virtue in that If, as Touchstone would say., But
do you seriously propose that every man should become his own Boswell?, What would become of our industrious compilers of Lives and Recollections
in that case?, GILBERT., What has become of them?, They are the pest of the age, nothing
more and nothing less., Every great man nowadays has his disciples, and
it is always Judas who writes the biography., ERNEST., My dear fellow!, GILBERT., I am afraid it is true., Formerly we used to canonise our
heroes., The modern method is to vulgarise them., Cheap editions of great
books may be delightful, but cheap editions of great men are absolutely
detestable., ERNEST., May I ask, Gilbert, to whom you allude?, GILBERT., Oh!, to all our second-rate _litt?rateurs_., We are overrun by a
set of people who, when poet or painter passes away, arrive at the house
along with the undertaker, and forget that their one duty is to behave as
mutes., But we won?t talk about them., They are the mere body-snatchers
of literature., The dust is given to one, and the ashes to another, and
the soul is out of their reach., And now, let me play Chopin to you, or
Dvor?k?, Shall I play you a fantasy by Dvor?k?, He writes passionate,
curiously-coloured things., ERNEST., No; I don?t want music just at present., It is far too
indefinite., Besides, I took the Baroness Bernstein down to dinner last
night, and, though absolutely charming in every other respect, she
insisted on discussing music as if it were actually written in the German
language., Now, whatever music sounds like I am glad to say that it does
not sound in the smallest degree like German., There are forms of
patriotism that are really quite degrading., No; Gilbert, don?t play any
more., Turn round and talk to me., Talk to me till the white-horned day
comes into the room., There is something in your voice that is wonderful., GILBERT (_rising from the piano_)., I am not in a mood for talking
to-night., I really am not., How horrid of you to smile!, Where are the
cigarettes?, Thanks., How exquisite these single daffodils are!, They
seem to be made of amber and cool ivory., They are like Greek things of
the best period., What was the story in the confessions of the remorseful
Academician that made you laugh?, Tell it to me., After playing Chopin, I
feel as if I had been weeping over sins that I had never committed, and
mourning over tragedies that were not my own., Music always seems to me
to produce that effect., It creates for one a past of which one has been
ignorant, and fills one with a sense of sorrows that have been hidden
from one?s tears., I can fancy a man who had led a perfectly commonplace
life, hearing by chance some curious piece of music, and suddenly
discovering that his soul, without his being conscious of it, had passed
through terrible experiences, and known fearful joys, or wild romantic
loves, or great renunciations., And so tell me this story, Ernest., I
want to be amused., ERNEST., Oh!, I don?t know that it is of any importance., But I thought
it a really admirable illustration of the true value of ordinary
art-criticism., It seems that a lady once gravely asked the remorseful
Academician, as you call him, if his celebrated picture of ?A Spring-Day
at Whiteley?s,?, or, ?Waiting for the Last Omnibus,?, or some subject of
that kind, was all painted by hand?, GILBERT., And was it?, ERNEST., You are quite incorrigible., But, seriously speaking, what is
the use of art-criticism?, Why cannot the artist be left alone, to create
a new world if he wishes it, or, if not, to shadow forth the world which
we already know, and of which, I fancy, we would each one of us be
wearied if Art, with her fine spirit of choice and delicate instinct of
selection, did not, as it were, purify it for us, and give to it a
momentary perfection., It seems to me that the imagination spreads, or
should spread, a solitude around it, and works best in silence and in
isolation., Why should the artist be troubled by the shrill clamour of
criticism?, Why should those who cannot create take upon themselves to
estimate the value of creative work?, What can they know about it?, If a
man?s work is easy to understand, an explanation is unnecessary., ., ., ., GILBERT., And if his work is incomprehensible, an explanation is wicked., ERNEST., I did not say that., GILBERT., Ah!, but you should have., Nowadays, we have so few mysteries
left to us that we cannot afford to part with one of them., The members
of the Browning Society, like the theologians of the Broad Church Party,
or the authors of Mr. Walter Scott?s Great Writers Series, seem to me to
spend their time in trying to explain their divinity away., Where one had
hoped that Browning was a mystic they have sought to show that he was
simply inarticulate., Where one had fancied that he had something to
conceal, they have proved that he had but little to reveal., But I speak
merely of his incoherent work., ...]",2
165,"[And yet, I feel I am a little unfair in this matter., As a
rule, the critics?I speak, of course, of the higher class, of those in
fact who write for the sixpenny papers?are far more cultured than the
people whose work they are called upon to review., This is, indeed, only
what one would expect, for criticism demands infinitely more cultivation
than creation does., ERNEST., Really?, GILBERT., Certainly., Anybody can write a three-volumed novel., It merely
requires a complete ignorance of both life and literature., The
difficulty that I should fancy the reviewer feels is the difficulty of
sustaining any standard., Where there is no style a standard must be
impossible., The poor reviewers are apparently reduced to be the
reporters of the police-court of literature, the chroniclers of the
doings of the habitual criminals of art., It is sometimes said of them
that they do not read all through the works they are called upon to
criticise., They do not., Or at least they should not., If they did so,
they would become confirmed misanthropes, or if I may borrow a phrase
from one of the pretty Newnham graduates, confirmed womanthropes for the
rest of their lives., Nor is it necessary., To know the vintage and
quality of a wine one need not drink the whole cask., It must be
perfectly easy in half an hour to say whether a book is worth anything or
worth nothing., Ten minutes are really sufficient, if one has the
instinct for form., Who wants to wade through a dull volume?, One tastes
it, and that is quite enough?more than enough, I should imagine., I am
aware that there are many honest workers in painting as well as in
literature who object to criticism entirely., They are quite right., Their work stands in no intellectual relation to their age., It brings us
no new element of pleasure., It suggests no fresh departure of thought,
or passion, or beauty., It should not be spoken of., It should be left to
the oblivion that it deserves., ERNEST., But, my dear fellow?excuse me for interrupting you?you seem to
me to be allowing your passion for criticism to lead you a great deal too
far., For, after all, even you must admit that it is much more difficult
to do a thing than to talk about it., GILBERT., More difficult to do a thing than to talk about it?, Not at
all., That is a gross popular error., It is very much more difficult to
talk about a thing than to do it., In the sphere of actual life that is
of course obvious., Anybody can make history., Only a great man can write
it., There is no mode of action, no form of emotion, that we do not share
with the lower animals., It is only by language that we rise above them,
or above each other?by language, which is the parent, and not the child,
of thought., Action, indeed, is always easy, and when presented to us in
its most aggravated, because most continuous form, which I take to be
that of real industry, becomes simply the refuge of people who have
nothing whatsoever to do., No, Ernest, don?t talk about action., It is a
blind thing dependent on external influences, and moved by an impulse of
whose nature it is unconscious., It is a thing incomplete in its essence,
because limited by accident, and ignorant of its direction, being always
at variance with its aim., Its basis is the lack of imagination., It is
the last resource of those who know not how to dream., ERNEST., Gilbert, you treat the world as if it were a crystal ball., You
hold it in your hand, and reverse it to please a wilful fancy., You do
nothing but re-write history., GILBERT., The one duty we owe to history is to re-write it., That is not
the least of the tasks in store for the critical spirit., When we have
fully discovered the scientific laws that govern life, we shall realise
that the one person who has more illusions than the dreamer is the man of
action., He, indeed, knows neither the origin of his deeds nor their
results., From the field in which he thought that he had sown thorns, we
have gathered our vintage, and the fig-tree that he planted for our
pleasure is as barren as the thistle, and more bitter., It is because
Humanity has never known where it was going that it has been able to find
its way., ERNEST., You think, then, that in the sphere of action a conscious aim is
a delusion?, GILBERT., It is worse than a delusion., If we lived long enough to see
the results of our actions it may be that those who call themselves good
would be sickened with a dull remorse, and those whom the world calls
evil stirred by a noble joy., Each little thing that we do passes into
the great machine of life which may grind our virtues to powder and make
them worthless, or transform our sins into elements of a new
civilisation, more marvellous and more splendid than any that has gone
before., But men are the slaves of words., They rage against Materialism,
as they call it, forgetting that there has been no material improvement
that has not spiritualised the world, and that there have been few, if
any, spiritual awakenings that have not wasted the world?s faculties in
barren hopes, and fruitless aspirations, and empty or trammelling creeds., What is termed Sin is an essential element of progress., Without it the
world would stagnate, or grow old, or become colourless., By its
curiosity Sin increases the experience of the race., Through its
intensified assertion of individualism, it saves us from monotony of
type., In its rejection of the current notions about morality, it is one
with the higher ethics., And as for the virtues!, What are the virtues?, Nature, M. Renan tells us, cares little about chastity, and it may be
that it is to the shame of the Magdalen, and not to their own purity,
that the Lucretias of modern life owe their freedom from stain., Charity,
as even those of whose religion it makes a formal part have been
compelled to acknowledge, creates a multitude of evils., The mere
existence of conscience, that faculty of which people prate so much
nowadays, and are so ignorantly proud, is a sign of our imperfect
development., It must be merged in instinct before we become fine., Self-denial is simply a method by which man arrests his progress, and
self-sacrifice a survival of the mutilation of the savage, part of that
old worship of pain which is so terrible a factor in the history of the
world, and which even now makes its victims day by day, and has its
altars in the land., Virtues!, Who knows what the virtues are?, Not you., Not I., Not any one., It is well for our vanity that we slay the
criminal, for if we suffered him to live he might show us what we had
gained by his crime., It is well for his peace that the saint goes to his
martyrdom., He is spared the sight of the horror of his harvest., ERNEST., Gilbert, you sound too harsh a note., Let us go back to the more
gracious fields of literature., What was it you said?, That it was more
difficult to talk about a thing than to do it?, GILBERT (_after a pause_)., Yes: I believe I ventured upon that simple
truth., Surely you see now that I am right?, When man acts he is a
puppet., When he describes he is a poet., The whole secret lies in that., It was easy enough on the sandy plains by windy Ilion to send the notched
arrow from the painted bow, or to hurl against the shield of hide and
flamelike brass the long ash-handled spear., It was easy for the
adulterous queen to spread the Tyrian carpets for her lord, and then, as
he lay couched in the marble bath, to throw over his head the purple net,
and call to her smooth-faced lover to stab through the meshes at the
heart that should have broken at Aulis., ...]",2
166,"[And the chief
thing that makes life a failure from this artistic point of view is the
thing that lends to life its sordid security, the fact that one can never
repeat exactly the same emotion., How different it is in the world of
Art!, On a shelf of the bookcase behind you stands the _Divine Comedy_,
and I know that, if I open it at a certain place, I shall be filled with
a fierce hatred of some one who has never wronged me, or stirred by a
great love for some one whom I shall never see., There is no mood or
passion that Art cannot give us, and those of us who have discovered her
secret can settle beforehand what our experiences are going to be., We
can choose our day and select our hour., We can say to ourselves,
?To-morrow, at dawn, we shall walk with grave Virgil through the valley
of the shadow of death,?, and lo!, the dawn finds us in the obscure wood,
and the Mantuan stands by our side., We pass through the gate of the
legend fatal to hope, and with pity or with joy behold the horror of
another world., The hypocrites go by, with their painted faces and their
cowls of gilded lead., Out of the ceaseless winds that drive them, the
carnal look at us, and we watch the heretic rending his flesh, and the
glutton lashed by the rain., We break the withered branches from the tree
in the grove of the Harpies, and each dull-hued poisonous twig bleeds
with red blood before us, and cries aloud with bitter cries., Out of a
horn of fire Odysseus speaks to us, and when from his sepulchre of flame
the great Ghibelline rises, the pride that triumphs over the torture of
that bed becomes ours for a moment., Through the dim purple air fly those
who have stained the world with the beauty of their sin, and in the pit
of loathsome disease, dropsy-stricken and swollen of body into the
semblance of a monstrous lute, lies Adamo di Brescia, the coiner of false
coin., He bids us listen to his misery; we stop, and with dry and gaping
lips he tells us how he dreams day and night of the brooks of clear water
that in cool dewy channels gush down the green Casentine hills., Sinon,
the false Greek of Troy, mocks at him., He smites him in the face, and
they wrangle., We are fascinated by their shame, and loiter, till Virgil
chides us and leads us away to that city turreted by giants where great
Nimrod blows his horn., Terrible things are in store for us, and we go to
meet them in Dante?s raiment and with Dante?s heart., We traverse the
marshes of the Styx, and Argenti swims to the boat through the slimy
waves., He calls to us, and we reject him., When we hear the voice of his
agony we are glad, and Virgil praises us for the bitterness of our scorn., We tread upon the cold crystal of Cocytus, in which traitors stick like
straws in glass., Our foot strikes against the head of Bocca., He will
not tell us his name, and we tear the hair in handfuls from the screaming
skull., Alberigo prays us to break the ice upon his face that he may weep
a little., We pledge our word to him, and when he has uttered his
dolorous tale we deny the word that we have spoken, and pass from him;
such cruelty being courtesy indeed, for who more base than he who has
mercy for the condemned of God?, In the jaws of Lucifer we see the man
who sold Christ, and in the jaws of Lucifer the men who slew C?sar., We
tremble, and come forth to re-behold the stars., In the land of Purgation the air is freer, and the holy mountain rises
into the pure light of day., There is peace for us, and for those who for
a season abide in it there is some peace also, though, pale from the
poison of the Maremma, Madonna Pia passes before us, and Ismene, with the
sorrow of earth still lingering about her, is there., Soul after soul
makes us share in some repentance or some joy., He whom the mourning of
his widow taught to drink the sweet wormwood of pain, tells us of Nella
praying in her lonely bed, and we learn from the mouth of Buonconte how a
single tear may save a dying sinner from the fiend., Sordello, that noble
and disdainful Lombard, eyes us from afar like a couchant lion., When he
learns that Virgil is one of Mantua?s citizens, he falls upon his neck,
and when he learns that he is the singer of Rome he falls before his
feet., In that valley whose grass and flowers are fairer than cleft
emerald and Indian wood, and brighter than scarlet and silver, they are
singing who in the world were kings; but the lips of Rudolph of Hapsburg
do not move to the music of the others, and Philip of France beats his
breast and Henry of England sits alone., On and on we go, climbing the
marvellous stair, and the stars become larger than their wont, and the
song of the kings grows faint, and at length we reach the seven trees of
gold and the garden of the Earthly Paradise., In a griffin-drawn chariot
appears one whose brows are bound with olive, who is veiled in white, and
mantled in green, and robed in a vesture that is coloured like live fire., The ancient flame wakes within us., Our blood quickens through terrible
pulses., We recognise her., It is Beatrice, the woman we have worshipped., The ice congealed about our heart melts., Wild tears of anguish break
from us, and we bow our forehead to the ground, for we know that we have
sinned., When we have done penance, and are purified, and have drunk of
the fountain of Lethe and bathed in the fountain of Eunoe, the mistress
of our soul raises us to the Paradise of Heaven., Out of that eternal
pearl, the moon, the face of Piccarda Donati leans to us., Her beauty
troubles us for a moment, and when, like a thing that falls through
water, she passes away, we gaze after her with wistful eyes., The sweet
planet of Venus is full of lovers., Cunizza, the sister of Ezzelin, the
lady of Sordello?s heart, is there, and Folco, the passionate singer of
Provence, who in sorrow for Azalais forsook the world, and the
Canaanitish harlot whose soul was the first that Christ redeemed., Joachim of Flora stands in the sun, and, in the sun, Aquinas recounts the
story of St. Francis and Bonaventure the story of St. Dominic., Through
the burning rubies of Mars, Cacciaguida approaches., He tells us of the
arrow that is shot from the bow of exile, and how salt tastes the bread
of another, and how steep are the stairs in the house of a stranger., In
Saturn the soul sings not, and even she who guides us dare not smile., On
a ladder of gold the flames rise and fall., At last, we see the pageant
of the Mystical Rose., Beatrice fixes her eyes upon the face of God to
turn them not again., The beatific vision is granted to us; we know the
Love that moves the sun and all the stars., Yes, we can put the earth back six hundred courses and make ourselves one
with the great Florentine, kneel at the same altar with him, and share
his rapture and his scorn., And if we grow tired of an antique time, and
desire to realise our own age in all its weariness and sin, are there not
books that can make us live more in one single hour than life can make us
live in a score of shameful years?, Close to your hand lies a little
volume, bound in some Nile-green skin that has been powdered with gilded
nenuphars and smoothed with hard ivory., It is the book that Gautier
loved, it is Baudelaire?s masterpiece., Open it at that sad madrigal that
begins

    Que m?importe que tu sois sage?, Sois belle!, et sois triste!, and you will find yourself worshipping sorrow as you have never
worshipped joy., Pass on to the poem on the man who tortures himself, let
its subtle music steal into your brain and colour your thoughts, and you
will become for a moment what he was who wrote it; nay, not for a moment
only, but for many barren moonlit nights and sunless sterile days will a
despair that is not your own make its dwelling within you, and the misery
of another gnaw your heart away., Read the whole book, suffer it to tell
even one of its secrets to your soul, and your soul will grow eager to
know more, and will feed upon poisonous honey, and seek to repent of
strange crimes of which it is guiltless, and to make atonement for
terrible pleasures that it has never known., And then, when you are tired
of these flowers of evil, turn to the flowers that grow in the garden of
Perdita, and in their dew-drenched chalices cool your fevered brow, and
let their loveliness heal and restore your soul; or wake from his
forgotten tomb the sweet Syrian, Meleager, and bid the lover of Heliodore
make you music, for he too has flowers in his song, red pomegranate
blossoms, and irises that smell of myrrh, ringed daffodils and dark blue
hyacinths, and marjoram and crinkled ox-eyes., Dear to him was the
perfume of the bean-field at evening, and dear to him the odorous
eared-spikenard that grew on the Syrian hills, and the fresh green thyme,
the wine-cup?s charm., The feet of his love as she walked in the garden
were like lilies set upon lilies., Softer than sleep-laden poppy petals
were her lips, softer than violets and as scented., The flame-like crocus
sprang from the grass to look at her., For her the slim narcissus stored
the cool rain; and for her the anemones forgot the Sicilian winds that
wooed them., And neither crocus, nor anemone, nor narcissus was as fair
as she was., It is a strange thing, this transference of emotion., We sicken with the
same maladies as the poets, and the singer lends us his pain., Dead lips
have their message for us, and hearts that have fallen to dust can
communicate their joy., We run to kiss the bleeding mouth of Fantine, and
we follow Manon Lescaut over the whole world., Ours is the love-madness
of the Tyrian, and the terror of Orestes is ours also., There is no
passion that we cannot feel, no pleasure that we may not gratify, and we
can choose the time of our initiation and the time of our freedom also., Life!, Life!, Don?t let us go to life for our fulfilment or our
experience., It is a thing narrowed by circumstances, incoherent in its
utterance, and without that fine correspondence of form and spirit which
is the only thing that can satisfy the artistic and critical temperament., It makes us pay too high a price for its wares, and we purchase the
meanest of its secrets at a cost that is monstrous and infinite., ERNEST., Must we go, then, to Art for everything?, GILBERT., For everything., Because Art does not hurt us., The tears that
we shed at a play are a type of the exquisite sterile emotions that it is
the function of Art to awaken., We weep, but we are not wounded., We
grieve, but our grief is not bitter., In the actual life of man, sorrow,
as Spinoza says somewhere, is a passage to a lesser perfection., But the
sorrow with which Art fills us both purifies and initiates, if I may
quote once more from the great art critic of the Greeks., It is through
Art, and through Art only, that we can realise our perfection; through
Art, and through Art only, that we can shield ourselves from the sordid
perils of actual existence., This results not merely from the fact that
nothing that one can imagine is worth doing, and that one can imagine
everything, but from the subtle law that emotional forces, like the
forces of the physical sphere, are limited in extent and energy., One can
feel so much, and no more., And how can it matter with what pleasure life
tries to tempt one, or with what pain it seeks to maim and mar one?s
soul, if in the spectacle of the lives of those who have never existed
one has found the true secret of joy, and wept away one?s tears over
their deaths who, like Cordelia and the daughter of Brabantio, can never
die?, ERNEST., ...]",2
167,"[It is too splendid to
be sane., Those of whose lives it forms the dominant note will always
seem to the world to be pure visionaries., ERNEST., Well, at least, the critic will be sincere., GILBERT., A little sincerity is a dangerous thing, and a great deal of it
is absolutely fatal., The true critic will, indeed, always be sincere in
his devotion to the principle of beauty, but he will seek for beauty in
every age and in each school, and will never suffer himself to be limited
to any settled custom of thought or stereotyped mode of looking at
things., He will realise himself in many forms, and by a thousand
different ways, and will ever be curious of new sensations and fresh
points of view., Through constant change, and through constant change
alone, he will find his true unity., He will not consent to be the slave
of his own opinions., For what is mind but motion in the intellectual
sphere?, The essence of thought, as the essence of life, is growth., You
must not be frightened by word, Ernest., What people call insincerity is
simply a method by which we can multiply our personalities., ERNEST., I am afraid I have not been fortunate in my suggestions., GILBERT., Of the three qualifications you mentioned, two, sincerity and
fairness, were, if not actually moral, at least on the borderland of
morals, and the first condition of criticism is that the critic should be
able to recognise that the sphere of Art and the sphere of Ethics are
absolutely distinct and separate., When they are confused, Chaos has come
again., They are too often confused in England now, and though our modern
Puritans cannot destroy a beautiful thing, yet, by means of their
extraordinary prurience, they can almost taint beauty for a moment., It
is chiefly, I regret to say, through journalism that such people find
expression., I regret it because there is much to be said in favour of
modern journalism., By giving us the opinions of the uneducated, it keeps
us in touch with the ignorance of the community., By carefully
chronicling the current events of contemporary life, it shows us of what
very little importance such events really are., By invariably discussing
the unnecessary it makes us understand what things are requisite for
culture, and what are not., But it should not allow poor Tartuffe to
write articles upon modern art., When it does this it stultifies itself., And yet Tartuffe?s articles and Chadband?s notes do this good, at least., They serve to show how extremely limited is the area over which ethics,
and ethical considerations, can claim to exercise influence., Science is
out of the reach of morals, for her eyes are fixed upon eternal truths., Art is out of the reach of morals, for her eyes are fixed upon things
beautiful and immortal and ever-changing., To morals belong the lower and
less intellectual spheres., However, let these mouthing Puritans pass;
they have their comic side., Who can help laughing when an ordinary
journalist seriously proposes to limit the subject-matter at the disposal
of the artist?, Some limitation might well, and will soon, I hope, be
placed upon some of our newspapers and newspaper writers., For they give
us the bald, sordid, disgusting facts of life., They chronicle, with
degrading avidity, the sins of the second-rate, and with the
conscientiousness of the illiterate give us accurate and prosaic details
of the doings of people of absolutely no interest whatsoever., But the
artist, who accepts the facts of life, and yet transforms them into
shapes of beauty, and makes them vehicles of pity or of awe, and shows
their colour-element, and their wonder, and their true ethical import
also, and builds out of them a world more real than reality itself, and
of loftier and more noble import?who shall set limits to him?, Not the
apostles of that new Journalism which is but the old vulgarity ?writ
large.?, Not the apostles of that new Puritanism, which is but the whine
of the hypocrite, and is both writ and spoken badly., The mere suggestion
is ridiculous., Let us leave these wicked people, and proceed to the
discussion of the artistic qualifications necessary for the true critic., ERNEST., And what are they?, Tell me yourself., GILBERT., Temperament is the primary requisite for the critic?a
temperament exquisitely susceptible to beauty, and to the various
impressions that beauty gives us., Under what conditions, and by what
means, this temperament is engendered in race or individual, we will not
discuss at present., It is sufficient to note that it exists, and that
there is in us a beauty-sense, separate from the other senses and above
them, separate from the reason and of nobler import, separate from the
soul and of equal value?a sense that leads some to create, and others,
the finer spirits as I think, to contemplate merely., But to be purified
and made perfect, this sense requires some form of exquisite environment., Without this it starves, or is dulled., You remember that lovely passage
in which Plato describes how a young Greek should be educated, and with
what insistence he dwells upon the importance of surroundings, telling us
how the lad is to be brought up in the midst of fair sights and sounds,
so that the beauty of material things may prepare his soul for the
reception of the beauty that is spiritual., Insensibly, and without
knowing the reason why, he is to develop that real love of beauty which,
as Plato is never weary of reminding us, is the true aim of education., By slow degrees there is to be engendered in him such a temperament as
will lead him naturally and simply to choose the good in preference to
the bad, and, rejecting what is vulgar and discordant, to follow by fine
instinctive taste all that possesses grace and charm and loveliness., Ultimately, in its due course, this taste is to become critical and
self-conscious, but at first it is to exist purely as a cultivated
instinct, and ?he who has received this true culture of the inner man
will with clear and certain vision perceive the omissions and faults in
art or nature, and with a taste that cannot err, while he praises, and
finds his pleasure in what is good, and receives it into his soul, and so
becomes good and noble, he will rightly blame and hate the bad, now in
the days of his youth, even before he is able to know the reason why?, :
and so, when, later on, the critical and self-conscious spirit develops
in him, he ?will recognise and salute it as a friend with whom his
education has made him long familiar.?, I need hardly say, Ernest, how
far we in England have fallen short of this ideal, and I can imagine the
smile that would illuminate the glossy face of the Philistine if one
ventured to suggest to him that the true aim of education was the love of
beauty, and that the methods by which education should work were the
development of temperament, the cultivation of taste, and the creation of
the critical spirit., Yet, even for us, there is left some loveliness of environment, and the
dulness of tutors and professors matters very little when one can loiter
in the grey cloisters at Magdalen, and listen to some flute-like voice
singing in Waynfleete?s chapel, or lie in the green meadow, among the
strange snake-spotted fritillaries, and watch the sunburnt noon smite to
a finer gold the tower?s gilded vanes, or wander up the Christ Church
staircase beneath the vaulted ceiling?s shadowy fans, or pass through the
sculptured gateway of Laud?s building in the College of St. John., Nor is
it merely at Oxford, or Cambridge, that the sense of beauty can be formed
and trained and perfected., All over England there is a Renaissance of
the decorative Arts., Ugliness has had its day., Even in the houses of
the rich there is taste, and the houses of those who are not rich have
been made gracious and comely and sweet to live in., Caliban, poor noisy
Caliban, thinks that when he has ceased to make mows at a thing, the
thing ceases to exist., But if he mocks no longer, it is because he has
been met with mockery, swifter and keener than his own, and for a moment
has been bitterly schooled into that silence which should seal for ever
his uncouth distorted lips., What has been done up to now, has been
chiefly in the clearing of the way., It is always more difficult to
destroy than it is to create, and when what one has to destroy is
vulgarity and stupidity, the task of destruction needs not merely courage
but also contempt., Yet it seems to me to have been, in a measure, done., We have got rid of what was bad., We have now to make what is beautiful., And though the mission of the ?sthetic movement is to lure people to
contemplate, not to lead them to create, yet, as the creative instinct is
strong in the Celt, and it is the Celt who leads in art, there is no
reason why in future years this strange Renaissance should not become
almost as mighty in its way as was that new birth of Art that woke many
centuries ago in the cities of Italy., Certainly, for the cultivation of temperament, we must turn to the
decorative arts: to the arts that touch us, not to the arts that teach
us., Modern pictures are, no doubt, delightful to look at., At least,
some of them are., But they are quite impossible to live with; they are
too clever, too assertive, too intellectual., Their meaning is too
obvious, and their method too clearly defined., One exhausts what they
have to say in a very short time, and then they become as tedious as
one?s relations., I am very fond of the work of many of the Impressionist
painters of Paris and London., Subtlety and distinction have not yet left
the school., Some of their arrangements and harmonies serve to remind one
of the unapproachable beauty of Gautier?s immortal _Symphonie en Blanc
Majeur_, that flawless masterpiece of colour and music which may have
suggested the type as well as the titles of many of their best pictures., For a class that welcomes the incompetent with sympathetic eagerness, and
that confuses the bizarre with the beautiful, and vulgarity with truth,
they are extremely accomplished., They can do etchings that have the
brilliancy of epigrams, pastels that are as fascinating as paradoxes, and
as for their portraits, whatever the commonplace may say against them, no
one can deny that they possess that unique and wonderful charm which
belongs to works of pure fiction., But even the Impressionists, earnest
and industrious as they are, will not do., I like them., Their white
keynote, with its variations in lilac, was an era in colour., Though the
moment does not make the man, the moment certainly makes the
Impressionist, and for the moment in art, and the ?moment?s monument,?, as
Rossetti phrased it, what may not be said?, They are suggestive also., If
they have not opened the eyes of the blind, they have at least given
great encouragement to the short-sighted, and while their leaders may
have all the inexperience of old age, their young men are far too wise to
be ever sensible., Yet they will insist on treating painting as if it
were a mode of autobiography invented for the use of the illiterate, and
are always prating to us on their coarse gritty canvases of their
unnecessary selves and their unnecessary opinions, and spoiling by a
vulgar over-emphasis that fine contempt of nature which is the best and
only modest thing about them., One tires, at the end, of the work of
individuals whose individuality is always noisy, and generally
uninteresting., There is far more to be said in favour of that newer
school at Paris, the _Archaicistes_, as they call themselves, who,
refusing to leave the artist entirely at the mercy of the weather, do not
find the ideal of art in mere atmospheric effect, but seek rather for the
imaginative beauty of design and the loveliness of fair colour, and
rejecting the tedious realism of those who merely paint what they see,
try to see something worth seeing, and to see it not merely with actual
and physical vision, but with that nobler vision of the soul which is as
far wider in spiritual scope as it is far more splendid in artistic
purpose., They, at any rate, work under those decorative conditions that
each art requires for its perfection, and have sufficient ?sthetic
instinct to regret those sordid and stupid limitations of absolute
modernity of form which have proved the ruin of so many of the
Impressionists., Still, the art that is frankly decorative is the art to
live with., It is, of all our visible arts, the one art that creates in
us both mood and temperament., Mere colour, unspoiled by meaning, and
unallied with definite form, can speak to the soul in a thousand
different ways., The harmony that resides in the delicate proportions of
lines and masses becomes mirrored in the mind., The repetitions of
pattern give us rest., The marvels of design stir the imagination., In
the mere loveliness of the materials employed there are latent elements
of culture., Nor is this all., ...]",2
168,"[And those who saw Mr. Irving in the last act of _Richard the
Third_ have not, I am sure, forgotten how much the agony and terror of
his dream was intensified, by contrast, through the calm and quiet that
preceded it, and the delivery of such lines as

lines which had a double meaning for the audience, remembering the last
words which Richard?s mother called after him as he was marching to
Bosworth:?, As regards the resources which Shakespeare had at his disposal, it is to
be remarked that, while he more than once complains of the smallness of
the stage on which he has to produce big historical plays, and of the
want of scenery which obliges him to cut out many effective open-air
incidents, he always writes as a dramatist who had at his disposal a most
elaborate theatrical wardrobe, and who could rely on the actors taking
pains about their make-up., Even now it is difficult to produce such a
play as the _Comedy of Errors_; and to the picturesque accident of Miss
Ellen Terry?s brother resembling herself we owe the opportunity of seeing
_Twelfth Night_ adequately performed., Indeed, to put any play of
Shakespeare?s on the stage, absolutely as he himself wished it to be
done, requires the services of a good property-man, a clever wig-maker, a
costumier with a sense of colour and a knowledge of textures, a master of
the methods of making-up, a fencing-master, a dancing-master, and an
artist to direct personally the whole production., For he is most careful
to tell us the dress and appearance of each character., ?Racine abhorre
la r?alit?,?, says Auguste Vacquerie somewhere; ?il ne daigne pas
s?occuper de son costume., Si l?on s?en rapportait aux indications du
po?te, Agamemnon serait v?tu d?un sceptre et Achille d?une ?p?e.?, But
with Shakespeare it is very different., He gives us directions about the
costumes of Perdita, Florizel, Autolycus, the Witches in _Macbeth_, and
the apothecary in _Romeo and Juliet_, several elaborate descriptions of
his fat knight, and a detailed account of the extraordinary garb in which
Petruchio is to be married., Rosalind, he tells us, is tall, and is to
carry a spear and a little dagger; Celia is smaller, and is to paint her
face brown so as to look sunburnt., The children who play at fairies in
Windsor Forest are to be dressed in white and green?a compliment, by the
way, to Queen Elizabeth, whose favourite colours they were?and in white,
with green garlands and gilded vizors, the angels are to come to
Katherine in Kimbolton., Bottom is in homespun, Lysander is distinguished
from Oberon by his wearing an Athenian dress, and Launce has holes in his
boots., The Duchess of Gloucester stands in a white sheet with her
husband in mourning beside her., The motley of the Fool, the scarlet of
the Cardinal, and the French lilies broidered on the English coats, are
all made occasion for jest or taunt in the dialogue., We know the
patterns on the Dauphin?s armour and the Pucelle?s sword, the crest on
Warwick?s helmet and the colour of Bardolph?s nose., Portia has golden
hair, Phoebe is black-haired, Orlando has chestnut curls, and Sir Andrew
Aguecheek?s hair hangs like flax on a distaff, and won?t curl at all., Some of the characters are stout, some lean, some straight, some
hunchbacked, some fair, some dark, and some are to blacken their faces., Lear has a white beard, Hamlet?s father a grizzled, and Benedick is to
shave his in the course of the play., Indeed, on the subject of stage
beards Shakespeare is quite elaborate; tells us of the many different
colours in use, and gives a hint to actors always to see that their own
are properly tied on., There is a dance of reapers in rye-straw hats, and
of rustics in hairy coats like satyrs; a masque of Amazons, a masque of
Russians, and a classical masque; several immortal scenes over a weaver
in an ass?s head, a riot over the colour of a coat which it takes the
Lord Mayor of London to quell, and a scene between an infuriated husband
and his wife?s milliner about the slashing of a sleeve., As for the metaphors Shakespeare draws from dress, and the aphorisms he
makes on it, his hits at the costume of his age, particularly at the
ridiculous size of the ladies?, bonnets, and the many descriptions of the
_mundus muliebris_, from the long of Autolycus in the _Winter?s Tale_
down to the account of the Duchess of Milan?s gown in _Much Ado About
Nothing_, they are far too numerous to quote; though it may be worth
while to remind people that the whole of the Philosophy of Clothes is to
be found in Lear?s scene with Edgar?a passage which has the advantage of
brevity and style over the grotesque wisdom and somewhat mouthing
metaphysics of _Sartor Resartus_., But I think that from what I have
already said it is quite clear that Shakespeare was very much interested
in costume., I do not mean in that shallow sense by which it has been
concluded from his knowledge of deeds and daffodils that he was the
Blackstone and Paxton of the Elizabethan age; but that he saw that
costume could be made at once impressive of a certain effect on the
audience and expressive of certain types of character, and is one of the
essential factors of the means which a true illusionist has at his
disposal., Indeed to him the deformed figure of Richard was of as much
value as Juliet?s loveliness; he sets the serge of the radical beside the
silks of the lord, and sees the stage effects to be got from each: he has
as much delight in Caliban as he has in Ariel, in rags as he has in cloth
of gold, and recognises the artistic beauty of ugliness., The difficulty Ducis felt about translating _Othello_ in consequence of
the importance given to such a vulgar thing as a handkerchief, and his
attempt to soften its grossness by making the Moor reiterate ?Le bandeau!, le bandeau!?, may be taken as an example of the difference between _la
trag?die philosophique_ and the drama of real life; and the introduction
for the first time of the word _mouchoir_ at the Th?, ?tre Fran?ais was an
era in that romantic-realistic movement of which Hugo is the father and
M. Zola the _enfant terrible_, just as the classicism of the earlier part
of the century was emphasised by Talma?s refusal to play Greek heroes any
longer in a powdered periwig?one of the many instances, by the way, of
that desire for arch?ological accuracy in dress which has distinguished
the great actors of our age., In criticising the importance given to money in _La Com?die Humaine_,
Th?ophile Gautier says that Balzac may claim to have invented a new hero
in fiction, _le h?ros m?tallique_., Of Shakespeare it may be said he was
the first to see the dramatic value of doublets, and that a climax may
depend on a crinoline., The burning of the Globe Theatre?an event due, by the way, to the results
of the passion for illusion that distinguished Shakespeare?s
stage-management?has unfortunately robbed us of many important documents;
but in the inventory, still in existence, of the costume-wardrobe of a
London theatre in Shakespeare?s time, there are mentioned particular
costumes for cardinals, shepherds, kings, clowns, friars, and fools;
green coats for Robin Hood?s men, and a green gown for Maid Marian; a
white and gold doublet for Henry the Fifth, and a robe for Longshanks;
besides surplices, copes, damask gowns, gowns of cloth of gold and of
cloth of silver, taffeta gowns, calico gowns, velvet coats, satin coats,
frieze coats, jerkins of yellow leather and of black leather, red suits,
grey suits, French Pierrot suits, a robe ?for to goo invisibell,?, which
seems inexpensive at ?3, 10s., and four incomparable fardingales?all of
which show a desire to give every character an appropriate dress., There
are also entries of Spanish, Moorish and Danish costumes, of helmets,
lances, painted shields, imperial crowns, and papal tiaras, as well as of
costumes for Turkish Janissaries, Roman Senators, and all the gods and
goddesses of Olympus, which evidence a good deal of arch?ological
research on the part of the manager of the theatre., It is true that
there is a mention of a bodice for Eve, but probably the _donn?e_ of the
play was after the Fall., Indeed, anybody who cares to examine the age of Shakespeare will see that
arch?ology was one of its special characteristics., After that revival of
the classical forms of architecture which was one of the notes of the
Renaissance, and the printing at Venice and elsewhere of the masterpieces
of Greek and Latin literature, had come naturally an interest in the
ornamentation and costume of the antique world., Nor was it for the
learning that they could acquire, but rather for the loveliness that they
might create, that the artists studied these things., The curious objects
that were being constantly brought to light by excavations were not left
to moulder in a museum, for the contemplation of a callous curator, and
the _ennui_ of a policeman bored by the absence of crime., They were used
as motives for the production of a new art, which was to be not beautiful
merely, but also strange., Infessura tells us that in 1485 some workmen digging on the Appian Way
came across an old Roman sarcophagus inscribed with the name ?Julia,
daughter of Claudius.?, On opening the coffer they found within its
marble womb the body of a beautiful girl of about fifteen years of age,
preserved by the embalmer?s skill from corruption and the decay of time., Her eyes were half open, her hair rippled round her in crisp curling
gold, and from her lips and cheek the bloom of maidenhood had not yet
departed., Borne back to the Capitol, she became at once the centre of a
new cult, and from all parts of the city crowded pilgrims to worship at
the wonderful shrine, till the Pope, fearing lest those who had found the
secret of beauty in a Pagan tomb might forget what secrets Jud?a?s rough
and rock-hewn sepulchre contained, had the body conveyed away by night,
and in secret buried., Legend though it may be, yet the story is none the
less valuable as showing us the attitude of the Renaissance towards the
antique world., Arch?ology to them was not a mere science for the
antiquarian; it was a means by which they could touch the dry dust of
antiquity into the very breath and beauty of life, and fill with the new
wine of romanticism forms that else had been old and outworn., From the
pulpit of Niccola Pisano down to Mantegna?s ?Triumph of C?sar,?, and the
service Cellini designed for King Francis, the influence of this spirit
can be traced; nor was it confined merely to the immobile arts?the arts
of arrested movement?but its influence was to be seen also in the great
Gr?co-Roman masques which were the constant amusement of the gay courts
of the time, and in the public pomps and processions with which the
citizens of big commercial towns were wont to greet the princes that
chanced to visit them; pageants, by the way, which were considered so
important that large prints were made of them and published?a fact which
is a proof of the general interest at the time in matters of such kind., And this use of arch?ology in shows, so far from being a bit of priggish
pedantry, is in every way legitimate and beautiful., For the stage is not
merely the meeting-place of all the arts, but is also the return of art
to life., Sometimes in an arch?ological novel the use of strange and
obsolete terms seems to hide the reality beneath the learning, and I dare
say that many of the readers of _Notre Dame de Paris_ have been much
puzzled over the meaning of such expressions as _la casaque ?, mahoitres_,
_les voulgiers_, _le gallimard tach?, d?encre_, _les craaquiniers_, and
the like; but with the stage how different it is!, The ancient world
wakes from its sleep, and history moves as a pageant before our eyes,
without obliging us to have recourse to a dictionary or an encyclop?dia
for the perfection of our enjoyment., Indeed, there is not the slightest
necessity that the public should know the authorities for the mounting of
any piece., From such materials, for instance, as the disk of Theodosius,
materials with which the majority of people are probably not very
familiar, Mr. E. W. Godwin, one of the most artistic spirits of this
century in England, created the marvellous loveliness of the first act of
_Claudian_, and showed us the life of Byzantium in the fourth century,
not by a dreary lecture and a set of grimy casts, not by a novel which
requires a glossary to explain it, but by the visible presentation before
us of all the glory of that great town., And while the costumes were true
to the smallest points of colour and design, yet the details were not
assigned that abnormal importance which they must necessarily be given in
a piecemeal lecture, but were subordinated to the rules of lofty
composition and the unity of artistic effect., Mr. Symonds, speaking of
that great picture of Mantegna?s, now in Hampton Court, says that the
artist has converted an antiquarian motive into a theme for melodies of
line., The same could have been said with equal justice of Mr. Godwin?s
scene., Only the foolish called it pedantry, only those who would neither
look nor listen spoke of the passion of the play being killed by its
paint., It was in reality a scene not merely perfect in its
picturesqueness, but absolutely dramatic also, getting rid of any
necessity for tedious descriptions, and showing us, by the colour and
character of Claudian?s dress, and the dress of his attendants, the whole
nature and life of the man, from what school of philosophy he affected,
down to what horses he backed on the turf., And indeed arch?ology is only really delightful when transfused into some
form of art., I have no desire to underrate the services of laborious
scholars, but I feel that the use Keats made of Lempri?re?s Dictionary is
of far more value to us than Professor Max M?ller?s treatment of the same
mythology as a disease of language., Better _Endymion_ than any theory,
however sound, or, as in the present instance, unsound, of an epidemic
among adjectives!, And who does not feel that the chief glory of
Piranesi?s book on Vases is that it gave Keats the suggestion for his
?Ode on a Grecian Urn??, Art, and art only, can make arch?ology
beautiful; and the theatric art can use it most directly and most
vividly, for it can combine in one exquisite presentation the illusion of
actual life with the wonder of the unreal world., But the sixteenth
century was not merely the age of Vitruvius; it was the age of Vecellio
also., Every nation seems suddenly to have become interested in the dress
of its neighbours., Europe began to investigate its own clothes, and the
amount of books published on national costumes is quite extraordinary., At the beginning of the century the _Nuremberg Chronicle_, with its two
thousand illustrations, reached its fifth edition, and before the century
was over seventeen editions were published of Munster?s _Cosmography_., Besides these two books there were also the works of Michael Colyns, of
Hans Weigel, of Amman, and of Vecellio himself, all of them well
illustrated, some of the drawings in Vecellio being probably from the
hand of Titian., Nor was it merely from books and treatises that they acquired their
knowledge., The development of the habit of foreign travel, the increased
commercial intercourse between countries, and the frequency of diplomatic
missions, gave every nation many opportunities of studying the various
forms of contemporary dress., After the departure from England, for
instance, of the ambassadors from the Czar, the Sultan and the Prince of
Morocco, Henry the Eighth and his friends gave several masques in the
strange attire of their visitors., Later on London saw, perhaps too
often, the sombre splendour of the Spanish Court, and to Elizabeth came
envoys from all lands, whose dress, Shakespeare tells us, had an
important influence on English costume., And the interest was not confined merely to classical dress, or the dress
of foreign nations; there was also a good deal of research, amongst
theatrical people especially, into the ancient costume of England itself:
and when Shakespeare, in the prologue to one of his plays, expresses his
regret at being unable to produce helmets of the period, he is speaking
as an Elizabethan manager and not merely as an Elizabethan poet., At
Cambridge, for instance, during his day, a play of _Richard The Third_
was performed, in which the actors were attired in real dresses of the
time, procured from the great collection of historical costume in the
Tower, which was always open to the inspection of managers, and sometimes
placed at their disposal., And I cannot help thinking that this
performance must have been far more artistic, as regards costume, than
Garrick?s mounting of Shakespeare?s own play on the subject, in which he
himself appeared in a nondescript fancy dress, and everybody else in the
costume of the time of George the Third, Richmond especially being much
admired in the uniform of a young guardsman., For what is the use to the stage of that arch?ology which has so
strangely terrified the critics, but that it, and it alone, can give us
the architecture and apparel suitable to the time in which the action of
the play passes?, It enables us to see a Greek dressed like a Greek, and
an Italian like an Italian; to enjoy the arcades of Venice and the
balconies of Verona; and, if the play deals with any of the great eras in
our country?s history, to contemplate the age in its proper attire, and
the king in his habit as he lived., And I wonder, by the way, what Lord
Lytton would have said some time ago, at the Princess?s Theatre, had the
curtain risen on his father?s Brutus reclining in a Queen Anne chair,
attired in a flowing wig and a flowered dressing-gown, a costume which in
the last century was considered peculiarly appropriate to an antique
Roman!, For in those halcyon days of the drama no arch?ology troubled the
stage, or distressed the critics, and our inartistic grandfathers sat
peaceably in a stifling atmosphere of anachronisms, and beheld with the
calm complacency of the age of prose an Iachimo in powder and patches, a
Lear in lace ruffles, and a Lady Macbeth in a large crinoline., I can
understand arch?ology being attacked on the ground of its excessive
realism, but to attack it as pedantic seems to be very much beside the
mark., However, to attack it for any reason is foolish; one might just as
well speak disrespectfully of the equator., For arch?ology, being a
science, is neither good nor bad, but a fact simply., Its value depends
entirely on how it is used, and only an artist can use it., We look to
the arch?ologist for the materials, to the artist for the method., In designing the scenery and costumes for any of Shakespeare?s plays, the
first thing the artist has to settle is the best date for the drama., This should be determined by the general spirit of the play, more than by
any actual historical references which may occur in it., Most _Hamlets_ I
have seen were placed far too early., _Hamlet_ is essentially a scholar
of the Revival of Learning; and if the allusion to the recent invasion of
England by the Danes puts it back to the ninth century, the use of foils
brings it down much later., Once, however, that the date has been fixed,
then the arch?ologist is to supply us with the facts which the artist is
to convert into effects., It has been said that the anachronisms in the plays themselves show us
that Shakespeare was indifferent to historical accuracy, and a great deal
of capital has been made out of Hector?s indiscreet quotation from
Aristotle., Upon the other hand, the anachronisms are really few in
number, and not very important, and, had Shakespeare?s attention been
drawn to them by a brother artist, he would probably have corrected them., For, though they can hardly be called blemishes, they are certainly not
the great beauties of his work; or, at least, if they are, their
anachronistic charm cannot be emphasised unless the play is accurately
mounted according to its proper date., In looking at Shakespeare?s plays
as a whole, however, what is really remarkable is their extraordinary
fidelity as regards his personages and his plots., Many of his _dramatis
person?_ are people who had actually existed, and some of them might have
been seen in real life by a portion of his audience., Indeed the most
violent attack that was made on Shakespeare in his time was for his
supposed caricature of Lord Cobham., As for his plots, Shakespeare
constantly draws them either from authentic history, or from the old
ballads and traditions which served as history to the Elizabethan public,
and which even now no scientific historian would dismiss as absolutely
untrue., ...]",2

   For Faun and nymph are old and grey,
   Ah, leave the hills of Arcady!, This is the land where liberty
   Lit grave-browed Milton on his way,
   This modern world hath need of thee!, A land of ancient chivalry
   Where gentle Sidney saw the day,

   This England lacks some stronger lay,

   A beautiful and silent Sphinx has watched me through the shifting

   For silver moons are naught to her and naught to her the suns that
   reel., Red follows grey across the air, the waves of moonlight ebb and flow
   But with the Dawn she does not go and in the night-time she is there., Dawn follows Dawn and Nights grow old and all the while this curious
   cat
   Lies couching on the Chinese mat with eyes of satin rimmed with gold., Upon the mat she lies and leers and on the tawny throat of her
   Flutters the soft and silky fur or ripples to her pointed ears., Come forth, my lovely seneschal!, so somnolent, so statuesque!, Come forth you exquisite grotesque!, half woman and half animal!, Come forth my lovely languorous Sphinx!, and put your head upon my
   knee!, And let me stroke your throat and see your body spotted like the Lynx!, ...]",2
172,"[In the eyes of humanity
it should be a horrible thing for him to be there at all., This terror that seizes and dominates the child, as it seizes the grown
man also, is of course intensified beyond power of expression by the
solitary cellular system of our prisons., Every child is confined to its
cell for twenty-three hours out of the twenty-four., This is the
appalling thing., To shut up a child in a dimly-lit cell for twenty-three
hours out of the twenty-four is an example of the cruelty of stupidity., If an individual, parent or guardian, did this to a child he would be
severely punished., The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children
would take the matter up at once., There would be on all hands the utmost
detestation of whomsoever had been guilty of such cruelty., A heavy
sentence would undoubtedly follow conviction., But our own actual society
does worse itself, and to the child to be so treated by a strange
abstract force, of whose claims it has no cognizance, is much worse than
it would be to receive the same treatment from its father or mother, or
someone it knew., The inhuman treatment of a child is always inhuman, by
whomsoever it is inflicted., But inhuman treatment by Society is to the
child the more terrible because there is no appeal., A parent or guardian
can be moved, and let out the child from the dark lonely room in which
it is confined., But a warder cannot., Most warders are very fond of
children., But the system prohibits them from rendering the child any
assistance., Should they do so, as Warder Martin did, they are dismissed., The second thing from which a child suffers in prison is hunger., The
food that is given to it consists of a piece of usually badly-baked
prison bread and a tin of water for breakfast at half-past seven., At
twelve o'clock it gets dinner, composed of a tin of coarse Indian meal
stirabout, and at half-past five it gets a piece of dry bread and a tin
of water for its supper., This diet in the case of a strong grown man is
always productive of illness of some kind, chiefly of course
diarrhoea, with its attendant weakness., In fact in a big prison
astringent medicines are served out regularly by the warders as a matter
of course., In the case of a child, the child is, as a rule, incapable of
eating the food at all., Anyone who knows anything about children knows
how easily a child's digestion is upset by a fit of crying, or trouble
and mental distress of any kind., A child who has been crying all day
long, and perhaps half the night, in a lonely dimly-lit cell, and is
preyed upon by terror, simply cannot eat food of this coarse, horrible
kind., In the case of the little child to whom Warder Martin gave the
biscuits, the child was crying with hunger on Tuesday morning, and
utterly unable to eat the bread and water served to it for its
breakfast., Martin went out after the breakfasts had been served and
bought the few sweet biscuits for the child rather than see it starving., It was a beautiful action on his part, and was so recognised by the
child, who, utterly unconscious of the regulation of the Prison Board,
told one of the senior warders how kind this junior warder had been to
him., The result was, of course, a report and a dismissal., I know Martin extremely well, and I was under his charge for the last
seven weeks of my imprisonment., On his appointment at Reading he had
charge of Gallery C, in which I was confined, so I saw him constantly., I
was struck by the singular kindness and humanity of the way in which he
spoke to me and to the other prisoners., Kind words are much in prison,
and a pleasant ""Good morning"" or ""Good evening"" will make one as happy
as one can be in solitary confinement., He was always gentle and
considerate., I happen to know another case in which he showed great
kindness to one of the prisoners, and I have no hesitation in mentioning
it., One of the most horrible things in prison is the badness of the
sanitary arrangements., No prisoner is allowed under any circumstances to
leave his cell after half-past five p.m., If, consequently, he is
suffering from diarrhoea, he has to use his cell as a latrine, and
pass the night in a most fetid and unwholesome atmosphere., Some days
before my release Martin was going the rounds at half-past seven with
one of the senior warders for the purpose of collecting the oakum and
tools of the prisoners., A man just convicted, and suffering from
violent diarrhoea in consequence of the food, as is always the case,
asked this senior warder to allow him to empty the slops in his cell on
account of the horrible odour of the cell and the possibility of illness
again in the night., The senior warder refused absolutely; it was against
the rules., The man, as far as he was concerned, had to pass the night in
this dreadful condition., Martin, however, rather than see this wretched
man in such a loathsome predicament, said he would empty the man's slops
himself, and did so., A warder emptying a prisoner's slops is, of course,
against the rules, but Martin did this act of kindness to the man out of
the simple humanity of his nature, and the man was naturally most
grateful., As regards the children, a great deal has been talked and written lately
about the contaminating influence of prison on young children., What is
said is quite true., A child is utterly contaminated by prison life., But
the contaminating influence is not that of the prisoners., It is that of
the whole prison system--of the governor, the chaplain, the warders, the
lonely cell, the isolation, the revolting food, the rules of the Prison
Commissioners, the mode of discipline as it is termed, of the life., Every care is taken to isolate a child from the sight even of all
prisoners over sixteen years of age., Children sit behind a curtain in
chapel, and are sent to take exercise in small sunless yards--sometimes
a stone-yard, sometimes a yard at the back of the mills--rather than
that they should see the elder prisoners at exercise., But the only
really humanising influence in prison is the influence of the prisoners., Their cheerfulness under terrible circumstances, their sympathy for each
other, their humility, their gentleness, their pleasant smiles of
greeting when they meet each other, their complete acquiescence in their
punishments, are all quite wonderful, and I myself learnt many sound
lessons from them., I am not proposing that the children should not sit
behind a curtain in chapel, or that they should take exercise in a
corner of the common yard., I am merely pointing out that the bad
influence on children is not, and could never be, that of the prisoners,
but is, and will always remain, that of the prison system itself., There
is not a single man in Reading Gaol that would not gladly have done the
three children's punishment for them., When I saw them last it was on the
Tuesday following their conviction., I was taking exercise at half-past
eleven with about twelve other men, as the three children passed near
us, in charge of a warder, from the damp, dreary stone-yard in which
they had been at their exercise., I saw the greatest pity and sympathy in
the eyes of my companions as they looked at them., Prisoners are, as a
class, extremely kind and sympathetic to each other., Suffering and the
community of suffering makes people kind, and day after day as I tramped
the yard I used to feel with pleasure and comfort what Carlyle calls
somewhere ""the silent rhythmic charm of human companionship."", In this as
in all other things, philanthropists and people of that kind are astray., It is not the prisoners who need reformation., It is the prisons., Of course no child under fourteen years of age should be sent to prison
at all., It is an absurdity, and, like many absurdities, of absolutely
tragic results., If, however, they are to be sent to prison, during the
daytime they should be in a workshop or schoolroom with a warder., At
night they should sleep in a dormitory, with a night-warder to look
after them., They should be allowed exercise for at least three hours a
day., The dark, badly-ventilated, ill-smelling prison cells are dreadful
for a child, dreadful indeed for anyone., One is always breathing bad air
in prison., The food given to children should consist of tea and
bread-and-butter and soup., Prison soup is very good and wholesome., A
resolution of the House of Commons could settle the treatment of
children in half an hour., I hope you will use your influence to have
this done., The way that children are treated at present is really an
outrage on humanity and common-sense., It comes from stupidity., Let me draw attention now to another terrible thing that goes on in
English prisons, indeed in prisons all over the world where the system
of silence and cellular confinement is practised., I refer to the large
number of men who become insane or weak-minded in prison., In convict
prisons this is, of course, quite common; but in ordinary gaols also,
such as that I was confined in, it is to be found., About three months ago, I noticed amongst the prisoners who took
exercise with me a young man who seemed to me to be silly or
half-witted., Every prison of course has its half-witted clients, who
return again and again, and may be said to live in the prison., But this
young man struck me as being more than usually half-witted on account of
his silly grin and idiotic laughter to himself, and the peculiar
restlessness of his eternally twitching hands., He was noticed by all the
other prisoners on account of the strangeness of his conduct., From time
to time he did not appear at exercise, which showed me that he was being
punished by confinement to his cell., Finally, I discovered that he was
under observation, and being watched night and day by warders., When he
did appear at exercise, he always seemed hysterical, and used to walk
round crying or laughing., At chapel he had to sit right under the
observation of two warders, who carefully watched him all the time., Sometimes he would bury his head in his hands, an offence against the
chapel regulations, and his head would be immediately struck up by a
warder, so that he should keep his eyes fixed permanently in the
direction of the Communion-table., Sometimes he would cry--not making any
disturbance--but with tears streaming down his face and a hysterical
throbbing in the throat., Sometimes he would grin idiot-like to himself
and make faces., He was on more than one occasion sent out of chapel to
his cell, and of course he was continually punished., As the bench on
which I used to sit in chapel was directly behind the bench at the end
of which this unfortunate man was placed, I had full opportunity of
observing him., I also saw him, of course, at exercise continually, and I
saw that he was becoming insane, and was being treated as if he was
shamming., On Saturday week last, I was in my cell at about one o'clock occupied in
cleaning and polishing the tins I had been using for dinner., Suddenly I
was startled by the prison silence being broken by the most horrible and
revolting shrieks or rather howls, for at first I thought some animal
like a bull or a cow was being unskilfully slaughtered outside the
prison walls., I soon realised, however, that the howls proceeded from
the basement of the prison, and I knew that some wretched man was being
flogged., I need not say how hideous and terrible it was for me, and I
began to wonder who it was who was being punished in this revolting
manner., Suddenly it dawned upon me that they might be flogging this
unfortunate lunatic., My feelings on the subject need not be chronicled;
they have nothing to do with the question., ...]",2
173,"[It was always springtime once in my heart., My temperament
was akin to joy., I filled my life to the very brim with pleasure, as one
might fill a cup to the very brim with wine., Now I am approaching life
from a completely new standpoint, and even to conceive happiness is often
extremely difficult for me., I remember during my first term at Oxford
reading in Pater's _Renaissance_--that book which has had such strange
influence over my life--how Dante places low in the Inferno those who
wilfully live in sadness; and going to the college library and turning to
the passage in the _Divine Comedy_ where beneath the dreary marsh lie
those who were 'sullen in the sweet air,' saying for ever and ever
through their sighs--

I knew the church condemned _accidia_, but the whole idea seemed to me
quite fantastic, just the sort of sin, I fancied, a priest who knew
nothing about real life would invent., Nor could I understand how Dante,
who says that 'sorrow remarries us to God,' could have been so harsh to
those who were enamoured of melancholy, if any such there really were., I
had no idea that some day this would become to me one of the greatest
temptations of my life., While I was in Wandsworth prison I longed to die., It was my one desire., When after two months in the infirmary I was transferred here, and found
myself growing gradually better in physical health, I was filled with
rage., I determined to commit suicide on the very day on which I left
prison., After a time that evil mood passed away, and I made up my mind
to live, but to wear gloom as a king wears purple: never to smile again:
to turn whatever house I entered into a house of mourning: to make my
friends walk slowly in sadness with me: to teach them that melancholy is
the true secret of life: to maim them with an alien sorrow: to mar them
with my own pain., Now I feel quite differently., I see it would be both
ungrateful and unkind of me to pull so long a face that when my friends
came to see me they would have to make their faces still longer in order
to show their sympathy; or, if I desired to entertain them, to invite
them to sit down silently to bitter herbs and funeral baked meats., I
must learn how to be cheerful and happy., The last two occasions on which I was allowed to see my friends here, I
tried to be as cheerful as possible, and to show my cheerfulness, in
order to make them some slight return for their trouble in coming all the
way from town to see me., It is only a slight return, I know, but it is
the one, I feel certain, that pleases them most., I saw R--- for an hour
on Saturday week, and I tried to give the fullest possible expression of
the delight I really felt at our meeting., And that, in the views and
ideas I am here shaping for myself, I am quite right is shown to me by
the fact that now for the first time since my imprisonment I have a real
desire for life., There is before me so much to do, that I would regard it as a terrible
tragedy if I died before I was allowed to complete at any rate a little
of it., I see new developments in art and life, each one of which is a
fresh mode of perfection., I long to live so that I can explore what is
no less than a new world to me., Do you want to know what this new world
is?, I think you can guess what it is., It is the world in which I have
been living., Sorrow, then, and all that it teaches one, is my new world., I used to live entirely for pleasure., I shunned suffering and sorrow of
every kind., I hated both., I resolved to ignore them as far as possible:
to treat them, that is to say, as modes of imperfection., They were not
part of my scheme of life., They had no place in my philosophy., My
mother, who knew life as a whole, used often to quote to me Goethe's
lines--written by Carlyle in a book he had given her years ago, and
translated by him, I fancy, also:--

They were the lines which that noble Queen of Prussia, whom Napoleon
treated with such coarse brutality, used to quote in her humiliation and
exile; they were the lines my mother often quoted in the troubles of her
later life., I absolutely declined to accept or admit the enormous truth
hidden in them., I could not understand it., I remember quite well how I
used to tell her that I did not want to eat my bread in sorrow, or to
pass any night weeping and watching for a more bitter dawn., I had no idea that it was one of the special things that the Fates had in
store for me: that for a whole year of my life, indeed, I was to do
little else., But so has my portion been meted out to me; and during the
last few months I have, after terrible difficulties and struggles, been
able to comprehend some of the lessons hidden in the heart of pain., Clergymen and people who use phrases without wisdom sometimes talk of
suffering as a mystery., It is really a revelation., One discerns things
one never discerned before., One approaches the whole of history from a
different standpoint., What one had felt dimly, through instinct, about
art, is intellectually and emotionally realised with perfect clearness of
vision and absolute intensity of apprehension., I now see that sorrow, being the supreme emotion of which man is capable,
is at once the type and test of all great art., What the artist is always
looking for is the mode of existence in which soul and body are one and
indivisible: in which the outward is expressive of the inward: in which
form reveals., Of such modes of existence there are not a few: youth and
the arts preoccupied with youth may serve as a model for us at one
moment: at another we may like to think that, in its subtlety and
sensitiveness of impression, its suggestion of a spirit dwelling in
external things and making its raiment of earth and air, of mist and city
alike, and in its morbid sympathy of its moods, and tones, and colours,
modern landscape art is realising for us pictorially what was realised in
such plastic perfection by the Greeks., Music, in which all subject is
absorbed in expression and cannot be separated from it, is a complex
example, and a flower or a child a simple example, of what I mean; but
sorrow is the ultimate type both in life and art., Behind joy and laughter there may be a temperament, coarse, hard and
callous., But behind sorrow there is always sorrow., Pain, unlike
pleasure, wears no mask., Truth in art is not any correspondence between
the essential idea and the accidental existence; it is not the
resemblance of shape to shadow, or of the form mirrored in the crystal to
the form itself; it is no echo coming from a hollow hill, any more than
it is a silver well of water in the valley that shows the moon to the
moon and Narcissus to Narcissus., Truth in art is the unity of a thing
with itself: the outward rendered expressive of the inward: the soul made
incarnate: the body instinct with spirit., For this reason there is no
truth comparable to sorrow., There are times when sorrow seems to me to
be the only truth., Other things may be illusions of the eye or the
appetite, made to blind the one and cloy the other, but out of sorrow
have the worlds been built, and at the birth of a child or a star there
is pain., More than this, there is about sorrow an intense, an extraordinary
reality., I have said of myself that I was one who stood in symbolic
relations to the art and culture of my age., There is not a single
wretched man in this wretched place along with me who does not stand in
symbolic relation to the very secret of life., For the secret of life is
suffering., It is what is hidden behind everything., When we begin to
live, what is sweet is so sweet to us, and what is bitter so bitter, that
we inevitably direct all our desires towards pleasures, and seek not
merely for a 'month or twain to feed on honeycomb,' but for all our years
to taste no other food, ignorant all the while that we may really be
starving the soul., I remember talking once on this subject to one of the most beautiful
personalities I have ever known: a woman, whose sympathy and noble
kindness to me, both before and since the tragedy of my imprisonment,
have been beyond power and description; one who has really assisted me,
though she does not know it, to bear the burden of my troubles more than
any one else in the whole world has, and all through the mere fact of her
existence, through her being what she is--partly an ideal and partly an
influence: a suggestion of what one might become as well as a real help
towards becoming it; a soul that renders the common air sweet, and makes
what is spiritual seem as simple and natural as sunlight or the sea: one
for whom beauty and sorrow walk hand in hand, and have the same message., On the occasion of which I am thinking I recall distinctly how I said to
her that there was enough suffering in one narrow London lane to show
that God did not love man, and that wherever there was any sorrow, though
but that of a child, in some little garden weeping over a fault that it
had or had not committed, the whole face of creation was completely
marred., I was entirely wrong., She told me so, but I could not believe
her., I was not in the sphere in which such belief was to be attained to., Now it seems to me that love of some kind is the only possible
explanation of the extraordinary amount of suffering that there is in the
world., I cannot conceive of any other explanation., I am convinced that
there is no other, and that if the world has indeed, as I have said, been
built of sorrow, it has been built by the hands of love, because in no
other way could the soul of man, for whom the world was made, reach the
full stature of its perfection., Pleasure for the beautiful body, but
pain for the beautiful soul., When I say that I am convinced of these things I speak with too much
pride., Far off, like a perfect pearl, one can see the city of God., It
is so wonderful that it seems as if a child could reach it in a summer's
day., And so a child could., But with me and such as me it is different., One can realise a thing in a single moment, but one loses it in the long
hours that follow with leaden feet., It is so difficult to keep 'heights
that the soul is competent to gain.', We think in eternity, but we move
slowly through time; and how slowly time goes with us who lie in prison I
need not tell again, nor of the weariness and despair that creep back
into one's cell, and into the cell of one's heart, with such strange
insistence that one has, as it were, to garnish and sweep one's house for
their coming, as for an unwelcome guest, or a bitter master, or a slave
whose slave it is one's chance or choice to be., And, though at present my friends may find it a hard thing to believe, it
is true none the less, that for them living in freedom and idleness and
comfort it is more easy to learn the lessons of humility than it is for
me, who begin the day by going down on my knees and washing the floor of
my cell., For prison life with its endless privations and restrictions
makes one rebellious., The most terrible thing about it is not that it
breaks one's heart--hearts are made to be broken--but that it turns one's
heart to stone., One sometimes feels that it is only with a front of
brass and a lip of scorn that one can get through the day at all., And he
who is in a state of rebellion cannot receive grace, to use the phrase of
which the Church is so fond--so rightly fond, I dare say--for in life as
in art the mood of rebellion closes up the channels of the soul, and
shuts out the airs of heaven., Yet I must learn these lessons here, if I
am to learn them anywhere, and must be filled with joy if my feet are on
the right road and my face set towards 'the gate which is called
beautiful,' though I may fall many times in the mire and often in the
mist go astray., This New Life, as through my love of Dante I like sometimes to call it,
is of course no new life at all, but simply the continuance, by means of
development, and evolution, of my former life., I remember when I was at
Oxford saying to one of my friends as we were strolling round Magdalen's
narrow bird-haunted walks one morning in the year before I took my
degree, that I wanted to eat of the fruit of all the trees in the garden
of the world, and that I was going out into the world with that passion
in my soul., And so, indeed, I went out, and so I lived., My only mistake
was that I confined myself so exclusively to the trees of what seemed to
me the sun-lit side of the garden, and shunned the other side for its
shadow and its gloom., Failure, disgrace, poverty, sorrow, despair,
suffering, tears even, the broken words that come from lips in pain,
remorse that makes one walk on thorns, conscience that condemns, self-
abasement that punishes, the misery that puts ashes on its head, the
anguish that chooses sack-cloth for its raiment and into its own drink
puts gall:--all these were things of which I was afraid., And as I had
determined to know nothing of them, I was forced to taste each of them in
turn, to feed on them, to have for a season, indeed, no other food at
all., I don't regret for a single moment having lived for pleasure., I did it
to the full, as one should do everything that one does., There was no
pleasure I did not experience., I threw the pearl of my soul into a cup
of wine., I went down the primrose path to the sound of flutes., I lived
on honeycomb., But to have continued the same life would have been wrong
because it would have been limiting., I had to pass on., The other half
of the garden had its secrets for me also., Of course all this is
foreshadowed and prefigured in my books., ...]",2
174,"[I have a right to share in sorrow, and he who can look at the loveliness
of the world and share its sorrow, and realise something of the wonder of
both, is in immediate contact with divine things, and has got as near to
God's secret as any one can get., Perhaps there may come into my art also, no less than into my life, a
still deeper note, one of greater unity of passion, and directness of
impulse., Not width but intensity is the true aim of modern art., We are
no longer in art concerned with the type., It is with the exception that
we have to do., I cannot put my sufferings into any form they took, I
need hardly say., Art only begins where Imitation ends, but something
must come into my work, of fuller memory of words perhaps, of richer
cadences, of more curious effects, of simpler architectural order, of
some aesthetic quality at any rate., When Marsyas was 'torn from the scabbard of his limbs'--_della vagina
della membre sue_, to use one of Dante's most terrible Tacitean
phrases--he had no more song, the Greek said., Apollo had been victor., The lyre had vanquished the reed., But perhaps the Greeks were mistaken., I hear in much modern Art the cry of Marsyas., It is bitter in
Baudelaire, sweet and plaintive in Lamartine, mystic in Verlaine., It is
in the deferred resolutions of Chopin's music., It is in the discontent
that haunts Burne-Jones's women., Even Matthew Arnold, whose song of
Callicles tells of 'the triumph of the sweet persuasive lyre,' and the
'famous final victory,' in such a clear note of lyrical beauty, has not a
little of it; in the troubled undertone of doubt and distress that haunts
his verses, neither Goethe nor Wordsworth could help him, though he
followed each in turn, and when he seeks to mourn for _Thyrsis_ or to
sing of the _Scholar Gipsy_, it is the reed that he has to take for the
rendering of his strain., But whether or not the Phrygian Faun was
silent, I cannot be., Expression is as necessary to me as leaf and
blossoms are to the black branches of the trees that show themselves
above the prison walls and are so restless in the wind., Between my art
and the world there is now a wide gulf, but between art and myself there
is none., I hope at least that there is none., To each of us different fates are meted out., My lot has been one of
public infamy, of long imprisonment, of misery, of ruin, of disgrace, but
I am not worthy of it--not yet, at any rate., I remember that I used to
say that I thought I could bear a real tragedy if it came to me with
purple pall and a mask of noble sorrow, but that the dreadful thing about
modernity was that it put tragedy into the raiment of comedy, so that the
great realities seemed commonplace or grotesque or lacking in style., It
is quite true about modernity., It has probably always been true about
actual life., It is said that all martyrdoms seemed mean to the looker
on., The nineteenth century is no exception to the rule., Everything about my tragedy has been hideous, mean, repellent, lacking in
style; our very dress makes us grotesque., We are the zanies of sorrow., We are clowns whose hearts are broken., We are specially designed to
appeal to the sense of humour., On November 13th, 1895, I was brought
down here from London., From two o'clock till half-past two on that day I
had to stand on the centre platform of Clapham Junction in convict dress,
and handcuffed, for the world to look at., I had been taken out of the
hospital ward without a moment's notice being given to me., Of all
possible objects I was the most grotesque., When people saw me they
laughed., Each train as it came up swelled the audience., Nothing could
exceed their amusement., That was, of course, before they knew who I was., As soon as they had been informed they laughed still more., For half an
hour I stood there in the grey November rain surrounded by a jeering mob., For a year after that was done to me I wept every day at the same hour
and for the same space of time., That is not such a tragic thing as
possibly it sounds to you., To those who are in prison tears are a part
of every day's experience., A day in prison on which one does not weep is
a day on which one's heart is hard, not a day on which one's heart is
happy., Well, now I am really beginning to feel more regret for the people who
laughed than for myself., Of course when they saw me I was not on my
pedestal, I was in the pillory., But it is a very unimaginative nature
that only cares for people on their pedestals., A pedestal may be a very
unreal thing., A pillory is a terrific reality., They should have known
also how to interpret sorrow better., I have said that behind sorrow
there is always sorrow., It were wiser still to say that behind sorrow
there is always a soul., And to mock at a soul in pain is a dreadful
thing., In the strangely simple economy of the world people only get what
they give, and to those who have not enough imagination to penetrate the
mere outward of things, and feel pity, what pity can be given save that
of scorn?, I write this account of the mode of my being transferred here simply that
it should be realised how hard it has been for me to get anything out of
my punishment but bitterness and despair., I have, however, to do it, and
now and then I have moments of submission and acceptance., All the spring
may be hidden in the single bud, and the low ground nest of the lark may
hold the joy that is to herald the feet of many rose-red dawns., So
perhaps whatever beauty of life still remains to me is contained in some
moment of surrender, abasement, and humiliation., I can, at any rate,
merely proceed on the lines of my own development, and, accepting all
that has happened to me, make myself worthy of it., People used to say of me that I was too individualistic., I must be far
more of an individualist than ever I was., I must get far more out of
myself than ever I got, and ask far less of the world than ever I asked., Indeed, my ruin came not from too great individualism of life, but from
too little., The one disgraceful, unpardonable, and to all time
contemptible action of my life was to allow myself to appeal to society
for help and protection., To have made such an appeal would have been
from the individualist point of view bad enough, but what excuse can
there ever be put forward for having made it?, Of course once I had put
into motion the forces of society, society turned on me and said, 'Have
you been living all this time in defiance of my laws, and do you now
appeal to those laws for protection?, You shall have those laws exercised
to the full., You shall abide by what you have appealed to.', The result
is I am in gaol., Certainly no man ever fell so ignobly, and by such
ignoble instruments, as I did., The Philistine element in life is not the failure to understand art., Charming people, such as fishermen, shepherds, ploughboys, peasants and
the like, know nothing about art, and are the very salt of the earth., He
is the Philistine who upholds and aids the heavy, cumbrous, blind,
mechanical forces of society, and who does not recognise dynamic force
when he meets it either in a man or a movement., People thought it dreadful of me to have entertained at dinner the evil
things of life, and to have found pleasure in their company., But then,
from the point of view through which I, as an artist in life, approach
them they were delightfully suggestive and stimulating., The danger was
half the excitement., ., ., ., My business as an artist was with Ariel., I
set myself to wrestle with Caliban., ., ., ., A great friend of mine--a friend of ten years' standing--came to see me
some time ago, and told me that he did not believe a single word of what
was said against me, and wished me to know that he considered me quite
innocent, and the victim of a hideous plot., I burst into tears at what
he said, and told him that while there was much amongst the definite
charges that was quite untrue and transferred to me by revolting malice,
still that my life had been full of perverse pleasures, and that unless
he accepted that as a fact about me and realised it to the full I could
not possibly be friends with him any more, or ever be in his company., It
was a terrible shock to him, but we are friends, and I have not got his
friendship on false pretences., Emotional forces, as I say somewhere in _Intentions_, are as limited in
extent and duration as the forces of physical energy., The little cup
that is made to hold so much can hold so much and no more, though all the
purple vats of Burgundy be filled with wine to the brim, and the treaders
stand knee-deep in the gathered grapes of the stony vineyards of Spain., There is no error more common than that of thinking that those who are
the causes or occasions of great tragedies share in the feelings suitable
to the tragic mood: no error more fatal than expecting it of them., The
martyr in his 'shirt of flame' may be looking on the face of God, but to
him who is piling the faggots or loosening the logs for the blast the
whole scene is no more than the slaying of an ox is to the butcher, or
the felling of a tree to the charcoal burner in the forest, or the fall
of a flower to one who is mowing down the grass with a scythe., Great
passions are for the great of soul, and great events can be seen only by
those who are on a level with them., * * * * *

I know of nothing in all drama more incomparable from the point of view
of art, nothing more suggestive in its subtlety of observation, than
Shakespeare's drawing of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern., They are Hamlet's
college friends., They have been his companions., They bring with them
memories of pleasant days together., At the moment when they come across
him in the play he is staggering under the weight of a burden intolerable
to one of his temperament., The dead have come armed out of the grave to
impose on him a mission at once too great and too mean for him., He is a
dreamer, and he is called upon to act., ...]",2
175,"[The warders stripped him of his clothes,
                 And gave him to the flies:
               They mocked the swollen purple throat,
                 And the stark and staring eyes:
               And with laughter loud they heaped the shroud
                 In which the convict lies., The Chaplain would not kneel to pray
                 By his dishonoured grave:
               Nor mark it with that blessed Cross
                 That Christ for sinners gave,
               Because the man was one of those
                 Whom Christ came down to save., Yet all is well; he has but passed
                 To  Life's appointed bourne:
               And alien tears will fill for him
                 Pity's long-broken urn,

                 And outcasts always mourn., V

               I know not whether Laws be right,
                 Or whether Laws be wrong;
               All that we know who lie in gaol
                 Is that the wall is strong;
               And that each day is like a year,
                 A year whose days are long., But this I know, that every Law
                 That men have made for Man,
               Since first Man took His brother's life,
                 And the sad world began,
               But straws the wheat and saves the chaff
                 With a most evil fan., This too I know- and wise it were
                 If each could know the same-
               That every prison that men build
                 Is built with bricks of shame,
               And bound with bars lest Christ should see
                 How men their brothers maim., With bars they blur the gracious moon,
                 And blind the goodly sun:
               And the do well to hide their Hell,
                 For in it things are done
               That Son of things nor son of Man
                 Ever should look upon!, The vilest deeds like poison weeds
                 Bloom well in prison-air:
               It is only what is good in Man
                 That wastes and withers there:
               Pale Anguish keeps the heavy gate,
                 And the warder is Despair., For they starve the little frightened child
                 Till it weeps both night and day:
               And they scourge the weak, and flog the fool,
                 And gibe the old and gray,
               And some grow mad, and all grow bad,
                 And none a word may say., Each narrow cell in which we dwell
                 Is a foul and dark latrine,
               And the fetid breath of living Death
                 Chokes up each grated screen,
               And all, but Lust, is turned to dust
                 In Humanity's machine., The brackish water that we drink
                 Creeps with a loathsome slime,
               And the bitter bread they weigh in scales
                 Is full of chalk and lime,
               And Sleep will not lie down, but walks
                 Wild-eyed, and cries to Time., But though lean Hunger and green Thirst
                 Like asp with adder fight,
               We have little care of prison fare,
                 For what chills and kills outright
               Is that every stone one lifts by day
                 Becomes one's heart by night., With midnight always in one's heart,
                 And twilight in one's cell,
               We turn the crank, or tear the rope,
                 Each in his separate Hell,
               And the silence is more awful far
                 Than the sound of a brazen bell., And never a human voice comes near
                 To speak a gentle word:
               And the eye that watches through the door
                 Is pitiless and hard:
               And by all forgot, we rot and rot,
                 With soul and body marred., And thus we rust Life's iron chain
                 Degraded and alone:
               And some men curse, and some men weep,
                 And some men make no moan:
               But God's eternal Laws are kind
                 And break the heart of stone., And every human heart that breaks,
                 In prison-cell or yard,
               Is as that broken box that gave
                 Its treasure to the Lord,
               And filled the unclean leper's house
                 With the scent of costliest nard., Ah!, happy they whose hearts can break
                 And peace of pardon win!, How else may man make straight his plan
                 And cleanse his soul from Sin?, How else but through a broken heart
                 May Lord Christ enter in?, And he of the swollen purple throat,
                 And the stark and staring eyes,
               Waits for the holy hands that took
                 The Thief to Paradise;
               And a broken and a contrite heart
                 The Lord will not despise., The man in red who reads the Law
                 Gave him three weeks of life,
               Three little weeks in which to heal
                 His soul of his soul's strife,
               And cleanse from every blot of blood
                 The hand that held the knife., And with tears of blood he cleansed the hand,
                 The hand that held the steel:
               For only blood can wipe out blood,
                 And only tears can heal:
               And the crimson stain that was of Cain
                 Became Christ's snow-white seal., VI

               In Reading gaol by Reading town
                 There is a pit of shame,

                 Eaten by teeth of flame,
               In a burning winding-sheet he lies,
                 And his grave has got no name., And there, till Christ call forth the dead,
                 In silence let him lie:
               No need to waste the foolish tear,
                 Or heave the windy sigh:
               The man had killed the thing he loved,
                 And so he had to die., And all men kill the thing they love,
                 By all let this be heard,
               Some do it with a bitter look,
                 Some with a flattering word,
               The coward does it with a kiss,

It is only in the best Greek gems, on the silver coins of Syracuse,
or among the marble figures of the Parthenon frieze, that one can
find the ideal representation of the marvellous beauty of that face
which laughed through the leaves last night as Hester Grazebrook., Pure Greek it is, with the grave low forehead, the exquisitely
arched brow; the noble chiselling of the mouth, shaped as if it
were the mouthpiece of an instrument of music; the supreme and
splendid curve of the cheek; the augustly pillared throat which
bears it all:  it is Greek, because the lines which compose it are
so definite and so strong, and yet so exquisitely harmonized that
the effect is one of simple loveliness purely:  Greek, because its
essence and its quality, as is the quality of music and of
architecture, is that of beauty based on absolutely mathematical
laws., But while art remains dumb and immobile in its passionless
serenity, with the beauty of this face it is different:  the grey
eyes lighten into blue or deepen into violet as fancy succeeds
fancy; the lips become flower-like in laughter or, tremulous as a
bird's wing, mould themselves at last into the strong and bitter
moulds of pain or scorn., And then motion comes, and the statue
wakes into life., But the life is not the ordinary life of common
days; it is life with a new value given to it, the value of art:
and the charm to me of Hester Grazebrook's acting in the first
scene of the play last night was that mingling of classic grace
with absolute reality which is the secret of all beautiful art, of
the plastic work of the Greeks and of the pictures of Jean Francois
Millet equally., I do not think that the sovereignty and empire of women's beauty
has at all passed away, though we may no longer go to war for them
as the Greeks did for the daughter of Leda., The greatest empire
still remains for them--the empire of art., And, indeed, this
wonderful face, seen last night for the first time in America, has
filled and permeated with the pervading image of its type the whole
of our modern art in England., Last century it was the romantic
type which dominated in art, the type loved by Reynolds and
Gainsborough, of wonderful contrasts of colour, of exquisite and
varying charm of expression, but without that definite plastic
feeling which divides classic from romantic work., This type
degenerated into mere facile prettiness in the hands of lesser
masters, and, in protest against it, was created by the hands of
the Pre-Raphaelites a new type, with its rare combination of Greek
form with Florentine mysticism., But this mysticism becomes over-
strained and a burden, rather than an aid to expression, and a
desire for the pure Hellenic joy and serenity came in its place;
and in all our modern work, in the paintings of such men as Albert
Moore and Leighton and Whistler, we can trace the influence of this
single face giving fresh life and inspiration in the form of a new
artistic ideal., SLAVES OF FASHION



Miss Leffler-Arnim's statement, in a lecture delivered recently at
St. Saviour's Hospital, that ""she had heard of instances where
ladies were so determined not to exceed the fashionable measurement
that they had actually held on to a cross-bar while their maids
fastened the fifteen-inch corset,"" has excited a good deal of
incredulity, but there is nothing really improbable in it., From
the sixteenth century to our own day there is hardly any form of
torture that has not been inflicted on girls, and endured by women,
in obedience to the dictates of an unreasonable and monstrous
Fashion., ""In order to obtain a real Spanish figure,"" says
Montaigne, ""what a Gehenna of suffering will not women endure,
drawn in and compressed by great coches entering the flesh; nay,
sometimes they even die thereof!"", ""A few days after my arrival at
school,"" Mrs. Somerville tells us in her memoirs, ""although
perfectly straight and well made, I was enclosed in stiff stays,
with a steel busk in front; while above my frock, bands drew my
shoulders back till the shoulder-blades met., Then a steel rod with
a semi-circle, which went under my chin, was clasped to the steel
busk in my stays., In this constrained state I and most of the
younger girls had to prepare our lessons""; and in the life of Miss
Edgeworth we read that, being sent to a certain fashionable
establishment, ""she underwent all the usual tortures of back-
boards, iron collars and dumbs, and also (because she was a very
tiny person) the unusual one of being hung by the neck to draw out
the muscles and increase the growth,"" a signal failure in her case., Indeed, instances of absolute mutilation and misery are so common
in the past that it is unnecessary to multiply them; but it is
really sad to think that in our own day a civilized woman can hang
on to a cross-bar while her maid laces her waist into a fifteen-
inch circle., To begin with, the waist is not a circle at all, but
an oval; nor can there be any greater error than to imagine that an
unnaturally small waist gives an air of grace, or even of
slightness, to the whole figure., Its effect, as a rule, is simply
to exaggerate the width of the shoulders and the hips; and those
whose figures possess that stateliness which is called stoutness by
the vulgar, convert what is a quality into a defect by yielding to
the silly edicts of Fashion on the subject of tight-lacing., The
fashionable English waist, also, is not merely far too small, and
consequently quite out of proportion to the rest of the figure, but
it is worn far too low down., I use the expression ""worn""
advisedly, for a waist nowadays seems to be regarded as an article
of apparel to be put on when and where one likes., A long waist
always implies shortness of the lower limbs, and, from the artistic
point of view, has the effect of diminishing the height; and I am
glad to see that many of the most charming women in Paris are
returning to the idea of the Directoire style of dress., This style
is not by any means perfect, but at least it has the merit of
indicating the proper position of the waist., I feel quite sure
that all English women of culture and position will set their faces
against such stupid and dangerous practices as are related by Miss
Leffler-Arnim., Fashion's motto is:  Il faut souffrir pour etre
belle; but the motto of art and of common-sense is:  Il faut etre
bete pour souffrir., Talking of Fashion, a critic in the Pall Mall Gazelle expresses his
surprise that I should have allowed an illustration of a hat,
covered with ""the bodies of dead birds,"" to appear in the first
number of the Woman's World; and as I have received many letters on
the subject, it is only right that I should state my exact position
in the matter., Fashion is such an essential part of the mundus
muliebris of our day, that it seems to me absolutely necessary that
its growth, development, and phases should be duly chronicled; and
the historical and practical value of such a record depends
entirely upon its perfect fidelity to fact., ...]",2
176,"[They said it so often and so tediously that, at
last, the Church has begun to say it., One hears it now from every
pulpit., It is perfectly true., Property not merely has duties, but has
so many duties that its possession to any large extent is a bore., It
involves endless claims upon one, endless attention to business, endless
bother., If property had simply pleasures, we could stand it; but its
duties make it unbearable., In the interest of the rich we must get rid
of it., The virtues of the poor may be readily admitted, and are much to
be regretted., We are often told that the poor are grateful for charity., Some of them are, no doubt, but the best amongst the poor are never
grateful., They are ungrateful, discontented, disobedient, and
rebellious., They are quite right to be so., Charity they feel to be a
ridiculously inadequate mode of partial restitution, or a sentimental
dole, usually accompanied by some impertinent attempt on the part of the
sentimentalist to tyrannise over their private lives., Why should they be
grateful for the crumbs that fall from the rich man?s table?, They should
be seated at the board, and are beginning to know it., As for being
discontented, a man who would not be discontented with such surroundings
and such a low mode of life would be a perfect brute., Disobedience, in
the eyes of anyone who has read history, is man?s original virtue., It is
through disobedience that progress has been made, through disobedience
and through rebellion., Sometimes the poor are praised for being thrifty., But to recommend thrift to the poor is both grotesque and insulting., It
is like advising a man who is starving to eat less., For a town or
country labourer to practise thrift would be absolutely immoral., Man
should not be ready to show that he can live like a badly-fed animal., He
should decline to live like that, and should either steal or go on the
rates, which is considered by many to be a form of stealing., As for
begging, it is safer to beg than to take, but it is finer to take than to
beg., No: a poor man who is ungrateful, unthrifty, discontented, and
rebellious, is probably a real personality, and has much in him., He is
at any rate a healthy protest., As for the virtuous poor, one can pity
them, of course, but one cannot possibly admire them., They have made
private terms with the enemy, and sold their birthright for very bad
pottage., They must also be extraordinarily stupid., I can quite
understand a man accepting laws that protect private property, and admit
of its accumulation, as long as he himself is able under those conditions
to realise some form of beautiful and intellectual life., But it is
almost incredible to me how a man whose life is marred and made hideous
by such laws can possibly acquiesce in their continuance., However, the explanation is not really difficult to find., It is simply
this., Misery and poverty are so absolutely degrading, and exercise such
a paralysing effect over the nature of men, that no class is ever really
conscious of its own suffering., They have to be told of it by other
people, and they often entirely disbelieve them., What is said by great
employers of labour against agitators is unquestionably true., Agitators
are a set of interfering, meddling people, who come down to some
perfectly contented class of the community, and sow the seeds of
discontent amongst them., That is the reason why agitators are so
absolutely necessary., Without them, in our incomplete state, there would
be no advance towards civilisation., Slavery was put down in America, not
in consequence of any action on the part of the slaves, or even any
express desire on their part that they should be free., It was put down
entirely through the grossly illegal conduct of certain agitators in
Boston and elsewhere, who were not slaves themselves, nor owners of
slaves, nor had anything to do with the question really., It was,
undoubtedly, the Abolitionists who set the torch alight, who began the
whole thing., And it is curious to note that from the slaves themselves
they received, not merely very little assistance, but hardly any sympathy
even; and when at the close of the war the slaves found themselves free,
found themselves indeed so absolutely free that they were free to starve,
many of them bitterly regretted the new state of things., To the thinker,
the most tragic fact in the whole of the French Revolution is not that
Marie Antoinette was killed for being a queen, but that the starved
peasant of the Vend?e voluntarily went out to die for the hideous cause
of feudalism., It is clear, then, that no Authoritarian Socialism will do., For while
under the present system a very large number of people can lead lives of
a certain amount of freedom and expression and happiness, under an
industrial-barrack system, or a system of economic tyranny, nobody would
be able to have any such freedom at all., It is to be regretted that a
portion of our community should be practically in slavery, but to propose
to solve the problem by enslaving the entire community is childish., Every man must be left quite free to choose his own work., No form of
compulsion must be exercised over him., If there is, his work will not be
good for him, will not be good in itself, and will not be good for
others., And by work I simply mean activity of any kind., I hardly think that any Socialist, nowadays, would seriously propose that
an inspector should call every morning at each house to see that each
citizen rose up and did manual labour for eight hours., Humanity has got
beyond that stage, and reserves such a form of life for the people whom,
in a very arbitrary manner, it chooses to call criminals., But I confess
that many of the socialistic views that I have come across seem to me to
be tainted with ideas of authority, if not of actual compulsion., Of
course, authority and compulsion are out of the question., All
association must be quite voluntary., It is only in voluntary
associations that man is fine., But it may be asked how Individualism, which is now more or less
dependent on the existence of private property for its development, will
benefit by the abolition of such private property., The answer is very
simple., It is true that, under existing conditions, a few men who have
had private means of their own, such as Byron, Shelley, Browning, Victor
Hugo, Baudelaire, and others, have been able to realise their personality
more or less completely., Not one of these men ever did a single day?s
work for hire., They were relieved from poverty., They had an immense
advantage., The question is whether it would be for the good of
Individualism that such an advantage should be taken away., Let us
suppose that it is taken away., What happens then to Individualism?, How
will it benefit?, It will benefit in this way., Under the new conditions Individualism will
be far freer, far finer, and far more intensified than it is now., I am
not talking of the great imaginatively-realised Individualism of such
poets as I have mentioned, but of the great actual Individualism latent
and potential in mankind generally., For the recognition of private
property has really harmed Individualism, and obscured it, by confusing a
man with what he possesses., It has led Individualism entirely astray., It has made gain not growth its aim., So that man thought that the
important thing was to have, and did not know that the important thing is
to be., The true perfection of man lies, not in what man has, but in what
man is., Private property has crushed true Individualism, and set up an
Individualism that is false., It has debarred one part of the community
from being individual by starving them., It has debarred the other part
of the community from being individual by putting them on the wrong road,
and encumbering them., Indeed, so completely has man?s personality been
absorbed by his possessions that the English law has always treated
offences against a man?s property with far more severity than offences
against his person, and property is still the test of complete
citizenship., The industry necessary for the making money is also very
demoralising., In a community like ours, where property confers immense
distinction, social position, honour, respect, titles, and other pleasant
things of the kind, man, being naturally ambitious, makes it his aim to
accumulate this property, and goes on wearily and tediously accumulating
it long after he has got far more than he wants, or can use, or enjoy, or
perhaps even know of., Man will kill himself by overwork in order to
secure property, and really, considering the enormous advantages that
property brings, one is hardly surprised., One?s regret is that society
should be constructed on such a basis that man has been forced into a
groove in which he cannot freely develop what is wonderful, and
fascinating, and delightful in him?in which, in fact, he misses the true
pleasure and joy of living., He is also, under existing conditions, very
insecure., An enormously wealthy merchant may be?often is?at every moment
of his life at the mercy of things that are not under his control., If
the wind blows an extra point or so, or the weather suddenly changes, or
some trivial thing happens, his ship may go down, his speculations may go
wrong, and he finds himself a poor man, with his social position quite
gone., Now, nothing should be able to harm a man except himself., Nothing
should be able to rob a man at all., What a man really has, is what is in
him., What is outside of him should be a matter of no importance., With the abolition of private property, then, we shall have true,
beautiful, healthy Individualism., Nobody will waste his life in
accumulating things, and the symbols for things., One will live., To live
is the rarest thing in the world., Most people exist, that is all., It is a question whether we have ever seen the full expression of a
personality, except on the imaginative plane of art., In action, we never
have., C?sar, says Mommsen, was the complete and perfect man., But how
tragically insecure was C?sar!, ...]",2
177,"[?exotic,?, and ?unhealthy.?, There
is one other word that they use., That word is ?morbid.?, They do not use
it often., The meaning of the word is so simple that they are afraid of
using it., Still, they use it sometimes, and, now and then, one comes
across it in popular newspapers., It is, of course, a ridiculous word to
apply to a work of art., For what is morbidity but a mood of emotion or a
mode of thought that one cannot express?, The public are all morbid,
because the public can never find expression for anything., The artist is
never morbid., He expresses everything., He stands outside his subject,
and through its medium produces incomparable and artistic effects., To
call an artist morbid because he deals with morbidity as his
subject-matter is as silly as if one called Shakespeare mad because he
wrote ?King Lear.?, On the whole, an artist in England gains something by being attacked., His individuality is intensified., He becomes more completely himself., Of course, the attacks are very gross, very impertinent, and very
contemptible., But then no artist expects grace from the vulgar mind, or
style from the suburban intellect., Vulgarity and stupidity are two very
vivid facts in modern life., One regrets them, naturally., But there they
are., They are subjects for study, like everything else., And it is only
fair to state, with regard to modern journalists, that they always
apologise to one in private for what they have written against one in
public., Within the last few years two other adjectives, it may be mentioned, have
been added to the very limited vocabulary of art-abuse that is at the
disposal of the public., One is the word ?unhealthy,?, the other is the
word ?exotic.?, The latter merely expresses the rage of the momentary
mushroom against the immortal, entrancing, and exquisitely lovely orchid., It is a tribute, but a tribute of no importance., The word ?unhealthy,?, however, admits of analysis., It is a rather interesting word., In fact,
it is so interesting that the people who use it do not know what it
means., What does it mean?, What is a healthy, or an unhealthy work of art?, All
terms that one applies to a work of art, provided that one applies them
rationally, have reference to either its style or its subject, or to both
together., From the point of view of style, a healthy work of art is one
whose style recognises the beauty of the material it employs, be that
material one of words or of bronze, of colour or of ivory, and uses that
beauty as a factor in producing the ?sthetic effect., From the point of
view of subject, a healthy work of art is one the choice of whose subject
is conditioned by the temperament of the artist, and comes directly out
of it., In fine, a healthy work of art is one that has both perfection
and personality., Of course, form and substance cannot be separated in a
work of art; they are always one., But for purposes of analysis, and
setting the wholeness of ?sthetic impression aside for a moment, we can
intellectually so separate them., An unhealthy work of art, on the other
hand, is a work whose style is obvious, old-fashioned, and common, and
whose subject is deliberately chosen, not because the artist has any
pleasure in it, but because he thinks that the public will pay him for
it., In fact, the popular novel that the public calls healthy is always a
thoroughly unhealthy production; and what the public call an unhealthy
novel is always a beautiful and healthy work of art., I need hardly say that I am not, for a single moment, complaining that
the public and the public press misuse these words., I do not see how,
with their lack of comprehension of what Art is, they could possibly use
them in the proper sense., I am merely pointing out the misuse; and as
for the origin of the misuse and the meaning that lies behind it all, the
explanation is very simple., It comes from the barbarous conception of
authority., It comes from the natural inability of a community corrupted
by authority to understand or appreciate Individualism., In a word, it
comes from that monstrous and ignorant thing that is called Public
Opinion, which, bad and well-meaning as it is when it tries to control
action, is infamous and of evil meaning when it tries to control Thought
or Art., Indeed, there is much more to be said in favour of the physical force of
the public than there is in favour of the public?s opinion., The former
may be fine., The latter must be foolish., It is often said that force is
no argument., That, however, entirely depends on what one wants to prove., Many of the most important problems of the last few centuries, such as
the continuance of personal government in England, or of feudalism in
France, have been solved entirely by means of physical force., The very
violence of a revolution may make the public grand and splendid for a
moment., It was a fatal day when the public discovered that the pen is
mightier than the paving-stone, and can be made as offensive as the
brickbat., They at once sought for the journalist, found him, developed
him, and made him their industrious and well-paid servant., It is greatly
to be regretted, for both their sakes., Behind the barricade there may be
much that is noble and heroic., But what is there behind the
leading-article but prejudice, stupidity, cant, and twaddle?, And when
these four are joined together they make a terrible force, and constitute
the new authority., In old days men had the rack., Now they have the press., That is an
improvement certainly., But still it is very bad, and wrong, and
demoralising., Somebody?was it Burke?, ?called journalism the fourth
estate., That was true at the time, no doubt., But at the present moment
it really is the only estate., It has eaten up the other three., The
Lords Temporal say nothing, the Lords Spiritual have nothing to say, and
the House of Commons has nothing to say and says it., We are dominated by
Journalism., In America the President reigns for four years, and
Journalism governs for ever and ever., Fortunately in America Journalism
has carried its authority to the grossest and most brutal extreme., As a
natural consequence it has begun to create a spirit of revolt., People
are amused by it, or disgusted by it, according to their temperaments., But it is no longer the real force it was., It is not seriously treated., In England, Journalism, not, except in a few well-known instances, having
been carried to such excesses of brutality, is still a great factor, a
really remarkable power., The tyranny that it proposes to exercise over
people?s private lives seems to me to be quite extraordinary., The fact
is, that the public have an insatiable curiosity to know everything,
except what is worth knowing., Journalism, conscious of this, and having
tradesman-like habits, supplies their demands., In centuries before ours
the public nailed the ears of journalists to the pump., That was quite
hideous., In this century journalists have nailed their own ears to the
keyhole., That is much worse., And what aggravates the mischief is that
the journalists who are most to blame are not the amusing journalists who
write for what are called Society papers., The harm is done by the
serious, thoughtful, earnest journalists, who solemnly, as they are doing
at present, will drag before the eyes of the public some incident in the
private life of a great statesman, of a man who is a leader of political
thought as he is a creator of political force, and invite the public to
discuss the incident, to exercise authority in the matter, to give their
views, and not merely to give their views, but to carry them into action,
to dictate to the man upon all other points, to dictate to his party, to
dictate to his country; in fact, to make themselves ridiculous,
offensive, and harmful., The private lives of men and women should not be
told to the public., The public have nothing to do with them at all., In
France they manage these things better., There they do not allow the
details of the trials that take place in the divorce courts to be
published for the amusement or criticism of the public., All that the
public are allowed to know is that the divorce has taken place and was
granted on petition of one or other or both of the married parties
concerned., In France, in fact, they limit the journalist, and allow the
artist almost perfect freedom., Here we allow absolute freedom to the
journalist, and entirely limit the artist., English public opinion, that
is to say, tries to constrain and impede and warp the man who makes
things that are beautiful in effect, and compels the journalist to retail
things that are ugly, or disgusting, or revolting in fact, so that we
have the most serious journalists in the world, and the most indecent
newspapers., It is no exaggeration to talk of compulsion., There are
possibly some journalists who take a real pleasure in publishing horrible
things, or who, being poor, look to scandals as forming a sort of
permanent basis for an income., But there are other journalists, I feel
certain, men of education and cultivation, who really dislike publishing
these things, who know that it is wrong to do so, and only do it because
the unhealthy conditions under which their occupation is carried on
oblige them to supply the public with what the public wants, and to
compete with other journalists in making that supply as full and
satisfying to the gross popular appetite as possible., ...]",2
178,"[Pain is
not the ultimate mode of perfection., It is merely provisional and a
protest., It has reference to wrong, unhealthy, unjust surroundings., When the wrong, and the disease, and the injustice are removed, it will
have no further place., It will have done its work., It was a great work,
but it is almost over., Its sphere lessens every day., Nor will man miss it., For what man has sought for is, indeed, neither
pain nor pleasure, but simply Life., Man has sought to live intensely,
fully, perfectly., When he can do so without exercising restraint on
others, or suffering it ever, and his activities are all pleasurable to
him, he will be saner, healthier, more civilised, more himself., Pleasure
is Nature?s test, her sign of approval., When man is happy, he is in
harmony with himself and his environment., The new Individualism, for
whose service Socialism, whether it wills it or not, is working, will be
perfect harmony., It will be what the Greeks sought for, but could not,
except in Thought, realise completely, because they had slaves, and fed
them; it will be what the Renaissance sought for, but could not realise
completely except in Art, because they had slaves, and starved them., It
will be complete, and through it each man will attain to his perfection., The new Individualism is the new Hellenism., PROLOGUE., SCENE.--_A Russian Inn._

often as he likes, and no one can say him nay., PETER., That is about all they are good for; and there he stays, and has
not written a line to us for four months now--a good son that, eh?, MICH. Come, come, Father Peter, Dmitri's letters must have gone

snowstorm, and his wife and children starved afterwards when the hard
times came; but what business was it of mine?, I didn't make the world., Let God and the Czar look to it., And then the blight came, and the black
plague with it, and the priests couldn't bury the people fast enough,
and they lay dead on the roads--men and women both., But what business
was it of mine?, I didn't make the world., Let God and the Czar look to
it., Or two autumns ago, when the river overflowed on a sudden, and the
children's school was carried away and drowned every girl and boy in it., I didn't make the world--let God and the Czar look to it., MICH., But, Father Peter--

half his mother's fortune to bring with him to pay the lawyer folk of
Moscow., He has only written three times, and every time for more money., He got it, not at my wish, but at hers (_pointing to VERA_), and now for

by a moment?s folly, to lead again a decent life., I believed what she

the slightest notice of me., LADY HUNSTANTON., I assure you, dear, that the country has not that
effect at all., Why, it was from Melthorpe, which is only two miles from

occurrence perfectly., Poor Lord Belton died three days afterwards of
joy, or gout., I forget which., We had a large party staying here at the

danger., And danger has become so rare in modern life., LADY CAROLINE., As far as I can make out, the young women of the present
day seem to make it the sole object of their lives to be always playing
with fire., MRS. ALLONBY., The one advantage of playing with fire, Lady Caroline, is

of conjugal anxiety by this time!, Sir John is her fourth!, LORD ILLINGWORTH., So much marriage is certainly not becoming., Twenty
years of romance make a woman look like a ruin; but twenty years of
marriage make her something like a public building., MRS.

serious, except the thing that is worshipped., MRS. ALLONBY., And that should be man?, LORD ILLINGWORTH., Women kneel so gracefully; men don?t., MRS. ALLONBY., You are thinking of Lady Stutfield!, LORD ILLINGWORTH., I assure you I have not thought of Lady Stutfield for

fair-haired woman with no chin., MRS. ALLONBY., Ah, Ernest has a chin., He has a very strong chin, a
square chin., Ernest?s chin is far too square., LADY STUTFIELD., But do you really think a man?s chin can be too square?, I think a man should look very, very strong, and that his chin should be
quite, quite square., MRS. ALLONBY., Then you should certainly know Ernest, Lady Stutfield., It
is only fair to tell you beforehand he has got no conversation at all., LADY STUTFIELD., I adore silent men., MRS. ALLONBY., Oh, Ernest isn?t silent., He talks the whole time., But he
has got no conversation., What he talks about I don?t know., I haven?t
listened to him for years., LADY STUTFIELD., Have you never forgiven him then?, How sad that seems!, But all life is very, very sad, is it not?, MRS. ALLONBY., Life, Lady Stutfield, is simply a _mauvais quart d?heure_
made up of exquisite moments., LADY STUTFIELD., Yes, there are moments, certainly., But was it something
very, very wrong that Mr. Allonby did?, Did he become angry with you, and
say anything that was unkind or true?, MRS. ALLONBY., Oh dear, no., Ernest is invariably calm., That is one of
the reasons he always gets on my nerves., Nothing is so aggravating as
calmness., There is something positively brutal about the good temper of
most modern men., I wonder we women stand it as well as we do., LADY STUTFIELD., Yes; men?s good temper shows they are not so sensitive
as we are, not so finely strung., It makes a great barrier often between
husband and wife, does it not?, But I would so much like to know what was
the wrong thing Mr. Allonby did., MRS. ALLONBY., Well, I will tell you, if you solemnly promise to tell
everybody else., LADY STUTFIELD., Thank you, thank you., I will make a point of repeating
it., MRS. ALLONBY., When Ernest and I were engaged, he swore to me positively
on his knees that he had never loved any one before in the whole course
of his life., I was very young at the time, so I didn?t believe him, I
needn?t tell you., Unfortunately, however, I made no enquiries of any
kind till after I had been actually married four or five months., I found
out then that what he had told me was perfectly true., And that sort of
thing makes a man so absolutely uninteresting., LADY HUNSTANTON., My dear!, MRS. ALLONBY., Men always want to be a woman?s first love., That is their
clumsy vanity., We women have a more subtle instinct about things., What
we like is to be a man?s last romance., LADY STUTFIELD., I see what you mean., It?s very, very beautiful., LADY HUNSTANTON., My dear child, you don?t mean to tell me that you won?t
forgive your husband because he never loved any one else?, Did you ever
hear such a thing, Caroline?, I am quite surprised., LADY CAROLINE., Oh, women have become so highly educated, Jane, that
nothing should surprise us nowadays, except happy marriages., They
apparently are getting remarkably rare., MRS. ALLONBY., Oh, they?re quite out of date., LADY STUTFIELD., Except amongst the middle classes, I have been told., MRS. ALLONBY., How like the middle classes!, LADY STUTFIELD., Yes?is it not?, ?very, very like them., LADY CAROLINE., If what you tell us about the middle classes is true,
Lady Stutfield, it redounds greatly to their credit., It is much to be
regretted that in our rank of life the wife should be so persistently
frivolous, under the impression apparently that it is the proper thing to
be., It is to that I attribute the unhappiness of so many marriages we
all know of in society., MRS. ALLONBY., Do you know, Lady Caroline, I don?t think the frivolity of
the wife has ever anything to do with it., More marriages are ruined
nowadays by the common sense of the husband than by anything else., How
can a woman be expected to be happy with a man who insists on treating
her as if she were a perfectly rational being?, LADY HUNSTANTON., My dear!, MRS. ALLONBY., Man, poor, awkward, reliable, necessary man belongs to a
sex that has been rational for millions and millions of years., ...]",2

year in which my brother had his last exposure in the evening newspapers., LADY HUNSTANTON., Ah, I remember., That would be about four years ago., Of course, there were a great many people between the present Lord

died shortly afterwards, and she married almost immediately one of Lord
Ascot?s sons, who, I am told, beats her., LADY HUNSTANTON., Ah, that is in the family, dear, that is in the family., And there was also, I remember, a clergyman who wanted to be a lunatic,
or a lunatic who wanted to be a clergyman, I forget which, but I know the
Court of Chancery investigated the matter, and decided that he was quite
sane., And I saw him afterwards at poor Lord Plumstead?s with straws in
his hair, or something very odd about him., I can?t recall what., I often

Hunstanton?, LADY HUNSTANTON., No, dear, he was killed in the hunting field., Or was
it fishing, Caroline?, I forget., But George came in for everything., I
always tell him that no younger son has ever had such good luck as he has
had., MRS. ARBUTHNOT., Lady Hunstanton, I want to speak to Gerald at once., Might I see him?, Can he be sent for?, LADY HUNSTANTON., Certainly, dear., I will send one of the servants into
the dining-room to fetch him., I don?t know what keeps the gentlemen so
long., [_Rings bell_.], When I knew Lord Illingworth first as plain
George Harford, he was simply a very brilliant young man about town, with
not a penny of money except what poor dear Lady Cecilia gave him., She
was quite devoted to him., Chiefly, I fancy, because he was on bad terms
with his father., Oh, here is the dear Archdeacon., [_To Servant_.], It
doesn?t matter., [_Enter_ SIR JOHN _and_ DOCTOR DAUBENY., SIR JOHN _goes over to_ LADY

never enjoyed myself more., [_Sees_ MRS., ARBUTHNOT.], Ah, Mrs. Arbuthnot., LADY HUNSTANTON., [_To_ DOCTOR BAUBENY.], You see I have got Mrs.
Arbuthnot to come to me at last., THE ARCHDEACON., That is a great honour, Lady Hunstanton., Mrs. Daubeny
will be quite jealous of you., LADY HUNSTANTON., Ah, I am so sorry Mrs. Daubeny could not come with you
to-night., Headache as usual, I suppose., THE ARCHDEACON., Yes, Lady Hunstanton; a perfect martyr., But she is
happiest alone., She is happiest alone., LADY CAROLINE., [_To her husband_.], John!, [SIR JOHN _goes over to his

well, thank you, Lord Illingworth., But what a short time you have been
in the dining-room!, It seems as if we had only just left., LORD ILLINGWORTH., I was bored to death., Never opened my lips the whole
time., Absolutely longing to come in to you., MRS. ALLONBY., You should have., The American girl has been giving us a
lecture., LORD ILLINGWORTH., Really?, All Americans lecture, I believe., I suppose
it is something in their climate., What did she lecture about?, MRS. ALLONBY., Oh, Puritanism, of course., LORD ILLINGWORTH., I am going to convert her, am I not?, How long do you
give me?, ...]",2

happy with you., But a man can?t stay always with his mother., No chap

would have been proud to see me Lord Illingworth?s secretary., MRS. ARBUTHNOT., I do not think you would be suitable as a private
secretary to Lord Illingworth., You have no qualifications., LORD ILLINGWORTH., I don?t wish to seem to interfere for a moment, Mrs.
Arbuthnot, but as far as your last objection is concerned, I surely am
the best judge., And I can only tell you that your son has all the
qualifications I had hoped for., He has more, in fact, than I had even
thought of., Far more., [MRS. ARBUTHNOT _remains silent_.], Have you any

are quite by ourselves here., Whatever it is, I need not say I will not
repeat it., GERALD., Mother?, LORD ILLINGWORTH., If you would like to be alone with your son, I will
leave you., You may have some other reason you don?t wish me to hear., MRS. ARBUTHNOT., I have no other reason., LORD ILLINGWORTH., Then, my dear boy, we may look on the thing as

knew she would come round in the end., GERALD., My mother is awfully conscientious, Lord Illingworth, and I know
she doesn?t think I am educated enough to be your secretary., She is
perfectly right, too., I was fearfully idle when I was at school, and I
couldn?t pass an examination now to save my life., LORD ILLINGWORTH., My dear Gerald, examinations are of no value
whatsoever., If a man is a gentleman, he knows quite enough, and if he is
not a gentleman, whatever he knows is bad for him., GERALD., But I am so ignorant of the world, Lord Illingworth., LORD ILLINGWORTH., Don?t be afraid, Gerald., Remember that you?ve got on
your side the most wonderful thing in the world?youth!, There is nothing
like youth., The middle-aged are mortgaged to Life., The old are in
life?s lumber-room., But youth is the Lord of Life., Youth has a kingdom
waiting for it., Every one is born a king, and most people die in exile,
like most kings., To win back my youth, Gerald, there is nothing I
wouldn?t do?except take exercise, get up early, or be a useful member of
the community., GERALD., But you don?t call yourself old, Lord Illingworth?, LORD ILLINGWORTH., I am old enough to be your father, Gerald., GERALD., I don?t remember my father; he died years ago., LORD ILLINGWORTH., So Lady Hunstanton told me., GERALD., It is very curious, my mother never talks to me about my father., I sometimes think she must have married beneath her., LORD ILLINGWORTH., [_Winces slightly_.], Really?, [_Goes over and puts
his hand on_ GERALD?S _shoulder_.], You have missed not having a father,
I suppose, Gerald?, GERALD., Oh, no; my mother has been so good to me., No one ever had such
a mother as I have had., LORD ILLINGWORTH., I am quite sure of that., Still I should imagine that
most mothers don?t quite understand their sons., Don?t realise, I mean,
that a son has ambitions, a desire to see life, to make himself a name., After all, Gerald, you couldn?t be expected to pass all your life in such
a hole as Wrockley, could you?, GERALD., Oh, no!, It would be dreadful!, LORD ILLINGWORTH., A mother?s love is very touching, of course, but it is
often curiously selfish., I mean, there is a good deal of selfishness in
it., GERALD., [_Slowly_.], I suppose there is., LORD ILLINGWORTH., Your mother is a thoroughly good woman., ...]",2
198,"[Ah!, those things are very sad, no doubt, but I believe
there are admirable homes where people of that kind are looked after and
reformed, and I think on the whole that the secret of life is to take
things very, very easily., MRS. ALLONBY., The secret of life is never to have an emotion that is
unbecoming., LADY STUTFIELD., The secret of life is to appreciate the pleasure of
being terribly, terribly deceived., KELVIL., The secret of life is to resist temptation, Lady Stutfield., LORD ILLINGWORTH., There is no secret of life., Life?s aim, if it has
one, is simply to be always looking for temptations., There are not
nearly enough., I sometimes pass a whole day without coming across a
single one., It is quite dreadful., It makes one so nervous about the
future., LADY HUNSTANTON., [_Shakes her fan at him_.], I don?t know how it is,
dear Lord Illingworth, but everything you have said to-day seems to me
excessively immoral., It has been most interesting, listening to you., LORD ILLINGWORTH., All thought is immoral., Its very essence is
destruction., If you think of anything, you kill it., Nothing survives
being thought of., LADY HUNSTANTON., I don?t understand a word, Lord Illingworth., But I
have no doubt it is all quite true., Personally, I have very little to
reproach myself with, on the score of thinking., I don?t believe in women
thinking too much., Women should think in moderation, as they should do
all things in moderation., LORD ILLINGWORTH., Moderation is a fatal thing, Lady Hunstanton., Nothing
succeeds like excess., LADY HUNSTANTON., I hope I shall remember that., It sounds an admirable
maxim., But I?m beginning to forget everything., It?s a great misfortune., LORD ILLINGWORTH., It is one of your most fascinating qualities, Lady
Hunstanton., No woman should have a memory., Memory in a woman is the
beginning of dowdiness., One can always tell from a woman?s bonnet
whether she has got a memory or not., LADY HUNSTANTON., How charming you are, dear Lord Illingworth., You
always find out that one?s most glaring fault is one?s most important
virtue., You have the most comforting views of life., [_Enter_ FARQUHAR.], FARQUHAR., Doctor Daubeny?s carriage!, LADY HUNSTANTON., My dear Archdeacon!, It is only half-past ten., THE ARCHDEACON., [_Rising_.], I am afraid I must go, Lady Hunstanton., Tuesday is always one of Mrs. Daubeny?s bad nights., LADY HUNSTANTON., [_Rising_.], Well, I won?t keep you from her., [_Goes

mother, Gerald., I hope she is better?, GERALD., My mother has not come down yet, Lady Hunstanton., LADY HUNSTANTON., Ah, I am afraid the heat was too much for her last

was the music., Music makes one feel so romantic?at least it always gets

quite the happy English home., LADY HUNSTANTON., That?s just the word, dear; that just describes it., One feels your mother?s good influence in everything she has about her,
Gerald., MRS. ALLONBY., Lord Illingworth says that all influence is bad, but that
a good influence is the worst in the world., LADY HUNSTANTON., When Lord Illingworth knows Mrs. Arbuthnot better he
will change his mind., I must certainly bring him here., MRS. ALLONBY., I should like to see Lord Illingworth in a happy English
home., LADY HUNSTANTON., It would do him a great deal of good, dear., Most women
in London, nowadays, seem to furnish their rooms with nothing but
orchids, foreigners, and French novels., But here we have the room of a
sweet saint., Fresh natural flowers, books that don?t shock one, pictures
that one can look at without blushing., MRS. ALLONBY., But I like blushing., LADY HUNSTANTON., Well, there _is_ a good deal to be said for blushing,
if one can do it at the proper moment., Poor dear Hunstanton used to tell
me I didn?t blush nearly often enough., But then he was so very
particular., He wouldn?t let me know any of his men friends, except those
who were over seventy, like poor Lord Ashton: who afterwards, by the way,
was brought into the Divorce Court., A most unfortunate case., MRS. ALLONBY., I delight in men over seventy., They always offer one the
devotion of a lifetime., I think seventy an ideal age for a man., LADY HUNSTANTON., She is quite incorrigible, Gerald, isn?t she?, By-the-by, Gerald, I hope your dear mother will come and see me more
often now., You and Lord Illingworth start almost immediately, don?t you?, GERALD., I have given up my intention of being Lord Illingworth?s
secretary., LADY HUNSTANTON., Surely not, Gerald!, It would be most unwise of you., What reason can you have?, GERALD., I don?t think I should be suitable for the post., MRS. ALLONBY., I wish Lord Illingworth would ask me to be his secretary., But he says I am not serious enough., LADY HUNSTANTON., My dear, you really mustn?t talk like that in this
house., Mrs. Arbuthnot doesn?t know anything about the wicked society in
which we all live., She won?t go into it., She is far too good., I
consider it was a great honour her coming to me last night., It gave
quite an atmosphere of respectability to the party., MRS. ALLONBY., Ah, that must have been what you thought was thunder in
the air., LADY HUNSTANTON., My dear, how can you say that?, There is no resemblance
between the two things at all., But really, Gerald, what do you mean by
not being suitable?, GERALD., Lord Illingworth?s views of life and mine are too different., LADY HUNSTANTON., But, my dear Gerald, at your age you shouldn?t have any
views of life., They are quite out of place., You must be guided by
others in this matter., Lord Illingworth has made you the most flattering
offer, and travelling with him you would see the world?as much of it, at
least, as one should look at?under the best auspices possible, and stay
with all the right people, which is so important at this solemn moment in

202,"[Having become a candidate for the honorable office of one of your Representatives in the next General Assembly of this State, in according with an established custom and the principles of true Republicanism it becomes my duty to make known to you, the people whom I propose to represent, my sentiments with regard to local affairs., Time and experience have verified to a demonstration the public utility of internal improvements., That the poorest and most thinly populated countries would be greatly benefited by the opening of good roads, and in the clearing of navigable streams within their limits, is what no person will deny., Yet it is folly to undertake works of this or any other without first knowing that we are able to finish them--as half-finished work generally proves to be labor lost., There cannot justly be any objection to having railroads and canals, any more than to other good things, provided they cost nothing., The only objection is to paying for them; and the objection arises from the want of ability to pay., With respect to the County of Sangamon, some  Yet, however desirable an object the construction of a railroad through our country may be, however high our imaginations may be heated at thoughts of it,--there is always a heart-appalling shock accompanying the amount of its cost, which forces us to shrink from our pleasing anticipations., The probable cost of this contemplated railroad is estimated at $290,000; the bare statement of which, in my opinion, is sufficient to justify the belief that the improvement of the Sangamon River is an object much better suited to our infant resources., What the cost of this work would be, I am unable to say., It is probable, however, that it would not be greater than is common to streams of the same length., Finally, I believe the improvement of the Sangamon River to be vastly important and highly desirable to the people of the county; and, if elected, any measure in the Legislature having this for its object, which may appear judicious, will meet my approbation and receive my support., It appears that the practice of loaning money at exorbitant rates of interest has already been opened as a field for discussion; so I suppose I may enter upon it without claiming the honor or risking the danger which may await its first explorer., It seems as though we are never to have an end to this baneful and corroding system, acting almost as prejudicially to the general interests of the community as a direct tax of several thousand dollars annually laid on each county for the benefit of a few individuals only, unless there be a law made fixing the limits of usury., A law for this purpose, I am of opinion, may be made without materially injuring any class of people., In cases of extreme necessity, there could always be means found to cheat the law; while in all other cases it would have its intended effect., I would favor the passage of a law on this subject which might not be very easily evaded., Let it be such that the labor and difficulty of evading it could only be justified in cases of greatest necessity., Upon the subject of education, not presuming to dictate any plan or system respecting it, I can only say that I view it as the most important subject which we as a people can be engaged in., That every man may receive at least a moderate education, and thereby be enabled to read the histories of his own and other countries, by which he may duly appreciate the value of our free institutions, appears to be an object of vital importance, even on this account alone, to say nothing of the advantages and satisfaction to be derived from all being able to read the Scriptures, and other works both of a religious and moral nature, for themselves., For my part, I desire to see the time when education--and by its means, morality, sobriety, enterprise, and industry--shall become much more general than at present, and should be gratified to have it in my power to contribute something to the advancement of any measure which might have a tendency to accelerate that happy period., With regard to existing laws, some alterations are thought to be necessary., Many respectable men have suggested that our estray laws, the law respecting the issuing of executions, the road law, and some others, are deficient in their present form, and require alterations., But, considering the great probability that the framers of those laws were wiser than myself, I should prefer not meddling with them, unless they were first attacked by others; in which case I should feel it both a privilege and a duty to take that stand which, in my view, might tend most to the advancement of justice., But, fellow-citizens, I shall conclude., Considering the great degree of modesty which should always attend youth, it is probable I have already been more presuming than becomes me., However, upon the subjects of which I have treated, I have spoken as I have thought., I may be wrong in regard to any or all of them; but, holding it a sound maxim that it is better only sometimes to be right than at all times to be wrong, so soon as I discover my opinions to be erroneous, I shall be ready to renounce them., Every man is said to have his peculiar ambition., Whether it be true or not, I can say, for one, that I have no other so great as that of being truly esteemed of my fellow-men, by rendering myself worthy of their esteem., How far I shall succeed in gratifying this ambition is yet to be developed., I am young, and unknown to many of you., I was born, and have ever remained, in the most humble walks of life., I have no wealthy or popular relations or friends to recommend me., My case is thrown exclusively upon the independent voters of the county; and, if elected, they will have conferred a favor upon me for which I shall be unremitting in my labors to compensate., But, if the good people in their wisdom shall see fit to keep me in the background, I have been too familiar with disappointments to be very much chagrined., In regard to the time David Rankin served the enclosed discharge shows correctly--as well as I can recollect--having no writing to refer., The transfer of Rankin from my company occurred as follows: Rankin having lost his horse at Dixon's ferry and having acquaintance in one of the foot companies who were going down the river was desirous to go with them, and one Galishen being an acquaintance of mine and belonging to the company in which Rankin wished to go wished to leave it and join mine, this being the case it was agreed that they should exchange places and answer to each other's names--as it was expected we all would be discharged in very few days., As to a blanket--I have no knowledge of Rankin ever getting any., The above embraces all the facts now in my recollection which are pertinent to the case., I shall take pleasure in giving any further information in my power should you call on me., At your request I send you a receipt for the postage on your paper., I am somewhat surprised at your request., I will, however, comply with it., The law requires newspaper postage to be paid in advance, and now that I have waited a full year you choose to wound my feelings by insinuating that unless you get a receipt I will probably make you pay it again., In your paper of last Saturday I see a communication, over the signature of ""Many Voters,"" in which the candidates who are announced in the Journal are called upon to ""show their hands."", Agreed., Here's mine., I go for all sharing the privileges of the government who assist in bearing its burdens., Consequently, I go for admitting all whites to the right of suffrage who pay taxes or bear arms (by no means excluding females)., If elected, I shall consider the whole people of Sangamon my constituents, as well those that oppose as those that support me., While acting as their representative, I shall be governed by their will on all subjects upon which I have the means of knowing what their will is; and upon all others I shall do what my own judgment teaches me will best advance their interests., Whether elected or not, I go for distributing the proceeds of the sales of the public lands to the several States, to enable our State, in common with others, to dig canals and construct railroads without borrowing money and paying the interest on it., If alive on the first Monday in November, I shall vote for Hugh L. White for President., I am told that during my absence last week you passed through this place, and stated publicly that you were in possession of a fact or facts which, if known to the public, would entirely destroy the prospects of N. W. Edwards and myself at the ensuing election; but that, through favor to us, you should forbear to divulge them., No one has needed favors more than I, and, generally, few have been less unwilling to accept them; but in this case favor to me would be injustice to the public, and therefore I must beg your pardon for declining it., That I once had the confidence of the people of Sangamon, is sufficiently evident; and if I have since done anything, either by design or misadventure, which if known would subject me to a forfeiture of that confidence, he that knows of that thing, and conceals it, is a traitor to his country's interest., I find myself wholly unable to form any conjecture of what fact or facts, real or supposed, you spoke; but my opinion of your veracity will not permit me for a moment to doubt that you at least believed what you said., I am flattered with the personal regard you manifested for me; but I do hope that, on more mature reflection, you will view the public interest as a paramount consideration, and therefore determine to let the worst come., I here assure you that the candid statement of facts on your part, however low it may sink me, shall never break the tie of personal friendship between us., I wish an answer to this, and you are at liberty to publish both, if you choose., I have been sick ever since my arrival, or I should have written sooner., It is but little difference, however, as I have very little even yet to write., And more, the longer I can avoid the mortification of looking in the post-office for your letter and not finding it, the better., You see I am mad about that old letter yet., I don't like very well to risk you again., I'll try you once more, anyhow., The new State House is not yet finished, and consequently the Legislature is doing little or nothing., The governor delivered an inflammatory political message, and it is expected there will be some sparring between the parties about it as soon as the two Houses get to business., Taylor delivered up his petition for the new county to one of our members this morning., I am told he despairs of its success, on account of all the members from Morgan County opposing it., There are names enough on the petition, I think, to justify the members from our county in going for it; but if the members from Morgan oppose it, which they say they will, the chance will be bad., Our chance to take the seat of government to Springfield is better than I expected., An internal-improvement convention was held there since we met, which recommended a loan of several millions of dollars, on the faith of the State, to construct railroads., Some of the Legislature are for it, and some against it; which has the majority I cannot tell., There is great strife and struggling for the office of the United States Senator here at this time., It is probable we shall ease their pains in a few days., The opposition men have no candidate of their own, and consequently they will smile as complacently at the angry snarl of the contending Van Buren candidates and their respective friends as the Christian does at Satan's rage., You recollect that I mentioned at the outset of this letter that I had been unwell., That is the fact, though I believe I am about well now; but that, with other things I cannot account for, have conspired, and have gotten my spirits so low that I feel that I would rather be any place in the world than here., I really cannot endure the thought of staying here ten weeks., Write back as soon as you get this, and, if possible, say something that will please me, for really I have not been pleased since I left you., This letter is so dry and stupid that I am ashamed to send it, but with my present feelings I cannot do any better., Give my best respects to Mr. and Mrs., Able and family., Lest I should fall into the too common error of being mistaken in regard to which side I design to be upon, I shall make it my first care to remove all doubt on that point, by declaring that I am opposed to the resolution under consideration, in toto., Before I proceed to the body of the subject, I will further remark, that it is not without a considerable degree of apprehension that I venture to cross the track of the gentleman from Coles [Mr. Linder]., Indeed, I do not believe I could muster a sufficiency of courage to come in contact with that gentleman, were it not for the fact that he, some days since, most graciously condescended to assure us that he would never be found wasting ammunition on small game., On the same fortunate occasion, he further gave us to understand, that he regarded himself as being decidedly the superior of our common friend from Randolph [Mr. Shields]; and feeling, as I really do, that I, to say the most of myself, am nothing more than the peer of our friend from Randolph, I shall regard the gentleman from Coles as decidedly my superior also, and consequently, in the course of what I shall have to say, whenever I shall have occasion to allude to that gentleman, I shall endeavor to adopt that kind of court language which I understand to be due to decided superiority., In one faculty, at least, there can be no dispute of the gentleman's superiority over me and most other men, and that is, the faculty of entangling a subject, so that neither himself, or any other man, can find head or tail to it., Here he has introduced a resolution embracing ninety-nine printed lines across common writing paper, and yet more than one half of his opening speech has been made upon subjects about which there is not one word said in his resolution., Though his resolution embraces nothing in regard to the constitutionality of the Bank, much of what he has said has been with a view to make the impression that it was unconstitutional in its inception., Now, although I am satisfied that an ample field may be found within the pale of the resolution, at least for small game, yet, as the gentleman has traveled out of it, I feel that I may, with all due humility, venture to follow him., The gentleman has discovered that some gentleman at Washington city has been upon the very eve of deciding our Bank unconstitutional, and that he would probably have completed his very authentic decision, had not some one of the Bank officers placed his hand upon his mouth, and begged him to withhold it., The fact that the individuals composing our Supreme Court have, in an official capacity, decided in favor of the constitutionality of the Bank, would, in my mind, seem a sufficient answer to this., It is a fact known to all, that the members of the Supreme Court, together with the Governor, form a Council of Revision, and that this Council approved this Bank charter., I ask, then, if the extra-judicial decision not quite but almost made by the gentleman at Washington, before whom, by the way, the question of the constitutionality of our Bank never has, nor never can come--is to be taken as paramount to a decision officially made by that tribunal, by which, and which alone, the constitutionality of the Bank can ever be settled?, But, aside from this view of the subject, I would ask, if the committee which this resolution proposes to appoint are to examine into the Constitutionality of the Bank?, Are they to be clothed with power to send for persons and papers, for this object?, And after they have found the bank to be unconstitutional, and decided it so, how are they to enforce their decision?, What will their decision amount to?, ...]",3
203,"[I was only endeavoring to show that there was at least as great a probability of any seven members that could be selected from this House being bribed to act corruptly, as there was that the twenty-four commissioners had been so bribed., By a reference to the ninth section of the Bank charter, it will be seen that those commissioners were John Tilson, Robert K. McLaughlin, Daniel Warm, A.G. S. Wight, John C. Riley, W. H. Davidson, Edward M. Wilson, Edward L. Pierson, Robert R. Green, Ezra Baker, Aquilla Wren, John Taylor, Samuel C. Christy, Edmund Roberts, Benjamin Godfrey, Thomas Mather, A. M. Jenkins, W. Linn, W. S. Gilman, Charles Prentice, Richard I. Hamilton, A.H. Buckner, W. F. Thornton, and Edmund D. Taylor., These are twenty-four of the most respectable men in the State., Probably no twenty-four men could be selected in the State with whom the people are better acquainted, or in whose honor and integrity they would more readily place confidence., And I now repeat, that there is less probability that those men have been bribed and corrupted, than that any seven men, or rather any six men, that could be selected from the members of this House, might be so bribed and corrupted, even though they were headed and led on by ""decided superiority"" himself., In all seriousness, I ask every reasonable man, if an issue be joined by these twenty-four commissioners, on the one part, and any other seven men, on the other part, and the whole depend upon the honor and integrity of the contending parties, to which party would the greatest degree of credit be due?, Again: Another consideration is, that we have no right to make the examination., What I shall say upon this head I design exclusively for the law-loving and law-abiding part of the House., To those who claim omnipotence for the Legislature, and who in the plenitude of their assumed powers are disposed to disregard the Constitution, law, good faith, moral right, and everything else, I have not a word to say., But to the law-abiding part I say, examine the Bank charter, go examine the Constitution, go examine the acts that the General Assembly of this State has passed, and you will find just as much authority given in each and every of them to compel the Bank to bring its coffers to this hall and to pour their contents upon this floor, as to compel it to submit to this examination which this resolution proposes., Why, Sir, the gentleman from Coles, the mover of this resolution, very lately denied on this floor that the Legislature had any right to repeal or otherwise meddle with its own acts, when those acts were made in the nature of contracts, and had been accepted and acted on by other parties., Now I ask if this resolution does not propose, for this House alone, to do what he, but the other day, denied the right of the whole Legislature to do?, He must either abandon the position he then took, or he must now vote against his own resolution., It is no difference to me, and I presume but little to any one else, which he does., I am by no means the special advocate of the Bank., I have long thought that it would be well for it to report its condition to the General Assembly, and that cases might occur, when it might be proper to make an examination of its affairs by a committee., Accordingly, during the last session, while a bill supplemental to the Bank charter was pending before the House, I offered an amendment to the same, in these words: ""The said corporation shall, at the next session of the General Assembly, and at each subsequent General Session, during the existence of its charter, report to the same the amount of debts due from said corporation; the amount of debts due to the same; the amount of specie in its vaults, and an account of all lands then owned by the same, and the amount for which such lands have been taken; and moreover, if said corporation shall at any time neglect or refuse to submit its books, papers, and all and everything necessary for a full and fair examination of its affairs, to any person or persons appointed by the General Assembly, for the purpose of making such examination, the said corporation shall forfeit its charter."", This amendment was negatived by a vote of 34 to 15., Eleven of the 34 who voted against it are now members of this House; and though it would be out of order to call their names, I hope they will all recollect themselves, and not vote for this examination to be made without authority, inasmuch as they refused to receive the authority when it was in their power to do so., I have said that cases might occur, when an examination might be proper; but I do not believe any such case has now occurred; and if it has, I should still be opposed to making an examination without legal authority., I am opposed to encouraging that lawless and mobocratic spirit, whether in relation to the Bank or anything else, which is already abroad in the land and is spreading with rapid and fearful impetuosity, to the ultimate overthrow of every institution, of every moral principle, in which persons and property have hitherto found security., But supposing we had the authority, I would ask what good can result from the examination?, Can we declare the Bank unconstitutional, and compel it to desist from the abuses of its power, provided we find such abuses to exist?, Can we repair the injuries which it may have done to individuals?, Most certainly we can do none of these things., Why then shall we spend the public money in such employment?, Oh, say the examiners, we can injure the credit of the Bank, if nothing else, Please tell me, gentlemen, who will suffer most by that?, You cannot injure, to any extent, the stockholders., They are men of wealth--of large capital; and consequently, beyond the power of malice., But by injuring the credit of the Bank, you will depreciate the value of its paper in the hands of the honest and unsuspecting farmer and mechanic, and that is all you can do., But suppose you could effect your whole purpose; suppose you could wipe the Bank from existence, which is the grand ultimatum of the project, what would be the consequence?, why, Sir, we should spend several thousand dollars of the public treasure in the operation, annihilate the currency of the State, render valueless in the hands of our people that reward of their former labors, and finally be once more under the comfortable obligation of paying the Wiggins loan, principal and interest., As a subject for the remarks of the evening, ""The Perpetuation of our Political Institutions"" is selected., In the great journal of things happening under the sun, we, the American people, find our account running under date of the nineteenth century of the Christian era., We find ourselves in the peaceful possession of the fairest portion of the earth as regards extent of territory, fertility of soil, and salubrity of climate., We find ourselves under the government of a system of political institutions conducing more essentially to the ends of civil and religious liberty than any of which the history of former times tells us., We, when mounting the stage of existence, found ourselves the legal inheritors of these fundamental blessings., We toiled not in the acquirement or establishment of them; they are a legacy bequeathed us by a once hardy, brave, and patriotic, but now lamented and departed, race of ancestors., Theirs was the task (and nobly they performed it) to possess themselves, and through themselves us, of this goodly land, and to uprear upon its hills and its valleys a political edifice of liberty and equal rights; it is ours only to transmit these--the former unprofaned by the foot of an invader, the latter undecayed by the lapse of time and untorn by usurpation--to the latest generation that fate shall permit the world to know., This task gratitude to our fathers, justice to ourselves, duty to posterity, and love for our species in general, all imperatively require us faithfully to perform., How then shall we perform it?, At what point shall we expect the approach of danger?, By what means shall we fortify against it?, Shall we expect some transatlantic military giant to step the ocean and crush us at a blow?, Never!, All the armies of Europe, Asia, and Africa combined, with all the treasure of the earth (our own excepted) in their military chest, with a Bonaparte for a commander, could not by force take a drink from the Ohio or make a track on the Blue Ridge in a trial of a thousand years., At what point then is the approach of danger to be expected?, I answer: If it ever reach us it must spring up amongst us; it cannot come from abroad., If destruction be our lot we must ourselves be its author and finisher., As a nation of freemen we must live through all time, or die by suicide., I hope I am over-wary; but if I am not, there is even now something of ill omen amongst us., I mean the increasing disregard for law which pervades the country--the growing disposition to substitute the wild and furious passions in lieu of the sober judgment of courts, and the worse than savage mobs for the executive ministers of justice., This disposition is awfully fearful in any community; and that it now exists in ours, though grating to our feelings to admit, it would be a violation of truth and an insult to our intelligence to deny., Accounts of outrages committed by mobs form the everyday news of the times., They have pervaded the country from New England to Louisiana; they are neither peculiar to the eternal snows of the former nor the burning suns of the latter; they are not the creature of climate, neither are they confined to the slave holding or the non-slave holding States., Alike they spring up among the pleasure-hunting masters of Southern slaves, and the order-loving citizens of the land of steady habits., Whatever then their cause may be, it is common to the whole country., It would be tedious as well as useless to recount the horrors of all of them., Those happening in the State of Mississippi and at St. Louis are perhaps the most dangerous in example and revolting to humanity., In the Mississippi case they first commenced by hanging the regular gamblers--a set of men certainly not following for a livelihood a very useful or very honest occupation, but one which, so far from being forbidden by the laws, was actually licensed by an act of the Legislature passed but a single year before., Next, negroes suspected of conspiring to raise an insurrection were caught up and hanged in all parts of the State; then, white men supposed to be leagued with the negroes; and finally, strangers from neighboring States, going thither on business, were in many instances subjected to the same fate., Thus went on this process of hanging, from gamblers to negroes, from negroes to white citizens, and from these to strangers, till dead men were seen literally dangling from the boughs of trees upon every roadside, and in numbers almost sufficient to rival the native Spanish moss of the country as a drapery of the forest., Turn then to that horror-striking scene at St. Louis., A single victim only was sacrificed there., This story is very short, and is perhaps the most highly tragic of anything of its length that has ever been witnessed in real life., A mulatto man by the name of McIntosh was seized in the street, dragged to the suburbs of the city, chained to a tree, and actually burned to death; and all within a single hour from the time he had been a freeman attending to his own business and at peace with the world., Such are the effects of mob law, and such are the scenes becoming more and more frequent in this land so lately famed for love of law and order, and the stories of which have even now grown too familiar to attract anything more than an idle remark., But you are perhaps ready to ask, ""What has this to do with the perpetuation of our political institutions?"", I answer, It has much to do with it., Its direct consequences are, comparatively speaking, but a small evil, and much of its danger consists in the proneness of our minds to regard its direct as its only consequences., Abstractly considered, the hanging of the gamblers at Vicksburg was of but little consequence., They constitute a portion of population that is worse than useless in any community; and their death, if no pernicious example be set by it, is never matter of reasonable regret with any one., If they were annually swept from the stage of existence by the plague or smallpox, honest men would perhaps be much profited by the operation., Similar too is the correct reasoning in regard to the burning of the negro at St. Louis., He had forfeited his life by the perpetration of an outrageous murder upon one of the most worthy and respectable citizens of the city, and had he not died as he did, he must have died by the sentence of the law in a very short time afterwards., As to him alone, it was as well the way it was as it could otherwise have been., But the example in either case was fearful., When men take it in their heads to-day to hang gamblers or burn murderers, they should recollect that in the confusion usually attending such transactions they will be as likely to hang or burn some one who is neither a gambler nor a murderer as one who is, and that, acting upon the example they set, the mob of to-morrow may, and probably will, hang or burn some of them by the very same mistake., And not only so: the innocent, those who have ever set their faces against violations of law in every shape, alike with the guilty fall victims to the ravages of mob law; and thus it goes on, step by step, till all the walls erected for the defense of the persons and property of individuals are trodden down and disregarded., But all this, even, is not the full extent of the evil., By such examples, by instances of the perpetrators of such acts going unpunished, the lawless in spirit are encouraged to become lawless in practice; and having been used to no restraint but dread of punishment, they thus become absolutely unrestrained., Having ever regarded government as their deadliest bane, they make a jubilee of the suspension of its operations, and pray for nothing so much as its total annihilation., While, on the other hand, good men, men who love tranquillity, who desire to abide by the laws and enjoy their benefits, who would gladly spill their blood in the defense of their country, seeing their property destroyed, their families insulted, and their lives endangered, their persons injured, and seeing nothing in prospect that forebodes a change for the better, become tired of and disgusted with a government that offers them no protection, and are not much averse to a change in which they imagine they have nothing to lose., Thus, then, by the operation of this mobocratic spirit which all must admit is now abroad in the land, the strongest bulwark of any government, and particularly of those constituted like ours, may effectually be broken down and destroyed--I mean the attachment of the people., Whenever this effect shall be produced among us; whenever the vicious portion of population shall be permitted to gather in bands of hundreds and thousands, and burn churches, ravage and rob provision-stores, throw printing presses into rivers, shoot editors, and hang and burn obnoxious persons at pleasure and with impunity, depend on it, this government cannot last., By such things the feelings of the best citizens will become more or less alienated from it, and thus it will be left without friends, or with too few, and those few too weak to make their friendship effectual., At such a time, and under such circumstances, men of sufficient talent and ambition will not be wanting to seize the opportunity, strike the blow, and overturn that fair fabric which for the last half century has been the fondest hope of the lovers of freedom throughout the world., I know the American people are much attached to their government; I know they would suffer much for its sake; I know they would endure evils long and patiently before they would ever think of exchanging it for another,--yet, notwithstanding all this, if the laws be continually despised and disregarded, if their rights to be secure in their persons and property are held by no better tenure than the caprice of a mob, the alienation of their affections from the government is the natural consequence; and to that, sooner or later, it must come., Here, then, is one point at which danger may be expected., The question recurs, How shall we fortify against it?, The answer is simple., Let every American, every lover of liberty, every well-wisher to his posterity swear by the blood of the Revolution never to violate in the least particular the laws of the country, and never to tolerate their violation by others., As the patriots of seventy-six did to the support of the Declaration of Independence, so to the support of the Constitution and laws let every American pledge his life, his property, and his sacred honor., Let every man remember that to violate the law is to trample on the blood of his father, and to tear the charter of his own and his children's liberty., Let reverence for the laws be breathed by every American mother to the lisping babe that prattles on her lap; let it be taught in schools, in seminaries, and in colleges; let it be written in primers, spelling books, and in almanacs; let it be preached from the pulpit, proclaimed in legislative halls, and enforced in courts of justice., And, in short, let it become the political religion of the nation; and let the old and the young, the rich and the poor, the grave and the gay of all sexes and tongues and colors and conditions, sacrifice unceasingly upon its altars., While ever a state of feeling such as this shall universally or even very generally prevail throughout the nation, vain will be every effort, and fruitless every attempt, to subvert our national freedom., When, I so pressingly urge a strict observance of all the laws, let me not be understood as saying there are no bad laws, or that grievances may not arise for the redress of which no legal provisions have been made., I mean to say no such thing., But I do mean to say that although bad laws, if they exist, should be repealed as soon as possible, still, while they continue in force, for the sake of example they should be religiously observed., ...]",3
204,"[I am afraid you would not be satisfied., There is a great deal of flourishing about in carriages here, which it would be your doom to see without sharing it., You would have to be poor, without the means of hiding your poverty., Do you believe you could bear that patiently?, Whatever woman may cast her lot with mine, should any ever do so, it is my intention to do all in my power to make her happy and contented; and there is nothing I can imagine that would make me more unhappy than to fail in the effort., I know I should be much happier with you than the way I am, provided I saw no signs of discontent in you., What you have said to me may have been in the way of jest, or I may have misunderstood you., If so, then let it be forgotten;

while at our late meeting we had but few expressions of thoughts., You must know that I cannot see you, or think of you, with entire indifference; and yet it may be that you are mistaken in regard to what my real feelings toward you are., If I knew you were not, I should not have troubled you with this letter., Perhaps any other man would know enough without information; but I consider it my peculiar right to plead ignorance, and your bounden duty to allow the plea., I want in all cases to do right; and most particularly so in all cases with women., I want, at this particular time, more than any thing else to do right with you; and if I knew it would be doing right, as I rather suspect it would, to let you alone I would do it., And, for the purpose of making the matter as plain as possible, I now say that you can drop the subject, dismiss your thoughts (if you ever had any) from me for ever and leave this letter unanswered without calling forth one accusing murmur from me., And I will even go further and say that, if it will add anything to your comfort or peace of mind to do so, it is my sincere wish that you should., Do not understand by this that I wish to cut your acquaintance., I mean no such thing., What I do wish is that our further acquaintance shall depend upon yourself., If such further acquaintance would contribute nothing to your happiness, I am sure it would not to mine., If you feel yourself in any degree bound to me, I am now willing to release you, provided you wish it; while on the other hand I am willing and even anxious to bind you faster if I can be convinced that it will, in any considerable degree, add to your happiness., This, indeed, is the whole question with me., Nothing would make me more miserable than to believe you miserable, nothing more happy than to know you were so., In what I have now said, I think I cannot be misunderstood; and to make myself understood is the only object of this letter., If it suits you best not to answer this, farewell., A long life and a merry one attend you., But, if you conclude to write back, speak as plainly as I do., There can neither be harm nor danger in saying to me anything you think, just in the manner you think it., My respects to your sister., Your friend, LINCOLN., In accordance with our determination, as expressed last week, we present to the reader the articles which were published in hand-bill form, in reference to the case of the heirs of Joseph Anderson vs. James Adams., These articles can now be read uninfluenced by personal or party feeling, and with the sole motive of learning the truth., When that is done, the reader can pass his own judgment on the matters at issue., We only regret in this case, that the publications were not made some weeks before the election., Such a course might have prevented the expressions of regret, which have often been heard since, from different individuals, on account of the disposition they made of their votes., To the Public:  It is well known to most of you, that there is existing at this time considerable excitement in regard to Gen. Adams's titles to certain tracts of land, and the manner in which he acquired them., As I understand, the Gen. charges that the whole has been gotten up by a knot of lawyers to injure his election; and as I am one of the knot to which he refers, and as I happen to be in possession of facts connected with the matter, I will, in as brief a manner as possible, make a statement of them, together with the means by which I arrived at the knowledge of them., Sometime in May or June last, a widow woman, by the name of Anderson, and her son, who resides in Fulton county, came to Springfield, for the purpose as they said of selling a ten acre lot of ground lying near town, which they claimed as the property of the deceased husband and father., When they reached town they found the land was claimed by Gen. Adams., John T. Stuart and myself were employed to look into the matter, and if it was thought we could do so with any prospect of success, to commence a suit for the land., I went immediately to the recorder's office to examine Adams's title, and found that the land had been entered by one Dixon, deeded by Dixon to Thomas, by Thomas to one Miller, and by Miller to Gen. Adams., The oldest of these three deeds was about ten or eleven years old, and the latest more than five, all recorded at the same time, and that within less than one year., This I thought a suspicious circumstance, and I was thereby induced to examine the deeds very closely, with a view to the discovery of some defect by which to overturn the title, being almost convinced then it was founded in fraud., I discovered that in the deed from Thomas to Miller, although Miller's name stood in a sort of marginal note on the record book, it was nowhere in the deed itself., I told the fact to Talbott, the recorder, and proposed to him that he should go to Gen. Adams's and get the original deed, and compare it with the record, and thereby ascertain whether the defect was in the original or there was merely an error in the recording., As Talbott afterwards told me, he went to the General's, but not finding him at home, got the deed from his son, which, when compared with the record, proved what we had discovered was merely an error of the recorder., After Mr. Talbott corrected the record, he brought the original to our office, as I then thought and think yet, to show us that it was right., When he came into the room he handed the deed to me, remarking that the fault was all his own., On opening it, another paper fell out of it, which on examination proved to be an assignment of a judgment in the Circuit Court of Sangamon County from Joseph Anderson, the late husband of the widow above named, to James Adams, the judgment being in favor of said Anderson against one Joseph Miller., Knowing that this judgment had some connection with the land affair, I immediately took a copy of it, which is word for word, letter for letter and cross for cross as follows:  Judgment in Sangamon Circuit Court against Joseph Miller obtained on a note originally 25 dolls and interest thereon accrued., I assign all my right, title and interest to James Adams which is in consideration of a debt I owe said Adams., As the copy shows, it bore date May 10, 1827; although the judgment assigned by it was not obtained until the October afterwards, as may be seen by any one on the records of the Circuit Court., Two other strange circumstances attended it which cannot be represented by a copy., One of them was, that the date ""1827"" had first been made ""1837"" and, without the figure ""3,"" being fully obliterated, the figure ""2"" had afterwards been made on top of it; the other was that, although the date was ten years old, the writing on it, from the freshness of its appearance, was thought by many, and I believe by all who saw it, not to be more than a week old., The paper on which it was written had a very old appearance; and there were some old figures on the back of it which made the freshness of the writing on the face of it much more striking than I suppose it otherwise might have been., The reader's curiosity is no doubt excited to know what connection this assignment had with the land in question., The story is this: Dixon sold and deeded the land to Thomas; Thomas sold it to Anderson; but before he gave a deed, Anderson sold it to Miller, and took Miller's note for the purchase money., When this note became due, Anderson sued Miller on it, and Miller procured an injunction from the Court of Chancery to stay the collection of the money until he should get a deed for the land., Gen. Adams was employed as an attorney by Anderson in this chancery suit, and at the October term, 1827, the injunction was dissolved, and a judgment given in favor of Anderson against Miller; and it was provided that Thomas was to execute a deed for the land in favor of Miller and deliver it to Gen. Adams, to be held up by him till Miller paid the judgment, and then to deliver it to him., Miller left the county without paying the judgment., Anderson moved to Fulton county, where he has since died When the widow came to Springfield last May or June, as before mentioned, and found the land deeded to Gen. Adams by Miller, she was naturally led to inquire why the money due upon the judgment had not been sent to them, inasmuch as he, Gen. Adams, had no authority to deliver Thomas's deed to Miller until the money was paid., Then it was the General told her, or perhaps her son, who came with her, that Anderson, in his lifetime, had assigned the judgment to him, Gen. Adams., I am now told that the General is exhibiting an assignment of the same judgment bearing date ""1828"" and in other respects differing from the one described; and that he is asserting that no such assignment as the one copied by me ever existed; or if there did, it was forged between Talbott and the lawyers, and slipped into his papers for the purpose of injuring him., Now, I can only say that I know precisely such a one did exist, and that Ben., Talbott, Wm., Butler, C.R., Matheny, John T. Stuart, Judge Logan, Robert Irwin, P. C. Canedy and S. M. Tinsley, all saw and examined it, and that at least one half of them will swear that IT WAS IN GENERAL ADAMS'S HANDWRITING!!, And further, I know that Talbott will swear that he got it out of the General's possession, and returned it into his possession again., The assignment which the General is now exhibiting purports to have been by Anderson in writing., The one I copied was signed with a cross., I am told that Gen. Neale says that he will swear that he heard Gen. Adams tell young Anderson that the assignment made by his father was signed with a cross., The above are 'facts,' as stated., I leave them without comment., I have given the names of persons who have knowledge of these facts, in order that any one who chooses may call on them and ascertain how far they will corroborate my statements., I have only made these statements because I am known by many to be one of the individuals against whom the charge of forging the assignment and slipping it into the General's papers has been made, and because our silence might be construed into a confession of its truth., I shall not subscribe my name; but I hereby authorize the editor of the Journal to give it up to any one that may call for it., In the Republican of this morning a publication of Gen. Adams's appears, in which my name is used quite unreservedly., For this I thank the General., I thank him because it gives me an opportunity, without appearing obtrusive, of explaining a part of a former publication of mine, which appears to me to have been misunderstood by many., In the former publication alluded to, I stated, in substance, that Mr. Talbott got a deed from a son of Gen. Adams's for the purpose of correcting a mistake that had occurred on the record of the said deed in the recorder's office; that he corrected the record, and brought the deed and handed it to me, and that on opening the deed, another paper, being the assignment of a judgment, fell out of it., This statement Gen. Adams and the editor of the Republican have seized upon as a most palpable evidence of fabrication and falsehood., They set themselves gravely about proving that the assignment could not have been in the deed when Talbott got it from young Adams, as he, Talbott, would have seen it when he opened the deed to correct the record., Now, the truth is, Talbott did see the assignment when he opened the deed, or at least he told me he did on the same day; and I only omitted to say so, in my former publication, because it was a matter of such palpable and necessary inference., ...]",3
205,"[Now, without attempting to explain, he furnishes me with another witness (Tinsley) by which the same thing is proved, to wit, that the assignment was not manufactured just before the election; but that it was some weeks before., Let it be borne in mind that Adams made this statement--has himself furnished two witnesses to prove its falsehood, and does not attempt to deny or explain it., Before going farther, let a pin be stuck here, labeled ""One lie proved and confessed."", On the 6th of September he said he had before stated in the hand-bill that he held an assignment dated May 20th, 1828, which in reply I pronounced to be false, and referred to the hand-bill for the truth of what I said., This week he forgets to make any explanation of this., Let another pin be stuck here, labelled as before., I mention these things because, if, when I convict him in one falsehood, he is permitted to shift his ground and pass it by in silence, there can be no end to this controversy., The first thing that attracts my attention in the General's present production is the information he is pleased to give to ""those who are made to suffer at his (my) hands."", Under present circumstances, this cannot apply to me, for I am not a widow nor an orphan: nor have I a wife or children who might by possibility become such., Such, however, I have no doubt, have been, and will again be made to suffer at his hands!, Hands!, Yes, they are the mischievous agents., The next thing I shall notice is his favorite expression, ""not of lawyers, doctors and others,"" which he is so fond of applying to all who dare expose his rascality., Now, let it be remembered that when he first came to this country he attempted to impose himself upon the community as a lawyer, and actually carried the attempt so far as to induce a man who was under a charge of murder to entrust the defence of his life in his hands, and finally took his money and got him hanged., Is this the man that is to raise a breeze in his favor by abusing lawyers?, If he is not himself a lawyer, it is for the lack of sense, and not of inclination., If he is not a lawyer, he is a liar, for he proclaimed himself a lawyer, and got a man hanged by depending on him., Passing over such parts of the article as have neither fact nor argument in them, I come to the question asked by Adams whether any person ever saw the assignment in his possession., This is an insult to common sense., Talbott has sworn once and repeated time and again, that he got it out of Adams's possession and returned it into the same possession., Still, as though he was addressing fools, he has assurance to ask if any person ever saw it in his possession., Next I quote a sentence, ""Now my son Lucian swears that when Talbott called for the deed, that he, Talbott, opened it and pointed out the error."", True., His son Lucian did swear as he says; and in doing so, he swore what I will prove by his own affidavit to be a falsehood., Turn to Lucian's affidavit, and you will there see that Talbott called for the deed by which to correct an error on the record., Thus it appears that the error in question was on the record, and not in the deed., How then could Talbott open the deed and point out the error?, Where a thing is not, it cannot be pointed out., The error was not in the deed, and of course could not be pointed out there., This does not merely prove that the error could not be pointed out, as Lucian swore it was; but it proves, too, that the deed was not opened in his presence with a special view to the error, for if it had been, he could not have failed to see that there was no error in it., It is easy enough to see why Lucian swore this., His object was to prove that the assignment was not in the deed when Talbott got it: but it was discovered he could not swear this safely, without first swearing the deed was opened--and if he swore it was opened, he must show a motive for opening it, and the conclusion with him and his father was that the pointing out the error would appear the most plausible., For the purpose of showing that the assignment was not in the bundle when Talbott got it, is the story introduced into Lucian's affidavit that the deeds were counted., It is a remarkable fact, and one that should stand as a warning to all liars and fabricators, that in this short affidavit of Lucian's he only attempted to depart from the truth, so far as I have the means of knowing, in two points, to wit, in the opening the deed and pointing out the error and the counting of the deeds,--and in both of these he caught himself., About the counting, he caught himself thus--after saying the bundle contained five deeds and a lease, he proceeds, ""and I saw no other papers than the said deed and lease."", First he has six papers, and then he saw none but two; for ""my son Lucian's"" benefit, let a pin be stuck here., Adams again adduces the argument, that he could not have forged the assignment, for the reason that he could have had no motive for it., With those that know the facts there is no absence of motive., Admitting the paper which he has filed in the suit to be genuine, it is clear that it cannot answer the purpose for which he designs it., Hence his motive for making one that he supposed would answer is obvious., His making the date too old is also easily enough accounted for., The records were not in his hands, and then, there being some considerable talk upon this particular subject, he knew he could not examine the records to ascertain the precise dates without subjecting himself to suspicion; and hence he concluded to try it by guess, and, as it turned out, missed it a little., About Miller's deposition I have a word to say., In the first place, Miller's answer to the first question shows upon its face that he had been tampered with, and the answer dictated to him., He was asked if he knew Joel Wright and James Adams; and above three-fourths of his answer consists of what he knew about Joseph Anderson, a man about whom nothing had been asked, nor a word said in the question--a fact that can only be accounted for upon the supposition that Adams had secretly told him what he wished him to swear to., Another of Miller's answers I will prove both by common sense and the Court of Record is untrue., To one question he answers, ""Anderson brought a suit against me before James Adams, then an acting justice of the peace in Sangamon County, before whom he obtained a judgment., ""Q.--Did you remove the same by injunction to the Sangamon Circuit Court?, Ans.--I did remove it."", Now mark--it is said he removed it by injunction., The word ""injunction"" in common language imports a command that some person or thing shall not move or be removed; in law it has the same meaning., An injunction issuing out of chancery to a justice of the peace is a command to him to stop all proceedings in a named case until further orders., It is not an order to remove but to stop or stay something that is already moving., Besides this, the records of the Sangamon Circuit Court show that the judgment of which Miller swore was never removed into said Court by injunction or otherwise., I have now to take notice of a part of Adams's address which in the order of time should have been noticed before., It is in these words: ""I have now shown, in the opinion of two competent judges, that the handwriting of the forged assignment differed from mine, and by one of them that it could not be mistaken for mine."", That is false., Tinsley no doubt is the judge referred to; and by reference to his certificate it will be seen that he did not say the handwriting of the assignment could not be mistaken for Adams's--nor did he use any other expression substantially, or anything near substantially, the same., But if Tinsley had said the handwriting could not be mistaken for Adams's, it would have been equally unfortunate for Adams: for it then would have contradicted Keys, who says, ""I looked at the writing and judged it the said Adams's or a good imitation."", Adams speaks with much apparent confidence of his success on attending lawsuits, and the ultimate maintenance of his title to the land in question., Without wishing to disturb the pleasure of his dream, I would say to him that it is not impossible that he may yet be taught to sing a different song in relation to the matter., At the end of Miller's deposition, Adams asks, ""Will Mr. Lincoln now say that he is almost convinced my title to this ten acre tract of land is founded in fraud?"", I answer, I will not., I will now change the phraseology so as to make it run--I am quite convinced, &c. I cannot pass in silence Adams's assertion that he has proved that the forged assignment was not in the deed when it came from his house by Talbott, the recorder., In this, although Talbott has sworn that the assignment was in the bundle of deeds when it came from his house, Adams has the unaccountable assurance to say that he has proved the contrary by Talbott., Let him or his friends attempt to show wherein he proved any such thing by Talbott., In his publication of the 6th of September he hinted to Talbott, that he might be mistaken., In his present, speaking of Talbott and me he says ""They may have been imposed upon."", Can any man of the least penetration fail to see the object of this?, After he has stormed and raged till he hopes and imagines he has got us a little scared he wishes to softly whisper in our ears, ""If you'll quit I will."", If he could get us to say that some unknown, undefined being had slipped the assignment into our hands without our knowledge, not a doubt remains but that he would immediately discover that we were the purest men on earth., This is the ground he evidently wishes us to understand he is willing to compromise upon., But we ask no such charity at his hands., We are neither mistaken nor imposed upon., We have made the statements we have because we know them to be true and we choose to live or die by them., Esq., Carter, who is Adams's friend, personal and political, will recollect, that, on the 5th of this month, he (Adams), with a great affectation of modesty, declared that he would never introduce his own child as a witness., Notwithstanding this affectation of modesty, he has in his present publication introduced his child as witness; and as if to show with how much contempt he could treat his own declaration, he has had this same Esq., Carter to administer the oath to him., And so important a witness does he consider him, and so entirely does the whole of his entire present production depend upon the testimony of his child, that in it he has mentioned ""my son,"" ""my son Lucian,"" ""Lucian, my son,"" and the like expressions no less than fifteen different times., Let it be remembered here, that I have shown the affidavit of ""my darling son Lucian"" to be false by the evidence apparent on its own face; and I now ask if that affidavit be taken away what foundation will the fabric have left to stand upon?, General Adams's publications and out-door maneuvering, taken in connection with the editorial articles of the Republican, are not more foolish and contradictory than they are ludicrous and amusing., One week the Republican notifies the public that Gen. Adams is preparing an instrument that will tear, rend, split, rive, blow up, confound, overwhelm, annihilate, extinguish, exterminate, burst asunder, and grind to powder all its slanderers, and particularly Talbott and Lincoln--all of which is to be done in due time., Then for two or three weeks all is calm--not a word said., Again the Republican comes forth with a mere passing remark that ""public"" opinion has decided in favor of Gen. Adams, and intimates that he will give himself no more trouble about the matter., In the meantime Adams himself is prowling about and, as Burns says of the devil, ""For prey, and holes and corners tryin',"" and in one instance goes so far as to take an old acquaintance of mine several steps from a crowd and, apparently weighed down with the importance of his business, gravely and solemnly asks him if ""he ever heard Lincoln say he was a deist."", Anon the Republican comes again., ""We invite the attention of the public to General Adams's communication,"" &c. ""The victory is a great one, the triumph is overwhelming."", I really believe the editor of the Illinois Republican is fool enough to think General Adams leads off--""Authors most egregiously mistaken &c. Most woefully shall their presumption be punished,"" &c. (Lord have mercy on us.), ""The hour is yet to come, yea, nigh at hand--(how long first do you reckon?), --when the Journal and its junto shall say, I have appeared too early."", ""Their infamy shall be laid bare to the public gaze."", Suddenly the General appears to relent at the severity with which he is treating us and he exclaims: ""The condemnation of my enemies is the inevitable result of my own defense."", For your health's sake, dear Gen., do not permit your tenderness of heart to afflict you so much on our account., For some reason (perhaps because we are killed so quickly) we shall never be sensible of our suffering., Farewell, General., I will see you again at court if not before--when and where we will settle the question whether you or the widow shall have the land., Without apologizing for being egotistical, I shall make the history of so much of my life as has elapsed since I saw you the subject of this letter., And, by the way, I now discover that, in order to give a full and intelligible account of the things I have done and suffered since I saw you, I shall necessarily have to relate some that happened before., It was, then, in the autumn of 1836 that a married lady of my acquaintance, and who was a great friend of mine, being about to pay a visit to her father and other relatives residing in Kentucky, proposed to me that on her return she would bring a sister of hers with her on condition that I would engage to become her brother-in-law with all convenient despatch., ...]",3
206,"[I protest against this assertion., I assert that we have again and again, during this discussion, urged facts and arguments against the subtreasury which they have neither dared to deny nor attempted to answer., But lest some may be led to believe that we really wish to avoid the question, I now propose, in my humble way, to urge those arguments again; at the same time begging the audience to mark well the positions I shall take and the proof I shall offer to sustain them, and that they will not again permit Mr. Douglas or his friends to escape the force of them by a round and groundless assertion that we ""dare not meet them in argument."", Of the subtreasury, then, as contrasted with a national bank for the before-enumerated purposes, I lay down the following propositions, to wit: (1) It will injuriously affect the community by its operation on the circulating medium., (2) It will be a more expensive fiscal agent., (3) It will be a less secure depository of the public money., To show the truth of the first proposition, let us take a short review of our condition under the operation of a national bank., It was the depository of the public revenues., Between the collection of those revenues and the disbursement of them by the government, the bank was permitted to and did actually loan them out to individuals, and hence the large amount of money actually collected for revenue purposes, which by any other plan would have been idle a great portion of the time, was kept almost constantly in circulation., Any person who will reflect that money is only valuable while in circulation will readily perceive that any device which will keep the government revenues in constant circulation, instead of being locked up in idleness, is no inconsiderable advantage., By the subtreasury the revenue is to be collected and kept in iron boxes until the government wants it for disbursement; thus robbing the people of the use of it, while the government does not itself need it, and while the money is performing no nobler office than that of rusting in iron boxes., The natural effect of this change of policy, every one will see, is to reduce the quantity of money in circulation., But, again, by the subtreasury scheme the revenue is to be collected in specie., I anticipate that this will be disputed., I expect to hear it said that it is not the policy of the administration to collect the revenue in specie., If it shall, I reply that Mr. Van Buren, in his message recommending the subtreasury, expended nearly a column of that document in an attempt to persuade Congress to provide for the collection of the revenue in specie exclusively; and he concludes with these words:  ""It may be safely assumed that no motive of convenience to the citizens requires the reception of bank paper."", In addition to this, Mr. Silas Wright, Senator from New York, and the political, personal and confidential friend of Mr. Van Buren, drafted and introduced into the Senate the first subtreasury bill, and that bill provided for ultimately collecting the revenue in specie., It is true, I know, that that clause was stricken from the bill, but it was done by the votes of the Whigs, aided by a portion only of the Van Buren senators., No subtreasury bill has yet become a law, though two or three have been considered by Congress, some with and some without the specie clause; so that I admit there is room for quibbling upon the question of whether the administration favor the exclusive specie doctrine or not; but I take it that the fact that the President at first urged the specie doctrine, and that under his recommendation the first bill introduced embraced it, warrants us in charging it as the policy of the party until their head as publicly recants it as he at first espoused it., I repeat, then, that by the subtreasury the revenue is to be collected in specie., Now mark what the effect of this must be., By all estimates ever made there are but between sixty and eighty millions of specie in the United States., The expenditures of the Government for the year 1838--the last for which we have had the report--were forty millions., Thus it is seen that if the whole revenue be collected in specie, it will take more than half of all the specie in the nation to do it., By this means more than half of all the specie belonging to the fifteen millions of souls who compose the whole population of the country is thrown into the hands of the public office-holders, and other public creditors comprising in number perhaps not more than one quarter of a million, leaving the other fourteen millions and three quarters to get along as they best can, with less than one half of the specie of the country, and whatever rags and shinplasters they may be able to put, and keep, in circulation., By this means, every office-holder and other public creditor may, and most likely will, set up shaver; and a most glorious harvest will the specie-men have of it,--each specie-man, upon a fair division, having to his share the fleecing of about fifty-nine rag-men., In all candor let me ask, was such a system for benefiting the few at the expense of the many ever before devised?, And was the sacred name of Democracy ever before made to indorse such an enormity against the rights of the people?, I have already said that the subtreasury will reduce the quantity of money in circulation., This position is strengthened by the recollection that the revenue is to be collected in Specie, so that the mere amount of revenue is not all that is withdrawn, but the amount of paper circulation that the forty millions would serve as a basis to is withdrawn, which would be in a sound state at least one hundred millions., When one hundred millions, or more, of the circulation we now have shall be withdrawn, who can contemplate without terror the distress, ruin, bankruptcy, and beggary that must follow?, The man who has purchased any article--say a horse--on credit, at one hundred dollars, when there are two hundred millions circulating in the country, if the quantity be reduced to one hundred millions by the arrival of pay-day, will find the horse but sufficient to pay half the debt; and the other half must either be paid out of his other means, and thereby become a clear loss to him, or go unpaid, and thereby become a clear loss to his creditor., What I have here said of a single case of the purchase of a horse will hold good in every case of a debt existing at the time a reduction in the quantity of money occurs, by whomsoever, and for whatsoever, it may have been contracted., It may be said that what the debtor loses the creditor gains by this operation; but on examination this will be found true only to a very limited extent., It is more generally true that all lose by it--the creditor by losing more of his debts than he gains by the increased value of those he collects; the debtor by either parting with more of his property to pay his debts than he received in contracting them, or by entirely breaking up his business, and thereby being thrown upon the world in idleness., The general distress thus created will, to be sure, be temporary, because, whatever change may occur in the quantity of money in any community, time will adjust the derangement produced; but while that adjustment is progressing, all suffer more or less, and very many lose everything that renders life desirable., Why, then, shall we suffer a severe difficulty, even though it be but temporary, unless we receive some equivalent for it?, What I have been saying as to the effect produced by a reduction of the quantity of money relates to the whole country., I now propose to show that it would produce a peculiar and permanent hardship upon the citizens of those States and Territories in which the public lands lie., The land-offices in those States and Territories, as all know, form the great gulf by which all, or nearly all, the money in them is swallowed up., When the quantity of money shall be reduced, and consequently everything under individual control brought down in proportion, the price of those lands, being fixed by law, will remain as now., Of necessity it will follow that the produce or labor that now raises money sufficient to purchase eighty acres will then raise but sufficient to purchase forty, or perhaps not that much; and this difficulty and hardship will last as long, in some degree, as any portion of these lands shall remain undisposed of., Knowing, as I well do, the difficulty that poor people now encounter in procuring homes, I hesitate not to say that when the price of the public lands shall be doubled or trebled, or, which is the same thing, produce and labor cut down to one half or one third of their present prices, it will be little less than impossible for them to procure those homes at all....  Well, then, what did become of him?, (Postmaster General Barry) Why, the President immediately expressed his high disapprobation of his almost unequaled incapacity and corruption by appointing him to a foreign mission, with a salary and outfit of $18,000 a year!, The party now attempt to throw Barry off, and to avoid the responsibility of his sins., Did not the President indorse those sins when, on the very heel of their commission, he appointed their author to the very highest and most honorable office in his gift, and which is but a single step behind the very goal of American political ambition?, I return to another of Mr. Douglas's excuses for the expenditures of 1838, at the same time announcing the pleasing intelligence that this is the last one., He says that ten millions of that year's expenditure was a contingent appropriation, to prosecute an anticipated war with Great Britain on the Maine boundary question., Few words will settle this., First, that the ten millions appropriated was not made till 1839, and consequently could not have been expended in 1838; second, although it was appropriated, it has never been expended at all., Those who heard Mr. Douglas recollect that he indulged himself in a contemptuous expression of pity for me., ""Now he's got me,"" thought I., But when he went on to say that five millions of the expenditure of 1838 were payments of the French indemnities, which I knew to be untrue; that five millions had been for the post-office, which I knew to be untrue; that ten millions had been for the Maine boundary war, which I not only knew to be untrue, but supremely ridiculous also; and when I saw that he was stupid enough to hope that I would permit such groundless and audacious assertions to go unexposed,--I readily consented that, on the score both of veracity and sagacity, the audience should judge whether he or I were the more deserving of the world's contempt., Mr. Lamborn insists that the difference between the Van Buren party and the Whigs is that, although the former sometimes err in practice, they are always correct in principle, whereas the latter are wrong in principle; and, better to impress this proposition, he uses a figurative expression in these words: ""The Democrats are vulnerable in the heel, but they are sound in the head and the heart."", The first branch of the figure--that is, that the Democrats are vulnerable in the heel--I admit is not merely figuratively, but literally true., Who that looks but for a moment at their Swartwouts, their Prices, their Harringtons, and their hundreds of others, scampering away with the public money to Texas, to Europe, and to every spot of the earth where a villain may hope to find refuge from justice, can at all doubt that they are most distressingly affected in their heels with a species of ""running itch""?, It seems that this malady of their heels operates on these sound-headed and honest-hearted creatures very much like the cork leg in the comic song did on its owner: which, when he had once got started on it, the more he tried to stop it, the more it would run away., At the hazard of wearing this point threadbare, I will relate an anecdote which seems too strikingly in point to be omitted., A witty Irish soldier, who was always boasting of his bravery when no danger was near, but who invariably retreated without orders at the first charge of an engagement, being asked by his captain why he did so, replied: ""Captain, I have as brave a heart as Julius Caesar ever had; but, somehow or other, whenever danger approaches, my cowardly legs will run away with it."", So with Mr. Lamborn's party., They take the public money into their hand for the most laudable purpose that wise heads and honest hearts can dictate; but before they can possibly get it out again, their rascally ""vulnerable heels"" will run away with them., Seriously this proposition of Mr. Lamborn is nothing more or less than a request that his party may be tried by their professions instead of their practices., Perhaps no position that the party assumes is more liable to or more deserving of exposure than this very modest request; and nothing but the unwarrantable length to which I have already extended these remarks forbids me now attempting to expose it., For the reason given, I pass it by., I shall advert to but one more point., Mr. Lamborn refers to the late elections in the States, and from their results confidently predicts that every State in the Union will vote for Mr. Van Buren at the next Presidential election., Address that argument to cowards and to knaves; with the free and the brave it will effect nothing., It may be true; if it must, let it., Many free countries have lost their liberty, and ours may lose hers; but if she shall, be it my proudest plume, not that I was the last to desert, but that I never deserted her., I know that the great volcano at Washington, aroused and directed by the evil spirit that reigns there, is belching forth the lava of political corruption in a current broad and deep, which is sweeping with frightful velocity over the whole length and breadth of the land, bidding fair to leave unscathed no green spot or living thing; while on its bosom are riding, like demons on the waves of hell, the imps of that evil spirit, and fiendishly taunting all those who dare resist its destroying course with the hopelessness of their effort; and, knowing this, I cannot deny that all may be swept away., Broken by it I, too, may be; bow to it I never will., The probability that we may fall in the struggle ought not to deter us from the support of a cause we believe to be just; it shall not deter me., If ever I feel the soul within me elevate and expand to those dimensions not wholly unworthy of its almighty Architect, it is when I contemplate the cause of my country deserted by all the world beside, and I standing up boldly and alone, and hurling defiance at her victorious oppressors., Here, without contemplating consequences, before high heaven and in the face of the world, I swear eternal fidelity to the just cause, as I deem it, of the land of my life, my liberty, and my love., And who that thinks with me will not fearlessly adopt the oath that I take?, Let none falter who thinks he is right, and we may succeed., But if, after all, we shall fail, be it so., We still shall have the proud consolation of saying to our consciences, and to the departed shade of our country's freedom, that the cause approved of our judgment, and adored of our hearts, in disaster, in chains, in torture, in death, we never faltered in defending., Dr. Henry will write you all the political news., I write this about some little matters of business., You recollect you told me you had drawn the Chicago Masark money, and sent it to the claimants., A hawk-billed Yankee is here besetting me at every turn I take, saying that Robert Kinzie never received the eighty dollars to which he was entitled., Can you tell me anything about the matter?, Again, old Mr. Wright, who lives up South Fork somewhere, is teasing me continually about some deeds which he says he left with you, but which I can find nothing of., Can you tell me where they are?, The Legislature is in session and has suffered the bank to forfeit its charter without benefit of clergy., There seems to be little disposition to resuscitate it., Whenever a letter comes from you to Mrs.____________ I carry it to her, and then I see Betty; she is a tolerable nice ""fellow"" now., Maybe I will write again when I get more time., Your friend as ever, A. LINCOLN  P. S.--The Democratic giant is here, but he is not much worth talking about., A.L., In obedience to a resolution of the Whig State convention, we have appointed you the Central Whig Committee of your county., The trust confided to you will be one of watchfulness and labor; but we hope the glory of having contributed to the overthrow of the corrupt powers that now control our beloved country will be a sufficient reward for the time and labor you will devote to it., Our Whig brethren throughout the Union have met in convention, and after due deliberation and mutual concessions have elected candidates for the Presidency and Vice-Presidency not only worthy of our cause, but worthy of the support of every true patriot who would have our country redeemed, and her institutions honestly and faithfully administered., To overthrow the trained bands that are opposed to us whose salaried officers are ever on the watch, and whose misguided followers are ever ready to obey their smallest commands, every Whig must not only know his duty, but must firmly resolve, whatever of time and labor it may cost, boldly and faithfully to do it., Our intention is to organize the whole State, so that every Whig can be brought to the polls in the coming Presidential contest., We cannot do this, however, without your co-operation; and as we do our duty, so we shall expect you to do yours., After due deliberation, the following is the plan of organization, and the duties required of each county committee:  To divide their county into small districts, and to appoint in each a subcommittee, whose duty it shall be to make a perfect list of all the voters in their respective districts, and to ascertain with certainty for whom they will vote., If they meet with men who are doubtful as to the man they will support, such voters should be designated in separate lines, with the name of the man they will probably support., It will be the duty of said subcommittee to keep a constant watch on the doubtful voters, and from time to time have them talked to by those in whom they have the most confidence, and also to place in their hands such documents as will enlighten and influence them., ...]",3
207,"[When the General Assembly, now about adjourning, assembled in November last, from the bankrupt state of the public treasury, the pecuniary embarrassments prevailing in every department of society, the dilapidated state of the public works, and the impending danger of the degradation of the State, you had a right to expect that your representatives would lose no time in devising and adopting measures to avert threatened calamities, alleviate the distresses of the people, and allay the fearful apprehensions in regard to the future prosperity of the State., It was not expected by you that the spirit of party would take the lead in the councils of the State, and make every interest bend to its demands., Nor was it expected that any party would assume to itself the entire control of legislation, and convert the means and offices of the State, and the substance of the people, into aliment for party subsistence., Neither could it have been expected by you that party spirit, however strong its desires and unreasonable its demands, would have passed the sanctuary of the Constitution, and entered with its unhallowed and hideous form into the formation of the judiciary system., At the early period of the session, measures were adopted by the dominant party to take possession of the State, to fill all public offices with party men, and make every measure affecting the interests of the people and the credit of the State operate in furtherance of their party views., The merits of men and measures therefore became the subject of discussion in caucus, instead of the halls of legislation, and decisions there made by a minority of the Legislature have been executed and carried into effect by the force of party discipline, without any regard whatever to the rights of the people or the interests of the State., The Supreme Court of the State was organized, and judges appointed, according to the provisions of the Constitution, in 1824., The people have never complained of the organization of that court; no attempt has ever before been made to change that department., Respect for public opinion, and regard for the rights and liberties of the people, have hitherto restrained the spirit of party from attacks upon the independence and integrity of the judiciary., The same judges have continued in office since 1824; their decisions have not been the subject of complaint among the people; the integrity and honesty of the court have not been questioned, and it has never been supposed that the court has ever permitted party prejudice or party considerations to operate upon their decisions., The court was made to consist of four judges, and by the Constitution two form a quorum for the transaction of business., With this tribunal, thus constituted, the people have been satisfied for near sixteen years., The same law which organized the Supreme Court in 1824 also established and organized circuit courts to be held in each county in the State, and five circuit judges were appointed to hold those courts., In 1826 the Legislature abolished these circuit courts, repealed the judges out of office, and required the judges of the Supreme Court to hold the circuit courts., The reasons assigned for this change were, first, that the business of the country could be better attended to by the four judges of the Supreme Court than by the two sets of judges; and, second, the state of the public treasury forbade the employment of unnecessary officers., In 1828 a circuit was established north of the Illinois River, in order to meet the wants of the people, and a circuit judge was appointed to hold the courts in that circuit., In 1834 the circuit-court system was again established throughout the State, circuit judges appointed to hold the courts, and the judges of the Supreme Court were relieved from the performance of circuit court duties., The change was recommended by the then acting governor of the State, General W. L. D. Ewing, in the following terms:  ""The augmented population of the State, the multiplied number of organized counties, as well as the increase of business in all, has long since convinced every one conversant with this department of our government of the indispensable necessity of an alteration in our judiciary system, and the subject is therefore recommended to the earnest patriotic consideration of the Legislature., The present system has never been exempt from serious and weighty objections., The idea of appealing from the circuit court to the same judges in the Supreme Court is recommended by little hopes of redress to the injured party below., The duties of the circuit, too, it may be added, consume one half of the year, leaving a small and inadequate portion of time (when that required for domestic purposes is deducted) to erect, in the decisions of the Supreme Court, a judicial monument of legal learning and research, which the talent and ability of the court might otherwise be entirely competent to."", With this organization of circuit courts the people have never complained., The only complaints which we have heard have come from circuits which were so large that the judges could not dispose of the business, and the circuits in which Judges Pearson and Ralston lately presided., Whilst the honor and credit of the State demanded legislation upon the subject of the public debt, the canal, the unfinished public works, and the embarrassments of the people, the judiciary stood upon a basis which required no change--no legislative action., Yet the party in power, neglecting every interest requiring legislative action, and wholly disregarding the rights, wishes, and interests of the people, has, for the unholy purpose of providing places for its partisans and supplying them with large salaries, disorganized that department of the government., Provision is made for the election of five party judges of the Supreme Court, the proscription of four circuit judges, and the appointment of party clerks in more than half the counties of the State., Men professing respect for public opinion, and acknowledged to be leaders of the party, have avowed in the halls of legislation that the change in the judiciary was intended to produce political results favorable to their party and party friends., The immutable principles of justice are to make way for party interests, and the bonds of social order are to be rent in twain, in order that a desperate faction may be sustained at the expense of the people., The change proposed in the judiciary was supported upon grounds so destructive to the institutions of the country, and so entirely at war with the rights and liberties of the people, that the party could not secure entire unanimity in its support, three Democrats of the Senate and five of the House voting against the measure., They were unwilling to see the temples of justice and the seats of independent judges occupied by the tools of faction., The declarations of the party leaders, the selection of party men for judges, and the total disregard for the public will in the adoption of the measure, prove conclusively that the object has been not reform, but destruction; not the advancement of the highest interests of the State, but the predominance of party., We cannot in this manner undertake to point out all the objections to this party measure; we present you with those stated by the Council of Revision upon returning the bill, and we ask for them a candid consideration., Believing that the independence of the judiciary has been destroyed, that hereafter our courts will be independent of the people, and entirely dependent upon the Legislature; that our rights of property and liberty of conscience can no longer be regarded as safe from the encroachments of unconstitutional legislation; and knowing of no other remedy which can be adopted consistently with the peace and good order of society, we call upon you to avail yourselves of the opportunity afforded, and, at the next general election, vote for a convention of the people., For the reasons thus presented, and for others no less apparent, the undersigned cannot assent to the passage of the bill, or permit it to become a law, without this evidence of their disapprobation; and they now protest against the reorganization of the judiciary, because--(1) It violates the great principles of free government by subjecting the judiciary to the Legislature., (2) It is a fatal blow at the independence of the judges and the constitutional term of their office., (3) It is a measure not asked for, or wished for, by the people., (4) It will greatly increase the expense of our courts, or else greatly diminish their utility., (5) It will give our courts a political and partisan character, thereby impairing public confidence in their decisions., (6) It will impair our standing with other States and the world., (7)It is a party measure for party purposes, from which no practical good to the people can possibly arise, but which may be the source of immeasurable evils., The undersigned are well aware that this protest will be altogether unavailing with the majority of this body., The blow has already fallen, and we are compelled to stand by, the mournful spectators of the ruin it will cause., We have had the highest state of excitement here for a week past that our community has ever witnessed; and, although the public feeling is somewhat allayed, the curious affair which aroused it is very far from being even yet cleared of mystery., It would take a quire of paper to give you anything like a full account of it, and I therefore only propose a brief outline., The chief personages in the drama are Archibald Fisher, supposed to be murdered, and Archibald Trailor, Henry Trailor, and William Trailor, supposed to have murdered him., The three Trailors are brothers: the first, Arch., as you know, lives in town; the second, Henry, in Clary's Grove; and the third, William, in Warren County; and Fisher, the supposed murdered, being without a family, had made his home with William., On Saturday evening, being the 29th of May, Fisher and William came to Henry's in a one-horse dearborn, and there stayed over Sunday; and on Monday all three came to Springfield (Henry on horseback) and joined Archibald at Myers's, the Dutch carpenter., That evening at supper Fisher was missing, and so next morning some ineffectual search was made for him; and on Tuesday, at one o'clock P.M., William and Henry started home without him., In a day or two Henry and one or two of his Clary-Grove neighbors came back for him again, and advertised his disappearance in the papers., The knowledge of the matter thus far had not been general, and here it dropped entirely, till about the 10th instant, when Keys received a letter from the postmaster in Warren County, that William had arrived at home, and was telling a very mysterious and improbable story about the disappearance of Fisher, which induced the community there to suppose he had been disposed of unfairly., Keys made this letter public, which immediately set the whole town and adjoining county agog., And so it has continued until yesterday., The mass of the people commenced a systematic search for the dead body, while Wickersham was despatched to arrest Henry Trailor at the Grove, and Jim Maxcy to Warren to arrest William., On Monday last, Henry was brought in, and showed an evident inclination to insinuate that he knew Fisher to be dead, and that Arch., and William had killed him., He said he guessed the body could be found in Spring Creek, between the Beardstown road and Hickox's mill., Away the people swept like a herd of buffalo, and cut down Hickox's mill-dam nolens volens, to draw the water out of the pond, and then went up and down and down and up the creek, fishing and raking, and raking and ducking and diving for two days, and, after all, no dead body found., In the meantime a sort of scuffling-ground had been found in the brush in the angle, or point, where the road leading into the woods past the brewery and the one leading in past the brick-yard meet., From the scuffle-ground was the sign of something about the size of a man having been dragged to the edge of the thicket, where it joined the track of some small-wheeled carriage drawn by one horse, as shown by the road-tracks., The carriage-track led off toward Spring Creek., Near this drag-trail Dr. Merryman found two hairs, which, after a long scientific examination, he pronounced to be triangular human hairs, which term, he says, includes within it the whiskers, the hair growing under the arms and on other parts of the body; and he judged that these two were of the whiskers, because the ends were cut, showing that they had flourished in the neighborhood of the razor's operations., On Thursday last Jim Maxcy brought in William Trailor from Warren., On the same day Arch., was arrested and put in jail., Yesterday (Friday) William was put upon his examining trial before May and Lovely., Archibald and Henry were both present., Lamborn prosecuted, and Logan, Baker, and your humble servant defended., A great many witnesses were introduced and examined, but I shall only mention those whose testimony seemed most important., The first of these was Captain Ransdell., He swore that when William and Henry left Springfield for home on Tuesday before mentioned they did not take the direct route,--which, you know, leads by the butcher shop,--but that they followed the street north until they got opposite, or nearly opposite, May's new house, after which he could not see them from where he stood; and it was afterwards proved that in about an hour after they started, they came into the street by the butcher shop from toward the brickyard., Dr. Merryman and others swore to what is stated about the scuffle-ground, drag-trail, whiskers, and carriage tracks., Henry was then introduced by the prosecution., He swore that when they started for home they went out north, as Ransdell stated, and turned down west by the brick-yard into the woods, and there met Archibald; that they proceeded a small distance farther, when he was placed as a sentinel to watch for and announce the approach of any one that might happen that way; that William and Arch., took the dearborn out of the road a small distance to the edge of the thicket, where they stopped, and he saw them lift the body of a man into it; that they then moved off with the carriage in the direction of Hickox's mill, and he loitered about for something like an hour, when William returned with the carriage, but without Arch., and said they had put him in a safe place; that they went somehow he did not know exactly how--into the road close to the brewery, and proceeded on to Clary's Grove., He also stated that some time during the day William told him that he and Arch., had killed Fisher the evening before; that the way they did it was by him William knocking him down with a club, and Arch., then choking him to death., An old man from Warren, called Dr. Gilmore, was then introduced on the part of the defense., He swore that he had known Fisher for several years; that Fisher had resided at his house a long time at each of two different spells--once while he built a barn for him, and once while he was doctored for some chronic disease; that two or three years ago Fisher had a serious hurt in his head by the bursting of a gun, since which he had been subject to continued bad health and occasional aberration of mind., He also stated that on last Tuesday, being the same day that Maxcy arrested William Trailor, he (the doctor) was from home in the early part of the day, and on his return, about eleven o'clock, found Fisher at his house in bed, and apparently very unwell; that he asked him how he came from Springfield; that Fisher said he had come by Peoria, and also told of several other places he had been at more in the direction of Peoria, which showed that he at the time of speaking did not know where he had been wandering about in a state of derangement., He further stated that in about two hours he received a note from one of Trailor's friends, advising him of his arrest, and requesting him to go on to Springfield as a witness, to testify as to the state of Fisher's health in former times; that he immediately set off, calling up two of his neighbors as company, and, riding all evening and all night, overtook Maxcy and William at Lewiston in Fulton County; that Maxcy refusing to discharge Trailor upon his statement, his two neighbors returned and he came on to Springfield., Some question being made as to whether the doctor's story was not a fabrication, several acquaintances of his (among whom was the same postmaster who wrote Keys, as before mentioned) were introduced as sort of compurgators, who swore that they knew the doctor to be of good character for truth and veracity, and generally of good character in every way., Here the testimony ended, and the Trailors were discharged, Arch., and William expressing both in word and manner their entire confidence that Fisher would be found alive at the doctor's by Galloway, Mallory, and Myers, who a day before had been despatched for that purpose; which Henry still protested that no power on earth could ever show Fisher alive., Thus stands this curious affair., When the doctor's story was first made public, it was amusing to scan and contemplate the countenances and hear the remarks of those who had been actively in search for the dead body: some looked quizzical, some melancholy, and some furiously angry., Porter, who had been very active, swore he always knew the man was not dead, and that he had not stirred an inch to hunt for him; Langford, who had taken the lead in cutting down Hickox's mill-dam, and wanted to hang Hickox for objecting, looked most awfully woebegone: he seemed the ""victim of unrequited affection,"" as represented in the comic almanacs we used to laugh over; and Hart, the little drayman that hauled Molly home once, said it was too damned bad to have so much trouble, and no hanging after all., I commenced this letter on yesterday, since which I received yours of the 13th., I stick to my promise to come to Louisville., Nothing new here except what I have written., I have not seen ______ since my last trip, and I am going out there as soon as I mail this letter., It having been charged in some of the public prints that Harry Wilton, late United States marshal for the district of Illinois, had used his office for political effect, in the appointment of deputies for the taking of the census for the year 1840, we, the undersigned, were called upon by Mr. Wilton to examine the papers in his possession relative to these appointments, and to ascertain therefrom the correctness or incorrectness of such charge., We accompanied Mr. Wilton to a room, and examined the matter as fully as we could with the means afforded us., The only sources of information bearing on the subject which were submitted to us were the letters, etc., recommending and opposing the various appointments made, and Mr. Wilton's verbal statements concerning the same., From these letters, etc., it appears that in some instances appointments were made in accordance with the recommendations of leading Whigs, and in opposition to those of leading Democrats; among which instances the appointments at Scott, Wayne, Madison, and Lawrence are the strongest., According to Mr. Wilton's statement of the seventy-six appointments we examined, fifty-four were of Democrats, eleven of Whigs, and eleven of unknown politics., The chief ground of complaint against Mr. Wilton, as we had understood it, was because of his appointment of so many Democratic candidates for the Legislature, thus giving them a decided advantage over their Whig opponents; and consequently our attention was directed rather particularly to that point., We found that there were many such appointments, among which were those in Tazewell, McLean, Iroquois, Coles, Menard, Wayne, Washington, Fayette, etc., ; and we did not learn that there was one instance in which a Whig candidate for the Legislature had been appointed., There was no written evidence before us showing us at what time those appointments were made; but Mr. Wilton stated that they all with one exception were made before those appointed became candidates for the Legislature, and the letters, etc., recommending them all bear date before, and most of them long before, those appointed were publicly announced candidates., ...]",3
208,"[Your ever being happy in her presence, and your intense anxiety about her health, if there were nothing else, would place this beyond all dispute in my mind., I incline to think it probable that your nerves will fail you occasionally for a while; but once you get them firmly guarded now that trouble is over forever., I think, if I were you, in case my mind were not exactly right, I would avoid being idle., I would immediately engage in some business, or go to making preparations for it, which would be the same thing., If you went through the ceremony calmly, or even with sufficient composure not to excite alarm in any present, you are safe beyond question, and in two or three months, to say the most, will be the happiest of men., I would desire you to give my particular respects to Fanny; but perhaps you will not wish her to know you have received this, lest she should desire to see it., Make her write me an answer to my last letter to her; at any rate I would set great value upon a note or letter from her., Write me whenever you have leisure., Yours forever, A. LINCOLN., P. S.--I have been quite a man since you left., Yours of the 10th is duly received., Judge Logan and myself are doing business together now, and we are willing to attend to your cases as you propose., As to the terms, we are willing to attend each case you prepare and send us for $10 (when there shall be no opposition) to be sent in advance, or you to know that it is safe., It takes $5.75 of cost to start upon, that is, $1.75 to clerk, and $2 to each of two publishers of papers., Judge Logan thinks it will take the balance of $20 to carry a case through., This must be advanced from time to time as the services are performed, as the officers will not act without., I do not know whether you can be admitted an attorney of the Federal court in your absence or not; nor is it material, as the business can be done in our names., Thinking it may aid you a little, I send you one of our blank forms of Petitions., It, you will see, is framed to be sworn to before the Federal court clerk, and, in your cases, will have [to] be so far changed as to be sworn to before the clerk of your circuit court; and his certificate must be accompanied with his official seal., The schedules, too, must be attended to., Be sure that they contain the creditors' names, their residences, the amounts due each, the debtors' names, their residences, and the amounts they owe, also all property and where located., Also be sure that the schedules are all signed by the applicants as well as the Petition., Publication will have to be made here in one paper, and in one nearest the residence of the applicant., Write us in each case where the last advertisement is to be sent, whether to you or to what paper., I believe I have now said everything that can be of any advantage., Your friend as ever  I never encourage deceit, and falsehood, especially if you have got a bad memory, is the worst enemy a fellow can have., The fact is truth is your truest friend, no matter what the circumstances are., Notwithstanding this copy-book preamble, my boy, I am inclined to suggest a little prudence on your part., You see I have a congenital aversion to failure, and the sudden announcement to your Uncle Andrew of the success of your ""lamp rubbing"" might possibly prevent your passing the severe physical examination to which you will be subjected in order to enter the Military Academy., You see I should like to have a perfect soldier credited to dear old Illinois--no broken bones, scalp wounds, etc., So I think it might be wise to hand this letter from me in to your good uncle through his room-window after he has had a comfortable dinner, and watch its effect from the top of the pigeon-house., I have just told the folks here in Springfield on this 111th anniversary of the birth of him whose name, mightiest in the cause of civil liberty, still mightiest in the cause of moral reformation, we mention in solemn awe, in naked, deathless splendor, that the one victory we can ever call complete will be that one which proclaims that there is not one slave or one drunkard on the face of God's green earth., Recruit for this victory., Now, boy, on your march, don't you go and forget the old maxim that ""one drop of honey catches more flies than a half-gallon of gall."", Load your musket with this maxim, and smoke it in your pipe., Although the temperance cause has been in progress for near twenty years, it is apparent to all that it is just now being crowned with a degree of success hitherto unparalleled., The list of its friends is daily swelled by the additions of fifties, of hundreds, and of thousands., The cause itself seems suddenly transformed from a cold abstract theory to a living, breathing, active, and powerful chieftain, going forth ""conquering and to conquer."", The citadels of his great adversary are daily being stormed and dismantled; his temple and his altars, where the rites of his idolatrous worship have long been performed, and where human sacrifices have long been wont to be made, are daily desecrated and deserted., The triumph of the conqueror's fame is sounding from hill to hill, from sea to sea, and from land to land, and calling millions to his standard at a blast., For this new and splendid success we heartily rejoice., That that success is so much greater now than heretofore is doubtless owing to rational causes; and if we would have it continue, we shall do well to inquire what those causes are., The warfare heretofore waged against the demon intemperance has somehow or other been erroneous., Either the champions engaged or the tactics they adopted have not been the most proper., These champions for the most part have been preachers, lawyers, and hired agents., Between these and the mass of mankind there is a want of approachability, if the term be admissible, partially, at least, fatal to their success., They are supposed to have no sympathy of feeling or interest with those very persons whom it is their object to convince and persuade., And again, it is so common and so easy to ascribe motives to men of these classes other than those they profess to act upon., The preacher, it is said, advocates temperance because he is a fanatic, and desires a union of the Church and State; the lawyer from his pride and vanity of hearing himself speak; and the hired agent for his salary., But when one who has long been known as a victim of intemperance bursts the fetters that have bound him, and appears before his neighbors ""clothed and in his right mind,"" a redeemed specimen of long-lost humanity, and stands up, with tears of joy trembling in his eyes, to tell of the miseries once endured, now to be endured no more forever; of his once naked and starving children, now clad and fed comfortably; of a wife long weighed down with woe, weeping, and a broken heart, now restored to health, happiness, and a renewed affection; and how easily it is all done, once it is resolved to be done; how simple his language!, there is a logic and an eloquence in it that few with human feelings can resist., They cannot say that he desires a union of Church and State, for he is not a church member; they cannot say he is vain of hearing himself speak, for his whole demeanor shows he would gladly avoid speaking at all; they cannot say he speaks for pay, for he receives none, and asks for none., Nor can his sincerity in any way be doubted, or his sympathy for those he would persuade to imitate his example be denied., In my judgment, it is to the battles of this new class of champions that our late success is greatly, perhaps chiefly, owing., But, had the old-school champions themselves been of the most wise selecting, was their system of tactics the most judicious?, It seems to me it was not., Too much denunciation against dram-sellers and dram-drinkers was indulged in., This I think was both impolitic and unjust., It was impolitic, because it is not much in the nature of man to be driven to anything; still less to be driven about that which is exclusively his own business; and least of all where such driving is to be submitted to at the expense of pecuniary interest or burning appetite., When the dram-seller and drinker were incessantly told not in accents of entreaty and persuasion, diffidently addressed by erring man to an erring brother, but in the thundering tones of anathema and denunciation with which the lordly judge often groups together all the crimes of the felon's life, and thrusts them in his face just ere he passes sentence of death upon him that they were the authors of all the vice and misery and crime in the land; that they were the manufacturers and material of all the thieves and robbers and murderers that infest the earth; that their houses were the workshops of the devil; and that their persons should be shunned by all the good and virtuous, as moral pestilences--I say, when they were told all this, and in this way, it is not wonderful that they were slow to acknowledge the truth of such denunciations, and to join the ranks of their denouncers in a hue and cry against themselves., To have expected them to do otherwise than they did to have expected them not to meet denunciation with denunciation, crimination with crimination, and anathema with anathema--was to expect a reversal of human nature, which is God's decree and can never be reversed., When the conduct of men is designed to be influenced, persuasion, kind, unassuming persuasion, should ever be adopted., It is an old and a true maxim that ""a drop of honey catches more flies than a gallon of gall."", So with men., If you would win a man to your cause, first convince him that you are his sincere friend., Therein is a drop of honey that catches his heart, which, say what he will, is the great highroad to his reason; and which, when once gained, you will find but little trouble in convincing his judgment of the justice of your cause, if indeed that cause really be a just one., On the contrary, assume to dictate to his judgment, or to command his action, or to mark him as one to be shunned and despised, and he will retreat within himself, close all the avenues to his head and his heart; and though your cause be naked truth itself, transformed to the heaviest lance, harder than steel, and sharper than steel can be made, and though you throw it with more than herculean force and precision, you shall be no more able to pierce him than to penetrate the hard shell of a tortoise with a rye straw., Such is man, and so must he be understood by those who would lead him, even to his own best interests., On this point the Washingtonians greatly excel the temperance advocates of former times., Those whom they desire to convince and persuade are their old friends and companions., They know they are not demons, nor even the worst of men; they know that generally they are kind, generous, and charitable even beyond the example of their more staid and sober neighbors., They are practical philanthropists; and they glow with a generous and brotherly zeal that mere theorizers are incapable of feeling., Benevolence and charity possess their hearts entirely; and out of the abundance of their hearts their tongues give utterance; ""love through all their actions runs, and all their words are mild."", In this spirit they speak and act, and in the same they are heard and regarded., And when such is the temper of the advocate, and such of the audience, no good cause can be unsuccessful., But I have said that denunciations against dramsellers and dram-drinkers are unjust, as well as impolitic., Let us see., I have not inquired at what period of time the use of intoxicating liquors commenced; nor is it important to know., It is sufficient that, to all of us who now inhabit the world, the practice of drinking them is just as old as the world itself that is, we have seen the one just as long as we have seen the other., When all such of us as have now reached the years of maturity first opened our eyes upon the stage of existence, we found intoxicating liquor recognized by everybody, used by everybody, repudiated by nobody., It commonly entered into the first draught of the infant and the last draught of the dying man., From the sideboard of the parson down to the ragged pocket of the houseless loafer, it was constantly found., Physicians proscribed it in this, that, and the other disease; government provided it for soldiers and sailors; and to have a rolling or raising, a husking or ""hoedown,"" anywhere about without it was positively insufferable., So, too, it was everywhere a respectable article of manufacture and merchandise., The making of it was regarded as an honorable livelihood, and he who could make most was the most enterprising and respectable., Large and small manufactories of it were everywhere erected, in which all the earthly goods of their owners were invested., Wagons drew it from town to town; boats bore it from clime to clime, and the winds wafted it from nation to nation; and merchants bought and sold it, by wholesale and retail, with precisely the same feelings on the part of the seller, buyer, and bystander as are felt at the selling and buying of ploughs, beef, bacon, or any other of the real necessaries of life., Universal public opinion not only tolerated but recognized and adopted its use., It is true that even then it was known and acknowledged that many were greatly injured by it; but none seemed to think the injury arose from the use of a bad thing, but from the abuse of a very good thing., The victims of it were to be pitied and compassionated, just as are the heirs of consumption and other hereditary diseases., Their failing was treated as a misfortune, and not as a crime, or even as a disgrace., If, then, what I have been saying is true, is it wonderful that some should think and act now as all thought and acted twenty years ago?, and is it just to assail, condemn, or despise them for doing so?, The universal sense of mankind on any subject is an argument, or at least an influence, not easily overcome., The success of the argument in favor of the existence of an overruling Providence mainly depends upon that sense; and men ought not in justice to be denounced for yielding to it in any case, or giving it up slowly, especially when they are backed by interest, fixed habits, or burning appetites., Another error, as it seems to me, into which the old reformers fell, was the position that all habitual drunkards were utterly incorrigible, and therefore must be turned adrift and damned without remedy in order that the grace of temperance might abound, to the temperate then, and to all mankind some hundreds of years thereafter., There is in this some thing so repugnant to humanity, so uncharitable, so cold-blooded and feelingless, that it, never did nor ever can enlist the enthusiasm of a popular cause., We could not love the man who taught it we could not hear him with patience., The heart could not throw open its portals to it, the generous man could not adopt it--it could not mix with his blood., It looked so fiendishly selfish, so like throwing fathers and brothers overboard to lighten the boat for our security, that the noble-minded shrank from the manifest meanness of the thing., ...]",3
209,"[Reign of reason, all hail!, And when the victory shall be complete, when there shall be neither a slave nor a drunkard on the earth, how proud the title of that land which may truly claim to be the birthplace and the cradle of both those revolutions that shall have ended in that victory., How nobly distinguished that people who shall have planted and nurtured to maturity both the political and moral freedom of their species., This is the one hundred and tenth anniversary of the birthday of Washington; we are met to celebrate this day., Washington is the mightiest name of earth long since mightiest in the cause of civil liberty, still mightiest in moral reformation., On that name no eulogy is expected., It cannot be., To add brightness to the sun or glory to the name of Washington is alike impossible., Let none attempt it., In solemn awe pronounce the name, and in its naked deathless splendor leave it shining on., DEAR SPEED:--Yours of the 16th instant, announcing that Miss Fanny and you are ""no more twain, but one flesh,"" reached me this morning., I have no way of telling you how much happiness I wish you both, though I believe you both can conceive it., I feel somewhat jealous of both of you now: you will be so exclusively concerned for one another, that I shall be forgotten entirely., My acquaintance with Miss Fanny (I call her this, lest you should think I am speaking of your mother) was too short for me to reasonably hope to long be remembered by her; and still I am sure I shall not forget her soon., Try if you cannot remind her of that debt she owes me--and be sure you do not interfere to prevent her paying it., I regret to learn that you have resolved to not return to Illinois., I shall be very lonesome without you., How miserably things seem to be arranged in this world!, If we have no friends, we have no pleasure; and if we have them, we are sure to lose them, and be doubly pained by the loss., I did hope she and you would make your home here; but I own I have no right to insist., You owe obligations to her ten thousand times more sacred than you can owe to others, and in that light let them be respected and observed., It is natural that she should desire to remain with her relatives and friends., As to friends, however, she could not need them anywhere: she would have them in abundance here., Give my kind remembrance to Mr. Williamson and his family, particularly Miss Elizabeth; also to your mother, brother, and sisters., Ask little Eliza Davis if she will ride to town with me if I come there again., And finally, give Fanny a double reciprocation of all the love she sent me., Write me often, and believe me  P. S. Poor Easthouse is gone at last., He died awhile before day this morning., They say he was very loath to die...., I received yours of the 12th written the day you went down to William's place, some days since, but delayed answering it till I should receive the promised one of the 16th, which came last night., I opened the letter with intense anxiety and trepidation; so much so, that, although it turned out better than I expected, I have hardly yet, at a distance of ten hours, become calm., I tell you, Speed, our forebodings (for which you and I are peculiar) are all the worst sort of nonsense., I fancied, from the time I received your letter of Saturday, that the one of Wednesday was never to come, and yet it did come, and what is more, it is perfectly clear, both from its tone and handwriting, that you were much happier, or, if you think the term preferable, less miserable, when you wrote it than when you wrote the last one before., You had so obviously improved at the very time I so much fancied you would have grown worse., You say that something indescribably horrible and alarming still haunts you., You will not say that three months from now, I will venture., When your nerves once get steady now, the whole trouble will be over forever., Nor should you become impatient at their being even very slow in becoming steady., Again you say, you much fear that that Elysium of which you have dreamed so much is never to be realized., Well, if it shall not, I dare swear it will not be the fault of her who is now your wife., I now have no doubt that it is the peculiar misfortune of both you and me to dream dreams of Elysium far exceeding all that anything earthly can realize., Far short of your dreams as you may be, no woman could do more to realize them than that same black-eyed Fanny., If you could but contemplate her through my imagination, it would appear ridiculous to you that any one should for a moment think of being unhappy with her., My old father used to have a saying that ""If you make a bad bargain, hug it all the tighter""; and it occurs to me that if the bargain you have just closed can possibly be called a bad one, it is certainly the most pleasant one for applying that maxim to which my fancy can by any effort picture., I write another letter, enclosing this, which you can show her, if she desires it., I do this because she would think strangely, perhaps, should you tell her that you received no letters from me, or, telling her you do, refuse to let her see them., I close this, entertaining the confident hope that every successive letter I shall have from you (which I here pray may not be few, nor far between) may show you possessing a more steady hand and cheerful heart than the last preceding it., Yours of the 10th instant was received three or four days since., You know I am sincere when I tell you the pleasure its contents gave me was, and is, inexpressible., As to your farm matter, I have no sympathy with you., I have no farm, nor ever expect to have, and consequently have not studied the subject enough to be much interested with it., I can only say that I am glad you are satisfied and pleased with it., But on that other subject, to me of the most intense interest whether in joy or sorrow, I never had the power to withhold my sympathy from you., It cannot be told how it now thrills me with joy to hear you say you are ""far happier than you ever expected to be."", That much I know is enough., I know you too well to suppose your expectations were not, at least, sometimes extravagant, and if the reality exceeds them all, I say, Enough, dear Lord., I am not going beyond the truth when I tell you that the short space it took me to read your last letter gave me more pleasure than the total sum of all I have enjoyed since the fatal 1st of January, 1841., Since then it seems to me I should have been entirely happy, but for the never-absent idea that there is one still unhappy whom I have contributed to make so., That still kills my soul., I cannot but reproach myself for even wishing to be happy while she is otherwise., She accompanied a large party on the railroad cars to Jacksonville last Monday, and on her return spoke, so that I heard of it, of having enjoyed the trip exceedingly., God be praised for that., You know with what sleepless vigilance I have watched you ever since the commencement of your affair; and although I am almost confident it is useless, I cannot forbear once more to say that I think it is even yet possible for your spirits to flag down and leave you miserable., If they should, don't fail to remember that they cannot long remain so., One thing I can tell you which I know you will be glad to hear, and that is that I have seen--and scrutinized her feelings as well as I could, and am fully convinced she is far happier now than she has been for the last fifteen months past., You will see by the last Sangamon Journal, that I made a temperance speech on the 22d of February, which I claim that Fanny and you shall read as an act of charity to me; for I cannot learn that anybody else has read it, or is likely to., Fortunately it is not very long, and I shall deem it a sufficient compliance with my request if one of you listens while the other reads it., As to your Lockridge matter, it is only necessary to say that there has been no court since you left, and that the next commences to-morrow morning, during which I suppose we cannot fail to get a judgment., I wish you would learn of Everett what he would take, over and above a discharge for all the trouble we have been at, to take his business out of our hands and give it to somebody else., It is impossible to collect money on that or any other claim here now; and although you know I am not a very petulant man, I declare I am almost out of patience with Mr. Everett's importunity., It seems like he not only writes all the letters he can himself, but gets everybody else in Louisville and vicinity to be constantly writing to us about his claim., I have always said that Mr. Everett is a very clever fellow, and I am very sorry he cannot be obliged; but it does seem to me he ought to know we are interested to collect his claim, and therefore would do it if we could., I am neither joking nor in a pet when I say we would thank him to transfer his business to some other, without any compensation for what we have done, provided he will see the court cost paid, for which we are security., The sweet violet you inclosed came safely to hand, but it was so dry, and mashed so flat, that it crumbled to dust at the first attempt to handle it., The juice that mashed out of it stained a place in the letter, which I mean to preserve and cherish for the sake of her who procured it to be sent., My renewed good wishes to her in particular, and generally to all such of your relations who know me., Yours of the 16th June was received only a day or two since., It was not mailed at Louisville till the 25th., You speak of the great time that has elapsed since I wrote you., Let me explain that., Your letter reached here a day or two after I started on the circuit., I was gone five or six weeks, so that I got the letters only a few weeks before Butler started to your country., I thought it scarcely worth while to write you the news which he could and would tell you more in detail., On his return he told me you would write me soon, and so I waited for your letter., As to my having been displeased with your advice, surely you know better than that., I know you do, and therefore will not labor to convince you., True, that subject is painful to me; but it is not your silence, or the silence of all the world, that can make me forget it., I acknowledge the correctness of your advice too; but before I resolve to do the one thing or the other, I must gain my confidence in my own ability to keep my resolves when they are made., In that ability you know I once prided myself as the only or chief gem of my character; that gem I lost--how and where you know too well., I have not yet regained it; and until I do, I cannot trust myself in any matter of much importance., I believe now that had you understood my case at the time as well as I understand yours afterward, by the aid you would have given me I should have sailed through clear, but that does not now afford me sufficient confidence to begin that or the like of that again., You make a kind acknowledgment of your obligations to me for your present happiness., I am pleased with that acknowledgment., But a thousand times more am I pleased to know that you enjoy a degree of happiness worthy of an acknowledgment., The truth is, I am not sure that there was any merit with me in the part I took in your difficulty; I was drawn to it by a fate., If I would I could not have done less than I did., I always was superstitious; I believe God made me one of the instruments of bringing your Fanny and you together, which union I have no doubt He had fore-ordained., Whatever He designs He will do for me yet., ""Stand still, and see the salvation of the Lord"" is my text just now., If, as you say, you have told Fanny all, I should have no objection to her seeing this letter, but for its reference to our friend here: let her seeing it depend upon whether she has ever known anything of my affairs; and if she has not, do not let her., ...]",3
210,"[With him truth is out of the question; and as for getting a good, bright, passable lie out of him, you might as well try to strike fire from a cake of tallow., I stick to it, it's all an infernal Whig lie!"", ""A Whig lie!, Highty tighty!"", ""Yes, a Whig lie; and it's just like everything the cursed British Whigs do., First they'll do some divilment, and then they'll tell a lie to hide it., And they don't care how plain a lie it is; they think they can cram any sort of a one down the throats of the ignorant Locofocos, as they call the Democrats."", ""Why, Jeff, you 're crazy: you don't mean to say Shields is a Whig!"", ""Yes, I do."", ""Why, look here!, the proclamation is in your own Democratic paper, as you call it."", ""I know it; and what of that?, They only printed it to let us Democrats see the deviltry the Whigs are at."", ""Well, but Shields is the auditor of this Loco--I mean this Democratic State."", ""So he is, and Tyler appointed him to office."", ""Tyler appointed him?"", ""Yes (if you must chaw it over), Tyler appointed him; or, if it was n't him, it was old Granny Harrison, and that's all one., I tell you, Aunt 'Becca, there's no mistake about his being a Whig., Why, his very looks shows it; everything about him shows it: if I was deaf and blind, I could tell him by the smell., I seed him when I was down in Springfield last winter., They had a sort of a gatherin' there one night among the grandees, they called a fair., All the gals about town was there, and all the handsome widows and married women, finickin' about trying to look like gals, tied as tight in the middle, and puffed out at both ends, like bundles of fodder that had n't been stacked yet, but wanted stackin' pretty bad., And then they had tables all around the house kivered over with [------] caps and pincushions and ten thousand such little knick-knacks, tryin' to sell 'em to the fellows that were bowin', and scrapin' and kungeerin' about 'em., They would n't let no Democrats in, for fear they'd disgust the ladies, or scare the little gals, or dirty the floor., I looked in at the window, and there was this same fellow Shields floatin' about on the air, without heft or earthly substances, just like a lock of cat fur where cats had been fighting., ""He was paying his money to this one, and that one, and t' other one, and sufferin' great loss because it was n't silver instead of State paper; and the sweet distress he seemed to be in,--his very features, in the ecstatic agony of his soul, spoke audibly and distinctly, 'Dear girls, it is distressing, but I cannot marry you all., Too well I know how much you suffer; but do, do remember, it is not my fault that I am so handsome and so interesting.', ""As this last was expressed by a most exquisite contortion of his face, he seized hold of one of their hands, and squeezed, and held on to it about a quarter of an hour., 'Oh, my good fellow!', says I to myself, 'if that was one of our Democratic gals in the Lost Townships, the way you 'd get a brass pin let into you would be about up to the head.', He a Democrat!, Fiddlesticks!, I tell you, Aunt 'Becca, he's a Whig, and no mistake; nobody but a Whig could make such a conceity dunce of himself."", ""Well,"" says I, ""maybe he is; but, if he is, I 'm mistaken the worst sort., Maybe so, maybe so; but, if I am, I'll suffer by it; I'll be a Democrat if it turns out that Shields is a Whig, considerin' you shall be a Whig if he turns out a Democrat."", ""A bargain, by jingoes!"", says he; ""but how will we find out?"", ""Why,"" says I, ""we'll just write and ax the printer."", ""Agreed again!"", says he; ""and by thunder!, if it does turn out that Shields is a Democrat, I never will----""  ""Jefferson!, Jefferson!"", ""What do you want, Peggy?"", ""Do get through your everlasting clatter some time, and bring me a gourd of water; the child's been crying for a drink this livelong hour."", ""Let it die, then; it may as well die for water as to be taxed to death to fatten officers of State."", Jeff run off to get the water, though, just like he hadn't been saying anything spiteful, for he's a raal good-hearted fellow, after all, once you get at the foundation of him., I walked into the house, and, ""Why, Peggy,"" says I, ""I declare we like to forgot you altogether."", ""Oh, yes,"" says she, ""when a body can't help themselves, everybody soon forgets 'em; but, thank God!, by day after to-morrow I shall be well enough to milk the cows, and pen the calves, and wring the contrary ones' tails for 'em, and no thanks to nobody."", ""Good evening, Peggy,"" says I, and so I sloped, for I seed she was mad at me for making Jeff neglect her so long., And now, Mr., Printer, will you be sure to let us know in your next paper whether this Shields is a Whig or a Democrat?, I don't care about it for myself, for I know well enough how it is already; but I want to convince Jeff., It may do some good to let him, and others like him, know who and what these officers of State are., It may help to send the present hypocritical set to where they belong, and to fill the places they now disgrace with men who will do more work for less pay, and take fewer airs while they are doing it., It ain't sensible to think that the same men who get us in trouble will change their course; and yet it's pretty plain if some change for the better is not made, it's not long that either Peggy or I or any of us will have a cow left to milk, or a calf's tail to wring., We hear you are to visit Indianapolis, Indiana, on the 5th Of October next., If our information in this is correct we hope you will not deny us the pleasure of seeing you in our State., We are aware of the toil necessarily incident to a journey by one circumstanced as you are; but once you have embarked, as you have already determined to do, the toil would not be greatly augmented by extending the journey to our capital., The season of the year will be most favorable for good roads, and pleasant weather; and although we cannot but believe you would be highly gratified with such a visit to the prairie-land, the pleasure it would give us and thousands such as we is beyond all question., You have never visited Illinois, or at least this portion of it; and should you now yield to our request, we promise you such a reception as shall be worthy of the man on whom are now turned the fondest hopes of a great and suffering nation., Please inform us at the earliest convenience whether we may expect you., I regret that my absence on public business compelled me to postpone a matter of private consideration a little longer than I could have desired., It will only be necessary, however, to account for it by informing you that I have been to Quincy on business that would not admit of delay., I will now state briefly the reasons of my troubling you with this communication, the disagreeable nature of which I regret, as I had hoped to avoid any difficulty with any one in Springfield while residing there, by endeavoring to conduct myself in such a way amongst both my political friends and opponents as to escape the necessity of any., Whilst thus abstaining from giving provocation, I have become the object of slander, vituperation, and personal abuse, which were I capable of submitting to, I would prove myself worthy of the whole of it., In two or three of the last numbers of the Sangamon Journal, articles of the most personal nature and calculated to degrade me have made their appearance., On inquiring, I was informed by the editor of that paper, through the medium of my friend General Whitesides, that you are the author of those articles., This information satisfies me that I have become by some means or other the object of your secret hostility., I will not take the trouble of inquiring into the reason of all this; but I will take the liberty of requiring a full, positive, and absolute retraction of all offensive allusions used by you in these communications, in relation to my private character and standing as a man, as an apology for the insults conveyed in them., This may prevent consequences which no one will regret more than myself., JYour note of to-day was handed me by General Whitesides., In that note you say you have been informed, through the medium of the editor of the Journal, that I am the author of certain articles in that paper which you deem personally abusive of you; and without stopping to inquire whether I really am the author, or to point out what is offensive in them, you demand an unqualified retraction of all that is offensive, and then proceed to hint at consequences., Now, sir, there is in this so much assumption of facts and so much of menace as to consequences, that I cannot submit to answer that note any further than I have, and to add that the consequences to which I suppose you allude would be matter of as great regret to me as it possibly could to you., In reply to my note of this date, you intimate that I assume facts and menace consequences, and that you cannot submit to answer it further., As now, sir, you desire it, I will be a little more particular., The editor of the Sangamon Journal gave me to understand that you are the author of an article which appeared, I think, in that paper of the 2d September instant, headed ""The Lost Townships,"" and signed Rebecca or 'Becca., I would therefore take the liberty of asking whether you are the author of said article, or any other over the same signature which has appeared in any of the late numbers of that paper., If so, I repeat my request of an absolute retraction of all offensive allusions contained therein in relation to my private character and standing., If you are not the author of any of these articles, your denial will be sufficient., I will say further, it is not my intention to menace, but to do myself justice., In case Whitesides shall signify a wish to adjust this affair without further difficulty, let him know that if the present papers be withdrawn, and a note from Mr. Shields asking to know if I am the author of the articles of which he complains, and asking that I shall make him gentlemanly satisfaction if I am the author, and this without menace, or dictation as to what that satisfaction shall be, a pledge is made that the following answer shall be given:  ""I did write the 'Lost Townships' letter which appeared in the Journal of the 2d instant, but had no participation in any form in any other article alluding to you., I wrote that wholly for political effect--I had no intention of injuring your personal or private character or standing as a man or a gentleman; and I did not then think, and do not now think, that that article could produce or has produced that effect against you; and had I anticipated such an effect I would have forborne to write it., And I will add that your conduct toward me, so far as I know, had always been gentlemanly; and that I had no personal pique against you, and no cause for any."", If this should be done, I leave it with you to arrange what shall and what shall not be published., If nothing like this is done, the preliminaries of the fight are to be--  First., Weapons: Cavalry broadswords of the largest size, precisely equal in all respects, and such as now used by the cavalry company at Jacksonville., Second., Position: A plank ten feet long, and from nine to twelve inches broad, to be firmly fixed on edge, on the ground, as the line between us, which neither is to pass his foot over upon forfeit of his life., Next a line drawn on the ground on either side of said plank and parallel with it, each at the distance of the whole length of the sword and three feet additional from the plank; and the passing of his own such line by either party during the fight shall be deemed a surrender of the contest., Third., Time: On Thursday evening at five o'clock, if you can get it so; but in no case to be at a greater distance of time than Friday evening at five o'clock., Fourth., Place: Within three miles of Alton, on the opposite side of the river, the particular spot to be agreed on by you., Any preliminary details coming within the above rules you are at liberty to make at your discretion; but you are in no case to swerve from these rules, or to pass beyond their limits., You have heard of my duel with Shields, and I have now to inform you that the dueling business still rages in this city., Day before yesterday Shields challenged Butler, who accepted, and proposed fighting next morning at sunrise in Bob Allen's meadow, one hundred yards' distance, with rifles., To this Whitesides, Shields's second, said ""No,"" because of the law., Thus ended duel No., 2., ...]",3
211,"[And, again, by the tariff system the whole revenue is paid by the consumers of foreign goods, and those chiefly the luxuries, and not the necessaries, of life., By this system the man who contents himself to live upon the products of his own country pays nothing at all., And surely that country is extensive enough, and its products abundant and varied enough, to answer all the real wants of its people., In short, by this system the burthen of revenue falls almost entirely on the wealthy and luxurious few, while the substantial and laboring many who live at home, and upon home products, go entirely free., By the direct-tax system none can escape., However strictly the citizen may exclude from his premises all foreign luxuries,--fine cloths, fine silks, rich wines, golden chains, and diamond rings,--still, for the possession of his house, his barn, and his homespun, he is to be perpetually haunted and harassed by the tax-gatherer., With these views we leave it to be determined whether we or our opponents are the more truly democratic on the subject., The third resolution declares the necessity and propriety of a national bank., During the last fifty years so much has been said and written both as to the constitutionality and expediency of such an institution, that we could not hope to improve in the least on former discussions of the subject, were we to undertake it., We, therefore, upon the question of constitutionality content ourselves with remarking the facts that the first national bank was established chiefly by the same men who formed the Constitution, at a time when that instrument was but two years old, and receiving the sanction, as President, of the immortal Washington; that the second received the sanction, as President, of Mr. Madison, to whom common consent has awarded the proud title of ""Father of the Constitution""; and subsequently the sanction of the Supreme Court, the most enlightened judicial tribunal in the world., Upon the question of expediency, we only ask you to examine the history of the times during the existence of the two banks, and compare those times with the miserable present., The fourth resolution declares the expediency of Mr. Clay's land bill., Much incomprehensible jargon is often used against the constitutionality of this measure., We forbear, in this place, attempting an answer to it, simply because, in our opinion, those who urge it are through party zeal resolved not to see or acknowledge the truth., The question of expediency, at least so far as Illinois is concerned, seems to us the clearest imaginable., By the bill we are to receive annually a large sum of money, no part of which we otherwise receive., The precise annual sum cannot be known in advance; it doubtless will vary in different years., Still it is something to know that in the last year--a year of almost unparalleled pecuniary pressure--it amounted to more than forty thousand dollars., This annual income, in the midst of our almost insupportable difficulties, in the days of our severest necessity, our political opponents are furiously resolving to take and keep from us., And for what?, Many silly reasons are given, as is usual in cases where a single good one is not to be found., One is that by giving us the proceeds of the lands we impoverish the national treasury, and thereby render necessary an increase of the tariff., This may be true; but if so, the amount of it only is that those whose pride, whose abundance of means, prompt them to spurn the manufactures of our country, and to strut in British cloaks and coats and pantaloons, may have to pay a few cents more on the yard for the cloth that makes them., A terrible evil, truly, to the Illinois farmer, who never wore, nor ever expects to wear, a single yard of British goods in his whole life., Another of their reasons is that by the passage and continuance of Mr. Clay's bill, we prevent the passage of a bill which would give us more., This, if it were sound in itself, is waging destructive war with the former position; for if Mr. Clay's bill impoverishes the treasury too much, what shall be said of one that impoverishes it still more?, But it is not sound in itself., It is not true that Mr. Clay's bill prevents the passage of one more favorable to us of the new States., Considering the strength and opposite interest of the old States, the wonder is that they ever permitted one to pass so favorable as Mr. Clay's., The last twenty-odd years' efforts to reduce the price of the lands, and to pass graduation bills and cession bills, prove the assertion to be true; and if there were no experience in support of it, the reason itself is plain., The States in which none, or few, of the public lands lie, and those consequently interested against parting with them except for the best price, are the majority; and a moment's reflection will show that they must ever continue the majority, because by the time one of the original new States (Ohio, for example) becomes populous and gets weight in Congress, the public lands in her limits are so nearly sold out that in every point material to this question she becomes an old State., She does not wish the price reduced, because there is none left for her citizens to buy; she does not wish them ceded to the States in which they lie, because they no longer lie in her limits, and she will get nothing by the cession., In the nature of things, the States interested in the reduction of price, in graduation, in cession, and in all similar projects, never can be the majority., Nor is there reason to hope that any of them can ever succeed as a Democratic party measure, because we have heretofore seen that party in full power, year after year, with many of their leaders making loud professions in favor of these projects, and yet doing nothing., What reason, then, is there to believe they will hereafter do better?, In every light in which we can view this question, it amounts simply to this: Shall we accept our share of the proceeds under Mr. Clay's bill, or shall we rather reject that and get nothing?, The fifth resolution recommends that a Whig candidate for Congress be run in every district, regardless of the chances of success., We are aware that it is sometimes a temporary gratification, when a friend cannot succeed, to be able to choose between opponents; but we believe that that gratification is the seed-time which never fails to be followed by a most abundant harvest of bitterness., By this policy we entangle ourselves., By voting for our opponents, such of us as do it in some measure estop ourselves to complain of their acts, however glaringly wrong we may believe them to be., By this policy no one portion of our friends can ever be certain as to what course another portion may adopt; and by this want of mutual and perfect understanding our political identity is partially frittered away and lost., And, again, those who are thus elected by our aid ever become our bitterest persecutors., Take a few prominent examples., In 1830 Reynolds was elected Governor; in 1835 we exerted our whole strength to elect Judge Young to the United States Senate, which effort, though failing, gave him the prominence that subsequently elected him; in 1836 General Ewing, was so elected to the United States Senate; and yet let us ask what three men have been more perseveringly vindictive in their assaults upon all our men and measures than they?, During the last summer the whole State was covered with pamphlet editions of misrepresentations against us, methodized into chapters and verses, written by two of these same men,--Reynolds and Young, in which they did not stop at charging us with error merely, but roundly denounced us as the designing enemies of human liberty, itself., If it be the will of Heaven that such men shall politically live, be it so; but never, never again permit them to draw a particle of their sustenance from us., The sixth resolution recommends the adoption of the convention system for the nomination of candidates., This we believe to be of the very first importance., Whether the system is right in itself we do not stop to inquire; contenting ourselves with trying to show that, while our opponents use it, it is madness in us not to defend ourselves with it., Experience has shown that we cannot successfully defend ourselves without it., For examples, look at the elections of last year., Our candidate for governor, with the approbation of a large portion of the party, took the field without a nomination, and in open opposition to the system., Wherever in the counties the Whigs had held conventions and nominated candidates for the Legislature, the aspirants who were not nominated were induced to rebel against the nominations, and to become candidates, as is said, ""on their own hook."", And, go where you would into a large Whig county, you were sure to find the Whigs not contending shoulder to shoulder against the common enemy, but divided into factions, and fighting furiously with one another., The election came, and what was the result?, The governor beaten, the Whig vote being decreased many thousands since 1840, although the Democratic vote had not increased any., Beaten almost everywhere for members of the Legislature,--Tazewell, with her four hundred Whig majority, sending a delegation half Democratic; Vermillion, with her five hundred, doing the same; Coles, with her four hundred, sending two out of three; and Morgan, with her two hundred and fifty, sending three out of four,--and this to say nothing of the numerous other less glaring examples; the whole winding up with the aggregate number of twenty-seven Democratic representatives sent from Whig counties., As to the senators, too, the result was of the same character., And it is most worthy to be remembered that of all the Whigs in the State who ran against the regular nominees, a single one only was elected., Although they succeeded in defeating the nominees almost by scores, they too were defeated, and the spoils chucklingly borne off by the common enemy., We do not mention the fact of many of the Whigs opposing the convention system heretofore for the purpose of censuring them., Far from it., We expressly protest against such a conclusion., We know they were generally, perhaps universally, as good and true Whigs as we ourselves claim to be., We mention it merely to draw attention to the disastrous result it produced, as an example forever hereafter to be avoided., That ""union is strength"" is a truth that has been known, illustrated, and declared in various ways and forms in all ages of the world., That great fabulist and philosopher Aesop illustrated it by his fable of the bundle of sticks; and he whose wisdom surpasses that of all philosophers has declared that ""a house divided against itself cannot stand."", It is to induce our friends to act upon this important and universally acknowledged truth that we urge the adoption of the convention system., Reflection will prove that there is no other way of practically applying it., In its application we know there will be incidents temporarily painful; but, after all, those incidents will be fewer and less intense with than without the system., If two friends aspire to the same office it is certain that both cannot succeed., Would it not, then, be much less painful to have the question decided by mutual friends some time before, than to snarl and quarrel until the day of election, and then both be beaten by the common enemy?, Before leaving this subject, we think proper to remark that we do not understand the resolution as intended to recommend the application of the convention system to the nomination of candidates for the small offices no way connected with politics; though we must say we do not perceive that such an application of it would be wrong., The seventh resolution recommends the holding of district conventions in May next, for the purpose of nominating candidates for Congress., The propriety of this rests upon the same reasons with that of the sixth, and therefore needs no further discussion., The eighth and ninth also relate merely to the practical application of the foregoing, and therefore need no discussion., Before closing, permit us to add a few reflections on the present condition and future prospects of the Whig party., In almost all the States we have fallen into the minority, and despondency seems to prevail universally among us., Is there just cause for this?, In 1840 we carried the nation by more than a hundred and forty thousand majority., Our opponents charged that we did it by fraudulent voting; but whatever they may have believed, we know the charge to be untrue., Where, now, is that mighty host?, Have they gone over to the enemy?, Let the results of the late elections answer., Every State which has fallen off from the Whig cause since 1840 has done so not by giving more Democratic votes than they did then, but by giving fewer Whig., Bouck, who was elected Democratic Governor of New York last fall by more than 15,000 majority, had not then as many votes as he had in 1840, when he was beaten by seven or eight thousand., And so has it been in all the other States which have fallen away from our cause., From this it is evident that tens of thousands in the late elections have not voted at all., Who and what are they?, is an important question, as respects the future., They can come forward and give us the victory again., That all, or nearly all, of them are Whigs is most apparent., Our opponents, stung to madness by the defeat of 1840, have ever since rallied with more than their usual unanimity., It has not been they that have been kept from the polls., These facts show what the result must be, once the people again rally in their entire strength., Proclaim these facts, and predict this result; and although unthinking opponents may smile at us, the sagacious ones will ""believe and tremble."", And why shall the Whigs not all rally again?, Are their principles less dear now than in 1840?, Have any of their doctrines since then been discovered to be untrue?, It is true, the victory of 1840 did not produce the happy results anticipated; but it is equally true, as we believe, that the unfortunate death of General Harrison was the cause of the failure., ...]",3
212,"[Write me at Springfield how the matter is., Don't show or speak of this letter., Butler informs me that he received a letter from you, in which you expressed some doubt whether the Whigs of Sangamon will support you cordially., You may, at once, dismiss all fears on that subject., We have already resolved to make a particular effort to give you the very largest majority possible in our county., From this, no Whig of the county dissents., We have many objects for doing it., We make it a matter of honor and pride to do it; we do it because we love the Whig cause; we do it because we like you personally; and last, we wish to convince you that we do not bear that hatred to Morgan County that you people have so long seemed to imagine., You will see by the journals of this week that we propose, upon pain of losing a barbecue, to give you twice as great a majority in this county as you shall receive in your own., I got up the proposal., Who of the five appointed is to write the district address?, I did the labor of writing one address this year, and got thunder for my reward., Nothing new here., P. S.--I wish you would measure one of the largest of those swords we took to Alton and write me the length of it, from tip of the point to tip of the hilt, in feet and inches., I have a dispute about the length., ours of the 9th instant is duly received, which I do not meet as a ""bore,"" but as a most welcome visitor., I will answer the business part of it first., In relation to our Congress matter here, you were right in supposing I would support the nominee., Neither Baker nor I, however, is the man, but Hardin, so far as I can judge from present appearances., We shall have no split or trouble about the matter; all will be harmony., In relation to the ""coming events"" about which Butler wrote you, I had not heard one word before I got your letter; but I have so much confidence in the judgment of Butler on such a subject that I incline to think there may be some reality in it., What day does Butler appoint?, By the way, how do ""events"" of the same sort come on in your family?, Are you possessing houses and lands, and oxen and asses, and men-servants and maid-servants, and begetting sons and daughters?, We are not keeping house, but boarding at the Globe Tavern, which is very well kept now by a widow lady of the name of Beck., Our room (the same that Dr. Wallace occupied there) and boarding only costs us four dollars a week., Ann Todd was married something more than a year since to a fellow by the name of Campbell, and who, Mary says, is pretty much of a ""dunce,"" though he has a little money and property., They live in Boonville, Missouri, and have not been heard from lately enough for me to say anything about her health., I reckon it will scarcely be in our power to visit Kentucky this year., Besides poverty and the necessity of attending to business, those ""coming events,"" I suspect, would be somewhat in the way., I most heartily wish you and your Fanny would not fail to come., Just let us know the time, and we will have a room provided for you at our house, and all be merry together for a while., Be sure to give my respects to your mother and family; assure her that if ever I come near her, I will not fail to call and see her., Mary joins in sending love to your Fanny and you., Yours as ever,  Knowing that you have correspondents enough, I have forborne to trouble you heretofore; and I now only do so to get you to set a matter right which has got wrong with one of our best friends., It is old Uncle Thomas Campbell of Spring Creek--(Berlin P.O.)., He has received several documents from you, and he says they are old newspapers and documents, having no sort of interest in them., He is, therefore, getting a strong impression that you treat him with disrespect., This, I know, is a mistaken impression; and you must correct it., The way, I leave to yourself., Rob't W. Canfield says he would like to have a document or two from you., The Locos (Democrats) here are in considerable trouble about Van Buren's letter on Texas, and the Virginia electors., They are growing sick of the Tariff question; and consequently are much confounded at V.B., 's cutting them off from the new Texas question., Nearly half the leaders swear they won't stand it., Of those are Ford, T. Campbell, Ewing, Calhoun and others., They don't exactly say they won't vote for V.B., but they say he will not be the candidate, and that they are for Texas anyhow., I do not wish to join in your proposal of a new plan for the selection of a Whig candidate for Congress because:  1st., I am entirely satisfied with the old system under which you and Baker were successively nominated and elected to Congress; and because the Whigs of the district are well acquainted with the system, and, so far as I know or believe, are well satisfied with it., If the old system be thought to be vague, as to all the delegates of the county voting the same way, or as to instructions to them as to whom they are to vote for, or as to filling vacancies, I am willing to join in a provision to make these matters certain., 2d., As to your proposals that a poll shall be opened in every precinct, and that the whole shall take place on the same day, I do not personally object., They seem to me to be not unfair; and I forbear to join in proposing them only because I choose to leave the decision in each county to the Whigs of the county, to be made as their own judgment and convenience may dictate., 3d., As to your proposed stipulation that all the candidates shall remain in their own counties, and restrain their friends in the same it seems to me that on reflection you will see the fact of your having been in Congress has, in various ways, so spread your name in the district as to give you a decided advantage in such a stipulation., I appreciate your desire to keep down excitement; and I promise you to ""keep cool"" under all circumstances., 4th., I have already said I am satisfied with the old system under which such good men have triumphed and that I desire no departure from its principles., But if there must be a departure from it, I shall insist upon a more accurate and just apportionment of delegates, or representative votes, to the constituent body, than exists by the old, and which you propose to retain in your new plan., If we take the entire population of the counties as shown by the late census, we shall see by the old plan, and by your proposed new plan, And so on in a less degree the matter runs through all the counties, being not only wrong in principle, but the advantage of it being all manifestly in your favor with one slight exception, in the comparison of two counties not here mentioned., Again, if we take the Whig votes of the counties as shown by the late Presidential election as a basis, the thing is still worse., It seems to me most obvious that the old system needs adjustment in nothing so much as in this; and still, by your proposal, no notice is taken of it., I have always been in the habit of acceding to almost any proposal that a friend would make and I am truly sorry that I cannot in this., I perhaps ought to mention that some friends at different places are endeavoring to secure the honor of the sitting of the convention at their towns respectively, and I fear that they would not feel much complimented if we shall make a bargain that it should sit nowhere., The Supreme Court adjourned this morning for the term., Your cases of Reinhardt vs. Schuyler, Bunce vs. Schuyler, Dickhut vs. Dunell, and Sullivan vs. Andrews are continued., Hinman vs. Pope I wrote you concerning some time ago., McNutt et al., vs. Bean and Thompson is reversed and remanded., Fitzpatrick vs. Brady et al., is reversed and remanded with leave to complainant to amend his bill so as to show the real consideration given for the land., Bunce against Graves the court confirmed, wherefore, in accordance with your directions, I moved to have the case remanded to enable you to take a new trial in the court below., The court allowed the motion; of which I am glad, and I guess you are., This, I believe, is all as to court business., The canal men have got their measure through the Legislature pretty much or quite in the shape they desired., Nothing else now., When I saw you at home, it was agreed that I should write to you and your brother Madison., Until I then saw you I was not aware of your being what is generally called an abolitionist, or, as you call yourself, a Liberty man, though I well knew there were many such in your country., I was glad to hear that you intended to attempt to bring about, at the next election in Putnam, a Union of the Whigs proper and such of the Liberty men as are Whigs in principle on all questions save only that of slavery., So far as I can perceive, by such union neither party need yield anything on the point in difference between them., If the Whig abolitionists of New York had voted with us last fall, Mr. Clay would now be President, Whig principles in the ascendant, and Texas not annexed; whereas, by the division, all that either had at stake in the contest was lost., And, indeed, it was extremely probable, beforehand, that such would be the result., As I always understood, the Liberty men deprecated the annexation of Texas extremely; and this being so, why they should refuse to cast their votes [so] as to prevent it, even to me seemed wonderful., What was their process of reasoning, I can only judge from what a single one of them told me., It was this: ""We are not to do evil that good may come."", This general proposition is doubtless correct; but did it apply?, If by your votes you could have prevented the extension, etc., of slavery would it not have been good, and not evil, so to have used your votes, even though it involved the casting of them for a slaveholder?, By the fruit the tree is to be known., An evil tree cannot bring forth good fruit., If the fruit of electing Mr. Clay would have been to prevent the extension of slavery, could the act of electing have been evil?, But I will not argue further., I perhaps ought to say that individually I never was much interested in the Texas question., I never could see much good to come of annexation, inasmuch as they were already a free republican people on our own model., On the other hand, I never could very clearly see how the annexation would augment the evil of slavery., It always seemed to me that slaves would be taken there in about equal numbers, with or without annexation., And if more were taken because of annexation, still there would be just so many the fewer left where they were taken from., It is possibly true, to some extent, that, with annexation, some slaves may be sent to Texas and continued in slavery that otherwise might have been liberated., To whatever extent this may be true, I think annexation an evil., I hold it to be a paramount duty of us in the free States, due to the Union of the States, and perhaps to liberty itself (paradox though it may seem), to let the slavery of the other States alone; while, on the other hand, I hold it to be equally clear that we should never knowingly lend ourselves, directly or indirectly, to prevent that slavery from dying a natural death--to find new places for it to live in when it can no longer exist in the old., Of course I am not now considering what would be our duty in cases of insurrection among the slaves., ...]",3
213,"[What I want now is to send you the money, to be used accordingly, if any one comes on to start the case, or to be retained by you if no one does., There is nothing of consequence new here., Congress is to organize to-morrow., Last night we held a Whig caucus for the House, and nominated Winthrop of Massachusetts for speaker, Sargent of Pennsylvania for sergeant-at-arms, Homer of New Jersey door-keeper, and McCormick of District of Columbia postmaster., The Whig majority in the House is so small that, together with some little dissatisfaction, [it] leaves it doubtful whether we will elect them all., This paper is too thick to fold, which is the reason I send only a half-sheet., Your letter, advising me of the receipt of our fee in the bank case, is just received, and I don't expect to hear another as good a piece of news from Springfield while I am away., I am under no obligations to the bank; and I therefore wish you to buy bank certificates, and pay my debt there, so as to pay it with the least money possible., I would as soon you should buy them of Mr. Ridgely, or any other person at the bank, as of any one else, provided you can get them as cheaply., I suppose, after the bank debt shall be paid, there will be some money left, out of which I would like to have you pay Lavely and Stout twenty dollars, and Priest and somebody (oil-makers) ten dollars, for materials got for house-painting., If there shall still be any left, keep it till you see or hear from me., I shall begin sending documents so soon as I can get them., I wrote you yesterday about a ""Congressional Globe."", As you are all so anxious for me to distinguish myself, I have concluded to do so before long., Whereas, The President of the United States, in his message of May 11, 1846, has declared that ""the Mexican Government not only refused to receive him [the envoy of the United States], or to listen to his propositions, but, after a long-continued series of menaces, has at last invaded our territory and shed the blood of our fellow-citizens on our own soil"";  And again, in his message of December 8, 1846, that ""we had ample cause of war against Mexico long before the breaking out of hostilities; but even then we forbore to take redress into our own hands until Mexico herself became the aggressor, by invading our soil in hostile array, and shedding the blood of our citizens"";  And yet again, in his message of December 7, 1847, that ""the Mexican Government refused even to hear the terms of adjustment which he [our minister of peace] was authorized to propose, and finally, under wholly unjustifiable pretexts, involved the two countries in war, by invading the territory of the State of Texas, striking the first blow, and shedding the blood of our citizens on our own soil"";  And whereas, This House is desirous to obtain a full knowledge of all the facts which go to establish whether the particular spot on which the blood of our citizens was so shed was or was not at that time our own soil: therefore,  Resolved, By the House of Representatives, that the President of the United States be respectfully requested to inform this House:  First., Whether the spot on which the blood of our citizens was shed, as in his message declared, was or was not within the territory of Spain, at least after the treaty of 1819, until the Mexican revolution., Second., Whether that spot is or is not within the territory which was wrested from Spain by the revolutionary government of Mexico., Third., Whether that spot is or is not within a settlement of people, which settlement has existed ever since long before the Texas revolution, and until its inhabitants fled before the approach of the United States army., Fourth., Whether that settlement is or is not isolated from any and all other settlements by the Gulf and the Rio Grande on the south and west, and by wide uninhabited regions on the north and east., Fifth., Whether the people of that settlement, or a majority of them, or any of them, have ever submitted themselves to the government or laws of Texas or of the United States, by consent or by compulsion, either by accepting office, or voting at elections, or paying tax, or serving on juries, or having process served upon them, or in any other way., Sixth., Whether the people of that settlement did or did not flee from the approach of the United States army, leaving unprotected their homes and their growing crops, before the blood was shed, as in the message stated; and whether the first blood, so shed, was or was not shed within the inclosure of one of the people who had thus fled from it., Seventh., Whether our citizens, whose blood was shed, as in his message declared, were or were not, at that time, armed officers and soldiers, sent into that settlement by the military order of the President, through the Secretary of War., Eighth., Whether the military force of the United States was or was not so sent into that settlement after General Taylor had more than once intimated to the War Department that, in his opinion, no such movement was necessary to the defence or protection of Texas., Mr. Lincoln said he had made an effort, some few days since, to obtain the floor in relation to this measure [resolution to direct Postmaster-General to make arrangements with railroad for carrying the mails--in Committee of the Whole], but had failed., One of the objects he had then had in view was now in a great measure superseded by what had fallen from the gentleman from Virginia who had just taken his seat., He begged to assure his friends on the other side of the House that no assault whatever was meant upon the Postmaster-General, and he was glad that what the gentleman had now said modified to a great extent the impression which might have been created by the language he had used on a previous occasion., He wanted to state to gentlemen who might have entertained such impressions, that the Committee on the Post-office was composed of five Whigs and four Democrats, and their report was understood as sustaining, not impugning, the position taken by the Postmaster-General., That report had met with the approbation of all the Whigs, and of all the Democrats also, with the exception of one, and he wanted to go even further than this., [Intimation was informally given Mr. Lincoln that it was not in order to mention on the floor what had taken place in committee.], He then observed that if he had been out of order in what he had said he took it all back so far as he could., He had no desire, he could assure gentlemen, ever to be out of order--though he never could keep long in order., Mr. Lincoln went on to observe that he differed in opinion, in the present case, from his honorable friend from Richmond [Mr. Botts]., That gentleman, had begun his remarks by saying that if all prepossessions in this matter could be removed out of the way, but little difficulty would be experienced in coming to an agreement., Now, he could assure that gentleman that he had himself begun the examination of the subject with prepossessions all in his favor., He had long and often heard of him, and, from what he had heard, was prepossessed in his favor., Of the Postmaster-General he had also heard, but had no prepossessions in his favor, though certainly none of an opposite kind., He differed, however, with that gentleman in politics, while in this respect he agreed with the gentleman from Virginia [Mr. Botts], whom he wished to oblige whenever it was in his power., That gentleman had referred to the report made to the House by the Postmaster-General, and had intimated an apprehension that gentlemen would be disposed to rely, on that report alone, and derive their views of the case from that document alone., Now it so happened that a pamphlet had been slipped into his [Mr. Lincoln's] hand before he read the report of the Postmaster-General; so that, even in this, he had begun with prepossessions in favor of the gentleman from Virginia., As to the report, he had but one remark to make: he had carefully examined it, and he did not understand that there was any dispute as to the facts therein stated the dispute, if he understood it, was confined altogether to the inferences to be drawn from those facts., It was a difference not about facts, but about conclusions., The facts were not disputed., If he was right in this, he supposed the House might assume the facts to be as they were stated, and thence proceed to draw their own conclusions., The gentleman had said that the Postmaster-General had got into a personal squabble with the railroad company., Of this Mr. Lincoln knew nothing, nor did he need or desire to know anything, because it had nothing whatever to do with a just conclusion from the premises., But the gentleman had gone on to ask whether so great a grievance as the present detention of the Southern mail ought not to be remedied., Mr. Lincoln would assure the gentleman that if there was a proper way of doing it, no man was more anxious than he that it should be done., The report made by the committee had been intended to yield much for the sake of removing that grievance., That the grievance was very great there was no dispute in any quarter., He supposed that the statements made by the gentleman from Virginia to show this were all entirely correct in point of fact., He did suppose that the interruptions of regular intercourse, and all the other inconveniences growing out of it, were all as that gentleman had stated them to be; and certainly, if redress could be rendered, it was proper it should be rendered as soon as possible., The gentleman said that in order to effect this no new legislative action was needed; all that was necessary was that the Postmaster-General should be required to do what the law, as it stood, authorized and required him to do., We come then, said Mr. Lincoln, to the law., Now the Postmaster-General says he cannot give to this company more than two hundred and thirty-seven dollars and fifty cents per railroad mile of transportation, and twelve and a half per cent., less for transportation by steamboats., He considers himself as restricted by law to this amount; and he says, further, that he would not give more if he could, because in his apprehension it would not be fair and just., Your letter of December 27 was received a day or two ago., I am much obliged to you for the trouble you have taken, and promise to take in my little business there., As to speech making, by way of getting the hang of the House I made a little speech two or three days ago on a post-office question of no general interest., I find speaking here and elsewhere about the same thing., I was about as badly scared, and no worse as I am when I speak in court., I expect to make one within a week or two, in which I hope to succeed well enough to wish you to see it., It is very pleasant to learn from you that there are some who desire that I should be reelected., I most heartily thank them for their kind partiality; and I can say, as Mr. Clay said of the annexation of Texas, that ""personally I would not object"" to a reelection, although I thought at the time, and still think, it would be quite as well for me to return to the law at the end of a single term., I made the declaration that I would not be a candidate again, more from a wish to deal fairly with others, to keep peace among our friends, and to keep the district from going to the enemy, than for any cause personal to myself; so that if it should so happen that nobody else wishes to be elected, I could not refuse the people the right of sending me again., But to enter myself as a competitor of others, or to authorize any one so to enter me is what my word and honor forbid., I got some letters intimating a probability of so much difficulty amongst our friends as to lose us the district; but I remember such letters were written to Baker when my own case was under consideration, and I trust there is no more ground for such apprehension now than there was then., Remember I am always glad to receive a letter from you., Some if not all the gentlemen on the other side of the House who have addressed the committee within the last two days have spoken rather complainingly, if I have rightly understood them, of the vote given a week or ten days ago declaring that the war with Mexico was unnecessarily and unconstitutionally commenced by the President., I admit that such a vote should not be given in mere party wantonness, and that the one given is justly censurable if it have no other or better foundation., I am one of those who joined in that vote; and I did so under my best impression of the truth of the case., How I got this impression, and how it may possibly be remedied, I will now try to show., When the war began, it was my opinion that all those who because of knowing too little, or because of knowing too much, could not conscientiously approve the conduct of the President in the beginning of it should nevertheless, as good citizens and patriots, remain silent on that point, at least till the war should be ended., Some leading Democrats, including ex-President Van Buren, have taken this same view, as I understand them; and I adhered to it and acted upon it, until since I took my seat here; and I think I should still adhere to it were it not that the President and his friends will not allow it to be so., Besides the continual effort of the President to argue every silent vote given for supplies into an indorsement of the justice and wisdom of his conduct; besides that singularly candid paragraph in his late message in which he tells us that Congress with great unanimity had declared that ""by the act of the Republic of Mexico, a state of war exists between that government and the United States,"" when the same journals that informed him of this also informed him that when that declaration stood disconnected from the question of supplies sixty-seven in the House, and not fourteen merely, voted against it; besides this open attempt to prove by telling the truth what he could not prove by telling the whole truth-demanding of all who will not submit to be misrepresented, in justice to themselves, to speak out, besides all this, one of my colleagues [Mr. Richardson] at a very early day in the session brought in a set of resolutions expressly indorsing the original justice of the war on the part of the President., Upon these resolutions when they shall be put on their passage I shall be compelled to vote; so that I cannot be silent if I would., Seeing this, I went about preparing myself to give the vote understandingly when it should come., I carefully examined the President's message, to ascertain what he himself had said and proved upon the point., The result of this examination was to make the impression that, taking for true all the President states as facts, he falls far short of proving his justification; and that the President would have gone further with his proof if it had not been for the small matter that the truth would not permit him., Under the impression thus made I gave the vote before mentioned., I propose now to give concisely the process of the examination I made, and how I reached the conclusion I did., The President, in his first war message of May, 1846, declares that the soil was ours on which hostilities were commenced by Mexico, and he repeats that declaration almost in the same language in each successive annual message, thus showing that he deems that point a highly essential one., In the importance of that point I entirely agree with the President., To my judgment it is the very point upon which he should be justified, or condemned., In his message of December, 1846, it seems to have occurred to him, as is certainly true, that title-ownership-to soil or anything else is not a simple fact, but is a conclusion following on one or more simple facts; and that it was incumbent upon him to present the facts from which he concluded the soil was ours on which the first blood of the war was shed., Accordingly, a little below the middle of page twelve in the message last referred to, he enters upon that task; forming an issue and introducing testimony, extending the whole to a little below the middle of page fourteen., Now, I propose to try to show that the whole of this--issue and evidence--is from beginning to end the sheerest deception., The issue, as he presents it, is in these words: ""But there are those who, conceding all this to be true, assume the ground that the true western boundary of Texas is the Nueces, instead of the Rio Grande; and that, therefore, in marching our army to the east bank of the latter river, we passed the Texas line and invaded the territory of Mexico."", Now this issue is made up of two affirmatives and no negative., The main deception of it is that it assumes as true that one river or the other is necessarily the boundary; and cheats the superficial thinker entirely out of the idea that possibly the boundary is somewhere between the two, and not actually at either., A further deception is that it will let in evidence which a true issue would exclude., A true issue made by the President would be about as follows: ""I say the soil was ours, on which the first blood was shed; there are those who say it was not."", I now proceed to examine the President's evidence as applicable to such an issue., ...]",3
214,"[But if he can not or will not do this,--if on any pretence or no pretence he shall refuse or omit it then I shall be fully convinced of what I more than suspect already that he is deeply conscious of being in the wrong; that he feels the blood of this war, like the blood of Abel, is crying to heaven against him; that originally having some strong motive--what, I will not stop now to give my opinion concerning to involve the two countries in a war, and trusting to escape scrutiny by fixing the public gaze upon the exceeding brightness of military glory,--that attractive rainbow that rises in showers of blood, that serpent's eye that charms to destroy,--he plunged into it, and was swept on and on till, disappointed in his calculation of the ease with which Mexico might be subdued, he now finds himself he knows not where., How like the half insane mumbling of a fever dream is the whole war part of his late message!, At one time telling us that Mexico has nothing whatever that we can get--but territory; at another showing us how we can support the war by levying contributions on Mexico., At one time urging the national honor, the security of the future, the prevention of foreign interference, and even the good of Mexico herself as among the objects of the war; at another telling us that ""to reject indemnity, by refusing to accept a cession of territory, would be to abandon all our just demands, and to wage the war, bearing all its expenses, without a purpose or definite object."", So then this national honor, security of the future, and everything but territorial indemnity may be considered the no-purposes and indefinite objects of the war!, But, having it now settled that territorial indemnity is the only object, we are urged to seize, by legislation here, all that he was content to take a few months ago, and the whole province of Lower California to boot, and to still carry on the war to take all we are fighting for, and still fight on., Again, the President is resolved under all circumstances to have full territorial indemnity for the expenses of the war; but he forgets to tell us how we are to get the excess after those expenses shall have surpassed the value of the whole of the Mexican territory., So again, he insists that the separate national existence of Mexico shall be maintained; but he does not tell us how this can be done, after we shall have taken all her territory., Lest the questions I have suggested be considered speculative merely, let me be indulged a moment in trying to show they are not., The war has gone on some twenty months; for the expenses of which, together with an inconsiderable old score, the President now claims about one half of the Mexican territory, and that by far the better half, so far as concerns our ability to make anything out of it., It is comparatively uninhabited; so that we could establish land-offices in it, and raise some money in that way., But the other half is already inhabited, as I understand it, tolerably densely for the nature of the country, and all its lands, or all that are valuable, already appropriated as private property., How then are we to make anything out of these lands with this encumbrance on them?, or how remove the encumbrance?, I suppose no one would say we should kill the people, or drive them out, or make slaves of them, or confiscate their property., How, then, can we make much out of this part of the territory?, If the prosecution of the war has in expenses already equalled the better half of the country, how long its future prosecution will be in equalling the less valuable half is not a speculative, but a practical, question, pressing closely upon us., And yet it is a question which the President seems never to have thought of., As to the mode of terminating the war and securing peace, the President is equally wandering and indefinite., First, it is to be done by a more vigorous prosecution of the war in the vital parts of the enemy's country; and after apparently talking himself tired on this point, the President drops down into a half-despairing tone, and tells us that ""with a people distracted and divided by contending factions, and a government subject to constant changes by successive revolutions, the continued success of our arms may fail to secure a satisfactory peace."", Then he suggests the propriety of wheedling the Mexican people to desert the counsels of their own leaders, and, trusting in our protestations, to set up a government from which we can secure a satisfactory peace; telling us that ""this may become the only mode of obtaining such a peace."", But soon he falls into doubt of this too; and then drops back on to the already half-abandoned ground of ""more vigorous prosecution."", All this shows that the President is in nowise satisfied with his own positions., First he takes up one, and in attempting to argue us into it he argues himself out of it, then seizes another and goes through the same process, and then, confused at being able to think of nothing new, he snatches up the old one again, which he has some time before cast off., His mind, taxed beyond its power, is running hither and thither, like some tortured creature on a burning surface, finding no position on which it can settle down and be at ease., Again, it is a singular omission in this message that it nowhere intimates when the President expects the war to terminate., At its beginning, General Scott was by this same President driven into disfavor if not disgrace, for intimating that peace could not be conquered in less than three or four months., But now, at the end of about twenty months, during which time our arms have given us the most splendid successes, every department and every part, land and water, officers and privates, regulars and volunteers, doing all that men could do, and hundreds of things which it had ever before been thought men could not do--after all this, this same President gives a long message, without showing us that as to the end he himself has even an imaginary conception., As I have before said, he knows not where he is., He is a bewildered, confounded, and miserably perplexed man., God grant he may be able to show there is not something about his conscience more painful than his mental perplexity., The Committee on the Post-office and Post Roads, to whom was referred the petition of Messrs. Saltmarsh and Fuller, report: That, as proved to their satisfaction, the mail routes from Milledgeville to Athens, and from Warrenton to Decatur, in the State of Georgia (numbered 2366 and 2380), were let to Reeside and Avery at $1300 per annum for the former and $1500 for the latter, for the term of four years, to commence on the first day of January, 1835; that, previous to the time for commencing the service, Reeside sold his interest therein to Avery; that on the 5th of May, 1835, Avery sold the whole to these petitioners, Saltmarsh and Fuller, to take effect from the beginning, January a 1835; that at this time, the Assistant Postmaster-General, being called on for that purpose, consented to the transfer of the contracts from Reeside and Avery to these petitioners, and promised to have proper entries of the transfer made on the books of the department, which, however, was neglected to be done; that the petitioners, supposing all was right, in good faith commenced the transportation of the mail on these routes, and after difficulty arose, still trusting that all would be made right, continued the service till December a 1837; that they performed the service to the entire satisfaction of the department, and have never been paid anything for it except $----; that the difficulty occurred as follows:  Mr. Barry was Postmaster-General at the times of making the contracts and the attempted transfer of them; Mr. Kendall succeeded Mr. Barry, and finding Reeside apparently in debt to the department, and these contracts still standing in the names of Reeside and Avery, refused to pay for the services under them, otherwise than by credits to Reeside; afterward, however, he divided the compensation, still crediting one half to Reeside, and directing the other to be paid to the order of Avery, who disclaimed all right to it., After discontinuing the service, these petitioners, supposing they might have legal redress against Avery, brought suit against him in New Orleans; in which suit they failed, on the ground that Avery had complied with his contract, having done so much toward the transfer as they had accepted and been satisfied with., Still later the department sued Reeside on his supposed indebtedness, and by a verdict of the jury it was determined that the department was indebted to him in a sum much beyond all the credits given him on the account above stated., Under these circumstances, the committee consider the petitioners clearly entitled to relief, and they report a bill accordingly; lest, however, there should be some mistake as to the amount which they have already received, we so frame it as that, by adjustment at the department, they may be paid so much as remains unpaid for services actually performed by them not charging them with the credits given to Reeside., The committee think it not improbable that the petitioners purchased the right of Avery to be paid for the service from the 1st of January, till their purchase on May 11, 1835; but, the evidence on this point being very vague, they forbear to report in favor of allowing it., Inclosed you find a letter of Louis W. Chandler., What is wanted is that you shall ascertain whether the claim upon the note described has received any dividend in the Probate Court of Christian County, where the estate of Mr. Overbon Williams has been administered on., If nothing is paid on it, withdraw the note and send it to me, so that Chandler can see the indorser of it., At all events write me all about it, till I can somehow get it off my hands., I have already been bored more than enough about it; not the least of which annoyance is his cursed, unreadable, and ungodly handwriting., I have made a speech, a copy of which I will send you by next mail., Your letter of the 19th ultimo was received last night, and for which I am much obliged., The only thing in it that I wish to talk to you at once about is that because of my vote for Ashmun's amendment you fear that you and I disagree about the war., I regret this, not because of any fear we shall remain disagreed after you have read this letter, but because if you misunderstand I fear other good friends may also., That vote affirms that the war was unnecessarily and unconstitutionally commenced by the President; and I will stake my life that if you had been in my place you would have voted just as I did., Would you have voted what you felt and knew to be a lie?, I know you would not., Would you have gone out of the House--skulked the vote?, I expect not., If you had skulked one vote, you would have had to skulk many more before the end of the session., Richardson's resolutions, introduced before I made any move or gave any vote upon the subject, make the direct question of the justice of the war; so that no man can be silent if he would., You are compelled to speak; and your only alternative is to tell the truth or a lie., I cannot doubt which you would do., This vote has nothing to do in determining my votes on the questions of supplies., I have always intended, and still intend, to vote supplies; perhaps not in the precise form recommended by the President, but in a better form for all purposes, except Locofoco party purposes., It is in this particular you seem mistaken., The Locos are untiring in their efforts to make the impression that all who vote supplies or take part in the war do of necessity approve the President's conduct in the beginning of it; but the Whigs have from the beginning made and kept the distinction between the two., In the very first act nearly all the Whigs voted against the preamble declaring that war existed by the act of Mexico; and yet nearly all of them voted for the supplies., As to the Whig men who have participated in the war, so far as they have spoken in my hearing they do not hesitate to denounce as unjust the President's conduct in the beginning of the war., They do not suppose that such denunciation is directed by undying hatred to him, as The Register would have it believed., There are two such Whigs on this floor (Colonel Haskell and Major James) The former fought as a colonel by the side of Colonel Baker at Cerro Gordo, and stands side by side with me in the vote that you seem dissatisfied with., The latter, the history of whose capture with Cassius Clay you well know, had not arrived here when that vote was given; but, as I understand, he stands ready to give just such a vote whenever an occasion shall present., Baker, too, who is now here, says the truth is undoubtedly that way; and whenever he shall speak out, he will say so., Colonel Doniphan, too, the favorite Whig of Missouri, and who overran all Northern Mexico, on his return home in a public speech at St. Louis condemned the administration in relation to the war., If I remember, G. T. M. Davis, who has been through almost the whole war, declares in favor of Mr. Clay; from which I infer that he adopts the sentiments of Mr. Clay, generally at least., On the other hand, I have heard of but one Whig who has been to the war attempting to justify the President's conduct., That one was Captain Bishop, editor of the Charleston Courier, and a very clever fellow., I do not mean this letter for the public, but for you., Before it reaches you, you will have seen and read my pamphlet speech, and perhaps been scared anew by it., After you get over your scare, read it over again, sentence by sentence, and tell me honestly what you think of it., I condensed all I could for fear of being cut off by the hour rule, and when I got through I had spoken but forty-five minutes., I just take my pen to say that Mr. Stephens, of Georgia, a little, slim, pale-faced, consumptive man, with a voice like Logan's, has just concluded the very best speech of an hour's length I ever heard., My old withered dry eyes are full of tears yet., If he writes it out anything like he delivered it, our people shall see a good many copies of it., Your letter of the 29th January was received last night., Being exclusively a constitutional argument, I wish to submit some reflections upon it in the same spirit of kindness that I know actuates you., Let me first state what I understand to be your position., It is that if it shall become necessary to repel invasion, the President may, without violation of the Constitution, cross the line and invade the territory of another country, and that whether such necessity exists in any given case the President is the sole judge., Before going further consider well whether this is or is not your position., If it is, it is a position that neither the President himself, nor any friend of his, so far as I know, has ever taken., Their only positions are--first, that the soil was ours when the hostilities commenced; and second, that whether it was rightfully ours or not, Congress had annexed it, and the President for that reason was bound to defend it; both of which are as clearly proved to be false in fact as you can prove that your house is mine., The soil was not ours, and Congress did not annex or attempt to annex it., But to return to your position., Allow the President to invade a neighboring nation whenever he shall deem it necessary to repel an invasion, and you allow him to do so whenever he may choose to say he deems it necessary for such purpose, and you allow him to make war at pleasure., Study to see if you can fix any limit to his power in this respect, after having given him so much as you propose., If to-day he should choose to say he thinks it necessary to invade Canada to prevent the British from invading us, how could you stop him?, You may say to him,--""I see no probability of the British invading us""; but he will say to you, ""Be silent: I see it, if you don't."", The provision of the Constitution giving the war making power to Congress was dictated, as I understand it, by the following reasons: kings had always been involving and impoverishing their people in wars, pretending generally, if not always, that the good of the people was the object., This our convention understood to be the most oppressive of all kingly oppressions, and they resolved to so frame the Constitution that no one man should hold the power of bringing this oppression upon us., But your view destroys the whole matter, and places our President where kings have always stood., Write soon again., The Committee on the Post-office and Post Roads, to whom was referred the resolution of the House of Representatives entitled ""An Act authorizing postmasters at county seats of justice to receive subscriptions for newspapers and periodicals, to be paid through the agency of the Post-office Department, and for other purposes,"" beg leave to submit the following report:  The committee have reason to believe that a general wish pervades the community at large that some such facility as the proposed measure should be granted by express law, for subscribing, through the agency of the Post-office Department, to newspapers and periodicals which diffuse daily, weekly, or monthly intelligence of passing events., Compliance with this general wish is deemed to be in accordance with our republican institutions, which can be best sustained by the diffusion of knowledge and the due encouragement of a universal, national spirit of inquiry and discussion of public events through the medium of the public press., The committee, however, has not been insensible to its duty of guarding the Post-office Department against injurious sacrifices for the accomplishment of this object, whereby its ordinary efficacy might be impaired or embarrassed., It has therefore been a subject of much consideration; but it is now confidently hoped that the bill herewith submitted effectually obviates all objections which might exist with regard to a less matured proposition., The committee learned, upon inquiry, that the Post-office Department, in view of meeting the general wish on this subject, made the experiment through one if its own internal regulations, when the new postage system went into operation on the first of July, 1845, and that it was continued until the thirtieth of September, 1847., But this experiment, for reasons hereafter stated, proved unsatisfactory, and it was discontinued by order of the Postmaster-General., As far as the committee can at present ascertain, the following seem to have been the principal grounds of dissatisfaction in this experiment:  (1) The legal responsibility of postmasters receiving newspaper subscriptions, or of their sureties, was not defined., (2) The authority was open to all postmasters instead of being limited to those of specific offices., ...]",3
215,"[General Ashley, in the Senate from Arkansas, died yesterday., Nothing else new beyond what you see in the papers., Not in view of all the facts., There are facts which you have kept out of view., It is a fact that the United States army in marching to the Rio Grande marched into a peaceful Mexican settlement, and frightened the inhabitants away from their homes and their growing crops., It is a fact that Fort Brown, opposite Matamoras, was built by that army within a Mexican cotton-field, on which at the time the army reached it a young cotton crop was growing, and which crop was wholly destroyed and the field itself greatly and permanently injured by ditches, embankments, and the like., It is a fact that when the Mexicans captured Captain Thornton and his command, they found and captured them within another Mexican field., Now I wish to bring these facts to your notice, and to ascertain what is the result of your reflections upon them., If you deny that they are facts, I think I can furnish proofs which shall convince you that you are mistaken., If you admit that they are facts, then I shall be obliged for a reference to any law of language, law of States, law of nations, law of morals, law of religions, any law, human or divine, in which an authority can be found for saying those facts constitute ""no aggression."", Possibly you consider those acts too small for notice., Would you venture to so consider them had they been committed by any nation on earth against the humblest of our people?, I know you would not., Then I ask, is the precept ""Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them"" obsolete?, of no force?, of no application?, On my return from Philadelphia, where I had been attending the nomination of ""Old Rough,"" (Zachary Taylor) I found your letter in a mass of others which had accumulated in my absence., By many, and often, it had been said they would not abide the nomination of Taylor; but since the deed has been done, they are fast falling in, and in my opinion we shall have a most overwhelming, glorious triumph., One unmistakable sign is that all the odds and ends are with us--Barnburners, Native Americans, Tyler men, disappointed office-seeking Locofocos, and the Lord knows what., This is important, if in nothing else, in showing which way the wind blows., Some of the sanguine men have set down all the States as certain for Taylor but Illinois, and it as doubtful., Cannot something be done even in Illinois?, Taylor's nomination takes the Locos on the blind side., It turns the war thunder against them., The war is now to them the gallows of Haman, which they built for us, and on which they are doomed to be hanged themselves., Excuse this short letter., I have so many to write that I cannot devote much time to any one., I wish at all times in no way to practise any fraud upon the House or the committee, and I also desire to do nothing which may be very disagreeable to any of the members., I therefore state in advance that my object in taking the floor is to make a speech on the general subject of internal improvements; and if I am out of order in doing so, I give the chair an opportunity of so deciding, and I will take my seat., At an early day of this session the President sent us what may properly be called an internal improvement veto message., The late Democratic convention, which sat at Baltimore, and which nominated General Cass for the Presidency, adopted a set of resolutions, now called the Democratic platform, among which is one in these words:  These things, taken together, show that the question of internal improvements is now more distinctly made--has become more intense--than at any former period., The veto message and the Baltimore resolution I understand to be, in substance, the same thing; the latter being the more general statement, of which the former is the amplification the bill of particulars., While I know there are many Democrats, on this floor and elsewhere, who disapprove that message, I understand that all who voted for General Cass will thereafter be counted as having approved it, as having indorsed all its doctrines., I suppose all, or nearly all, the Democrats will vote for him., Many of them will do so not because they like his position on this question, but because they prefer him, being wrong on this, to another whom they consider farther wrong on other questions., In this way the internal improvement Democrats are to be, by a sort of forced consent, carried over and arrayed against themselves on this measure of policy., General Cass, once elected, will not trouble himself to make a constitutional argument, or perhaps any argument at all, when he shall veto a river or harbor bill; he will consider it a sufficient answer to all Democratic murmurs to point to Mr. Polk's message, and to the Democratic platform., This being the case, the question of improvements is verging to a final crisis; and the friends of this policy must now battle, and battle manfully, or surrender all., In this view, humble as I am, I wish to review, and contest as well as I may, the general positions of this veto message., When I say general positions, I mean to exclude from consideration so much as relates to the present embarrassed state of the treasury in consequence of the Mexican War., Those general positions are: that internal improvements ought not to be made by the General Government--First., Because they would overwhelm the treasury Second., Because, while their burdens would be general, their benefits would be local and partial, involving an obnoxious inequality; and Third., Because they would be unconstitutional., Fourth., Because the States may do enough by the levy and collection of tonnage duties; or if not--Fifth., That the Constitution may be amended., ""Do nothing at all, lest you do something wrong,"" is the sum of these positions is the sum of this message., And this, with the exception of what is said about constitutionality, applying as forcibly to what is said about making improvements by State authority as by the national authority; so that we must abandon the improvements of the country altogether, by any and every authority, or we must resist and repudiate the doctrines of this message., Let us attempt the latter., The first position is, that a system of internal improvements would overwhelm the treasury., That in such a system there is a tendency to undue expansion, is not to be denied., Such tendency is founded in the nature of the subject., A member of Congress will prefer voting for a bill which contains an appropriation for his district, to voting for one which does not; and when a bill shall be expanded till every district shall be provided for, that it will be too greatly expanded is obvious., But is this any more true in Congress than in a State Legislature?, If a member of Congress must have an appropriation for his district, so a member of a Legislature must have one for his county., And if one will overwhelm the national treasury, so the other will overwhelm the State treasury., Go where we will, the difficulty is the same., Allow it to drive us from the halls of Congress, and it will, just as easily, drive us from the State Legislatures., Let us, then, grapple with it, and test its strength., Let us, judging of the future by the past, ascertain whether there may not be, in the discretion of Congress, a sufficient power to limit and restrain this expansive tendency within reasonable and proper bounds., The President himself values the evidence of the past., He tells us that at a certain point of our history more than two hundred millions of dollars had been applied for to make improvements; and this he does to prove that the treasury would be overwhelmed by such a system., Why did he not tell us how much was granted?, Would not that have been better evidence?, Let us turn to it, and see what it proves., In the message the President tells us that ""during the four succeeding years embraced by the administration of President Adams, the power not only to appropriate money, but to apply it, under the direction and authority of the General Government, as well to the construction of roads as to the improvement of harbors and rivers, was fully asserted and exercised."", This, then, was the period of greatest enormity., These, if any, must have been the days of the two hundred millions., And how much do you suppose was really expended for improvements during that four years?, Two hundred millions?, One hundred?, Fifty?, Ten?, Five?, No, sir; less than two millions., As shown by authentic documents, the expenditures on improvements during 1825, 1826, 1827, and 1828 amounted to one million eight hundred and seventy-nine thousand six hundred and twenty-seven dollars and one cent., These four years were the period of Mr. Adams's administration, nearly and substantially., This fact shows that when the power to make improvements ""was fully asserted and exercised,"" the Congress did keep within reasonable limits; and what has been done, it seems to me, can be done again., Now for the second portion of the message--namely, that the burdens of improvements would be general, while their benefits would be local and partial, involving an obnoxious inequality., That there is some degree of truth in this position, I shall not deny., No commercial object of government patronage can be so exclusively general as to not be of some peculiar local advantage., The navy, as I understand it, was established, and is maintained at a great annual expense, partly to be ready for war when war shall come, and partly also, and perhaps chiefly, for the protection of our commerce on the high seas., This latter object is, for all I can see, in principle the same as internal improvements., The driving a pirate from the track of commerce on the broad ocean, and the removing of a snag from its more narrow path in the Mississippi River, cannot, I think, be distinguished in principle., Each is done to save life and property, and for nothing else., The navy, then, is the most general in its benefits of all this class of objects; and yet even the navy is of some peculiar advantage to Charleston, Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York, and Boston, beyond what it is to the interior towns of Illinois., The next most general object I can think of would be improvements on the Mississippi River and its tributaries., They touch thirteen of our States-Pennsylvania, Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee, Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Wisconsin, and Iowa., Now I suppose it will not be denied that these thirteen States are a little more interested in improvements on that great river than are the remaining seventeen., These instances of the navy and the Mississippi River show clearly that there is something of local advantage in the most general objects., But the converse is also true., Nothing is so local as to not be of some general benefit., Take, for instance, the Illinois and Michigan Canal., Considered apart from its effects, it is perfectly local., Every inch of it is within the State of Illinois., That canal was first opened for business last April., In a very few days we were all gratified to learn, among other things, that sugar had been carried from New Orleans through this canal to Buffalo in New York., This sugar took this route, doubtless, because it was cheaper than the old route., Supposing benefit of the reduction in the cost of carriage to be shared between seller and the buyer, result is that the New Orleans merchant sold his sugar a little dearer, and the people of Buffalo sweetened their coffee a little cheaper, than before,--a benefit resulting from the canal, not to Illinois, where the canal is, but to Louisiana and New York, where it is not., ...]",3
216,"[I wish now to submit a few remarks on the general proposition of amending the Constitution., As a general rule, I think we would much better let it alone., No slight occasion should tempt us to touch it., Better not take the first step, which may lead to a habit of altering it., Better, rather, habituate ourselves to think of it as unalterable., It can scarcely be made better than it is., New provisions would introduce new difficulties, and thus create and increase appetite for further change., No, sir; let it stand as it is., New hands have never touched it., The men who made it have done their work, and have passed away., Who shall improve on what they did?, Mr. Chairman, for the purpose of reviewing this message in the least possible time, as well as for the sake of distinctness, I have analyzed its arguments as well as I could, and reduced them to the propositions I have stated., I have now examined them in detail., I wish to detain the committee only a little while longer with some general remarks upon the subject of improvements., That the subject is a difficult one, cannot be denied., Still it is no more difficult in Congress than in the State Legislatures, in the counties, or in the smallest municipal districts which anywhere exist., All can recur to instances of this difficulty in the case of county roads, bridges, and the like., One man is offended because a road passes over his land, and another is offended because it does not pass over his; one is dissatisfied because the bridge for which he is taxed crosses the river on a different road from that which leads from his house to town; another cannot bear that the county should be got in debt for these same roads and bridges; while not a few struggle hard to have roads located over their lands, and then stoutly refuse to let them be opened until they are first paid the damages., Even between the different wards and streets of towns and cities we find this same wrangling and difficulty., Now these are no other than the very difficulties against which, and out of which, the President constructs his objections of ""inequality,"" ""speculation,"" and ""crushing the treasury."", There is but a single alternative about them: they are sufficient, or they are not., If sufficient, they are sufficient out of Congress as well as in it, and there is the end., We must reject them as insufficient, or lie down and do nothing by any authority., Then, difficulty though there be, let us meet and encounter it., ""Attempt the end, and never stand to doubt; nothing so hard, but search will find it out."", Determine that the thing can and shall be done, and then we shall find the way., The tendency to undue expansion is unquestionably the chief difficulty., How to do something, and still not do too much, is the desideratum., Let each contribute his mite in the way of suggestion., The late Silas Wright, in a letter to the Chicago convention, contributed his, which was worth something; and I now contribute mine, which may be worth nothing., At all events, it will mislead nobody, and therefore will do no harm., I would not borrow money., I am against an overwhelming, crushing system., Suppose that, at each session, Congress shall first determine how much money can, for that year, be spared for improvements; then apportion that sum to the most important objects., So far all is easy; but how shall we determine which are the most important?, On this question comes the collision of interests., I shall be slow to acknowledge that your harbor or your river is more important than mine, and vice versa., To clear this difficulty, let us have that same statistical information which the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. Vinton] suggested at the beginning of this session., In that information we shall have a stern, unbending basis of facts--a basis in no wise subject to whim, caprice, or local interest., The prelimited amount of means will save us from doing too much, and the statistics will save us from doing what we do in wrong places., Adopt and adhere to this course, and, it seems to me, the difficulty is cleared., One of the gentlemen from South Carolina [Mr. Rhett] very much deprecates these statistics., He particularly objects, as I understand him, to counting all the pigs and chickens in the land., I do not perceive much force in the objection., It is true that if everything be enumerated, a portion of such statistics may not be very useful to this object., Such products of the country as are to be consumed where they are produced need no roads or rivers, no means of transportation, and have no very proper connection with this subject., The surplus--that which is produced in one place to be consumed in another; the capacity of each locality for producing a greater surplus; the natural means of transportation, and their susceptibility of improvement; the hindrances, delays, and losses of life and property during transportation, and the causes of each, would be among the most valuable statistics in this connection., From these it would readily appear where a given amount of expenditure would do the most good., These statistics might be equally accessible, as they would be equally useful, to both the nation and the States., In this way, and by these means, let the nation take hold of the larger works, and the States the smaller ones; and thus, working in a meeting direction, discreetly, but steadily and firmly, what is made unequal in one place may be equalized in another, extravagance avoided, and the whole country put on that career of prosperity which shall correspond with its extent of territory, its natural resources, and the intelligence and enterprise of its people., Last night I was attending a sort of caucus of the Whig members, held in relation to the coming Presidential election., The whole field of the nation was scanned, and all is high hope and confidence., Illinois is expected to better her condition in this race., Under these circumstances, judge how heartrending it was to come to my room and find and read your discouraging letter of the 15th., We have made no gains, but have lost ""H. R. Robinson, Turner, Campbell, and four or five more."", Tell Arney to reconsider, if he would be saved., Baker and I used to do something, but I think you attach more importance to our absence than is just., There is another cause., In 1840, for instance, we had two senators and five representatives in Sangamon; now we have part of one senator and two representatives., With quite one third more people than we had then, we have only half the sort of offices which are sought by men of the speaking sort of talent., This, I think, is the chief cause., Now, as to the young men., You must not wait to be brought forward by the older men., For instance, do you suppose that I should ever have got into notice if I had waited to be hunted up and pushed forward by older men?, You young men get together and form a ""Rough and Ready Club,"" and have regular meetings and speeches., Take in everybody you can get., Harrison Grimsley, L. A. Enos, Lee Kimball, and C. W. Matheny will do to begin the thing; but as you go along gather up all the shrewd, wild boys about town, whether just of age, or a little under age, Chris., Logan, Reddick Ridgely, Lewis Zwizler, and hundreds such., Let every one play the part he can play best,--some speak, some sing, and all ""holler."", Your meetings will be of evenings; the older men, and the women, will go to hear you; so that it will not only contribute to the election of ""Old Zach,"" but will be an interesting pastime, and improving to the intellectual faculties of all engaged., Don't fail to do this., You ask me to send you all the speeches made about ""Old Zach,"" the war, etc., Now this makes me a little impatient., I have regularly sent you the Congressional Globe and Appendix, and you cannot have examined them, or you would have discovered that they contain every speech made by every man in both houses of Congress, on every subject, during the session., Can I send any more?, Can I send speeches that nobody has made?, Thinking it would be most natural that the newspapers would feel interested to give at least some of the speeches to their readers, I at the beginning of the session made arrangements to have one copy of the Globe and Appendix regularly sent to each Whig paper of the district., And yet, with the exception of my own little speech, which was published in two only of the then five, now four, Whig papers, I do not remember having seen a single speech, or even extract from one, in any single one of those papers., With equal and full means on both sides, I will venture that the State Register has thrown before its readers more of Locofoco speeches in a month than all the Whig papers of the district have done of Whig speeches during the session., If you wish a full understanding of the war, I repeat what I believe I said to you in a letter once before, that the whole, or nearly so, is to be found in the speech of Dixon of Connecticut., This I sent you in pamphlet as well as in the Globe., Examine and study every sentence of that speech thoroughly, and you will understand the whole subject., You ask how Congress came to declare that war had existed by the act of Mexico., Is it possible you don't understand that yet?, You have at least twenty speeches in your possession that fully explain it., I will, however, try it once more., The news reached Washington of the commencement of hostilities on the Rio Grande, and of the great peril of General Taylor's army., Everybody, Whigs and Democrats, was for sending them aid, in men and money., It was necessary to pass a bill for this., The Locos had a majority in both houses, and they brought in a bill with a preamble saying: Whereas, War exists by the act of Mexico, therefore we send General Taylor money., The Whigs moved to strike out the preamble, so that they could vote to send the men and money, without saying anything about how the war commenced; but being in the minority, they were voted down, and the preamble was retained., Then, on the passage of the bill, the question came upon them, Shall we vote for preamble and bill together, or against both together?, They did not want to vote against sending help to General Taylor, and therefore they voted for both together., Is there any difficulty in understanding this?, Even my little speech shows how this was; and if you will go to the library, you may get the Journal of 1845-46, in which you will find the whole for yourself., We have nothing published yet with special reference to the Taylor race; but we soon will have, and then I will send them to everybody., I made an internal-improvement speech day before yesterday, which I shall send home as soon as I can get it written out and printed,--and which I suppose nobody will read., I feel nwilling to be either unjust or ungenerous, and he wanted to understand the real case of this judicial officer., The gentleman from Virginia had stated that he had to hold eleven courts., Now everybody knew that it was not the habit of the district judges of the United States in other States to hold anything like that number of courts; and he therefore took it for granted that this must happen under a peculiar law which required that large number of courts to be holden every year; and these laws, he further supposed, were passed at the request of the people of that judicial district., ...]",3
217,"[I understand your idea that if a Presidential candidate avow his opinion upon a given question, or rather upon all questions, and the people, with full knowledge of this, elect him, they thereby distinctly approve all those opinions., By means of it, measures are adopted or rejected contrary to the wishes of the whole of one party, and often nearly half of the other., Three, four, or half a dozen questions are prominent at a given time; the party selects its candidate, and he takes his position on each of these questions., On all but one his positions have already been indorsed at former elections, and his party fully committed to them; but that one is new, and a large portion of them are against it., But what are they to do?, The whole was strung together; and they must take all, or reject all., They cannot take what they like, and leave the rest., What they are already committed to being the majority, they shut their eyes, and gulp the whole., Next election, still another is introduced in the same way., If we run our eyes along the line of the past, we shall see that almost if not quite all the articles of the present Democratic creed have been at first forced upon the party in this very way., And just now, and just so, opposition to internal improvements is to be established if General Cass shall be elected., Almost half the Democrats here are for improvements; but they will vote for Cass, and if he succeeds, their vote will have aided in closing the doors against improvements., Now this is a process which we think is wrong., We prefer a candidate who, like General Taylor, will allow the people to have their own way, regardless of his private opinions; and I should think the internal-improvement Democrats, at least, ought to prefer such a candidate., He would force nothing on them which they don't want, and he would allow them to have improvements which their own candidate, if elected, will not., Mr. Speaker, I have said General Taylor's position is as well defined as is that of General Cass., In saying this, I admit I do not certainly know what he would do on the Wilmot Proviso., I am a Northern man or rather a Western Free-State man, with a constituency I believe to be, and with personal feelings I know to be, against the extension of slavery., As such, and with what information I have, I hope and believe General Taylor, if elected, would not veto the proviso., But I do not know it., Yet if I knew he would, I still would vote for him., I should do so because, in my judgment, his election alone can defeat General Cass; and because, should slavery thereby go to the territory we now have, just so much will certainly happen by the election of Cass, and in addition a course of policy leading to new wars, new acquisitions of territory and still further extensions of slavery., One of the two is to be President., Which is preferable?, But there is as much doubt of Cass on improvements as there is of Taylor on the proviso., I have no doubt myself of General Cass on this question; but I know the Democrats differ among themselves as to his position., My internal-improvement colleague [Mr. Wentworth] stated on this floor the other day that he was satisfied Cass was for improvements, because he had voted for all the bills that he [Mr. Wentworth] had., So far so good., But Mr. Polk vetoed some of these very bills., The Baltimore convention passed a set of resolutions, among other things, approving these vetoes, and General Cass declares, in his letter accepting the nomination, that he has carefully read these resolutions, and that he adheres to them as firmly as he approves them cordially., In other words, General Cass voted for the bills, and thinks the President did right to veto them; and his friends here are amiable enough to consider him as being on one side or the other, just as one or the other may correspond with their own respective inclinations., My colleague admits that the platform declares against the constitutionality of a general system of improvements, and that General Cass indorses the platform; but he still thinks General Cass is in favor of some sort of improvements., Well, what are they?, As he is against general objects, those he is for must be particular and local., Now this is taking the subject precisely by the wrong end., Particularity expending the money of the whole people for an object which will benefit only a portion of them--is the greatest real objection to improvements, and has been so held by General Jackson, Mr. Polk, and all others, I believe, till now., But now, behold, the objects most general--nearest free from this objection--are to be rejected, while those most liable to it are to be embraced., To return: I cannot help believing that General Cass, when he wrote his letter of acceptance, well understood he was to be claimed by the advocates of both sides of this question, and that he then closed the door against all further expressions of opinion purposely to retain the benefits of that double position., His subsequent equivocation at Cleveland, to my mind, proves such to have been the case., One word more, and I shall have done with this branch of the subject., You Democrats, and your candidate, in the main are in favor of laying down in advance a platform--a set of party positions--as a unit, and then of forcing the people, by every sort of appliance, to ratify them, however unpalatable some of them may be., We and our candidate are in favor of making Presidential elections and the legislation of the country distinct matters; so that the people can elect whom they please, and afterward legislate just as they please, without any hindrance, save only so much as may guard against infractions of the Constitution, undue haste, and want of consideration., The difference between us is clear as noonday., That we are right we cannot doubt., We hold the true Republican position., In leaving the people's business in their hands, we cannot be wrong., We are willing, and even anxious, to go to the people on this issue., But I suppose I cannot reasonably hope to convince you that we have any principles., The most I can expect is to assure you that we think we have and are quite contented with them., The other day one of the gentlemen from Georgia [Mr. Iverson], an eloquent man, and a man of learning, so far as I can judge, not being learned myself, came down upon us astonishingly., He spoke in what the 'Baltimore American' calls the ""scathing and withering style."", At the end of his second severe flash I was struck blind, and found myself feeling with my fingers for an assurance of my continued existence., A little of the bone was left, and I gradually revived., He eulogized Mr. Clay in high and beautiful terms, and then declared that we had deserted all our principles, and had turned Henry Clay out, like an old horse, to root., This is terribly severe., It cannot be answered by argument--at least I cannot so answer it., I merely wish to ask the gentleman if the Whigs are the only party he can think of who sometimes turn old horses out to root., Is not a certain Martin Van Buren an old horse which your own party have turned out to root?, and is he not rooting a little to your discomfort about now?, But in not nominating Mr. Clay we deserted our principles, you say., Ah!, In what?, Tell us, ye men of principle, what principle we violated., We say you did violate principle in discarding Van Buren, and we can tell you how., You violated the primary, the cardinal, the one great living principle of all democratic representative government--the principle that the representative is bound to carry out the known will of his constituents., A large majority of the Baltimore convention of 1844 were, by their constituents, instructed to procure Van Buren 's nomination if they could., In violation--in utter glaring contempt of this, you rejected him; rejected him, as the gentleman from New York [Mr. Birdsall] the other day expressly admitted, for availability--that same ""general availability"" which you charge upon us, and daily chew over here, as something exceedingly odious and unprincipled., But the gentleman from Georgia [Mr. Iverson] gave us a second speech yesterday, all well considered and put down in writing, in which Van Buren was scathed and withered a ""few"" for his present position and movements., I cannot remember the gentleman's precise language; but I do remember he put Van Buren down, down, till he got him where he was finally to ""stink"" and ""rot."", Mr. Speaker, it is no business or inclination of mine to defend Martin Van Buren in the war of extermination now waging between him and his old admirers., I say, ""Devil take the hindmost""--and the foremost., But there is no mistaking the origin of the breach; and if the curse of ""stinking"" and ""rotting"" is to fall on the first and greatest violators of principle in the matter, I disinterestedly suggest that the gentleman from Georgia and his present co-workers are bound to take it upon themselves., But the gentleman from Georgia further says we have deserted all our principles, and taken shelter under General Taylor's military coat-tail, and he seems to think this is exceedingly degrading., Well, as his faith is, so be it unto him., But can he remember no other military coat-tail under which a certain other party have been sheltering for near a quarter of a century?, Has he no acquaintance with the ample military coat tail of General Jackson?, Does he not know that his own party have run the five last Presidential races under that coat-tail, and that they are now running the sixth under the same cover?, Yes, sir, that coat-tail was used not only for General Jackson himself, but has been clung to, with the grip of death, by every Democratic candidate since., You have never ventured, and dare not now venture, from under it., Your campaign papers have constantly been ""Old Hickories,"" with rude likenesses of the old general upon them; hickory poles and hickory brooms your never-ending emblems; Mr. Polk himself was ""Young Hickory,"" or something so; and even now your campaign paper here is proclaiming that Cass and Butler are of the true ""Hickory stripe."", Now, sir, you dare not give it up., Like a horde of hungry ticks you have stuck to the tail of the Hermitage Lion to the end of his life; and you are still sticking to it, and drawing a loathsome sustenance from it, after he is dead., A fellow once advertised that he had made a discovery by which he could make a new man out of an old one, and have enough of the stuff left to make a little yellow dog., Just such a discovery has General Jackson's popularity been to you., You not only twice made President of him out of it, but you have had enough of the stuff left to make Presidents of several comparatively small men since; and it is your chief reliance now to make still another., Mr. Speaker, old horses and military coat-tails, or tails of any sort, are not figures of speech such as I would be the first to introduce into discussions here; but as the gentleman from Georgia has thought fit to introduce them, he and you are welcome to all you have made, or can make by them., If you have any more old horses, trot them out; any more tails, just cock them and come at us., I repeat, I would not introduce this mode of discussion here; but I wish gentlemen on the other side to understand that the use of degrading figures is a game at which they may not find themselves able to take all the winnings., Aye, you give it up, and well you may; but for a very different reason from that which you would have us understand., The point--the power to hurt--of all figures consists in the truthfulness of their application; and, understanding this, you may well give it up., They are weapons which hit you, but miss us., But in my hurry I was very near closing this subject of military tails before I was done with it., There is one entire article of the sort I have not discussed yet,--I mean the military tail you Democrats are now engaged in dovetailing into the great Michigander [Cass]., Yes, sir; all his biographies (and they are legion) have him in hand, tying him to a military tail, like so many mischievous boys tying a dog to a bladder of beans., True, the material they have is very limited, but they drive at it might and main., He invaded Canada without resistance, and he outvaded it without pursuit., As he did both under orders, I suppose there was to him neither credit nor discredit in them; but they constitute a large part of the tail., He was not at Hull's surrender, but he was close by; he was volunteer aid to General Harrison on the day of the battle of the Thames; and as you said in 1840 Harrison was picking huckleberries two miles off while the battle was fought, I suppose it is a just conclusion with you to say Cass was aiding Harrison to pick huckleberries., This is about all, except the mooted question of the broken sword., Some authors say he broke it, some say he threw it away, and some others, who ought to know, say nothing about it., ...]",3
218,"[On other occasions, and among the lower officers and privates on that occasion, I doubt not the proportion was different., I wish to do justice to all., I think of all those brave men as Americans, in whose proud fame, as an American, I too have a share., Many of them, Whigs and Democrats are my constituents and personal friends; and I thank them,--more than thank them,--one and all, for the high imperishable honor they have conferred on our common State., But the distinction between the cause of the President in beginning the war, and the cause of the country after it was begun, is a distinction which you cannot perceive., To you the President and the country seem to be all one., You are interested to see no distinction between them; and I venture to suggest that probably your interest blinds you a little., We see the distinction, as we think, clearly enough; and our friends who have fought in the war have no difficulty in seeing it also., What those who have fallen would say, were they alive and here, of course we can never know; but with those who have returned there is no difficulty., Colonel Haskell and Major Gaines, members here, both fought in the war, and both of them underwent extraordinary perils and hardships; still they, like all other Whigs here, vote, on the record, that the war was unnecessarily and unconstitutionally commenced by the President., And even General Taylor himself, the noblest Roman of them all, has declared that as a citizen, and particularly as a soldier, it is sufficient for him to know that his country is at war with a foreign nation, to do all in his power to bring it to a speedy and honorable termination by the most vigorous and energetic operations, without inquiry about its justice, or anything else connected with it., Mr. Speaker, let our Democratic friends be comforted with the assurance that we are content with our position, content with our company, and content with our candidate; and that although they, in their generous sympathy, think we ought to be miserable, we really are not, and that they may dismiss the great anxiety they have on our account., Mr. Speaker, I see I have but three minutes left, and this forces me to throw out one whole branch of my subject., A single word on still another., The Democrats are keen enough to frequently remind us that we have some dissensions in our ranks., Our good friend from Baltimore immediately before me [Mr. McLane] expressed some doubt the other day as to which branch of our party General Taylor would ultimately fall into the hands of., That was a new idea to me., I knew we had dissenters, but I did not know they were trying to get our candidate away from us., I would like to say a word to our dissenters, but I have not the time., Some such we certainly have; have you none, gentlemen Democrats?, Is it all union and harmony in your ranks?, no bickerings?, no divisions?, If there be doubt as to which of our divisions will get our candidate, is there no doubt as to which of your candidates will get your party?, I have heard some things from New York; and if they are true, one might well say of your party there, as a drunken fellow once said when he heard the reading of an indictment for hog-stealing., The clerk read on till he got to and through the words, ""did steal, take, and carry away ten boars, ten sows, ten shoats, and ten pigs,"" at which he exclaimed, ""Well, by golly, that is the most equally divided gang of hogs I ever did hear of!"", If there is any other gang of hogs more equally divided than the Democrats of New York are about this time, I have not heard of it., Mr. Lincoln has a very tall and thin figure, with an intellectual face, showing a searching mind, and a cool judgment., He spoke in a clear and cool and very eloquent manner, for an hour and a half, carrying the audience with him in his able arguments and brilliant illustrations--only interrupted by warm and frequent applause., He began by expressing a real feeling of modesty in addressing an audience ""this side of the mountains,"" a part of the country where, in the opinion of the people of his section, everybody was supposed to be instructed and wise., But he had devoted his attention to the question of the coming Presidential election, and was not unwilling to exchange with all whom he might the ideas to which he had arrived., He then began to show the fallacy of some of the arguments against Gen. Taylor, making his chief theme the fashionable statement of all those who oppose him (""the old Locofocos as well as the new"") that he has no principles, and that the Whig party have abandoned their principles by adopting him as their candidate., He maintained that Gen. Taylor occupied a high and unexceptionable Whig ground, and took for his first instance and proof of this the statement in the Allison letter--with regard to the bank, tariff, rivers and harbors, etc.--that the will of the people should produce its own results, without executive influence., The principle that the people should do what--under the Constitution--as they please, is a Whig principle., All that Gen. Taylor is not only to consent to, but appeal to the people to judge and act for themselves., And this was no new doctrine for Whigs., It was the ""platform"" on which they had fought all their battles, the resistance of executive influence, and the principle of enabling the people to frame the government according to their will., Gen. Taylor consents to be the candidate, and to assist the people to do what they think to be their duty, and think to be best in their national affairs, but because he don't want to tell what we ought to do, he is accused of having no principles., The Whigs here maintained for years that neither the influence, the duress, or the prohibition of the executive should control the legitimately expressed will of the people; and now that, on that very ground, Gen. Taylor says that he should use the power given him by the people to do, to the best of his judgment, the will of the people, he is accused of want of principle, and of inconsistency in position., Mr. Lincoln proceeded to examine the absurdity of an attempt to make a platform or creed for a national party, to all parts of which all must consent and agree, when it was clearly the intention and the true philosophy of our government, that in Congress all opinions and principles should be represented, and that when the wisdom of all had been compared and united, the will of the majority should be carried out., On this ground he conceived (and the audience seemed to go with him) that Gen. Taylor held correct, sound republican principles., Mr. Lincoln then passed to the subject of slavery in the States, saying that the people of Illinois agreed entirely with the people of Massachusetts on this subject, except perhaps that they did not keep so constantly thinking about it., All agreed that slavery was an evil, but that we were not responsible for it and cannot affect it in States of this Union where we do not live., But the question of the extension of slavery to new territories of this country is a part of our responsibility and care, and is under our control., In opposition to this Mr. L. believed that the self-named ""Free Soil"" party was far behind the Whigs., Both parties opposed the extension., As he understood it the new party had no principle except this opposition., If their platform held any other, it was in such a general way that it was like the pair of pantaloons the Yankee pedlar offered for sale, ""large enough for any man, small enough for any boy."", They therefore had taken a position calculated to break down their single important declared object., They were working for the election of either Gen. Cass or Gen. Taylor., The speaker then went on to show, clearly and eloquently, the danger of extension of slavery, likely to result from the election of Gen. Cass., To unite with those who annexed the new territory to prevent the extension of slavery in that territory seemed to him to be in the highest degree absurd and ridiculous., Suppose these gentlemen succeed in electing Mr. Van Buren, they had no specific means to prevent the extension of slavery to New Mexico and California, and Gen. Taylor, he confidently believed, would not encourage it, and would not prohibit its restriction., But if Gen. Cass was elected, he felt certain that the plans of farther extension of territory would be encouraged, and those of the extension of slavery would meet no check., The ""Free Soil"" mart in claiming that name indirectly attempts a deception, by implying that Whigs were not Free Soil men., Declaring that they would ""do their duty and leave the consequences to God"" merely gave an excuse for taking a course they were not able to maintain by a fair and full argument., To make this declaration did not show what their duty was., If it did we should have no use for judgment, we might as well be made without intellect; and when divine or human law does not clearly point out what is our duty, we have no means of finding out what it is but by using our most intelligent judgment of the consequences., If there were divine law or human law for voting for Martin Van Buren, or if a fair examination of the consequences and just reasoning would show that voting for him would bring about the ends they pretended to wish--then he would give up the argument., But since there was no fixed law on the subject, and since the whole probable result of their action would be an assistance in electing Gen. Cass, he must say that they were behind the Whigs in their advocacy of the freedom of the soil., Mr. Lincoln proceeded to rally the Buffalo convention for forbearing to say anything--after all the previous declarations of those members who were formerly Whigs--on the subject of the Mexican War, because the Van Burens had been known to have supported it., He declared that of all the parties asking the confidence of the country, this new one had less of principle than any other., He wondered whether it was still the opinion of these Free Soil gentlemen, as declared in the ""whereas"" at Buffalo, that the Whig and Democratic parties were both entirely dissolved and absorbed into their own body., Had the Vermont election given them any light?, They had calculated on making as great an impression in that State as in any part of the Union, and there their attempts had been wholly ineffectual., Their failure was a greater success than they would find in any other part of the Union., Mr. Lincoln went on to say that he honestly believed that all those who wished to keep up the character of the Union; who did not believe in enlarging our field, but in keeping our fences where they are and cultivating our present possessions, making it a garden, improving the morals and education of the people, devoting the administrations to this purpose; all real Whigs, friends of good honest government--the race was ours., He had opportunities of hearing from almost every part of the Union from reliable sources and had not heard of a county in which we had not received accessions from other parties., If the true Whigs come forward and join these new friends, they need not have a doubt., We had a candidate whose personal character and principles he had already described, whom he could not eulogize if he would., Gen. Taylor had been constantly, perseveringly, quietly standing up, doing his duty and asking no praise or reward for it., He was and must be just the man to whom the interests, principles, and prosperity of the country might be safely intrusted., He had never failed in anything he had undertaken, although many of his duties had been considered almost impossible., Mr. Lincoln then went into a terse though rapid review of the origin of the Mexican War and the connection of the administration and General Taylor with it, from which he deduced a strong appeal to the Whigs present to do their duty in the support of General Taylor, and closed with the warmest aspirations for and confidence in a deserved success., At the close of his truly masterly and convincing speech, the audience gave three enthusiastic cheers for Illinois, and three more for the eloquent Whig member from the State., Your letter of the 7th was received night before last., I very cheerfully send you the twenty dollars, which sum you say is necessary to save your land from sale., It is singular that you should have forgotten a judgment against you; and it is more singular that the plaintiff should have let you forget it so long; particularly as I suppose you always had property enough to satisfy a judgment of that amount., Before you pay it, it would be well to be sure you have not paid, or at least, that you cannot prove you have paid it., Give my love to mother and all the connections., Affectionately your son,  Resolved, That the Committee on the District of Columbia be instructed to report a bill in substance as follows:  Sec., 1., Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States, in Congress assembled, That no person not now within the District of Columbia, nor now owned by any person or persons now resident within it, nor hereafter born within it, shall ever be held in slavery within said District., Sec., 2., That no person now within said District, or now owned by any person or persons now resident within the same, or hereafter born within it, shall ever be held in slavery without the limits of said District: Provided, That officers of the Government of the United States, being citizens of the slaveholding States, coming into said District on public business, and remaining only so long as may be reasonably necessary for that object, may be attended into and out of said District, and while there, by the necessary servants of themselves and their families, without their right to hold such servants in service being thereby impaired., Sec., 3., That all children born of slave mothers within said District, on or after the first day of January, in the year of our Lord eighteen hundred and fifty, shall be free; but shall be reasonably supported and educated by the respective owners of their mothers, or by their heirs or representatives, and shall owe reasonable service as apprentices to such owners, heirs, or representatives, until they respectively arrive at the age of __ years, when they shall be entirely free; and the municipal authorities of Washington and Georgetown, within their respective jurisdictional limits, are hereby empowered and required to make all suitable and necessary provision for enforcing obedience to this section, on the part of both masters and apprentices., Sec., 4., That all persons now within this District, lawfully held as slaves, or now owned by any person or persons now resident within said District, shall remain such at the will of their respective owners, their heirs, and legal representatives: Provided, That such owner, or his legal representative, may at any time receive from the Treasury of the United States the full value of his or her slave, of the class in this section mentioned, upon which such slave shall be forthwith and forever free: And provided further, That the President of the United States, the Secretary of State, and the Secretary of the Treasury shall be a board for determining the value of such slaves as their owners may desire to emancipate under this section, and whose duty it shall be to hold a session for the purpose on the first Monday of each calendar month, to receive all applications, and, on satisfactory evidence in each case that the person presented for valuation is a slave, and of the class in this section mentioned, and is owned by the applicant, shall value such slave at his or her full cash value, and give to the applicant an order on the Treasury for the amount, and also to such slave a certificate of freedom., Sec., 5., That the municipal authorities of Washington and Georgetown, within their respective jurisdictional limits, are hereby empowered and required to provide active and efficient means to arrest and deliver up to their owners all fugitive slaves escaping into said District., Sec., 6., That the election officers within said District of Columbia are hereby empowered and required to open polls, at all the usual places of holding elections, on the first Monday of April next, and receive the vote of every free white male citizen above the age of twenty-one years, having resided within said District for the period of one year or more next preceding the time of such voting for or against this act, to proceed in taking said votes, in all respects not herein specified, as at elections under the municipal laws, and with as little delay as possible to transmit correct statements of the votes so cast to the President of the United States; and it shall be the duty of the President to canvass said votes immediately, and if a majority of them be found to be for this act, to forthwith issue his proclamation giving notice of the fact; and this act shall only be in full force and effect on and after the day of such proclamation., Sec., 7., ...]",3
219,"[This office is not confined to my district, but pertains to the whole State; so that Colonel Baker has an equal right with myself to be heard concerning it., However, the office is located here; and I think it is not probable that any one would desire to remove from a distance to take it., A tirade is still kept up against me here for recommending T. R. King., This morning it is openly avowed that my supposed influence at Washington shall be broken down generally, and King's prospects defeated in particular., Now, what I have done in this matter I have done at the request of you and some other friends in Tazewell; and I therefore ask you to either admit it is wrong or come forward and sustain me., If the truth will permit, I propose that you sustain me in the following manner: copy the inclosed scrap in your own handwriting and get everybody (not three or four, but three or four hundred) to sign it, and then send it to me., Also, have six, eight or ten of our best known Whig friends there write to me individual letters, stating the truth in this matter as they understand it., Don't neglect or delay in the matter., I understand information of an indictment having been found against him about three years ago, for gaming or keeping a gaming house, has been sent to the department., I shall try to take care of it at the department till your action can be had and forwarded on., I regret troubling you so often in relation to the land-offices here, but I hope you will perceive the necessity of it, and excuse me., On the 7th of April I wrote you recommending Turner R. King for register, and Walter Davis for receiver., Subsequently I wrote you that, for a private reason, I had concluded to transpose them., That private reason was the request of an old personal friend who himself desired to be receiver, but whom I felt it my duty to refuse a recommendation., He said if I would transpose King and Davis he would be satisfied., I thought it a whim, but, anxious to oblige him, I consented., Immediately he commenced an assault upon King's character, intending, as I suppose, to defeat his appointment, and thereby secure another chance for himself., This double offence of bad faith to me and slander upon a good man is so totally outrageous that I now ask to have King and Davis placed as I originally recommended,--that is, King for register and Davis for receiver., An effort is being made now to have Mr. Barret, the present register, retained., I have already said he has done the duties of the office well, and I now add he is a gentleman in the true sense., Still, he submits to be the instrument of his party to injure us., His high character enables him to do it more effectually., Last year he presided at the convention which nominated the Democratic candidate for Congress in this district, and afterward ran for the State Senate himself, not desiring the seat, but avowedly to aid and strengthen his party., He made speech after speech with a degree of fierceness and coarseness against General Taylor not quite consistent with his habitually gentlemanly deportment., At least one (and I think more) of those who are now trying to have him retained was himself an applicant for this very office, and, failing to get my recommendation, now takes this turn., In writing you a third time in relation to these offices, I stated that I supposed charges had been forwarded to you against King, and that I would inquire into the truth of them., I now send you herewith what I suppose will be an ample defense against any such charges., I ask attention to all the papers, but particularly to the letters of Mr. David Mack, and the paper with the long list of names., There is no mistake about King's being a good man., After the unjust assault upon him, and considering the just claims of Tazewell County, as indicated in the letters I inclose you, it would in my opinion be injustice, and withal a blunder, not to appoint him, at least as soon as any one is appointed to either of the offices here., Butterfield will be commissioner of the Gen'l Land Office, unless prevented by strong and speedy efforts., Ewing is for him, and he is only not appointed yet because Old Zach., hangs fire., I have reliable information of this., Now, if you agree with me that this appointment would dissatisfy rather than gratify the Whigs of this State, that it would slacken their energies in future contests, that his appointment in '41 is an old sore with them which they will not patiently have reopened,--in a word that his appointment now would be a fatal blunder to the administration and our political men here in Illinois, write Crittenden to that effect., He can control the matter., Were you to write Ewing I fear the President would never hear of your letter., This may be mere suspicion., You might write directly to Old Zach., You will be the best judge of the propriety of that., Not a moment's time is to be lost., Let this be confidential except with Mr. Edwards and a few others whom you know I would trust just as I do you., I am about to ask a favor of you, one which I hope will not cost you much., I understand the General Land-Office is about to be given to Illinois, and that Mr. Ewing desires Justin Butterfield, of Chicago, to be the man., I give you my word, the appointment of Mr. Butterfield will be an egregious political blunder., It will give offence to the whole Whig party here, and be worse than a dead loss to the administration of so much of its patronage., Now, if you can conscientiously do so, I wish you to write General Taylor at once, saying that either I or the man I recommend should in your opinion be appointed to that office, if any one from Illinois shall be., I restrict my request to Illinois because you may have a man from your own State, and I do not ask to interfere with that., What I claim as my invention, and desire to secure by letters patent, is the combination of expansible buoyant chambers placed at the sides of a vessel with the main shaft or shafts by means of the sliding spars, which pass down through the buoyant chambers and are made fast to their bottoms and the series of ropes and pulleys or their equivalents in such a manner that by turning the main shaft or shafts in one direction the buoyant chambers will be forced downward into the water, and at the same time expanded and filled with air for buoying up the vessel by the displacement of water, and by turning the shafts in an opposite direction the buoyant chambers will be contracted into a small space and secured against injury., Vandalia, the receiver's office at which place is the subject of the within, is not in my district; and I have been much perplexed to express any preference between Dr. Stapp and Mr. Remann., If any one man is better qualified for such an office than all others, Dr. Stapp is that man; still, I believe a large majority of the Whigs of the district prefer Mr. Remann, who also is a good man., Perhaps the papers on file will enable you to judge better than I can., The writers of the within are good men, residing within the land district., Your two letters were received last night., I have a great many letters to write, and so cannot write very long ones., There must be some mistake about Walter Davis saying I promised him the post-office., I did not so promise him., I did tell him that if the distribution of the offices should fall into my hands, he should have something; and if I shall be convinced he has said any more than this, I shall be disappointed., I said this much to him because, as I understand, he is of good character, is one of the young men, is of the mechanics, and always faithful and never troublesome; a Whig, and is poor, with the support of a widow mother thrown almost exclusively on him by the death of his brother., If these are wrong reasons, then I have been wrong; but I have certainly not been selfish in it, because in my greatest need of friends he was against me, and for Baker., Mr. Edwards is unquestionably offended with me in connection with the matter of the General Land-Office., He wrote a letter against me which was filed at the department., The better part of one's life consists of his friendships; and, of them, mine with Mr. Edwards was one of the most cherished., I have not been false to it., At a word I could have had the office any time before the department was committed to Mr. Butterfield, at least Mr. Ewing and the President say as much., That word I forbore to speak, partly for other reasons, but chiefly for Mr. Edwards' sake, losing the office (that he might gain it) I was always for; but to lose his friendship, by the effort for him, would oppress me very much, were I not sustained by the utmost consciousness of rectitude., I first determined to be an applicant, unconditionally, on the 2nd of June; and I did so then upon being informed by a telegraphic despatch that the question was narrowed down to Mr. B and myself, and that the Cabinet had postponed the appointment three weeks, for my benefit., Not doubting that Mr. Edwards was wholly out of the question I, nevertheless, would not then have become an applicant had I supposed he would thereby be brought to suspect me of treachery to him., Two or three days afterwards a conversation with Levi Davis convinced me Mr. Edwards was dissatisfied; but I was then too far in to get out., His own letter, written on the 25th of April, after I had fully informed him of all that had passed, up to within a few days of that time, gave assurance I had that entire confidence from him which I felt my uniform and strong friendship for him entitled me to., Among other things it says, ""Whatever course your judgment may dictate as proper to be pursued, shall never be excepted to by me."", I also had had a letter from Washington, saying Chambers, of the Republic, had brought a rumor then, that Mr. E had declined in my favor, which rumor I judged came from Mr. E himself, as I had not then breathed of his letter to any living creature., In saying I had never, before the 2nd of June, determined to be an applicant, unconditionally, I mean to admit that, before then, I had said substantially I would take the office rather than it should be lost to the State, or given to one in the State whom the Whigs did not want; but I aver that in every instance in which I spoke of myself, I intended to keep, and now believe I did keep, Mr. E above myself., Mr. Edwards' first suspicion was that I had allowed Baker to overreach me, as his friend, in behalf of Don Morrison., I knew this was a mistake; and the result has proved it., I understand his view now is, that if I had gone to open war with Baker I could have ridden him down, and had the thing all my own way., I believe no such thing., With Baker and some strong man from the Military tract & elsewhere for Morrison, and we and some strong man from the Wabash & elsewhere for Mr. E, it was not possible for either to succeed., I believed this in March, and I know it now., The only thing which gave either any chance was the very thing Baker & I proposed,--an adjustment with themselves., You may wish to know how Butterfield finally beat me., I can not tell you particulars now, but will when I see you., In the meantime let it be understood I am not greatly dissatisfied,--I wish the offer had been so bestowed as to encourage our friends in future contests, and I regret exceedingly Mr. Edwards' feelings towards me., These two things away, I should have no regrets,--at least I think I would not., Resolved, That, in their present glorious struggle for liberty, the Hungarians command our highest admiration and have our warmest sympathy., Resolved, That they have our most ardent prayers for their speedy triumph and final success., Resolved, That the Government of the United States should acknowledge the independence of Hungary as a nation of freemen at the very earliest moment consistent with our amicable relations with the government against which they are contending., Resolved, That, in the opinion of this meeting, the immediate acknowledgment of the independence of Hungary by our government is due from American freemen to their struggling brethren, to the general cause of republican liberty, and not violative of the just rights of any nation or people., Your letter of the 9th was received a day or two ago., The notes and mortgages you enclosed me were duly received., I also got the original Blanchard mortgage from Antrim Campbell, with whom Blanchard had left it for you., I got a decree of foreclosure on the whole; but, owing to there being no redemption on the sale to be under the Blanchard mortgage, the court allowed Mobley till the first of March to pay the money, before advertising for sale., Stuart was empowered by Mobley to appear for him, and I had to take such decree as he would consent to, or none at all., I cast the matter about in my mind and concluded that as I could not get a decree we would put the accrued interest at interest, and thereby more than match the fact of throwing the Blanchard debt back from twelve to six per cent., it was better to do it., This is the present state of the case., I can well enough understand and appreciate your suggestions about the Land-Office at Danville; but in my present condition, I can do nothing., On my return from Kentucky I found your letter of the 7th of November, and have delayed answering it till now for the reason I now briefly state., From the beginning of our acquaintance I had felt the greatest kindness for you and had supposed it was reciprocated on your part., Last summer, under circumstances which I mentioned to you, I was painfully constrained to withhold a recommendation which you desired, and shortly afterwards I learned, in such a way as to believe it, that you were indulging in open abuse of me., Of course my feelings were wounded., ...]",3
220,"[Your Petitioner further states that the reasons of his not being present at said trial, as he was not, and of its not being in his power to take an appeal in the ordinary way, as it was not, were that your Petitioner then resided in Edgar County about one hundred and twenty miles from where defendants resided; that a very short time before the suit was commenced your Petitioner was in Sangamon County for the purpose of collecting debts due him, and with the rest, the note in question, which note had then been given more than a year, that your Petitioner then saw the defendant J. L. Gerard who is the principal in said note, and solicited payment of the same; that said defendant then made no pretense that he did not owe the same, but on the contrary expressly promised that he would come into Springfield, in a very few days and either pay the money, or give a new note, payable by the then next Christmas; that your Petitioner accordingly left said note with said J. C. Spugg, with directions to give defendant full time to pay the money or give the new note as above, and if he did neither to sue; and then affiant came home to Edgar County, not having the slightest suspicion that if suit should be brought, the defendants would make any defense whatever; and your Petitioner never did in any way learn that said suit had been commenced until more than twenty days after it had been decided against him., He therefore prays for a writ of Certiorari., Inclosed is the deed for the land., We are all well, and have nothing in the way of news., We have had no Cholera here for about two weeks., Give my love to all, and especially to Mother., When I came into Charleston day before yesterday I learned that you are anxious to sell the land where you live, and move to Missouri., I have been thinking of this ever since, and cannot but think such a notion is utterly foolish., What can you do in Missouri better than here?, Is the land richer?, Can you there, any more than here, raise corn and wheat and oats without work?, Will anybody there, any more than here, do your work for you?, If you intend to go to work, there is no better place than right where you are; if you do not intend to go to work you cannot get along anywhere., Squirming and crawling about from place to place can do no good., You have raised no crop this year, and what you really want is to sell the land, get the money and spend it., Part with the land you have, and, my life upon it, you will never after own a spot big enough to bury you in., Half you will get for the land you spend in moving to Missouri, and the other half you will eat and drink and wear out, and no foot of land will be bought., Now I feel it is my duty to have no hand in such a piece of foolery., I feel that it is so even on your own account, and particularly on Mother's account., The eastern forty acres I intend to keep for Mother while she lives; if you will not cultivate it, it will rent for enough to support her; at least it will rent for something., Her dower in the other two forties she can let you have, and no thanks to me., Now do not misunderstand this letter., I do not write it in any unkindness., I write it in order, if possible, to get you to face the truth, which truth is, you are destitute because you have idled away all your time., Your thousand pretenses for not getting along better are all nonsense; they deceive nobody but yourself., Go to work is the only cure for your case., A word for Mother: Chapman tells me he wants you to go and live with him., If I were you I would try it awhile., If you get tired of it (as I think you will not) you can return to your own home., Chapman feels very kindly to you; and I have no doubt he will make your situation very pleasant., Chapman tells me he wants you to go and live with him., If I were you I would try it awhile., If you get tired of it (as I think you will not) you can return to your own home., Chapman feels very kindly to you; and I have no doubt he will make your situation very pleasant., When I wrote you before, I had not received your letter., I still think as I did, but if the land can be sold so that I get three hundred dollars to put to interest for Mother, I will not object, if she does not., But before I will make a deed, the money must be had, or secured beyond all doubt, at ten per cent., As to Abram, I do not want him, on my own account; but I understand he wants to live with me, so that he can go to school and get a fair start in the world, which I very much wish him to have., When I reach home, if I can make it convenient to take, I will take him, provided there is no mistake between us as to the object and terms of my taking him., In haste, as ever,   Your letter of the 22d is just received., Your proposal about selling the east forty acres of land is all that I want or could claim for myself; but I am not satisfied with it on Mother's account--I want her to have her living, and I feel that it is my duty, to some extent, to see that she is not wronged., She had a right of dower (that is, the use of one-third for life) in the other two forties; but, it seems, she has already let you take that, hook and line., She now has the use of the whole of the east forty, as long as she lives; and if it be sold, of course she is entitled to the interest on all the money it brings, as long as she lives; but you propose to sell it for three hundred dollars, take one hundred away with you, and leave her two hundred at 8 per cent., making her the enormous sum of 16 dollars a year., Now, if you are satisfied with treating her in that way, I am not., It is true that you are to have that forty for two hundred dollars, at Mother's death, but you are not to have it before., I am confident that land can be made to produce for Mother at least $30 a year, and I can not, to oblige any living person, consent that she shall be put on an allowance of sixteen dollars a year., On the fourth day of July, 1776, the people of a few feeble and oppressed colonies of Great Britain, inhabiting a portion of the Atlantic coast of North America, publicly declared their national independence, and made their appeal to the justice of their cause and to the God of battles for the maintenance of that declaration., That people were few in number and without resources, save only their wise heads and stout hearts., Within the first year of that declared independence, and while its maintenance was yet problematical, while the bloody struggle between those resolute rebels and their haughty would-be masters was still waging,--of undistinguished parents and in an obscure district of one of those colonies Henry Clay was born., The infant nation and the infant child began the race of life together., For three quarters of a century they have travelled hand in hand., They have been companions ever., The nation has passed its perils, and it is free, prosperous, and powerful., The child has reached his manhood, his middle age, his old age, and is dead., In all that has concerned the nation the man ever sympathized; and now the nation mourns the man., The day after his death one of the public journals, opposed to him politically, held the following pathetic and beautiful language, which I adopt partly because such high and exclusive eulogy, originating with a political friend, might offend good taste, but chiefly because I could not in any language of my own so well express my thoughts:  ""Alas, who can realize that Henry Clay is dead!, Who can realize that never again that majestic form shall rise in the council-chambers of his country to beat back the storms of anarchy which may threaten, or pour the oil of peace upon the troubled billows as they rage and menace around!, Who can realize that the workings of that mighty mind have ceased, that the throbbings of that gallant heart are stilled, that the mighty sweep of that graceful arm will be felt no more, and the magic of that eloquent tongue, which spake as spake no other tongue besides, is hushed hushed for ever!, Who can realize that freedom's champion, the champion of a civilized world and of all tongues and kindreds of people, has indeed fallen!, Alas, in those dark hours of peril and dread which our land has experienced, and which she may be called to experience again, to whom now may her people look up for that counsel and advice which only wisdom and experience and patriotism can give, and which only the undoubting confidence of a nation will receive?, Perchance in the whole circle of the great and gifted of our land there remains but one on whose shoulders the mighty mantle of the departed statesman may fall; one who while we now write is doubtless pouring his tears over the bier of his brother and friend brother, friend, ever, yet in political sentiment as far apart as party could make them., Ah, it is at times like these that the petty distinctions of mere party disappear., We see only the great, the grand, the noble features of the departed statesman; and we do not even beg permission to bow at his feet and mingle our tears with those who have ever been his political adherents--we do [not] beg this permission, we claim it as a right, though we feel it as a privilege., Henry Clay belonged to his country--to the world; mere party cannot claim men like him., His career has been national, his fame has filled the earth, his memory will endure to the last syllable of recorded time., ""Henry Clay is dead!, He breathed his last on yesterday, at twenty minutes after eleven, in his chamber at Washington., To those who followed his lead in public affairs, it more appropriately belongs to pronounce his eulogy and pay specific honors to the memory of the illustrious dead., But all Americans may show the grief which his death inspires, for his character and fame are national property., As on a question of liberty he knew no North, no South, no East, no West, but only the Union which held them all in its sacred circle, so now his countrymen will know no grief that is not as wide-spread as the bounds of the confederacy., The career of Henry Clay was a public career., From his youth he has been devoted to the public service, at a period, too, in the world's history justly regarded as a remarkable era in human affairs., He witnessed in the beginning the throes of the French Revolution., He saw the rise and fall of Napoleon., He was called upon to legislate for America and direct her policy when all Europe was the battlefield of contending dynasties, and when the struggle for supremacy imperilled the rights of all neutral nations., His voice spoke war and peace in the contest with Great Britain., ""When Greece rose against the Turks and struck for liberty, his name was mingled with the battle-cry of freedom., When South America threw off the thraldom of Spain, his speeches were read at the head of her armies by Bolivar., His name has been, and will continue to be, hallowed in two hemispheres, for it is       ""'One of the few, the immortal names       That were not born to die!', ""To the ardent patriot and profound statesman he added a quality possessed by few of the gifted on earth., His eloquence has not been surpassed., In the effective power to move the heart of man, Clay was without an equal, and the heaven-born endowment, in the spirit of its origin, has been most conspicuously exhibited against intestine feud., On at least three important occasions he has quelled our civil commotions by a power and influence which belonged to no other statesman of his age and times., And in our last internal discord, when this Union trembled to its centre, in old age he left the shades of private life, and gave the death-blow to fraternal strife, with the vigor of his earlier years, in a series of senatorial efforts which in themselves would bring immortality by challenging comparison with the efforts of any statesman in any age., He exorcised the demon which possessed the body politic, and gave peace to a distracted land., Alas!, the achievement cost him his life., He sank day by day to the tomb his pale but noble brow bound with a triple wreath, put there by a grateful country., May his ashes rest in peace, while his spirit goes to take its station among the great and good men who preceded him."", While it is customary and proper upon occasions like the present to give a brief sketch of the life of the deceased, in the case of Mr. Clay it is less necessary than most others; for his biography has been written and rewritten and read and reread for the last twenty-five years; so that, with the exception of a few of the latest incidents of his life, all is as well known as it can be., The short sketch which I give is, therefore, merely to maintain the connection of this discourse., Henry Clay was born on the twelfth day of April, 1777, in Hanover County, Virginia., Of his father, who died in the fourth or fifth year of Henry's age, little seems to be known, except that he was a respectable man and a preacher of the Baptist persuasion., Mr. Clay's education to the end of life was comparatively limited., I say ""to the end of life,"" because I have understood that from time to time he added something to his education during the greater part of his whole life., Mr. Clay's lack of a more perfect early education, however it may be regretted generally, teaches at least one profitable lesson: it teaches that in this country one can scarcely be so poor but that, if he will, he can acquire sufficient education to get through the world respectably., In his twenty-third year Mr. Clay was licensed to practise law, and emigrated to Lexington, Kentucky., Here he commenced and continued the practice till the year 1803, when he was first elected to the Kentucky Legislature., By successive elections he was continued in the Legislature till the latter part of 1806, when he was elected to fill a vacancy of a single session in the United States Senate., In 1807 he was again elected to the Kentucky House of Representatives, and by that body chosen Speaker., ...]",3
221,"[But this is a reprieve only, not a final sentence., A geographical line coinciding with a marked principle, moral and political, once conceived and held up to the angry passions of men, will never be obliterated, and every irritation will mark it deeper and deeper., I can say with conscious truth that there is not a man on earth who would sacrifice more than I would to relieve us from this heavy reproach in any practicable way., ""The cession of that kind of property--for it is so misnamed--is a bagatelle which would not cost me a second thought if in that way a general emancipation and expatriation could be effected, and gradually and with due sacrifices I think it might be., But as it is, we have the wolf by the ears, and we can neither hold him nor safely let him go., Justice is in one scale, and self-preservation in the other."", Mr. Clay was in Congress, and, perceiving the danger, at once engaged his whole energies to avert it., It began, as I have said, in 1819; and it did not terminate till 1821., Missouri would not yield the point; and Congress that is, a majority in Congress--by repeated votes showed a determination not to admit the State unless it should yield., After several failures, and great labor on the part of Mr. Clay to so present the question that a majority could consent to the admission, it was by a vote rejected, and, as all seemed to think, finally., A sullen gloom hung over the nation., All felt that the rejection of Missouri was equivalent to a dissolution of the Union, because those States which already had what Missouri was rejected for refusing to relinquish would go with Missouri., All deprecated and deplored this, but none saw how to avert it., For the judgment of members to be convinced of the necessity of yielding was not the whole difficulty; each had a constituency to meet and to answer to., Mr. Clay, though worn down and exhausted, was appealed to by members to renew his efforts at compromise., He did so, and by some judicious modifications of his plan, coupled with laborious efforts with individual members and his own overmastering eloquence upon that floor, he finally secured the admission of the State., Brightly and captivating as it had previously shown, it was now perceived that his great eloquence was a mere embellishment, or at most but a helping hand to his inventive genius and his devotion to his country in the day of her extreme peril., After the settlement of the Missouri question, although a portion of the American people have differed with Mr. Clay, and a majority even appear generally to have been opposed to him on questions of ordinary administration, he seems constantly to have been regarded by all as the man for the crisis., Accordingly, in the days of nullification, and more recently in the reappearance of the slavery question connected with our territory newly acquired of Mexico, the task of devising a mode of adjustment seems to have been cast upon Mr. Clay by common consent--and his performance of the task in each case was little else than a literal fulfilment of the public expectation., Mr. Clay's efforts in behalf of the South Americans, and afterward in behalf of the Greeks, in the times of their respective struggles for civil liberty, are among the finest on record, upon the noblest of all themes, and bear ample corroboration of what I have said was his ruling passion--a love of liberty and right, unselfishly, and for their own sakes., Having been led to allude to domestic slavery so frequently already, I am unwilling to close without referring more particularly to Mr. Clay's views and conduct in regard to it., He ever was on principle and in feeling opposed to slavery., The very earliest, and one of the latest, public efforts of his life, separated by a period of more than fifty years, were both made in favor of gradual emancipation., He did not perceive that on a question of human right the negroes were to be excepted from the human race., And yet Mr. Clay was the owner of slaves., Cast into life when slavery was already widely spread and deeply seated, he did not perceive, as I think no wise man has perceived, how it could be at once eradicated without producing a greater evil even to the cause of human liberty itself., His feeling and his judgment, therefore, ever led him to oppose both extremes of opinion on the subject., Those who would shiver into fragments the Union of these States, tear to tatters its now venerated Constitution, and even burn the last copy of the Bible, rather than slavery should continue a single hour, together with all their more halting sympathizers, have received, and are receiving, their just execration; and the name and opinions and influence of Mr. Clay are fully and, as I trust, effectually and enduringly arrayed against them., But I would also, if I could, array his name, opinions, and influence against the opposite extreme--against a few but an increasing number of men who, for the sake of perpetuating slavery, are beginning to assail and to ridicule the white man's charter of freedom, the declaration that ""all men are created free and equal."", So far as I have learned, the first American of any note to do or attempt this was the late John C. Calhoun; and if I mistake not, it soon after found its way into some of the messages of the Governor of South Carolina., We, however, look for and are not much shocked by political eccentricities and heresies in South Carolina., But only last year I saw with astonishment what purported to be a letter of a very distinguished and influential clergyman of Virginia, copied, with apparent approbation, into a St. Louis newspaper, containing the following to me very unsatisfactory language:  ""I am fully aware that there is a text in some Bibles that is not in mine., Professional abolitionists have made more use of it than of any passage in the Bible., It came, however, as I trace it, from Saint Voltaire, and was baptized by Thomas Jefferson, and since almost universally regarded as canonical authority`All men are born free and equal.', ""This is a genuine coin in the political currency of our generation., I am sorry to say that I have never seen two men of whom it is true., But I must admit I never saw the Siamese Twins, and therefore will not dogmatically say that no man ever saw a proof of this sage aphorism."", This sounds strangely in republican America., The like was not heard in the fresher days of the republic., Let us contrast with it the language of that truly national man whose life and death we now commemorate and lament: I quote from a speech of Mr. Clay delivered before the American Colonization Society in 1827:  ""We are reproached with doing mischief by the agitation of this question., The society goes into no household to disturb its domestic tranquillity., It addresses itself to no slaves to weaken their obligations of obedience., It seeks to affect no man's property., It neither has the power nor the will to affect the property of any one contrary to his consent., The execution of its scheme would augment instead of diminishing the value of property left behind., The society, composed of free men, conceals itself only with the free., Collateral consequences we are not responsible for., It is not this society which has produced the great moral revolution which the age exhibits., What would they who thus reproach us have done?, If they would repress all tendencies toward liberty and ultimate emancipation, they must do more than put down the benevolent efforts of this society., They must go back to the era of our liberty and independence, and muzzle the cannon which thunders its annual joyous return., They must renew the slave trade, with all its train of atrocities., They must suppress the workings of British philanthropy, seeking to meliorate the condition of the unfortunate West Indian slave., They must arrest the career of South American deliverance from thraldom., They must blow out the moral lights around us and extinguish that greatest torch of all which America presents to a benighted world--pointing the way to their rights, their liberties, and their happiness., And when they have achieved all those purposes their work will be yet incomplete., They must penetrate the human soul, and eradicate the light of reason and the love of liberty., Then, and not till then, when universal darkness and despair prevail, can you perpetuate slavery and repress all sympathy and all humane and benevolent efforts among free men in behalf of the unhappy portion of our race doomed to bondage."", The American Colonization Society was organized in 1816., Mr. Clay, though not its projector, was one of its earliest members; and he died, as for many preceding years he had been, its president., It was one of the most cherished objects of his direct care and consideration, and the association of his name with it has probably been its very greatest collateral support., He considered it no demerit in the society that it tended to relieve the slave-holders from the troublesome presence of the free negroes; but this was far from being its whole merit in his estimation., In the same speech from which we have quoted he says:  ""There is a moral fitness in the idea of returning to Africa her children, whose ancestors have been torn from her by the ruthless hand of fraud and violence., Transplanted in a foreign land, they will carry back to their native soil the rich fruits of religion, civilization, law, and liberty., May it not be one of the great designs of the Ruler of the universe, whose ways are often inscrutable by short-sighted mortals, thus to transform an original crime into a signal blessing to that most unfortunate portion of the globe?"", This suggestion of the possible ultimate redemption of the African race and African continent was made twenty-five years ago., Every succeeding year has added strength to the hope of its realization., May it indeed be realized., Pharaoh's country was cursed with plagues, and his hosts were lost in the Red Sea, for striving to retain a captive people who had already served them more than four hundred years., May like disasters never befall us!, If, as the friends of colonization hope, the present and coming generations of our countrymen shall by any means succeed in freeing our land from the dangerous presence of slavery, and at the same time in restoring a captive people to their long-lost fatherland with bright prospects for the future, and this too so gradually that neither races nor individuals shall have suffered by the change, it will indeed be a glorious consummation., And if to such a consummation the efforts of Mr. Clay shall have contributed, it will be what he most ardently wished, and none of his labors will have been more valuable to his country and his kind., But Henry Clay is dead., His long and eventful life is closed., Our country is prosperous and powerful; but could it have been quite all it has been, and is, and is to be, without Henry Clay?, Such a man the times have demanded, and such in the providence of God was given us., But he is gone., Let us strive to deserve, as far as mortals may, the continued care of Divine Providence, trusting that in future national emergencies He will not fail to provide us the instruments of safety and security., A leading article in the Daily Register of this morning has induced some of our friends to request our opinion on the election laws as applicable to challenged voters., We have examined the present constitution of the State, the election law of 1849, and the unrepealed parts of the election law in the revised code of 1845; and we are of the opinion that any person taking the oath prescribed in the act of 1849 is entitled to vote unless counter-proof be made satisfactory to a majority of the judges that such oath is untrue; and that for the purpose of obtaining such counter-proof, the proposed voter may be asked questions in the way of cross-examination, and other independent testimony may be received., We base our opinion as to receiving counter-proof upon the unrepealed Section nineteen of the election law in the revised code., I hope the subject-matter of this letter will appear a sufficient apology to you for the liberty I, a total stranger, take in addressing you., The persons here holding two lots under a conveyance made by you, as the attorney of Daniel M. Baily, now nearly twenty-two years ago, are in great danger of losing the lots, and very much, perhaps all, is to depend on the testimony you give as to whether you did or did not account to Baily for the proceeds received by you on this sale of the lots., I, therefore, as one of the counsel, beg of you to fully refresh your recollection by any means in your power before the time you may be called on to testify., If persons should come about you, and show a disposition to pump you on the subject, it may be no more than prudent to remember that it may be possible they design to misrepresent you and embarrass the real testimony you may ultimately give., It may be six months or a year before you are called on to testify., You, no doubt, remember the enclosed memorandum being handed me in your office., I have just made the desired search, and find that no such deed has ever been here., Campbell, the auditor, says that if it were here, it would be in his office, and that he has hunted for it a dozen times, and could never find it., He says that one time and another, he has heard much about the matter, that it was not a deed for Right of Way, but a deed, outright, for Depot-ground--at least, a sale for Depot-ground, and there may never have been a deed., He says, if there is a deed, it is most probable General Alexander, of Paris, has it., You know how anxious I am that this Nebraska measure shall be rebuked and condemned everywhere., Of course I hope something from your position; yet I do not expect you to do anything which may be wrong in your own judgment; nor would I have you do anything personally injurious to yourself., You are, and always have been, honestly and sincerely a Democrat; and I know how painful it must be to an honest, sincere man to be urged by his party to the support of a measure which in his conscience he believes to be wrong., You have had a severe struggle with yourself, and you have determined not to swallow the wrong., Is it not just to yourself that you should, in a few public speeches, state your reasons, and thus justify yourself?, I wish you would; and yet I say, don't do it, if you think it will injure you., You may have given your word to vote for Major Harris; and if so, of course you will stick to it., But allow me to suggest that you should avoid speaking of this; for it probably would induce some of your friends in like manner to cast their votes., You understand., ...]",3
222,"[Texas, principally south of the line, and west of Arkansas, though originally within the purchase from France, had, in 1819, been traded off to Spain in our treaty for the acquisition of Florida., It had thus become a part of Mexico., Mexico revolutionized and became independent of Spain., American citizens began settling rapidly with their slaves in the southern part of Texas., Soon they revolutionized against Mexico, and established an independent government of their own, adopting a constitution with slavery, strongly resembling the constitutions of our slave States., By still another rapid move, Texas, claiming a boundary much farther west than when we parted with her in 1819, was brought back to the United States, and admitted into the Union as a slave State., Then there was little or no settlement in the northern part of Texas, a considerable portion of which lay north of the Missouri line; and in the resolutions admitting her into the Union, the Missouri restriction was expressly extended westward across her territory., This was in 1845, only nine years ago., Thus originated the Missouri Compromise; and thus has it been respected down to 1845., And even four years later, in 1849, our distinguished Senator, in a public address, held the following language in relation to it:  ""The Missouri Compromise has been in practical operation for about a quarter of a century, and has received the sanction and approbation of men of all parties in every section of the Union., It has allayed all sectional jealousies and irritations growing out of this vexed question, and harmonized and tranquillized the whole country., It has given to Henry Clay, as its prominent champion, the proud sobriquet of the 'Great Pacificator,' and by that title, and for that service, his political friends had repeatedly appealed to the people to rally under his standard as a Presidential candidate, as the man who had exhibited the patriotism and power to suppress an unholy and treasonable agitation, and preserve the Union., He was not aware that any man or any party, from any section of the Union, had ever urged as an objection to Mr. Clay that he was the great champion of the Missouri Compromise., On the contrary, the effort was made by the opponents of Mr. Clay to prove that he was not entitled to the exclusive merit of that great patriotic measure, and that the honor was equally due to others, as well as to him, for securing its adoption; that it had its origin in the hearts of all patriotic men, who desired to preserve and perpetuate the blessings of our glorious Union--an origin akin to that of the Constitution of the United States, conceived in the same spirit of fraternal affection, and calculated to remove forever the only danger which seemed to threaten, at some distant day, to sever the social bond of union., All the evidences of public opinion at that day seemed to indicate that this compromise had been canonized in the hearts of the American people, as a sacred thing which no ruthless hand would ever be reckless enough to disturb."", I do not read this extract to involve Judge Douglas in an inconsistency., If he afterward thought he had been wrong, it was right for him to change., I bring this forward merely to show the high estimate placed on the Missouri Compromise by all parties up to so late as the year 1849., But going back a little in point of time., Our war with Mexico broke out in 1846., When Congress was about adjourning that session, President Polk asked them to place two millions of dollars under his control, to be used by him in the recess, if found practicable and expedient, in negotiating a treaty of peace with Mexico, and acquiring some part of her territory., A bill was duly gotten up for the purpose, and was progressing swimmingly in the House of Representatives, when a member by the name of David Wilmot, a Democrat from Pennsylvania, moved as an amendment, ""Provided, that in any territory thus acquired there never shall be slavery."", This is the origin of the far-famed Wilmot Proviso., It created a great flutter; but it stuck like wax, was voted into the bill, and the bill passed with it through the House., The Senate, however, adjourned without final action on it, and so both appropriation and proviso were lost for the time., The war continued, and at the next session the President renewed his request for the appropriation, enlarging the amount, I think, to three millions., Again came the proviso, and defeated the measure., Congress adjourned again, and the war went on., In December, 1847, the new Congress assembled., I was in the lower House that term., The Wilmot Proviso, or the principle of it, was constantly coming up in some shape or other, and I think I may venture to say I voted for it at least forty times during the short time I was there., The Senate, however, held it in check, and it never became a law., In the spring of 1848 a treaty of peace was made with Mexico, by which we obtained that portion of her country which now constitutes the Territories of New Mexico and Utah and the present State of California., By this treaty the Wilmot Proviso was defeated, in so far as it was intended to be a condition of the acquisition of territory., Its friends, however, were still determined to find some way to restrain slavery from getting into the new country., This new acquisition lay directly west of our old purchase from France, and extended west to the Pacific Ocean, and was so situated that if the Missouri line should be extended straight west, the new country would be divided by such extended line, leaving some north and some south of it., On Judge Douglas's motion, a bill, or provision of a bill, passed the Senate to so extend the Missouri line., The proviso men in the House, including myself, voted it down, because, by implication, it gave up the southern part to slavery, while we were bent on having it all free., In the fall of 1848 the gold-mines were discovered in California., This attracted people to it with unprecedented rapidity, so that on, or soon after, the meeting of the new Congress in December, 1849, she already had a population of nearly a hundred thousand, had called a convention, formed a State constitution excluding slavery, and was knocking for admission into the Union., The proviso men, of course, were for letting her in, but the Senate, always true to the other side, would not consent to her admission, and there California stood, kept out of the Union because she would not let slavery into her borders., Under all the circumstances, perhaps, this was not wrong., There were other points of dispute connected with the general question of Slavery, which equally needed adjustment., The South clamored for a more efficient fugitive slave law., The North clamored for the abolition of a peculiar species of slave trade in the District of Columbia, in connection with which, in view from the windows of the Capitol, a sort of negro livery-stable, where droves of negroes were collected, temporarily kept, and finally taken to Southern markets, precisely like droves of horses, had been openly maintained for fifty years., Utah and New Mexico needed territorial governments; and whether slavery should or should not be prohibited within them was another question., The indefinite western boundary of Texas was to be settled., She was a slave State, and consequently the farther west the slavery men could push her boundary, the more slave country they secured; and the farther east the slavery opponents could thrust the boundary back, the less slave ground was secured., Thus this was just as clearly a slavery question as any of the others., These points all needed adjustment, and they were held up, perhaps wisely, to make them help adjust one another., The Union now, as in 1820, was thought to be in danger, and devotion to the Union rightfully inclined men to yield somewhat in points where nothing else could have so inclined them., A compromise was finally effected., The South got their new fugitive slave law, and the North got California, (by far the best part of our acquisition from Mexico) as a free State., The South got a provision that New Mexico and Utah, when admitted as States, may come in with or without slavery as they may then choose; and the North got the slave trade abolished in the District of Columbia.., The North got the western boundary of Texas thrown farther back eastward than the South desired; but, in turn, they gave Texas ten millions of dollars with which to pay her old debts., This is the Compromise of 1850., Preceding the Presidential election of 1852, each of the great political parties, Democrats and Whigs, met in convention and adopted resolutions indorsing the Compromise of '50, as a ""finality,"" a final settlement, so far as these parties could make it so, of all slavery agitation., Previous to this, in 1851, the Illinois Legislature had indorsed it., During this long period of time, Nebraska (the Nebraska Territory, not the State of as we know it now) had remained substantially an uninhabited country, but now emigration to and settlement within it began to take place., It is about one third as large as the present United States, and its importance, so long overlooked, begins to come into view., The restriction of slavery by the Missouri Compromise directly applies to it--in fact was first made, and has since been maintained expressly for it., In 1853, a bill to give it a territorial government passed the House of Representatives, and, in the hands of Judge Douglas, failed of passing only for want of time., This bill contained no repeal of the Missouri Compromise., Indeed, when it was assailed because it did not contain such repeal, Judge Douglas defended it in its existing form., On January 4, 1854, Judge Douglas introduces a new bill to give Nebraska territorial government., He accompanies this bill with a report, in which last he expressly recommends that the Missouri Compromise shall neither be affirmed nor repealed., Before long the bill is so modified as to make two territories instead of one, calling the southern one Kansas., Also, about a month after the introduction of the bill, on the Judge's own motion it is so amended as to declare the Missouri Compromise inoperative and void; and, substantially, that the people who go and settle there may establish slavery, or exclude it, as they may see fit., In this shape the bill passed both branches of Congress and became a law., This is the repeal of the Missouri Compromise., The foregoing history may not be precisely accurate in every particular, but I am sure it is sufficiently so for all the use I shall attempt to make of it, and in it we have before us the chief material enabling us to judge correctly whether the repeal of the Missouri Compromise is right or wrong., I think, and shall try to show, that it is wrong--wrong in its direct effect, letting slavery into Kansas and Nebraska, and wrong in its prospective principle, allowing it to spread to every other part of the wide world where men can be found inclined to take it., This declared indifference, but, as I must think, covert real zeal, for the spread of slavery, I cannot but hate., I hate it because of the monstrous injustice of slavery itself., I hate it because it deprives our republican example of its just influence in the world; enables the enemies of free institutions with plausibility to taunt us as hypocrites; causes the real friends of freedom to doubt our sincerity; and especially because it forces so many good men among ourselves into an open war with the very fundamental principles of civil liberty, criticizing the Declaration of Independence, and insisting that there is no right principle of action but self-interest., Before proceeding let me say that I think I have no prejudice against the Southern people., They are just what we would be in their situation., If slavery did not now exist among them, they would not introduce it., If it did now exist among us, we should not instantly give it up., This I believe of the masses North and South., Doubtless there are individuals on both sides who would not hold slaves under any circumstances, and others who would gladly introduce slavery anew if it were out of existence., We know that some Southern men do free their slaves, go North and become tip-top abolitionists, while some Northern ones go South and become most cruel slave masters., When Southern people tell us that they are no more responsible for the origin of slavery than we are, I acknowledge the fact., When it is said that the institution exists, and that it is very difficult to get rid of it in any satisfactory way, I can understand and appreciate the saying., I surely will not blame them for not doing what I should not know how to do myself., If all earthly power were given me, I should not know what to do as to the existing institution., My first impulse would be to free all the slaves, and send them to Liberia, to their own native land., But a moment's reflection would convince me that whatever of high hope (as I think there is) there may be in this in the long run, its sudden execution is impossible., If they were all landed there in a day, they would all perish in the next ten days; and there are not surplus shipping and surplus money enough to carry them there in many times ten days., What then?, Free them all, and keep them among us as underlings?, Is it quite certain that this betters their condition?, I think I would not hold one in slavery at any rate, yet the point is not clear enough for me to denounce people upon., What next?, Free them, and make them politically and socially our equals?, My own feelings will not admit of this, and if mine would, we well know that those of the great mass of whites will not., Whether this feeling accords with justice and sound judgment is not the sole question, if indeed it is any part of it., A universal feeling, whether well or ill founded, cannot be safely disregarded., We cannot then make them equals., It does seem to me that systems of gradual emancipation might be adopted, but for their tardiness in this I will not undertake to judge our brethren of the South., ...]",3
223,"[It was frequently spoken of by members of Congress, and by citizens of Washington, six years ago; and I heard no one express a doubt that a system of gradual emancipation, with compensation to owners, would meet the approbation of a large majority of the white people of the District., But without the action of Congress they could say nothing; and Congress said ""No."", In the measures of 1850, Congress had the subject of slavery in the District expressly on hand., If they were then establishing the principle of allowing the people to do as they please with slavery, why did they not apply the principle to that people?, Again it is claimed that by the resolutions of the Illinois Legislature, passed in 1851, the repeal of the Missouri Compromise was demanded., This I deny also., Whatever may be worked out by a criticism of the language of those resolutions, the people have never understood them as being any more than an indorsement of the compromises of 1850, and a release of our senators from voting for the Wilmot Proviso., The whole people are living witnesses that this only was their view., Finally, it is asked, ""If we did not mean to apply the Utah and New Mexico provision to all future territories, what did we mean when we, in 1852, indorsed the compromises of 1850?"", For myself I can answer this question most easily., I meant not to ask a repeal or modification of the Fugitive Slave law., I meant not to ask for the abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia., I meant not to resist the admission of Utah and New Mexico, even should they ask to come in as slave States., I meant nothing about additional Territories, because, as I understood, we then had no Territory whose character as to slavery was not already settled., As to Nebraska, I regarded its character as being fixed by the Missouri Compromise for thirty years--as unalterably fixed as that of my own home in Illinois., As to new acquisitions, I said, ""Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof."", When we make new acquisitions, we will, as heretofore, try to manage them somehow., That is my answer; that is what I meant and said; and I appeal to the people to say each for himself whether that is not also the universal meaning of the free States., And now, in turn, let me ask a few questions., If, by any or all these matters, the repeal of the Missouri Compromise was commanded, why was not the command sooner obeyed?, Why was the repeal omitted in the Nebraska Bill of 1853?, Why was it omitted in the original bill of 1854?, Why in the accompanying report was such a repeal characterized as a departure from the course pursued in 1850 and its continued omission recommended?, I am aware Judge Douglas now argues that the subsequent express repeal is no substantial alteration of the bill., This argument seems wonderful to me., It is as if one should argue that white and black are not different., He admits, however, that there is a literal change in the bill, and that he made the change in deference to other senators who would not support the bill without., This proves that those other senators thought the change a substantial one, and that the Judge thought their opinions worth deferring to., His own opinions, therefore, seem not to rest on a very firm basis, even in his own mind; and I suppose the world believes, and will continue to believe, that precisely on the substance of that change this whole agitation has arisen., I conclude, then, that the public never demanded the repeal of the Missouri Compromise., I now come to consider whether the appeal with its avowed principles, is intrinsically right., I insist that it is not., Take the particular case., A controversy had arisen between the advocates and opponents of slavery, in relation to its establishment within the country we had purchased of France., The southern, and then best, part of the purchase was already in as a slave State., The controversy was settled by also letting Missouri in as a slave State; but with the agreement that within all the remaining part of the purchase, north of a certain line, there should never be slavery., As to what was to be done with the remaining part, south of the line, nothing was said; but perhaps the fair implication was, it should come in with slavery if it should so choose., The southern part, except a portion heretofore mentioned, afterward did come in with slavery, as the State of Arkansas., All these many years, since 1820, the northern part had remained a wilderness., At length settlements began in it also., In due course Iowa came in as a free State, and Minnesota was given a territorial government, without removing the slavery restriction., Finally, the sole remaining part north of the line--Kansas and Nebraska--was to be organized; and it is proposed, and carried, to blot out the old dividing line of thirty-four years' standing, and to open the whole of that country to the introduction of slavery., Now this, to my mind, is manifestly unjust., After an angry and dangerous controversy, the parties made friends by dividing the bone of contention., The one party first appropriates her own share, beyond all power to be disturbed in the possession of it, and then seizes the share of the other party., It is as if two starving men had divided their only loaf, the one had hastily swallowed his half, and then grabbed the other's half just as he was putting it to his mouth., Let me here drop the main argument, to notice what I consider rather an inferior matter., It is argued that slavery will not go to Kansas and Nebraska, in any event., This is a palliation, a lullaby., I have some hope that it will not; but let us not be too confident., As to climate, a glance at the map shows that there are five slave States--Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, Kentucky, and Missouri, and also the District of Columbia, all north of the Missouri Compromise line., The census returns of 1850 show that within these there are eight hundred and sixty-seven thousand two hundred and seventy-six slaves, being more than one fourth of all the slaves in the nation., It is not climate, then, that will keep slavery out of these Territories., Is there anything in the peculiar nature of the country?, Missouri adjoins these Territories by her entire western boundary, and slavery is already within every one of her western counties., I have even heard it said that there are more slaves in proportion to whites in the northwestern county of Missouri than within any other county in the State., Slavery pressed entirely up to the old western boundary of the State, and when rather recently a part of that boundary at the northwest was moved out a little farther west, slavery followed on quite up to the new line., Now, when the restriction is removed, what is to prevent it from going still farther?, Climate will not, no peculiarity of the country will, nothing in nature will., Will the disposition of the people prevent it?, Those nearest the scene are all in favor of the extension., The Yankees who are opposed to it may be most flumerous; but, in military phrase, the battlefield is too far from their base of operations., But it is said there now is no law in Nebraska on the subject of slavery, and that, in such case, taking a slave there operates his freedom., That is good book-law, but it is not the rule of actual practice., Wherever slavery is it has been first introduced without law., The oldest laws we find concerning it are not laws introducing it, but regulating it as an already existing thing., A white man takes his slave to Nebraska now., Who will inform the negro that he is free?, Who will take him before court to test the question of his freedom?, In ignorance of his legal emancipation he is kept chopping, splitting, and plowing., Others are brought, and move on in the same track., At last, if ever the time for voting comes on the question of slavery the institution already, in fact, exists in the country, and cannot well be removed., The fact of its presence, and the difficulty of its removal, will carry the vote in its favor., Keep it out until a vote is taken, and a vote in favor of it cannot be got in any population of forty thousand on earth, who have been drawn together by the ordinary motives of emigration and settlement., To get slaves into the Territory simultaneously with the whites in the incipient stages of settlement is the precise stake played for and won in this Nebraska measure., The question is asked us: ""If slaves will go in notwithstanding the general principle of law liberates them, why would they not equally go in against positive statute law--go in, even if the Missouri restriction were maintained!"", I answer, because it takes a much bolder man to venture in with his property in the latter case than in the former; because the positive Congressional enactment is known to and respected by all, or nearly all, whereas the negative principle that no law is free law is not much known except among lawyers., We have some experience of this practical difference., In spite of the Ordinance of '87, a few negroes were brought into Illinois, and held in a state of quasi-slavery, not enough, however, to carry a vote of the people in favor of the institution when they came to form a constitution., But into the adjoining Missouri country, where there was no Ordinance of '87,--was no restriction,--they were carried ten times, nay, a hundred times, as fast, and actually made a slave State., This is fact-naked fact., Another lullaby argument is that taking slaves to new countries does not increase their number, does not make any one slave who would otherwise be free., There is some truth in this, and I am glad of it; but it is not wholly true., The African slave trade is not yet effectually suppressed; and, if we make a reasonable deduction for the white people among us who are foreigners and the descendants of foreigners arriving here since 1808, we shall find the increase of the black population outrunning that of the white to an extent unaccountable, except by supposing that some of them, too, have been coming from Africa., If this be so, the opening of new countries to the institution increases the demand for and augments the price of slaves, and so does, in fact, make slaves of freemen, by causing them to be brought from Africa and sold into bondage., But however this may be, we know the opening of new countries to slavery tends to the perpetuation of the institution, and so does keep men in slavery who would otherwise be free., This result we do not feel like favoring, and we are under no legal obligation to suppress our feelings in this respect., Equal justice to the South, it is said, requires us to consent to the extension of slavery to new countries., That is to say, inasmuch as you do not object to my taking my hog to Nebraska, therefore I must not object to your taking your slave., Now, I admit that this is perfectly logical if there is no difference between hogs and negroes., But while you thus require me to deny the humanity of the negro, I wish to ask whether you of the South, yourselves, have ever been willing to do as much?, It is kindly provided that of all those who come into the world only a small percentage are natural tyrants., That percentage is no larger in the slave States than in the free., The great majority South, as well as North, have human sympathies, of which they can no more divest themselves than they can of their sensibility to physical pain., These sympathies in the bosoms of the Southern people manifest, in many ways, their sense of the wrong of slavery, and their consciousness that, after all, there is humanity in the negro., If they deny this, let me address them a few plain questions., In 1820 you (the South) joined the North, almost unanimously, in declaring the African slave trade piracy, and in annexing to it the punishment of death., Why did you do this?, If you did not feel that it was wrong, why did you join in providing that men should be hung for it?, The practice was no more than bringing wild negroes from Africa to such as would buy them., ...]",3
224,"[If this be the rule, you must leave it to each individual to say for himself whether he will have slaves., What better moral right have thirty-one citizens of Nebraska to say that the thirty-second shall not hold slaves than the people of the thirty-one States have to say that slavery shall not go into the thirty-second State at all?, But if it is a sacred right for the people of Nebraska to take and hold slaves there, it is equally their sacred right to buy them where they can buy them cheapest; and that, undoubtedly, will be on the coast of Africa, provided you will consent not to hang them for going there to buy them., You must remove this restriction, too, from the sacred right of self-government., I am aware you say that taking slaves from the States to Nebraska does not make slaves of freemen; but the African slave-trader can say just as much., He does not catch free negroes and bring them here., He finds them already slaves in the hands of their black captors, and he honestly buys them at the rate of a red cotton handkerchief a head., This is very cheap, and it is a great abridgment of the sacred right of self-government to hang men for engaging in this profitable trade., Another important objection to this application of the right of self-government is that it enables the first few to deprive the succeeding many of a free exercise of the right of self-government., The first few may get slavery in, and the subsequent many cannot easily get it out., How common is the remark now in the slave States, ""If we were only clear of our slaves, how much better it would be for us."", They are actually deprived of the privilege of governing themselves as they would, by the action of a very few in the beginning., The same thing was true of the whole nation at the time our Constitution was formed., Whether slavery shall go into Nebraska, or other new Territories, is not a matter of exclusive concern to the people who may go there., The whole nation is interested that the best use shall be made of these Territories., We want them for homes of free white people., This they cannot be, to any considerable extent, if slavery shall be planted within them., Slave States are places for poor white people to remove from, not to remove to., New free States are the places for poor people to go to, and better their condition., For this use the nation needs these Territories., Still further: there are constitutional relations between the slave and free States which are degrading to the latter., We are under legal obligations to catch and return their runaway slaves to them: a sort of dirty, disagreeable job, which, I believe, as a general rule, the slaveholders will not perform for one another., Then again, in the control of the government--the management of the partnership affairs--they have greatly the advantage of us., By the Constitution each State has two senators, each has a number of representatives in proportion to the number of its people, and each has a number of Presidential electors equal to the whole number of its senators and representatives together., But in ascertaining the number of the people for this purpose, five slaves are counted as being equal to three whites., The slaves do not vote; they are only counted and so used as to swell the influence of the white people's votes., The practical effect of this is more aptly shown by a comparison of the States of South Carolina and Maine., South Carolina has six representatives, and so has Maine; South Carolina has eight Presidential electors, and so has Maine., This is precise equality so far; and of course they are equal in senators, each having two., Thus in the control of the government the two States are equals precisely., But how are they in the number of their white people?, Maine has 581,813, while South Carolina has 274,567; Maine has twice as many as South Carolina, and 32,679 over., Thus, each white man in South Carolina is more than the double of any man in Maine., This is all because South Carolina, besides her free people, has 384,984 slaves., The South Carolinian has precisely the same advantage over the white man in every other free State as well as in Maine., He is more than the double of any one of us in this crowd., The same advantage, but not to the same extent, is held by all the citizens of the slave States over those of the free; and it is an absolute truth, without an exception, that there is no voter in any slave State but who has more legal power in the government than any voter in any free State., There is no instance of exact equality; and the disadvantage is against us the whole chapter through., This principle, in the aggregate, gives the slave States in the present Congress twenty additional representatives, being seven more than the whole majority by which they passed the Nebraska Bill., Now all this is manifestly unfair; yet I do not mention it to complain of it, in so far as it is already settled., It is in the Constitution, and I do not for that cause, or any other cause, propose to destroy, or alter, or disregard the Constitution., I stand to it, fairly, fully, and firmly., But when I am told I must leave it altogether to other people to say whether new partners are to be bred up and brought into the firm, on the same degrading terms against me, I respectfully demur., I insist that whether I shall be a whole man or only the half of one, in comparison with others is a question in which I am somewhat concerned, and one which no other man can have a sacred right of deciding for me., If I am wrong in this, if it really be a sacred right of self-government in the man who shall go to Nebraska to decide whether he will be the equal of me or the double of me, then, after he shall have exercised that right, and thereby shall have reduced me to a still smaller fraction of a man than I already am, I should like for some gentleman, deeply skilled in the mysteries of sacred rights, to provide himself with a microscope, and peep about, and find out, if he can, what has become of my sacred rights., They will surely be too small for detection with the naked eye., Finally, I insist that if there is anything which it is the duty of the whole people to never intrust to any hands but their own, that thing is the preservation and perpetuity of their own liberties and institutions., And if they shall think as I do, that the extension of slavery endangers them more than any or all other causes, how recreant to themselves if they submit The question, and with it the fate of their country, to a mere handful of men bent only on self-interest., If this question of slavery extension were an insignificant one, one having no power to do harm--it might be shuffled aside in this way; and being, as it is, the great Behemoth of danger, shall the strong grip of the nation be loosened upon him, to intrust him to the hands of such feeble keepers?, I have done with this mighty argument of self-government., Go, sacred thing!, Go in peace., But Nebraska is urged as a great Union-saving measure., Well, I too go for saving the Union., Much as I hate slavery, I would consent to the extension of it rather than see the Union dissolved, just as I would consent to any great evil to avoid a greater one., But when I go to Union-saving, I must believe, at least, that the means I employ have some adaptation to the end., To my mind, Nebraska has no such adaptation., ""It hath no relish of salvation in it."", It is an aggravation, rather, of the only one thing which ever endangers the Union., When it came upon us, all was peace and quiet., The nation was looking to the forming of new bends of union, and a long course of peace and prosperity seemed to lie before us., In the whole range of possibility, there scarcely appears to me to have been anything out of which the slavery agitation could have been revived, except the very project of repealing the Missouri Compromise., Every inch of territory we owned already had a definite settlement of the slavery question, by which all parties were pledged to abide., Indeed, there was no uninhabited country on the continent which we could acquire, if we except some extreme northern regions which are wholly out of the question., In this state of affairs the Genius of Discord himself could scarcely have invented a way of again setting us by the ears but by turning back and destroying the peace measures of the past., The counsels of that Genius seem to have prevailed., The Missouri Compromise was repealed; and here we are in the midst of a new slavery agitation, such, I think, as we have never seen before., Who is responsible for this?, Is it those who resist the measure, or those who causelessly brought it forward, and pressed it through, having reason to know, and in fact knowing, it must and would be so resisted?, It could not but be expected by its author that it would be looked upon as a measure for the extension of slavery, aggravated by a gross breach of faith., Argue as you will and long as you will, this is the naked front and aspect of the measure., And in this aspect it could not but produce agitation., Slavery is founded in the selfishness of man's nature--opposition to it in his love of justice., These principles are at eternal antagonism, and when brought into collision so fiercely as slavery extension brings them, shocks and throes and convulsions must ceaselessly follow., Repeal the Missouri Compromise, repeal all compromises, repeal the Declaration of Independence, repeal all past history, you still cannot repeal human nature., It still will be the abundance of man's heart that slavery extension is wrong, and out of the abundance of his heart his mouth will continue to speak., The structure, too, of the Nebraska Bill is very peculiar., The people are to decide the question of slavery for themselves; but when they are to decide, or how they are to decide, or whether, when the question is once decided, it is to remain so or is to be subject to an indefinite succession of new trials, the law does not say., Is it to be decided by the first dozen settlers who arrive there, or is it to await the arrival of a hundred?, Is it to be decided by a vote of the people or a vote of the Legislature, or, indeed, by a vote of any sort?, To these questions the law gives no answer., There is a mystery about this; for when a member proposed to give the Legislature express authority to exclude slavery, it was hooted down by the friends of the bill., This fact is worth remembering., Some Yankees in the East are sending emigrants to Nebraska to exclude slavery from it; and, so far as I can judge, they expect the question to be decided by voting in some way or other., But the Missourians are awake, too., They are within a stone's-throw of the contested ground., They hold meetings and pass resolutions, in which not the slightest allusion to voting is made., They resolve that slavery already exists in the Territory; that more shall go there; that they, remaining in Missouri, will protect it, and that abolitionists shall be hung or driven away., Through all this bowie knives and six-shooters are seen plainly enough, but never a glimpse of the ballot-box., And, really, what is the result of all this?, Each party within having numerous and determined backers without, is it not probable that the contest will come to blows and bloodshed?, Could there be a more apt invention to bring about collision and violence on the slavery question than this Nebraska project is?, I do not charge or believe that such was intended by Congress; but if they had literally formed a ring and placed champions within it to fight out the controversy, the fight could be no more likely to come off than it is., And if this fight should begin, is it likely to take a very peaceful, Union-saving turn?, Will not the first drop of blood so shed be the real knell of the Union?, The Missouri Compromise ought to be restored., For the sake of the Union, it ought to be restored., We ought to elect a House of Representatives which will vote its restoration., If by any means we omit to do this, what follows?, Slavery may or may not be established in Nebraska., ...]",3
225,"[Henceforth it is to be the chief jewel of the nation the very figure-head of the ship of state., Little by little, but steadily as man's march to the grave, we have been giving up the old for the new faith., Near eighty years ago we began by declaring that all men are created equal; but now from that beginning we have run down to the other declaration, that for some men to enslave others is a ""sacred right of self-government."", These principles cannot stand together., They are as opposite as God and Mammon; and who ever holds to the one must despise the other., When Pettit, in connection with his support of the Nebraska Bill, called the Declaration of Independence ""a self-evident lie,"" he only did what consistency and candor require all other Nebraska men to do., Of the forty-odd Nebraska senators who sat present and heard him, no one rebuked him., Nor am I apprised that any Nebraska newspaper, or any Nebraska orator, in the whole nation has ever yet rebuked him., If this had been said among Marion's men, Southerners though they were, what would have become of the man who said it?, If this had been said to the men who captured Andre, the man who said it would probably have been hung sooner than Andre was., If it had been said in old Independence Hall seventy-eight years ago, the very doorkeeper would have throttled the man and thrust him into the street., Let no one be deceived., The spirit of seventy-six and the spirit of Nebraska are utter antagonisms; and the former is being rapidly displaced by the latter., Fellow-countrymen, Americans, South as well as North, shall we make no effort to arrest this?, Already the liberal party throughout the world express the apprehension that ""the one retrograde institution in America is undermining the principles of progress, and fatally violating the noblest political system the world ever saw."", This is not the taunt of enemies, but the warning of friends., Is it quite safe to disregard it--to despise it?, Is there no danger to liberty itself in discarding the earliest practice and first precept of our ancient faith?, In our greedy chase to make profit of the negro, let us beware lest we ""cancel and tear in pieces"" even the white man's charter of freedom., Our republican robe is soiled and trailed in the dust., Let us repurify it., Let us turn and wash it white in the spirit, if not the blood, of the Revolution., Let us turn slavery from its claims of ""moral right,"" back upon its existing legal rights and its arguments of ""necessity."", Let us return it to the position our fathers gave it, and there let it rest in peace., Let us readopt the Declaration of Independence, and with it the practices and policy which harmonize with it., Let North and South, let all Americans--let all lovers of liberty everywhere join in the great and good work., If we do this, we shall not only have saved the Union, but we shall have so saved it as to make and to keep it forever worthy of the saving., We shall have so saved it that the succeeding millions of free happy people the world over shall rise up and call us blessed to the latest generations., At Springfield, twelve days ago, where I had spoken substantially as I have here, Judge Douglas replied to me; and as he is to reply to me here, I shall attempt to anticipate him by noticing some of the points he made there., He commenced by stating I had assumed all the way through that the principle of the Nebraska Bill would have the effect of extending slavery., He denied that this was intended or that this effect would follow., I will not reopen the argument upon this point., That such was the intention the world believed at the start, and will continue to believe., This was the countenance of the thing, and both friends and enemies instantly recognized it as such., That countenance cannot now be changed by argument., You can as easily argue the color out of the negro's skin., Like the ""bloody hand,"" you may wash it and wash it, the red witness of guilt still sticks and stares horribly at you., Next he says that Congressional intervention never prevented slavery anywhere; that it did not prevent it in the Northwestern Territory, nor in Illinois; that, in fact, Illinois came into the Union as a slave State; that the principle of the Nebraska Bill expelled it from Illinois, from several old States, from everywhere., Now this is mere quibbling all the way through., If the Ordinance of '87 did not keep slavery out of the Northwest Territory, how happens it that the northwest shore of the Ohio River is entirely free from it, while the southeast shore, less than a mile distant, along nearly the whole length of the river, is entirely covered with it?, If that ordinance did not keep it out of Illinois, what was it that made the difference between Illinois and Missouri?, They lie side by side, the Mississippi River only dividing them, while their early settlements were within the same latitude., Between 1810 and 1820 the number of slaves in Missouri increased 7211, while in Illinois in the same ten years they decreased 51., This appears by the census returns., During nearly all of that ten years both were Territories, not States., During this time the ordinance forbade slavery to go into Illinois, and nothing forbade it to go into Missouri., It did go into Missouri, and did not go into Illinois., That is the fact., Can any one doubt as to the reason of it?, But he says Illinois came into the Union as a slave State., Silence, perhaps, would be the best answer to this flat contradiction of the known history of the country., What are the facts upon which this bold assertion is based?, When we first acquired the country, as far back as 1787, there were some slaves within it held by the French inhabitants of Kaskaskia., The territorial legislation admitted a few negroes from the slave States as indentured servants., One year after the adoption of the first State constitution, the whole number of them was--what do you think?, Just one hundred and seventeen, while the aggregate free population was 55,094,--about four hundred and seventy to one., Upon this state of facts the people framed their constitution prohibiting the further introduction of slavery, with a sort of guaranty to the owners of the few indentured servants, giving freedom to their children to be born thereafter, and making no mention whatever of any supposed slave for life., Out of this small matter the Judge manufactures his argument that Illinois came into the Union as a slave State., Let the facts be the answer to the argument., The principles of the Nebraska Bill, he says, expelled slavery from Illinois., The principle of that bill first planted it here--that is, it first came because there was no law to prevent it, first came before we owned the country; and finding it here, and having the Ordinance of '87 to prevent its increasing, our people struggled along, and finally got rid of it as best they could., But the principle of the Nebraska Bill abolished slavery in several of the old States., Well, it is true that several of the old States, in the last quarter of the last century, did adopt systems of gradual emancipation by which the institution has finally become extinct within their limits; but it may or may not be true that the principle of the Nebraska Bill was the cause that led to the adoption of these measures., It is now more than fifty years since the last of these States adopted its system of emancipation., If the Nebraska Bill is the real author of the benevolent works, it is rather deplorable that it has for so long a time ceased working altogether., Is there not some reason to suspect that it was the principle of the Revolution, and not the principle of the Nebraska Bill, that led to emancipation in these old States?, Leave it to the people of these old emancipating States, and I am quite certain they will decide that neither that nor any other good thing ever did or ever will come of the Nebraska Bill., In the course of my main argument, Judge Douglas interrupted me to say that the principle of the Nebraska Bill was very old; that it originated when God made man, and placed good and evil before him, allowing him to choose for himself, being responsible for the choice he should make., At the time I thought this was merely playful, and I answered it accordingly., But in his reply to me he renewed it as a serious argument., In seriousness, then, the facts of this proposition are not true as stated., God did not place good and evil before man, telling him to make his choice., On the contrary, he did tell him there was one tree of the fruit of which he should not eat, upon pain of certain death., I should scarcely wish so strong a prohibition against slavery in Nebraska., But this argument strikes me as not a little remarkable in another particular--in its strong resemblance to the old argument for the ""divine right of kings."", By the latter, the king is to do just as he pleases with his white subjects, being responsible to God alone., By the former, the white man is to do just as he pleases with his black slaves, being responsible to God alone., The two things are precisely alike, and it is but natural that they should find similar arguments to sustain them., I had argued that the application of the principle of self-government, as contended for, would require the revival of the African slave trade; that no argument could be made in favor of a man's right to take slaves to Nebraska which could not be equally well made in favor of his right to bring them from the coast of Africa., The Judge replied that the Constitution requires the suppression of the foreign slave trade, but does not require the prohibition of slavery in the Territories., That is a mistake in point of fact., The Constitution does not require the action of Congress in either case, and it does authorize it in both., And so there is still no difference between the cases., In regard to what I have said of the advantage the slave States have over the free in the matter of representation, the Judge replied that we in the free States count five free negroes as five white people, while in the slave States they count five slaves as three whites only; and that the advantage, at last, was on the side of the free States., Now, in the slave States they count free negroes just as we do; and it so happens that, besides their slaves, they have as many free negroes as we have, and thirty thousand over., Thus, their free negroes more than balance ours; and their advantage over us, in consequence of their slaves, still remains as I stated it., In reply to my argument that the compromise measures of 1850 were a system of equivalents, and that the provisions of no one of them could fairly be carried to other subjects without its corresponding equivalent being carried with it, the Judge denied outright that these measures had any connection with or dependence upon each other., This is mere desperation., If they had no connection, why are they always spoken of in connection?, Why has he so spoken of them a thousand times?, Why has he constantly called them a series of measures?, Why does everybody call them a compromise?, Why was California kept out of the Union six or seven months, if it was not because of its connection with the other measures?, Webster's leading definition of the verb ""to compromise"" is ""to adjust and settle a difference, by mutual agreement, with concessions of claims by the parties."", This conveys precisely the popular understanding of the word ""compromise."", We knew, before the Judge told us, that these measures passed separately, and in distinct bills, and that no two of them were passed by the votes of precisely the same members., But we also know, and so does he know, that no one of them could have passed both branches of Congress but for the understanding that the others were to pass also., Upon this understanding, each got votes which it could have got in no other way., It is this fact which gives to the measures their true character; and it is the universal knowledge of this fact that has given them the name of ""compromises,"" so expressive of that true character., I had asked: ""If, in carrying the Utah and New Mexico laws to Nebraska, you could clear away other objection, how could you leave Nebraska 'perfectly free' to introduce slavery before she forms a constitution, during her territorial government, while the Utah and New Mexico laws only authorize it when they form constitutions and are admitted into the Union?"", ...]",3
226,"[William J., Black is also an applicant for the appointment, and I write this at the solicitation of his friends to say that he is every way worthy of the office, and that I doubt not the conferring it upon him will give great satisfaction., Yours of the 11th was received last night, and for which I thank you., Of course I prefer myself to all others; yet it is neither in my heart nor my conscience to say I am any better man than Mr. Williams., We shall have a terrible struggle with our adversaries., They are desperate and bent on desperate deeds., I accidentally learned of one of the leaders here writing to a member south of here, in about the following language:  We are beaten., They have a clean majority of at least nine, on joint ballot., They outnumber us, but we must outmanage them., Douglas must be sustained., We must elect the Speaker; and we must elect a Nebraska United States Senator, or ""elect none at all."", Similar letters, no doubt, are written to every Nebraska member., Be considering how we can best meet, and foil, and beat them., I send you, by mail, a copy of my Peoria speech., You may have seen it before, or you may not think it worth seeing now., Do not speak of the Nebraska letter mentioned above; I do not wish it to become public, that I received such information., I began with 44 votes, Shields 41, and Trumbull 5,--yet Trumbull was elected., In fact 47 different members voted for me,--getting three new ones on the second ballot, and losing four old ones., How came my 47 to yield to Trumbull's 5?, It was Governor Matteson's work., He has been secretly a candidate ever since (before, even) the fall election., All the members round about the canal were Anti-Nebraska, but were nevertheless nearly all Democrats and old personal friends of his., His plan was to privately impress them with the belief that he was as good Anti-Nebraska as any one else--at least could be secured to be so by instructions, which could be easily passed., The Nebraska men, of course, were not for Matteson; but when they found they could elect no avowed Nebraska man, they tardily determined to let him get whomever of our men he could, by whatever means he could, and ask him no questions., The Nebraska men were very confident of the election of Matteson, though denying that he was a candidate, and we very much believing also that they would elect him., But they wanted first to make a show of good faith to Shields by voting for him a few times, and our secret Matteson men also wanted to make a show of good faith by voting with us a few times., So we led off., On the seventh ballot, I think, the signal was given to the Nebraska men to turn to Matteson, which they acted on to a man, with one exception., ., ., Next ballot the remaining Nebraska man and one pretended Anti went over to him, giving him 46., The next still another, giving him 47, wanting only three of an election., In the meantime our friends, with a view of detaining our expected bolters, had been turning from me to Trumbull till he had risen to 35 and I had been reduced to 15., These would never desert me except by my direction; but I became satisfied that if we could prevent Matteson's election one or two ballots more, we could not possibly do so a single ballot after my friends should begin to return to me from Trumbull., So I determined to strike at once, and accordingly advised my remaining friends to go for him, which they did and elected him on the tenth ballot., Such is the way the thing was done., I think you would have done the same under the circumstances., I could have headed off every combination and been elected, had it not been for Matteson's double game--and his defeat now gives me more pleasure than my own gives me pain., On the whole, it is perhaps as well for our general cause that Trumbull is elected., The Nebraska men confess that they hate it worse than anything that could have happened., It is a great consolation to see them worse whipped than I am., Yours of the 5th is received, as also was that of 15th Dec, last, inclosing bond of Clift to Pray., When I received the bond I was dabbling in politics, and of course neglecting business., Having since been beaten out I have gone to work again., As I do not practice in Rushville, I to-day open a correspondence with Henry E. Dummer, Esq., of Beardstown, Ill., with the view of getting the job into his hands., He is a good man if he will undertake it., Write me whether I shall do this or return the bond to you., Your letter to Judge Logan has been shown to us by him; and, with his consent, we answer it., When it became probable that there would be a vacancy on the Supreme Bench, public opinion, on this side of the river, seemed to be universally directed to Logan as the proper man to fill it., I mean public opinion on our side in politics, with very small manifestation in any different direction by the other side., The result is, that he has been a good deal pressed to allow his name to be used, and he has consented to it, provided it can be done with perfect cordiality and good feeling on the part of all our own friends., We, the undersigned, are very anxious for it; and the more so now that he has been urged, until his mind is turned upon the matter., We, therefore are very glad of your letter, with the information it brings us, mixed only with a regret that we can not elect Logan and Walker both., We shall be glad, if you will hoist Logan's name, in your Quincy papers., Very truly your friends,  Your note containing election news is received; and for which I thank you., It is all of no use, however., Logan is worse beaten than any other man ever was since elections were invented--beaten more than twelve hundred in this county., It is conceded on all hands that the Prohibitory law is also beaten., You know what a poor correspondent I am., Ever since I received your very agreeable letter of the 22d of May, I have been intending to write you an answer to it., You suggest that in political action, now, you and I would differ., I suppose we would; not quite as much, however, as you may think., You know I dislike slavery, and you fully admit the abstract wrong of it., So far there is no cause of difference., But you say that sooner than yield your legal right to the slave, especially at the bidding of those who are not themselves interested, you would see the Union dissolved., I am not aware that any one is bidding you yield that right; very certainly I am not., I leave that matter entirely to yourself., I also acknowledge your rights and my obligations under the Constitution in regard to your slaves., I confess I hate to see the poor creatures hunted down and caught and carried back to their stripes and unrequited toil; but I bite my lips and keep quiet., In 1841 you and I had together a tedious low-water trip on a steamboat from Louisville to St. Louis., You may remember, as I well do, that from Louisville to the mouth of the Ohio there were on board ten or a dozen slaves shackled together with irons., That sight was a continued torment to me, and I see something like it every time I touch the Ohio or any other slave border., It is not fair for you to assume that I have no interest in a thing which has, and continually exercises, the power of making me miserable., You ought rather to appreciate how much the great body of the Northern people do crucify their feelings, in order to maintain their loyalty to the Constitution and the Union., I do oppose the extension of slavery because my judgment and feeling so prompt me, and I am under no obligations to the contrary., If for this you and I must differ, differ we must., You say, if you were President, you would send an army and hang the leaders of the Missouri outrages upon the Kansas elections; still, if Kansas fairly votes herself a slave State she must be admitted or the Union must be dissolved., But how if she votes herself a slave State unfairly, that is, by the very means for which you say you would hang men?, Must she still be admitted, or the Union dissolved?, That will be the phase of the question when it first becomes a practical one., In your assumption that there may be a fair decision of the slavery question in Kansas, I plainly see you and I would differ about the Nebraska law., I look upon that enactment not as a law, but as a violence from the beginning., It was conceived in violence, is maintained in violence, and is being executed in violence., I say it was conceived in violence, because the destruction of the Missouri Compromise, under the circumstances, was nothing less than violence., It was passed in violence because it could not have passed at all but for the votes of many members in violence of the known will of their constituents., It is maintained in violence, because the elections since clearly demand its repeal; and the demand is openly disregarded., You say men ought to be hung for the way they are executing the law; I say the way it is being executed is quite as good as any of its antecedents., It is being executed in the precise way which was intended from the first, else why does no Nebraska man express astonishment or condemnation?, Poor Reeder is the only public man who has been silly enough to believe that anything like fairness was ever intended, and he has been bravely undeceived., That Kansas will form a slave constitution, and with it will ask to be admitted into the Union, I take to be already a settled question, and so settled by the very means you so pointedly condemn., By every principle of law ever held by any court North or South, every negro taken to Kansas is free; yet, in utter disregard of this,--in the spirit of violence merely,--that beautiful Legislature gravely passes a law to hang any man who shall venture to inform a negro of his legal rights., This is the subject and real object of the law., If, like Haman, they should hang upon the gallows of their own building, I shall not be among the mourners for their fate., In my humble sphere, I shall advocate the restoration of the Missouri Compromise so long as Kansas remains a Territory, and when, by all these foul means, it seeks to come into the Union as a slave State, I shall oppose it., I am very loath in any case to withhold my assent to the enjoyment of property acquired or located in good faith; but I do not admit that good faith in taking a negro to Kansas to be held in slavery is a probability with any man., Any man who has sense enough to be the controller of his own property has too much sense to misunderstand the outrageous character of the whole Nebraska business., But I digress., In my opposition to the admission of Kansas I shall have some company, but we may be beaten., If we are, I shall not on that account attempt to dissolve the Union., I think it probable, however, we shall be beaten., ...]",3

for it is a singular fact, but none the less a fact, and well known by the most common experience, that men will do things under the terror of the party lash that they would not on any account or for any consideration do otherwise; while men who will march up to the mouth of a loaded cannon without shrinking will run from the terrible name of ""Abolitionist,"" even when pronounced by a worthless creature whom they, with good reason, despise., For instance--to press this point a little--Judge Douglas introduced his Nebraska Bill in January; and we had an extra session of our Legislature in the succeeding February, in which were seventy-five Democrats; and at a party caucus, fully attended, there were just three votes, out of the whole seventy-five, for the measure., But in a few days orders came on from Washington, commanding them to approve the measure; the party lash was applied, and it was brought up again in caucus, and passed by a large majority., The masses were against it, but party necessity carried it; and it was passed through the lower house of Congress against the will of the people, for the same reason., Here is where the greatest danger lies that, while we profess to be a government of law and reason, law will give way to violence on demand of this awful and crushing power., Like the great Juggernaut--I think that is the name--the great idol, it crushes everything that comes in its way, and makes a [?], --or, as I read once, in a blackletter law book, ""a slave is a human being who is legally not a person but a thing."", And if the safeguards to liberty are broken down, as is now attempted, when they have made things of all the free negroes, how long, think you, before they will begin to make things of poor white men?, [Applause.], Be not deceived., Revolutions do not go backward., The founder of the Democratic party declared that all men were created equal., His successor in the leadership has written the word ""white"" before men, making it read ""all white men are created equal."", Pray, will or may not the Know-Nothings, if they should get in power, add the word ""Protestant,"" making it read ""all Protestant white men...?"", Meanwhile the hapless negro is the fruitful subject of reprisals in other quarters., John Pettit, whom Tom Benton paid his respects to, you will recollect, calls the immortal Declaration ""a self-evident lie""; while at the birthplace of freedom--in the shadow of Bunker Hill and of the ""cradle of liberty,"" at the home of the Adamses and Warren and Otis--Choate, from our side of the house, dares to fritter away the birthday promise of liberty by proclaiming the Declaration to be ""a string of glittering generalities""; and the Southern Whigs, working hand in hand with proslavery Democrats, are making Choate's theories practical., Thomas Jefferson, a slaveholder, mindful of the moral element in slavery, solemnly declared that he trembled for his country when he remembered that God is just; while Judge Douglas, with an insignificant wave of the hand, ""don't care whether slavery is voted up or voted down."", Now, if slavery is right, or even negative, he has a right to treat it in this trifling manner., But if it is a moral and political wrong, as all Christendom considers it to be, how can he answer to God for this attempt to spread and fortify it?, But no man, and Judge Douglas no more than any other, can maintain a negative, or merely neutral, position on this question; and, accordingly, he avows that the Union was made by white men and for white men and their descendants., As matter of fact, the first branch of the proposition is historically true; the government was made by white men, and they were and are the superior race., This I admit., But the corner-stone of the government, so to speak, was the declaration that ""all men are created equal,"" and all entitled to ""life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."", And not only so, but the framers of the Constitution were particular to keep out of that instrument the word ""slave,"" the reason being that slavery would ultimately come to an end, and they did not wish to have any reminder that in this free country human beings were ever prostituted to slavery., Nor is it any argument that we are superior and the negro inferior--that he has but one talent while we have ten., Let the negro possess the little he has in independence; if he has but one talent, he should be permitted to keep the little he has., [Applause:] But slavery will endure no test of reason or logic; and yet its advocates, like Douglas, use a sort of bastard logic, or noisy assumption it might better be termed, like the above, in order to prepare the mind for the gradual, but none the less certain, encroachments of the Moloch of slavery upon the fair domain of freedom., But however much you may argue upon it, or smother it in soft phrase, slavery can only be maintained by force--by violence., The repeal of the Missouri Compromise was by violence., It was a violation of both law and the sacred obligations of honor, to overthrow and trample under foot a solemn compromise, obtained by the fearful loss to freedom of one of the fairest of our Western domains., Congress violated the will and confidence of its constituents in voting for the bill; and while public sentiment, as shown by the elections of 1854, demanded the restoration of this compromise, Congress violated its trust by refusing simply because it had the force of numbers to hold on to it., And murderous violence is being used now, in order to force slavery on to Kansas; for it cannot be done in any other way., The necessary result was to establish the rule of violence--force, instead of the rule of law and reason; to perpetuate and spread slavery, and in time to make it general., We see it at both ends of the line., In Washington, on the very spot where the outrage was started, the fearless Sumner is beaten to insensibility, and is now slowly dying; while senators who claim to be gentlemen and Christians stood by, countenancing the act, and even applauding it afterward in their places in the Senate., Even Douglas, our man, saw it all and was within helping distance, yet let the murderous blows fall unopposed., Then, at the other end of the line, at the very time Sumner was being murdered, Lawrence was being destroyed for the crime of freedom., It was the most prominent stronghold of liberty in Kansas, and must give way to the all-dominating power of slavery., Only two days ago, Judge Trumbull found it necessary to propose a bill in the Senate to prevent a general civil war and to restore peace in Kansas., We live in the midst of alarms; anxiety beclouds the future; we expect some new disaster with each newspaper we read., Are we in a healthful political state?, Are not the tendencies plain?, Do not the signs of the times point plainly the way in which we are going?, In the early days of the Constitution slavery was recognized, by South and North alike, as an evil, and the division of sentiment about it was not controlled by geographical lines or considerations of climate, but by moral and philanthropic views., Petitions for the abolition of slavery were presented to the very first Congress by Virginia and Massachusetts alike., To show the harmony which prevailed, I will state that a fugitive slave law was passed in 1793, with no dissenting voice in the Senate, and but seven dissenting votes in the House., It was, however, a wise law, moderate, and, under the Constitution, a just one., Twenty-five years later, a more stringent law was proposed and defeated; and thirty-five years after that, the present law, drafted by Mason of Virginia, was passed by Northern votes., I am not, just now, complaining of this law, but I am trying to show how the current sets; for the proposed law of 1817 was far less offensive than the present one., In 1774 the Continental Congress pledged itself, without a dissenting vote, to wholly discontinue the slave trade, and to neither purchase nor import any slave; and less than three months before the passage of the Declaration of Independence, the same Congress which adopted that declaration unanimously resolved ""that no slave be imported into any of the thirteen United Colonies."", On the second day of July, 1776, the draft of a Declaration of Independence was reported to Congress by the committee, and in it the slave trade was characterized as ""an execrable commerce,"" as ""a piratical warfare,"" as the ""opprobrium of infidel powers,"" and as ""a cruel war against human nature."", All agreed on this except South Carolina and Georgia, and in order to preserve harmony, and from the necessity of the case, these expressions were omitted., Indeed, abolition societies existed as far south as Virginia; and it is a well-known fact that Washington, Jefferson, Madison, Lee, Henry, Mason, and Pendleton were qualified abolitionists, and much more radical on that subject than we of the Whig and Democratic parties claim to be to-day., On March 1, 1784, Virginia ceded to the confederation all its lands lying northwest of the Ohio River., Jefferson, Chase of Maryland, and Howell of Rhode Island, as a committee on that and territory thereafter to be ceded, reported that no slavery should exist after the year 1800., Had this report been adopted, not only the Northwest, but Kentucky, Tennessee, Alabama, and Mississippi also would have been free; but it required the assent of nine States to ratify it., North Carolina was divided, and thus its vote was lost; and Delaware, Georgia, and New Jersey refused to vote., In point of fact, as it was, it was assented to by six States., Three years later on a square vote to exclude slavery from the Northwest, only one vote, and that from New York, was against it., And yet, thirty-seven years later, five thousand citizens of Illinois, out of a voting mass of less than twelve thousand, deliberately, after a long and heated contest, voted to introduce slavery in Illinois; and, to-day, a large party in the free State of Illinois are willing to vote to fasten the shackles of slavery on the fair domain of Kansas, notwithstanding it received the dowry of freedom long before its birth as a political community., I repeat, therefore, the question: Is it not plain in what direction we are tending?, [Sensation.], In the colonial time, Mason, Pendleton, and Jefferson were as hostile to slavery in Virginia as Otis, Ames, and the Adamses were in Massachusetts; and Virginia made as earnest an effort to get rid of it as old Massachusetts did., But circumstances were against them and they failed; but not that the good will of its leading men was lacking., Yet within less than fifty years Virginia changed its tune, and made negro-breeding for the cotton and sugar States one of its leading industries., In the Constitutional Convention, George Mason of Virginia made a more violent abolition speech than my friends Lovejoy or Codding would desire to make here to-day--a speech which could not be safely repeated anywhere on Southern soil in this enlightened year., But, while there were some differences of opinion on this subject even then, discussion was allowed; but as you see by the Kansas slave code, which, as you know, is the Missouri slave code, merely ferried across the river, it is a felony to even express an opinion hostile to that foul blot in the land of Washington and the Declaration of Independence., In Kentucky--my State--in 1849, on a test vote, the mighty influence of Henry Clay and many other good then there could not get a symptom of expression in favor of gradual emancipation on a plain issue of marching toward the light of civilization with Ohio and Illinois; but the State of Boone and Hardin and Henry Clay, with a nigger under each arm, took the black trail toward the deadly swamps of barbarism., Is there--can there be--any doubt about this thing?, And is there any doubt that we must all lay aside our prejudices and march, shoulder to shoulder, in the great army of Freedom?, Every Fourth of July our young orators all proclaim this to be ""the land of the free and the home of the brave!"", Well, now, when you orators get that off next year, and, may be, this very year, how would you like some old grizzled farmer to get up in the grove and deny it?, [Laughter.], How would you like that?, But suppose Kansas comes in as a slave State, and all the ""border ruffians"" have barbecues about it, and free-State men come trailing back to the dishonored North, like whipped dogs with their tails between their legs, it is--ain't it?--evident that this is no more the ""land of the free""; and if we let it go so, we won't dare to say ""home of the brave"" out loud., Can any man doubt that, even in spite of the people's will, slavery will triumph through violence, unless that will be made manifest and enforced?, Even Governor Reeder claimed at the outset that the contest in Kansas was to be fair, but he got his eyes open at last; and I believe that, as a result of this moral and physical violence, Kansas will soon apply for admission as a slave State., And yet we can't mistake that the people don't want it so, and that it is a land which is free both by natural and political law., No law, is free law!, Such is the understanding of all Christendom., In the Somerset case, decided nearly a century ago, the great Lord Mansfield held that slavery was of such a nature that it must take its rise in positive (as distinguished from natural) law; and that in no country or age could it be traced back to any other source., Will some one please tell me where is the positive law that establishes slavery in Kansas?, Aye, the bogus laws!, And, on the same principle, a gang of Missouri horse-thieves could come into Illinois and declare horse-stealing to be legal [Laughter], and it would be just as legal as slavery is in Kansas., But by express statute, in the land of Washington and Jefferson, we may soon be brought face to face with the discreditable fact of showing to the world by our acts that we prefer slavery to freedom--darkness to light!, It is, I believe, a principle in law that when one party to a contract violates it so grossly as to chiefly destroy the object for which it is made, the other party may rescind it., I will ask Browning if that ain't good law., Well, now if that be right, I go for rescinding the whole, entire Missouri Compromise and thus turning Missouri into a free State; and I should like to know the difference--should like for any one to point out the difference--between our making a free State of Missouri and their making a slave State of Kansas., There ain't one bit of difference, except that our way would be a great mercy to humanity., But I have never said, and the Whig party has never said, and those who oppose the Nebraska Bill do not as a body say, that they have any intention of interfering with slavery in the slave States., Our platform says just the contrary., We allow slavery to exist in the slave States, not because slavery is right or good, but from the necessities of our Union., We grant a fugitive slave law because it is so ""nominated in the bond""; because our fathers so stipulated--had to--and we are bound to carry out this agreement., But they did not agree to introduce slavery in regions where it did not previously exist., ...]",3
228,"[It was by that policy that here in Illinois the early fathers fought the good fight and gained the victory., In 1824 the free men of our State, led by Governor Coles (who was a native of Maryland and President Madison's private secretary), determined that those beautiful groves should never re-echo the dirge of one who has no title to himself., By their resolute determination, the winds that sweep across our broad prairies shall never cool the parched brow, nor shall the unfettered streams that bring joy and gladness to our free soil water the tired feet, of a slave; but so long as those heavenly breezes and sparkling streams bless the land, or the groves and their fragrance or memory remain, the humanity to which they minister SHALL BE FOREVER FREE!, Palmer, Yates, Williams, Browning, and some more in this convention came from Kentucky to Illinois (instead of going to Missouri), not only to better their conditions, but also to get away from slavery., They have said so to me, and it is understood among us Kentuckians that we don't like it one bit., Now, can we, mindful of the blessings of liberty which the early men of Illinois left to us, refuse a like privilege to the free men who seek to plant Freedom's banner on our Western outposts?, Should we not stand by our neighbors who seek to better their conditions in Kansas and Nebraska?, Can we as Christian men, and strong and free ourselves, wield the sledge or hold the iron which is to manacle anew an already oppressed race?, ""Woe unto them,"" it is written, ""that decree unrighteous decrees and that write grievousness which they have prescribed."", Can we afford to sin any more deeply against human liberty?, One great trouble in the matter is, that slavery is an insidious and crafty power, and gains equally by open violence of the brutal as well as by sly management of the peaceful., Even after the Ordinance of 1787, the settlers in Indiana and Illinois (it was all one government then) tried to get Congress to allow slavery temporarily, and petitions to that end were sent from Kaskaskia, and General Harrison, the Governor, urged it from Vincennes, the capital., If that had succeeded, good-bye to liberty here., But John Randolph of Virginia made a vigorous report against it; and although they persevered so well as to get three favorable reports for it, yet the United States Senate, with the aid of some slave States, finally squelched if for good., And that is why this hall is to-day a temple for free men instead of a negro livery-stable., Once let slavery get planted in a locality, by ever so weak or doubtful a title, and in ever so small numbers, and it is like the Canada thistle or Bermuda grass--you can't root it out., You yourself may detest slavery; but your neighbor has five or six slaves, and he is an excellent neighbor, or your son has married his daughter, and they beg you to help save their property, and you vote against your interests and principle to accommodate a neighbor, hoping that your vote will be on the losing side., And others do the same; and in those ways slavery gets a sure foothold., And when that is done the whole mighty Union--the force of the nation--is committed to its support., And that very process is working in Kansas to-day., And you must recollect that the slave property is worth a billion of dollars; while free-State men must work for sentiment alone., Then there are ""blue lodges""--as they call them--everywhere doing their secret and deadly work., It is a very strange thing, and not solvable by any moral law that I know of, that if a man loses his horse, the whole country will turn out to help hang the thief; but if a man but a shade or two darker than I am is himself stolen, the same crowd will hang one who aids in restoring him to liberty., Such are the inconsistencies of slavery, where a horse is more sacred than a man; and the essence of squatter or popular sovereignty--I don't care how you call it--is that if one man chooses to make a slave of another, no third man shall be allowed to object., And if you can do this in free Kansas, and it is allowed to stand, the next thing you will see is shiploads of negroes from Africa at the wharf at Charleston, for one thing is as truly lawful as the other; and these are the bastard notions we have got to stamp out, else they will stamp us out., Two years ago, at Springfield, Judge Douglas avowed that Illinois came into the Union as a slave State, and that slavery was weeded out by the operation of his great, patent, everlasting principle of ""popular sovereignty."", Well, now, that argument must be answered, for it has a little grain of truth at the bottom., I do not mean that it is true in essence, as he would have us believe., It could not be essentially true if the Ordinance of '87 was valid., But, in point of fact, there were some degraded beings called slaves in Kaskaskia and the other French settlements when our first State constitution was adopted; that is a fact, and I don't deny it., Slaves were brought here as early as 1720, and were kept here in spite of the Ordinance of 1787 against it., But slavery did not thrive here., On the contrary, under the influence of the ordinance the number decreased fifty-one from 1810 to 1820; while under the influence of squatter sovereignty, right across the river in Missouri, they increased seven thousand two hundred and eleven in the same time; and slavery finally faded out in Illinois, under the influence of the law of freedom, while it grew stronger and stronger in Missouri, under the law or practice of ""popular sovereignty."", In point of fact there were but one hundred and seventeen slaves in Illinois one year after its admission, or one to every four hundred and seventy of its population; or, to state it in another way, if Illinois was a slave State in 1820, so were New York and New Jersey much greater slave States from having had greater numbers, slavery having been established there in very early times., But there is this vital difference between all these States and the Judge's Kansas experiment: that they sought to disestablish slavery which had been already established, while the Judge seeks, so far as he can, to disestablish freedom, which had been established there by the Missouri Compromise., The Union is under-going a fearful strain; but it is a stout old ship, and has weathered many a hard blow, and ""the stars in their courses,"" aye, an invisible Power, greater than the puny efforts of men, will fight for us., But we ourselves must not decline the burden of responsibility, nor take counsel of unworthy passions., Whatever duty urges us to do or to omit must be done or omitted; and the recklessness with which our adversaries break the laws, or counsel their violation, should afford no example for us., Therefore, let us revere the Declaration of Independence; let us continue to obey the Constitution and the laws; let us keep step to the music of the Union., Let us draw a cordon, so to speak, around the slave States, and the hateful institution, like a reptile poisoning itself, will perish by its own infamy., But we cannot be free men if this is, by our national choice, to be a land of slavery., Those who deny freedom to others deserve it not for themselves; and, under the rule of a just God, cannot long retain it., Did you ever, my friends, seriously reflect upon the speed with which we are tending downwards?, Within the memory of men now present the leading statesman of Virginia could make genuine, red-hot abolitionist speeches in old Virginia!, and, as I have said, now even in ""free Kansas"" it is a crime to declare that it is ""free Kansas."", The very sentiments that I and others have just uttered would entitle us, and each of us, to the ignominy and seclusion of a dungeon; and yet I suppose that, like Paul, we were ""free born."", But if this thing is allowed to continue, it will be but one step further to impress the same rule in Illinois., The conclusion of all is, that we must restore the Missouri Compromise., We must highly resolve that Kansas must be free!We must reinstate the birthday promise of the Republic; we must reaffirm the Declaration of Independence; we must make good in essence as well as in form Madison's avowal that ""the word slave ought not to appear in the Constitution""; and we must even go further, and decree that only local law, and not that time-honored instrument, shall shelter a slaveholder., We must make this a land of liberty in fact, as it is in name., But in seeking to attain these results--so indispensable if the liberty which is our pride and boast shall endure--we will be loyal to the Constitution and to the ""flag of our Union,"" and no matter what our grievance--even though Kansas shall come in as a slave State; and no matter what theirs--even if we shall restore the compromise--WE WILL SAY TO THE SOUTHERN DISUNIONISTS, WE WON'T GO OUT OF THE UNION, AND YOU SHAN'T!, But let us, meanwhile, appeal to the sense and patriotism of the people, and not to their prejudices; let us spread the floods of enthusiasm here aroused all over these vast prairies, so suggestive of freedom., Let us commence by electing the gallant soldier Governor (Colonel) Bissell who stood for the honor of our State alike on the plains and amidst the chaparral of Mexico and on the floor of Congress, while he defied the Southern Hotspur; and that will have a greater moral effect than all the border ruffians can accomplish in all their raids on Kansas., There is both a power and a magic in popular opinion., To that let us now appeal; and while, in all probability, no resort to force will be needed, our moderation and forbearance will stand US in good stead when, if ever, WE MUST MAKE AN APPEAL TO BATTLE AND TO THE GOD OF HOSTS!, One can realize with this ability to move people's minds that the Southern Conspiracy were right to hate this man., He, better than any at the time was able to uncover their stratagems and tear down their sophisms and contradictions., I now expect to go to Chicago on the 15th, and I probably shall remain there or thereabouts for about two weeks., It turned me blind when I first heard Swett was beaten and Lovejoy nominated; but, after much reflection, I really believe it is best to let it stand., This, of course, I wish to be confidential., Lamon did get your deeds., I went with him to the office, got them, and put them in his hands myself., Your's of the 29th of June was duly received., I did not answer it because it plagued me., This morning I received another from Judd and Peck, written by consultation with you., Now let me tell you why I am plagued:  1., I can hardly spare the time., 2., I am superstitious., I have scarcely known a party preceding an election to call in help from the neighboring States but they lost the State., Last fall, our friends had Wade, of Ohio, and others, in Maine; and they lost the State., Last spring our adversaries had New Hampshire full of South Carolinians, and they lost the State., And so, generally, it seems to stir up more enemies than friends., Have the enemy called in any foreign help?, If they have a foreign champion there I should have no objection to drive a nail in his track., I shall reach Chicago on the night of the 15th, to attend to a little business in court., Consider the things I have suggested, and write me at Chicago., Especially write me whether Browning consents to visit you., You further charge us with being disunionists., If you mean that it is our aim to dissolve the Union, I for myself answer that it is untrue; for those who act with me I answer that it is untrue., Have you heard us assert that as our aim?, Do you really believe that such is our aim?, Do you find it in our platform, our speeches, our conventions, or anywhere?, If not, withdraw the charge., But you may say that, though it is not our aim, it will be the result if we succeed, and that we are therefore disunionists in fact., This is a grave charge you make against us, and we certainly have a right to demand that you specify in what way we are to dissolve the Union., How are we to effect this?, The only specification offered is volunteered by Mr. Fillmore in his Albany speech., His charge is that if we elect a President and Vice-President both from the free States, it will dissolve the Union., This is open folly., The Constitution provides that the President and Vice-President of the United States shall be of different States, but says nothing as to the latitude and longitude of those States., In 1828 Andrew Jackson, of Tennessee, and John C. Calhoun, of South Carolina, were elected President and Vice-President, both from slave States; but no one thought of dissolving the Union then on that account., In 1840 Harrison, of Ohio, and Tyler, of Virginia, were elected., In 1841 Harrison died and John Tyler succeeded to the Presidency, and William R. King, of Alabama, was elected acting Vice-President by the Senate; but no one supposed that the Union was in danger., In fact, at the very time Mr. Fillmore uttered this idle charge, the state of things in the United States disproved it., Mr. Pierce, of New Hampshire, and Mr., Bright, of Indiana, both from free States, are President and Vice-President, and the Union stands and will stand., You do not pretend that it ought to dissolve the Union, and the facts show that it won't; therefore the charge may be dismissed without further consideration., No other specification is made, and the only one that could be made is that the restoration of the restriction of 1820, making the United States territory free territory, would dissolve the Union., Gentlemen, it will require a decided majority to pass such an act., ...]",3
229,"[Less than a year ago the Richmond Enquirer, an avowed advocate of slavery, regardless of color, in order to favor his views, invented the phrase ""State equality,"" and now the President, in his message, adopts the Enquirer's catch-phrase, telling us the people ""have asserted the constitutional equality of each and all of the States of the Union as States."", The President flatters himself that the new central idea is completely inaugurated; and so indeed it is, so far as the mere fact of a Presidential election can inaugurate it., To us it is left to know that the majority of the people have not yet declared for it, and to hope that they never will., All of us who did not vote for Mr. Buchanan, taken together, are a majority of four hundred thousand., But in the late contest we were divided between Fremont and Fillmore., Can we not come together for the future?, Let every one who really believes and is resolved that free society is not and shall not be a failure, and who can conscientiously declare that in the last contest he has done only what he thought best--let every such one have charity to believe that every other one can say as much., Thus let bygones be bygones; let past differences as nothing be; and with steady eye on the real issue let us reinaugurate the good old ""central idea"" of the republic., We can do it., The human heart is with us; God is with us., We shall again be able, not to declare that ""all States as States are equal,"" nor yet that ""all citizens as citizens are equal,"" but to renew the broader, better declaration, including both these and much more, that ""all men are created equal."", When I was at Chicago two weeks ago I saw Mr. Arnold, and from a remark of his I inferred he was thinking of the speakership, though I think he was not anxious about it., He seemed most anxious for harmony generally, and particularly that the contested seats from Peoria and McDonough might be rightly determined., Since I came home I had a talk with Cullom, one of our American representatives here, and he says he is for you for Speaker and also that he thinks all the Americans will be for you, unless it be Gorin, of Macon, of whom he cannot speak., If you would like to be Speaker go right up and see Arnold., He is talented, a practised debater, and, I think, would do himself more credit on the floor than in the Speaker's seat., Go and see him; and if you think fit, show him this letter., Your note about the little paragraph in the Republican was received yesterday, since which time I have been too unwell to notice it., I had not supposed you wrote or approved it., The whole originated in mistake., You know by the conversation with me that I thought the establishment of the paper unfortunate, but I always expected to throw no obstacle in its way, and to patronize it to the extent of taking and paying for one copy., When the paper was brought to my house, my wife said to me, ""Now are you going to take another worthless little paper?"", I said to her evasively, ""I have not directed the paper to be left."", From this, in my absence, she sent the message to the carrier., This is the whole story., I am here to-night partly by the invitation of some of you, and partly by my own inclination., Two weeks ago Judge Douglas spoke here on the several subjects of Kansas, the Dred Scott decision, and Utah., I listened to the speech at the time, and have the report of it since., It was intended to controvert opinions which I think just, and to assail (politically, not personally) those men who, in common with me, entertain those opinions., For this reason I wished then, and still wish, to make some answer to it, which I now take the opportunity of doing., I begin with Utah., If it prove to be true, as is probable, that the people of Utah are in open rebellion to the United States, then Judge Douglas is in favor of repealing their territorial organization, and attaching them to the adjoining States for judicial purposes., I say, too, if they are in rebellion, they ought to be somehow coerced to obedience; and I am not now prepared to admit or deny that the Judge's mode of coercing them is not as good as any., The Republicans can fall in with it without taking back anything they have ever said., To be sure, it would be a considerable backing down by Judge Douglas from his much-vaunted doctrine of self-government for the Territories; but this is only additional proof of what was very plain from the beginning, that that doctrine was a mere deceitful pretense for the benefit of slavery., Those who could not see that much in the Nebraska act itself, which forced governors, and secretaries, and judges on the people of the Territories without their choice or consent, could not be made to see, though one should rise from the dead., But in all this it is very plain the Judge evades the only question the Republicans have ever pressed upon the Democracy in regard to Utah., That question the Judge well knew to be this: ""If the people of Utah peacefully form a State constitution tolerating polygamy, will the Democracy admit them into the Union?"", There is nothing in the United States Constitution or law against polygamy; and why is it not a part of the Judge's ""sacred right of self-government"" for the people to have it, or rather to keep it, if they choose?, These questions, so far as I know, the Judge never answers., It might involve the Democracy to answer them either way, and they go unanswered., As to Kansas., The substance of the Judge's speech on Kansas is an effort to put the free-State men in the wrong for not voting at the election of delegates to the constitutional convention., He says:  ""There is every reason to hope and believe that the law will be fairly interpreted and impartially executed, so as to insure to every bona fide inhabitant the free and quiet exercise of the elective franchise."", It appears extraordinary that Judge Douglas should make such a statement., He knows that, by the law, no one can vote who has not been registered; and he knows that the free-State men place their refusal to vote on the ground that but few of them have been registered., It is possible that this is not true, but Judge Douglas knows it is asserted to be true in letters, newspapers, and public speeches, and borne by every mail and blown by every breeze to the eyes and ears of the world., He knows it is boldly declared that the people of many whole counties, and many whole neighborhoods in others, are left unregistered; yet he does not venture to contradict the declaration, or to point out how they can vote without being registered; but he just slips along, not seeming to know there is any such question of fact, and complacently declares:   ""There is every reason to hope and believe that the law will be fairly and impartially executed, so as to insure to every bona fide inhabitant the free and quiet exercise of the elective franchise."", I readily agree that if all had a chance to vote they ought to have voted., If, on the contrary, as they allege, and Judge Douglas ventures not to particularly contradict, few only of the free-State men had a chance to vote, they were perfectly right in staying from the polls in a body., By the way, since the Judge spoke, the Kansas election has come off., The Judge expressed his confidence that all the Democrats in Kansas would do their duty-including ""free-State Democrats,"" of course., The returns received here as yet are very incomplete; but so far as they go, they indicate that only about one sixth of the registered voters have really voted; and this, too, when not more, perhaps, than one half of the rightful voters have been registered, thus showing the thing to have been altogether the most exquisite farce ever enacted., I am watching with considerable interest to ascertain what figure ""the free-State Democrats"" cut in the concern., Of course they voted,--all Democrats do their duty,--and of course they did not vote for slave-State candidates., We soon shall know how many delegates they elected, how many candidates they had pledged to a free State, and how many votes were cast for them., Allow me to barely whisper my suspicion that there were no such things in Kansas as ""free-State Democrats""--that they were altogether mythical, good only to figure in newspapers and speeches in the free States., If there should prove to be one real living free-State Democrat in Kansas, I suggest that it might be well to catch him, and stuff and preserve his skin as an interesting specimen of that soon-to-be extinct variety of the genus Democrat., And now as to the Dred Scott decision., That decision declares two propositions--first, that a negro cannot sue in the United States courts; and secondly, that Congress cannot prohibit slavery in the Territories., It was made by a divided court dividing differently on the different points., Judge Douglas does not discuss the merits of the decision, and in that respect I shall follow his example, believing I could no more improve on McLean and Curtis than he could on Taney., He denounces all who question the correctness of that decision, as offering violent resistance to it., But who resists it?, Who has, in spite of the decision, declared Dred Scott free, and resisted the authority of his master over him?, Judicial decisions have two uses--first, to absolutely determine the case decided, and secondly, to indicate to the public how other similar cases will be decided when they arise., For the latter use, they are called ""precedents"" and ""authorities."", We believe as much as Judge Douglas (perhaps more) in obedience to, and respect for, the judicial department of government., We think its decisions on constitutional questions, when fully settled, should control not only the particular cases decided, but the general policy of the country, subject to be disturbed only by amendments of the Constitution as provided in that instrument itself., More than this would be revolution., But we think the Dred Scott decision is erroneous., We know the court that made it has often overruled its own decisions, and we shall do what we can to have it to overrule this., We offer no resistance to it., Judicial decisions are of greater or less authority as precedents according to circumstances., That this should be so accords both with common sense and the customary understanding of the legal profession., If this important decision had been made by the unanimous concurrence of the judges, and without any apparent partisan bias, and in accordance with legal public expectation and with the steady practice of the departments throughout our history, and had been in no part based on assumed historical facts which are not really true; or, if wanting in some of these, it had been before the court more than once, and had there been affirmed and reaffirmed through a course of years, it then might be, perhaps would be, factious, nay, even revolutionary, not to acquiesce in it as a precedent., But when, as is true, we find it wanting in all these claims to the public confidence, it is not resistance, it is not factious, it is not even disrespectful, to treat it as not having yet quite established a settled doctrine for the country., But Judge Douglas considers this view awful., Hear him:  ""The courts are the tribunals prescribed by the Constitution and created by the authority of the people to determine, expound, and enforce the law., Hence, whoever resists the final decision of the highest judicial tribunal aims a deadly blow at our whole republican system of government--a blow which, if successful, would place all our rights and liberties at the mercy of passion, anarchy, and violence., I repeat, therefore, that if resistance to the decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States, in a matter like the points decided in the Dred Scott case, clearly within their jurisdiction as defined by the Constitution, shall be forced upon the country as a political issue, it will become a distinct and naked issue between the friends and enemies of the Constitution--the friends and the enemies of the supremacy of the laws."", Why, this same Supreme Court once decided a national bank to be constitutional; but General Jackson, as President of the United States, disregarded the decision, and vetoed a bill for a recharter, partly on constitutional ground, declaring that each public functionary must support the Constitution ""as he understands it."", But hear the General's own words., Here they are, taken from his veto message:  I drop the quotations merely to remark that all there ever was in the way of precedent up to the Dred Scott decision, on the points therein decided, had been against that decision., But hear General Jackson further:  Again and again have I heard Judge Douglas denounce that bank decision and applaud General Jackson for disregarding it., It would be interesting for him to look over his recent speech, and see how exactly his fierce philippics against us for resisting Supreme Court decisions fall upon his own head., It will call to mind a long and fierce political war in this country, upon an issue which, in his own language, and, of course, in his own changeless estimation, ""was a distinct issue between the friends and the enemies of the Constitution,"" and in which war he fought in the ranks of the enemies of the Constitution., I have said, in substance, that the Dred Scott decision was in part based on assumed historical facts which were not really true, and I ought not to leave the subject without giving some reasons for saying this; I therefore give an instance or two, which I think fully sustain me., Chief Justice Taney, in delivering the opinion of the majority of the court, insists at great length that negroes were no part of the people who made, or for whom was made, the Declaration of Independence, or the Constitution of the United States., On the contrary, Judge Curtis, in his dissenting opinion, shows that in five of the then thirteen States--to wit, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, and North Carolina--free negroes were voters, and in proportion to their numbers had the same part in making the Constitution that the white people had., He shows this with so much particularity as to leave no doubt of its truth; and as a sort of conclusion on that point, holds the following language:  Again, Chief Justice Taney says:  And again, after quoting from the Declaration, he says:  In these the Chief Justice does not directly assert, but plainly assumes as a fact, that the public estimate of the black man is more favorable now than it was in the days of the Revolution., This assumption is a mistake., In some trifling particulars the condition of that race has been ameliorated; but as a whole, in this country, the change between then and now is decidedly the other way, and their ultimate destiny has never appeared so hopeless as in the last three or four years., In two of the five States--New Jersey and North Carolina--that then gave the free negro the right of voting, the right has since been taken away, and in a third--New York--it has been greatly abridged; while it has not been extended, so far as I know, to a single additional State, though the number of the States has more than doubled., In those days, as I understand, masters could, at their own pleasure, emancipate their slaves; but since then such legal restraints have been made upon emancipation as to amount almost to prohibition., In those days Legislatures held the unquestioned power to abolish slavery in their respective States, but now it is becoming quite fashionable for State constitutions to withhold that power from the Legislatures., In those days, by common consent, the spread of the black man's bondage to the new countries was prohibited, but now Congress decides that it will not continue the prohibition, and the Supreme Court decides that it could not if it would., In those days our Declaration of Independence was held sacred by all, and thought to include all; but now, to aid in making the bondage of the negro universal and eternal, it is assailed and sneered at and construed and hawked at and torn, till, if its framers could rise from their graves, they could not at all recognize it., All the powers of earth seem rapidly combining against him., Mammon is after him, ambition follows, philosophy follows, and the theology of the day fast joining the cry., ...]",3
230,"[I have said that the separation of the races is the only perfect preventive of amalgamation., I have no right to say all the members of the Republican party are in favor of this, nor to say that as a party they are in favor of it., There is nothing in their platform directly on the subject., But I can say a very large proportion of its members are for it, and that the chief plank in their platform--opposition to the spread of slavery--is most favorable to that separation., Such separation, if ever effected at all, must be effected by colonization; and no political party, as such, is now doing anything directly for colonization., Party operations at present only favor or retard colonization incidentally., The enterprise is a difficult one; but ""where there is a will there is a way,"" and what colonization needs most is a hearty will., Will springs from the two elements of moral sense and self-interest., Let us be brought to believe it is morally right, and at the same time favorable to, or at least not against, our interest to transfer the African to his native clime, and we shall find a way to do it, however great the task may be., The children of Israel, to such numbers as to include four hundred thousand fighting men, went out of Egyptian bondage in a body., How differently the respective courses of the Democratic and Republican parties incidentally, bear on the question of forming a will--a public sentiment--for colonization, is easy to see., The Republicans inculcate, with whatever of ability they can, that the negro is a man, that his bondage is cruelly wrong, and that the field of his oppression ought not to be enlarged., The Democrats deny his manhood; deny, or dwarf to insignificance, the wrong of his bondage; so far as possible crush all sympathy for him, and cultivate and excite hatred and disgust against him; compliment themselves as Union-savers for doing so; and call the indefinite outspreading of his bondage ""a sacred right of self-government."", The plainest print cannot be read through a gold eagle; and it will be ever hard to find many men who will send a slave to Liberia, and pay his passage, while they can send him to a new country--Kansas, for instance--and sell him for fifteen hundred dollars, and the rise., Yours of the 14th is received, and I am much obliged for the legal information you give., You can scarcely be more anxious than I that the next election in Iowa should result in favor of the Republicans., I lost nearly all the working part of last year, giving my time to the canvass; and I am altogether too poor to lose two years together., I am engaged in a suit in the United States Court at Chicago, in which the Rock Island Bridge Company is a party., The trial is to commence on the 8th of September, and probably will last two or three weeks., During the trial it is not improbable that all hands may come over and take a look at the bridge, and, if it were possible to make it hit right, I could then speak at Davenport., My courts go right on without cessation till late in November., Write me again, pointing out the more striking points of difference between your old and new constitutions, and also whether Democratic and Republican party lines were drawn in the adoption of it, and which were for and which were against it., If, by possibility, I could get over among you it might be of some advantage to know these things in advance., Mr. A. Lincoln addressed the jury., He said he did not purpose to assail anybody, that he expected to grow earnest as he proceeded but not ill-natured., ""There is some conflict of testimony in the case,"" he said, ""but one quarter of such a number of witnesses seldom agree, and even if all were on one side some discrepancy might be expected., We are to try and reconcile them, and to believe that they are not intentionally erroneous as long as we can."", He had no prejudice, he said, against steamboats or steamboat men nor any against St. Louis, for he supposed they went about this matter as other people would do in their situation., ""St. Louis,"" he continued, ""as a commercial place may desire that this bridge should not stand, as it is adverse to her commerce, diverting a portion of it from the river; and it may be that she supposes that the additional cost of railroad transportation upon the productions of Iowa will force them to go to St. Louis if this bridge is removed., The meetings in St. Louis are connected with this case only as some witnesses are in it, and thus has some prejudice added color to their testimony."", The last thing that would be pleasing to him, Mr. Lincoln said, would be to have one of these great channels, extending almost from where it never freezes to where it never thaws, blocked up, but there is a travel from east to west whose demands are not less important than those of the river., It is growing larger and larger, building up new countries with a rapidity never before seen in the history of the world., He alluded to the astonishing growth of Illinois, having grown within his memory to a population of a million and a half; to Iowa and the other young rising communities of the Northwest., ""This current of travel,"" said he, ""has its rights as well as that of north and south., If the river had not the advantage in priority and legislation we could enter into free competition with it and we could surpass it., This particular railroad line has a great importance and the statement of its business during a little less than a year shows this importance., It is in evidence that from September 8, 1856, to August 8, 1857, 12,586 freight cars and 74,179 passengers passed over this bridge., Navigation was closed four days short of four months last year, and during this time while the river was of no use this road and bridge were valuable., There is, too, a considerable portion of time when floating or thin ice makes the river useless while the bridge is as useful as ever., This shows that this bridge must be treated with respect in this court and is not to be kicked about with contempt., The other day Judge Wead alluded to the strike of the contending interest and even a dissolution of the Union., The proper mode for all parties in this affair is to 'live and let live,' and then we will find a cessation of this trouble about the bridge., What mood were the steamboat men in when this bridge was burned?, Why, there was a shouting and ringing of bells and whistling on all the boats as it fell., It was a jubilee, a greater celebration than follows an excited election., The first thing I will proceed to is the record of Mr. Gurney and the complaint of Judge Wead that the record did not extend back over all the time from the completion of the bridge., The principal part of the navigation after the bridge was burned passed through the span., When the bridge was repaired and the boats were a second time confined to the draw it was provided that this record should be kept., That is the simple history of that book., ""From April 19th, 1856, to May 6th--seventeen days--there were twenty accidents and all the time since then there have been but twenty hits, including seven accidents, so that the dangers of this place are tapering off and as the boatmen get cool the accidents get less., We may soon expect if this ratio is kept up that there will be no accidents at all., ""Judge Wead said, while admitting that the floats went straight through, there was a difference between a float and a boat, but I do not remember that he indulged us with an argument in support of this statement., Is it because there is a difference in size?, Will not a small body and a large one float the same way under the same influence?, True a flatboat will float faster than an egg shell and the egg shell might be blown away by the wind, but if under the same influence they would go the same way., Logs, floats, boards, various things the witnesses say all show the same current., Then is not this test reliable?, At all depths too the direction of the current is the same., A series of these floats would make a line as long as a boat and would show any influence upon any part and all parts of the boat., ""I will now speak of the angular position of the piers., What is the amount of the angle?, The course of the river is a curve and the pier is straight., If a line is produced from the upper end of the long pier straight with the pier to a distance of 350 feet, and a line is drawn from a point in the channel opposite this point to the head of the pier, Colonel Nason says they will form an angle of twenty degrees., But the angle if measured at the pier is seven degrees; that is, we would have to move the pier seven degrees to make it exactly straight with the current., Would that make the navigation better or worse?, The witnesses of the plaintiff seem to think it was only necessary to say that the pier formed an angle with the current and that settled the matter., Our more careful and accurate witnesses say that, though they had been accustomed to seeing the piers placed straight with the current, yet they could see that here the current had been made straight by us in having made this slight angle; that the water now runs just right, that it is straight and cannot be improved., They think that if the pier was changed the eddy would be divided and the navigation improved., ""I am not now going to discuss the question what is a material obstruction., We do not greatly differ about the law., The cases produced here are, I suppose, proper to be taken into consideration by the court in instructing a jury., Some of them I think are not exactly in point, but I am still willing to trust his honor, Judge McLean, and take his instructions as law., What is reasonable skill and care?, This is a thing of which the jury are to judge., I differ from the other side when it says that they are bound to exercise no more care than was taken before the building of the bridge., If we are allowed by the Legislature to build the bridge which will require them to do more than before, when a pilot comes along, it is unreasonable for him to dash on heedless of this structure which has been legally put there., The Afton came there on the 5th and lay at Rock Island until next morning., When a boat lies up the pilot has a holiday, and would not any of these jurors have then gone around to the bridge and gotten acquainted with the place?, Pilot Parker has shown here that he does not understand the draw., I heard him say that the fall from the head to the foot of the pier was four feet; he needs information., He could have gone there that day and seen there was no such fall., He should have discarded passion and the chances are that he would have had no disaster at all., He was bound to make himself acquainted with the place., ""McCammon says that the current and the swell coming from the long pier drove her against the long pier., In other words drove her toward the very pier from which the current came!, It is an absurdity, an impossibility., The only recollection I can find for this contradiction is in a current which White says strikes out from the long pier and then like a ram's horn turns back, and this might have acted somehow in this manner., ""It is agreed by all that the plaintiff's boat was destroyed and that it was destroyed upon the head of the short pier; that she moved from the channel where she was with her bow above the head of the long pier, till she struck the short one, swung around under the bridge and there was crowded and destroyed., ""I shall try to prove that the average velocity of the current through the draw with the boat in it should be five and a half miles an hour; that it is slowest at the head of the pier and swiftest at the foot of the pier., Their lowest estimate in evidence is six miles an hour, their highest twelve miles., This was the testimony of men who had made no experiment, only conjecture., We have adopted the most exact means., The water runs swiftest in high water and we have taken the point of nine feet above low water., The water when the Afton was lost was seven feet above low water, or at least a foot lower than our time., Brayton and his assistants timed the instruments, the best instruments known in measuring currents., They timed them under various circumstances and they found the current five miles an hour and no more., They found that the water at the upper end ran slower than five miles; that below it was swifter than five miles, but that the average was five miles., Shall men who have taken no care, who conjecture, some of whom speak of twenty miles an hour, be believed against those who have had such a favorable and well improved opportunity?, They should not even qualify the result., Several men have given their opinion as to the distance of the steamboat Carson, and I suppose if one should go and measure that distance you would believe him in preference to all of them., ...]",3
231,"[Douglas says they cannot pay more, and I believe him., I do not write this as a lawyer seeking an advantage for a client; but only as a friend, only urging you to do what I think I would do if I were in your situation., I mean this as private and confidential only, but I feel a good deal of anxiety about it., This morning Col. McClernand showed me a petition for a mandamus against the Secretary of State to compel him to certify the apportionment act of last session; and he says it will be presented to the court to-morrow morning., We shall be allowed three or four days to get up a return, and I, for one, want the benefit of consultation with you., Please come right up., Yesterday morning the court overruled the demurrer to Hatches return in the mandamus case., McClernand was present; said nothing about pleading over; and so I suppose the matter is ended., The court gave no reason for the decision; but Peck tells me confidentially that they were unanimous in the opinion that even if the Gov'r had signed the bill purposely, he had the right to scratch his name off so long as the bill remained in his custody and control., Coming home from Bloomington last night I found your letter of the 15th., I know of no express statute or decisions as to what a J. P. upon the expiration of his term shall do with his docket books, papers, unfinished business, etc., but so far as I know, the practice has been to hand over to the successor, and to cease to do anything further whatever, in perfect analogy to Sections 110 and 112, and I have supposed and do suppose this is the law., I think the successor may forthwith do whatever the retiring J. P. might have done., As to the proviso to Section 114 I think it was put in to cover possible cases, by way of caution, and not to authorize the J. P. to go forward and finish up whatever might have been begun by him., The view I take, I believe, is the Common law principle, as to retiring officers and their successors, to which I remember but one exception, which is the case of Sheriff and ministerial officers of that class., I have not had time to examine this subject fully, but I have great confidence I am right., You must not think of offering me pay for this., Mr. John O. Johnson is my friend; I gave your name to him., He is doing the work of trying to get up a Republican organization., I do not suppose ""Long John"" ever saw or heard of him., Let me say to you confidentially, that I do not entirely appreciate what the Republican papers of Chicago are so constantly saying against ""Long John."", I consider those papers truly devoted to the Republican cause, and not unfriendly to me; but I do think that more of what they say against ""Long John"" is dictated by personal malice than themselves are conscious of., We can not afford to lose the services of ""Long John"" and I do believe the unrelenting warfare made upon him is injuring our cause., I mean this to be confidential., If you quietly co-operate with Mr. J. O. Johnson on getting up an organization, I think it will be right., Mr. G. A. Sutton is an applicant for superintendent of the addition of the Insane Asylum, and I understand it partly depends on you whether he gets it., Sutton is my fellow-townsman and friend, and I therefore wish to say for him that he is a man of sterling integrity and as a master mechanic and builder not surpassed by any in our city, or any I have known anywhere, as far as I can judge., I hope you will consider me as being really interested for Mr. Sutton and not as writing merely to relieve myself of importunity., Please show this to Col. William Ross and let him consider it as much intended for him as for yourself., Yours of the 9th written at Joliet is just received., Two or three days ago I learned that McLean had appointed delegates in favor of Lovejoy, and thenceforward I have considered his renomination a fixed fact., My opinion--if my opinion is of any consequence in this case, in which it is no business of mine to interfere--remains unchanged, that running an independent candidate against Lovejoy will not do; that it will result in nothing but disaster all round., In the first place, whosoever so runs will be beaten and will be spotted for life; in the second place, while the race is in progress, he will be under the strongest temptation to trade with the Democrats, and to favor the election of certain of their friends to the Legislature; thirdly, I shall be held responsible for it, and Republican members of the Legislature who are partial to Lovejoy will for that purpose oppose us; and lastly, it will in the end lose us the district altogether., There is no safe way but a convention; and if in that convention, upon a common platform which all are willing to stand upon, one who has been known as an abolitionist, but who is now occupying none but common ground, can get the majority of the votes to which all look for an election, there is no safe way but to submit., As to the inclination of some Republicans to favor Douglas, that is one of the chances I have to run, and which I intend to run with patience., I write in the court room., Court has opened, and I must close., If we could first know where we are, and whither we are tending, we could better judge what to do, and how to do it., We are now far into the fifth year since a policy was initiated with the avowed object and confident promise of putting an end to slavery agitation., Under the operation of that policy, that agitation has not only not ceased, but has constantly augmented., In my opinion, it will not cease until a crisis shall have been reached and passed., ""A house divided against itself cannot stand."", I believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free., I do not expect the Union to be dissolved; I do not expect the house to fall; but I do expect it will cease to be divided., It will become all one thing, or all the other., Either the opponents of slavery will arrest the further spread of it, and place it where the public mind shall rest in the belief that it is in the course of ultimate extinction, or its advocates will push it forward till it shall become alike lawful in all the States, old as well as new, North as well as South., Have we no tendency to the latter condition?, Let any one who doubts, carefully contemplate that now almost complete legal combination-piece of machinery, so to speak compounded of the Nebraska doctrine and the Dred Scott decision., Let him consider, not only what work the machinery is adapted to do, and how well adapted, but also let him study the history of its construction, and trace, if he can, or rather fail, if he can, to trace the evidences of design, and concert of action, among its chief architects, from the beginning., The new year of 1854 found slavery excluded from more than half the States by State Constitutions, and from most of the National territory by Congressional prohibition., Four days later, commenced the struggle which ended in repealing that Congressional prohibition., This opened all the National territory to slavery, and was the first point gained., But, so far, Congress only had acted, and an indorsement by the people, real or apparent, was indispensable to save the point already gained, and give chance for more., This necessity had not been overlooked, but had been provided for, as well as might be, in the notable argument of ""squatter sovereignty,"" otherwise called ""sacred right of self-government,"" which latter phrase, though expressive of the only rightful basis of any government, was so perverted in this attempted use of it as to amount to just this: That if any one man choose to enslave another, no third man shall be allowed to object., That argument was incorporated into the Nebraska Bill itself, in the language which follows:  ""It being the true intent and meaning of this Act not to legislate slavery into any Territory or State, nor to exclude it therefrom, but to leave the people thereof perfectly free to form and regulate their domestic institutions in their own way, subject only to the Constitution of the United States."", Then opened the roar of loose declamation in favor of ""squatter sovereignty,"" and ""sacred right of self-government."", ""But,"" said opposition members, ""let us amend the bill so as to expressly declare that the people of the Territory may exclude slavery."", ""Not we,"" said the friends of the measure, and down they voted the amendment., While the Nebraska Bill was passing through Congress, a law case, involving the question of a negro's freedom, by reason of his owner having voluntarily taken him first into a free State, and then into a territory covered by the Congressional Prohibition, and held him as a slave for a long time in each, was passing through the United States Circuit Court for the District of Missouri; and both Nebraska Bill and lawsuit were brought to a decision in the same month of May, 1854., The negro's name was ""Dred Scott,"" which name now designates the decision finally made in the case., Before the then next Presidential election, the law case came to, and was argued in, the Supreme Court of the United States; but the decision of it was deferred until after the election., Still, before the election, Senator Trumbull, on the floor of the Senate, requested the leading advocate of the Nebraska Bill to state his opinion whether the people of a territory can constitutionally exclude slavery from their limits; and the latter answers: ""That is a question for the Supreme Court."", The election came., Mr. Buchanan was elected, and the indorsement, such as it was, secured., That was the second point gained., The indorsement, however, fell short of a clear popular majority by nearly four hundred thousand votes,(approximately 10% of the vote) and so, perhaps, was not overwhelmingly reliable and satisfactory., The outgoing President, in his last annual message, as impressively as possible echoed back upon the people the weight and authority of the indorsement., The Supreme Court met again, did not announce their decision, but ordered a reargument., The Presidential inauguration came, and still no decision of the court; but the incoming President, in his inaugural address, fervently exhorted the people to abide by the forth-coming decision, whatever it might be., Then, in a few days, came the decision., The reputed author of the Nebraska Bill finds an early occasion to make a speech at this capital indorsing the Dred Scott decision, and vehemently denouncing all opposition to it., The new President, too, seizes the early occasion of the Silliman letter to indorse and strongly construe that decision, and to express his astonishment that any different view had ever been entertained!, At length a squabble springs up between the President and the author of the Nebraska Bill, on the mere question of fact, whether the Lecompton Constitution was or was not in any just sense made by the people of Kansas; and in that quarrel the latter declares that all he wants is a fair vote for the people, and that he cares not whether slavery be voted down or voted up., I do not understand his declaration, that he cares not whether slavery be voted down or voted up, to be intended by him other than as an apt definition of the policy he would impress upon the public mind,--the principle for which he declares he has suffered so much, and is ready to suffer to the end., And well may he cling to that principle!, If he has any parental feeling, well may he cling to it., That principle is the only shred left of his original Nebraska doctrine., Under the Dred Scott decision ""squatter sovereignty"" squatted out of existence, tumbled down like temporary scaffolding; like the mould at the foundry, served through one blast, and fell back into loose sand; helped to carry an election, and then was kicked to the winds., His late joint struggle with the Republicans, against the Lecompton Constitution, involves nothing of the original Nebraska doctrine., That struggle was made on a point--the right of a people to make their own constitution--upon which he and the Republicans have never differed., The several points of the Dred Scott decision, in connection with Senator Douglas's ""care not"" policy, constitute the piece of machinery, in its present state of advancement., This was the third point gained., The working points of that machinery are:  Firstly, That no negro slave, imported as such from Africa, and no descendant of such slave, can ever be a citizen of any State, in the sense of that term as used in the Constitution of the United States., This point is made in order to deprive the negro, in every possible event, of the benefit of that provision of the United States Constitution which declares that ""The citizens of each State shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in the several States."", Secondly, That, ""subject to the Constitution of the United States,"" neither Congress nor a Territorial Legislature can exclude slavery from any United States Territory., This point is made in order that individual men may fill up the Territories with slaves, without danger of losing them as property, and thus to enhance the chances of permanency to the institution through all the future., Thirdly, That whether the holding a negro in actual slavery in a free State makes him free, as against the holder, the United States courts will not decide, but will leave to be decided by the courts of any slave State the negro may be forced into by the master., This point is made, not to be pressed immediately; but, if acquiesced in for a while, and apparently indorsed by the people at an election, then to sustain the logical conclusion that what Dred Scott's master might lawfully do with Dred Scott, in the free State of Illinois, every other master may lawfully do with any other one, or one thousand slaves, in Illinois, or in any other free State., Auxiliary to all this, and working hand in hand with it, the Nebraska doctrine, or what is left of it, is to educate and mould public opinion, at least Northern public opinion, not to care whether slavery is voted down or voted up., This shows exactly where we now are; and partially, also, wither we are tending., It will throw additional light on the latter, to go back and run the mind over the string of historical facts already stated., Several things will now appear less dark and mysterious than they did when they were transpiring., The people were to be left ""perfectly free,"" ""subject only to the Constitution."", What the Constitution had to do with it, outsiders could not then see., Plainly enough now,--it was an exactly fitted niche, for the Dred Scott decision to afterward come in, and declare the perfect freedom of the people to be just no freedom at all., Why was the amendment, expressly declaring the right of the people, voted down?, Plainly enough now,--the adoption of it would have spoiled the niche for the Dred Scott decision., Why was the court decision held up?, Why even a Senator's individual opinion withheld, till after the Presidential election?, Plainly enough now,--the speaking out then would have damaged the ""perfectly free"" argument upon which the election was to be carried., Why the outgoing President's felicitation on the indorsement?, ...]",3
232,"[He said that a friend of our Senator Douglas had been talking to him, and had, among other things, said to him:  ""...why, you don't want to beat Douglas?"", ""Yes,"" said he, ""I do want to beat him, and I will tell you why., I believe his original Nebraska Bill was right in the abstract, but it was wrong in the time that it was brought forward., It was wrong in the application to a Territory in regard to which the question had been settled; it was brought forward at a time when nobody asked him; it was tendered to the South when the South had not asked for it, but when they could not well refuse it; and for this same reason he forced that question upon our party., It has sunk the best men all over the nation, everywhere; and now, when our President, struggling with the difficulties of this man's getting up, has reached the very hardest point to turn in the case, he deserts him and I am for putting him where he will trouble us no more."", Now, gentlemen, that is not my argument; that is not my argument at all., I have only been stating to you the argument of a Buchanan man., You will judge if there is any force in it., Popular sovereignty!, Everlasting popular sovereignty!, Let us for a moment inquire into this vast matter of popular sovereignty., What is popular sovereignty?, We recollect that at an early period in the history of this struggle there was another name for the same thing,--""squatter sovereignty."", It was not exactly popular sovereignty, but squatter sovereignty., What do those terms mean?, What do those terms mean when used now?, And vast credit is taken by our friend the Judge in regard to his support of it, when he declares the last years of his life have been, and all the future years of his life shall be, devoted to this matter of popular sovereignty., What is it?, Why, it is the sovereignty of the people!, What was squatter sovereignty?, I suppose, if it had any significance at all, it was the right of the people to govern themselves, to be sovereign in their own affairs while they were squatted down in a country not their own, while they had squatted on a Territory that did not belong to them, in the sense that a State belongs to the people who inhabit it, when it belonged to the nation; such right to govern themselves was called ""squatter sovereignty."", Now, I wish you to mark: What has become of that squatter sovereignty?, what has become of it?, Can you get anybody to tell you now that the people of a Territory have any authority to govern themselves, in regard to this mooted question of slavery, before they form a State constitution?, No such thing at all; although there is a general running fire, and although there has been a hurrah made in every speech on that side, assuming that policy had given the people of a Territory the right to govern themselves upon this question, yet the point is dodged., To-day it has been decided--no more than a year ago it was decided--by the Supreme Court of the United States, and is insisted upon to-day that the people of a Territory have no right to exclude slavery from a Territory; that if any one man chooses to take slaves into a Territory, all the rest of the people have no right to keep them out., This being so, and this decision being made one of the points that the Judge approved, and one in the approval of which he says he means to keep me down,--put me down I should not say, for I have never been up,--he says he is in favor of it, and sticks to it, and expects to win his battle on that decision, which says that there is no such thing as squatter sovereignty, but that any one man may take slaves into a Territory, and all the other men in the Territory may be opposed to it, and yet by reason of the Constitution they cannot prohibit it., When that is so, how much is left of this vast matter of squatter sovereignty, I should like to know?, When we get back, we get to the point of the right of the people to make a constitution., Kansas was settled, for example, in 1854., It was a Territory yet, without having formed a constitution, in a very regular way, for three years., All this time negro slavery could be taken in by any few individuals, and by that decision of the Supreme Court, which the Judge approves, all the rest of the people cannot keep it out; but when they come to make a constitution, they may say they will not have slavery., But it is there; they are obliged to tolerate it some way, and all experience shows it will be so, for they will not take the negro slaves and absolutely deprive the owners of them., All experience shows this to be so., All that space of time that runs from the beginning of the settlement of the Territory until there is sufficiency of people to make a State constitution,--all that portion of time popular sovereignty is given up., The seal is absolutely put down upon it by the court decision, and Judge Douglas puts his own upon the top of that; yet he is appealing to the people to give him vast credit for his devotion to popular sovereignty., Again, when we get to the question of the right of the people to form a State constitution as they please, to form it with slavery or without slavery, if that is anything new, I confess I don't know it., Has there ever been a time when anybody said that any other than the people of a Territory itself should form a constitution?, What is now in it that Judge Douglas should have fought several years of his life, and pledge himself to fight all the remaining years of his life for?, Can Judge Douglas find anybody on earth that said that anybody else should form a constitution for a people?, [A voice, ""Yes.""], Well, I should like you to name him; I should like to know who he was., [Same voice, ""John Calhoun.""], No, sir, I never heard of even John Calhoun saying such a thing., He insisted on the same principle as Judge Douglas; but his mode of applying it, in fact, was wrong., It is enough for my purpose to ask this crowd whenever a Republican said anything against it., They never said anything against it, but they have constantly spoken for it; and whoever will undertake to examine the platform, and the speeches of responsible men of the party, and of irresponsible men, too, if you please, will be unable to find one word from anybody in the Republican ranks opposed to that popular sovereignty which Judge Douglas thinks that he has invented., I suppose that Judge Douglas will claim, in a little while, that he is the inventor of the idea that the people should govern themselves; that nobody ever thought of such a thing until he brought it forward., We do not remember that in that old Declaration of Independence it is said that:  ""We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness; that to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed."", There is the origin of popular sovereignty., Who, then, shall come in at this day and claim that he invented it?, The Lecompton Constitution connects itself with this question, for it is in this matter of the Lecompton Constitution that our friend Judge Douglas claims such vast credit., I agree that in opposing the Lecompton Constitution, so far as I can perceive, he was right., I do not deny that at all; and, gentlemen, you will readily see why I could not deny it, even if I wanted to., But I do not wish to; for all the Republicans in the nation opposed it, and they would have opposed it just as much without Judge Douglas's aid as with it., They had all taken ground against it long before he did., Why, the reason that he urges against that constitution I urged against him a year before., I have the printed speech in my hand., The argument that he makes, why that constitution should not be adopted, that the people were not fairly represented nor allowed to vote, I pointed out in a speech a year ago, which I hold in my hand now, that no fair chance was to be given to the people., [""Read it, Read it.""], I shall not waste your time by trying to read it., [""Read it, Read it.""], Gentlemen, reading from speeches is a very tedious business, particularly for an old man that has to put on spectacles, and more so if the man be so tall that he has to bend over to the light., A little more, now, as to this matter of popular sovereignty and the Lecompton Constitution., The Lecompton Constitution, as the Judge tells us, was defeated., The defeat of it was a good thing or it was not., He thinks the defeat of it was a good thing, and so do I, and we agree in that., Who defeated it?, Yes, he furnished himself, and if you suppose he controlled the other Democrats that went with him, he furnished three votes; while the Republicans furnished twenty., That is what he did to defeat it., In the House of Representatives he and his friends furnished some twenty votes, and the Republicans furnished ninety odd., Now, who was it that did the work?, Why, yes, Douglas did it!, To be sure he did., Let us, however, put that proposition another way., The Republicans could not have done it without Judge Douglas., Could he have done it without them?, Which could have come the nearest to doing it without the other?, Ground was taken against it by the Republicans long before Douglas did it., The proportion of opposition to that measure is about five to one., You don't know what you are talking about, my friend., I am quite willing to answer any gentleman in the crowd who asks an intelligent question., Now, who in all this country has ever found any of our friends of Judge Douglas's way of thinking, and who have acted upon this main question, that has ever thought of uttering a word in behalf of Judge Trumbull?, I defy you to show a printed resolution passed in a Democratic meeting--I take it upon myself to defy any man to show a printed resolution of a Democratic meeting, large or small--in favor of Judge Trumbull, or any of the five to one Republicans who beat that bill., Everything must be for the Democrats!, They did everything, and the five to the one that really did the thing they snub over, and they do not seem to remember that they have an existence upon the face of the earth., Gentlemen, I fear that I shall become tedious., I leave this branch of the subject to take hold of another., I take up that part of Judge Douglas's speech in which he respectfully attended to me., Judge Douglas made two points upon my recent speech at Springfield., He says they are to be the issues of this campaign., The first one of these points he bases upon the language in a speech which I delivered at Springfield, which I believe I can quote correctly from memory., I said there that ""we are now far into the fifth year since a policy was instituted for the avowed object, and with the confident promise, of putting an end to slavery agitation; under the operation of that policy, that agitation has not only not ceased, but has constantly augmented."", ""I believe it will not cease until a crisis shall have been reached and passed., 'A house divided against itself cannot stand.', I believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free."", ""I do not expect the Union to be dissolved,""--I am quoting from my speech, ""--I do not expect the house to fall, but I do expect it will cease to be divided., It will become all one thing or all the other., Either the opponents of slavery will arrest the spread of it and place it where the public mind shall rest in the belief that it is in the course of ultimate extinction, or its advocates will push it forward until it shall become alike lawful in all the States, north as well as south."", What is the paragraph?, ...]",3
233,"[That is, they say that when a question comes up upon another person, it will be so decided again, unless the court decides in another way, unless the court overrules its decision., Well, we mean to do what we can to have the court decide the other way., That is one thing we mean to try to do., The sacredness that Judge Douglas throws around this decision is a degree of sacredness that has never been before thrown around any other decision., I have never heard of such a thing., Why, decisions apparently contrary to that decision, or that good lawyers thought were contrary to that decision, have been made by that very court before., It is the first of its kind; it is an astonisher in legal history., It is a new wonder of the world., It is based upon falsehood in the main as to the facts; allegations of facts upon which it stands are not facts at all in many instances, and no decision made on any question--the first instance of a decision made under so many unfavorable circumstances--thus placed, has ever been held by the profession as law, and it has always needed confirmation before the lawyers regarded it as settled law., But Judge Douglas will have it that all hands must take this extraordinary decision, made under these extraordinary circumstances, and give their vote in Congress in accordance with it, yield to it, and obey it in every possible sense., Circumstances alter cases., Do not gentlemen here remember the case of that same Supreme Court some twenty-five or thirty years ago deciding that a National Bank was constitutional?, I ask, if somebody does not remember that a National Bank was declared to be constitutional?, Such is the truth, whether it be remembered or not., The Bank charter ran out, and a recharter was granted by Congress., That recharter was laid before General Jackson., It was urged upon him, when he denied the constitutionality of the Bank, that the Supreme Court had decided that it was constitutional; and General Jackson then said that the Supreme Court had no right to lay down a rule to govern a coordinate branch of the government, the members of which had sworn to support the Constitution; that each member had sworn to support that Constitution as he understood it., I will venture here to say that I have heard Judge Douglas say that he approved of General Jackson for that act., What has now become of all his tirade about ""resistance of the Supreme Court""?, My fellow-citizens, getting back a little,--for I pass from these points,--when Judge Douglas makes his threat of annihilation upon the ""alliance,"" he is cautious to say that that warfare of his is to fall upon the leaders of the Republican party., Almost every word he utters, and every distinction he makes, has its significance., He means for the Republicans who do not count themselves as leaders, to be his friends; he makes no fuss over them; it is the leaders that he is making war upon., He wants it understood that the mass of the Republican party are really his friends., It is only the leaders that are doing something that are intolerant, and that require extermination at his hands., As this is dearly and unquestionably the light in which he presents that matter, I want to ask your attention, addressing myself to the Republicans here, that I may ask you some questions as to where you, as the Republican party, would be placed if you sustained Judge Douglas in his present position by a re-election?, I do not claim, gentlemen, to be unselfish; I do not pretend that I would not like to go to the United States Senate,--I make no such hypocritical pretense; but I do say to you that in this mighty issue it is nothing to you--nothing to the mass of the people of the nation,--whether or not Judge Douglas or myself shall ever be heard of after this night; it may be a trifle to either of us, but in connection with this mighty question, upon which hang the destinies of the nation, perhaps, it is absolutely nothing: but where will you be placed if you reindorse Judge Douglas?, Don't you know how apt he is, how exceedingly anxious he is at all times, to seize upon anything and everything to persuade you that something he has done you did yourselves?, Why, he tried to persuade you last night that our Illinois Legislature instructed him to introduce the Nebraska Bill., There was nobody in that Legislature ever thought of such a thing; and when he first introduced the bill, he never thought of it; but still he fights furiously for the proposition, and that he did it because there was a standing instruction to our Senators to be always introducing Nebraska bills., He tells you he is for the Cincinnati platform, he tells you he is for the Dred Scott decision., He tells you, not in his speech last night, but substantially in a former speech, that he cares not if slavery is voted up or down; he tells you the struggle on Lecompton is past; it may come up again or not, and if it does, he stands where he stood when, in spite of him and his opposition, you built up the Republican party., If you indorse him, you tell him you do not care whether slavery be voted up or down, and he will close or try to close your mouths with his declaration, repeated by the day, the week, the month, and the year., Is that what you mean?, [Cries of ""No,"" one voice ""Yes.""], Yes, I have no doubt you who have always been for him, if you mean that., No doubt of that, soberly I have said, and I repeat it., I think, in the position in which Judge Douglas stood in opposing the Lecompton Constitution, he was right; he does not know that it will return, but if it does we may know where to find him, and if it does not, we may know where to look for him, and that is on the Cincinnati platform., Now, I could ask the Republican party, after all the hard names that Judge Douglas has called them by all his repeated charges of their inclination to marry with and hug negroes; all his declarations of Black Republicanism,--by the way, we are improving, the black has got rubbed off,--but with all that, if he be indorsed by Republican votes, where do you stand?, Plainly, you stand ready saddled, bridled, and harnessed, and waiting to be driven over to the slavery extension camp of the nation,--just ready to be driven over, tied together in a lot, to be driven over, every man with a rope around his neck, that halter being held by Judge Douglas., That is the question., If Republican men have been in earnest in what they have done, I think they had better not do it; but I think that the Republican party is made up of those who, as far as they can peaceably, will oppose the extension of slavery, and who will hope for its ultimate extinction., If they believe it is wrong in grasping up the new lands of the continent and keeping them from the settlement of free white laborers, who want the land to bring up their families upon; if they are in earnest, although they may make a mistake, they will grow restless, and the time will come when they will come back again and reorganize, if not by the same name, at least upon the same principles as their party now has., It is better, then, to save the work while it is begun., You have done the labor; maintain it, keep it., If men choose to serve you, go with them; but as you have made up your organization upon principle, stand by it; for, as surely as God reigns over you, and has inspired your mind, and given you a sense of propriety, and continues to give you hope, so surely will you still cling to these ideas, and you will at last come back again after your wanderings, merely to do your work over again., We were often,--more than once, at least,--in the course of Judge Douglas's speech last night, reminded that this government was made for white men; that he believed it was made for white men., Well, that is putting it into a shape in which no one wants to deny it; but the Judge then goes into his passion for drawing inferences that are not warranted., I protest, now and forever, against that counterfeit logic which presumes that because I did not want a negro woman for a slave, I do necessarily want her for a wife., My understanding is that I need not have her for either, but, as God made us separate, we can leave one another alone, and do one another much good thereby., There are white men enough to marry all the white women, and enough black men to marry all the black women; and in God's name let them be so married., The Judge regales us with the terrible enormities that take place by the mixture of races; that the inferior race bears the superior down., Why, Judge, if we do not let them get together in the Territories, they won't mix there., I should say at least that that is a self-evident truth., Now, it happens that we meet together once every year, sometimes about the 4th of July, for some reason or other., These 4th of July gatherings I suppose have their uses., If you will indulge me, I will state what I suppose to be some of them., We are now a mighty nation; we are thirty or about thirty millions of people, and we own and inhabit about one fifteenth part of the dry land of the whole earth., We run our memory back over the pages of history for about eighty-two years, and we discover that we were then a very small people in point of numbers, vastly inferior to what we are now, with a vastly less extent of country, with vastly less of everything we deem desirable among men; we look upon the change as exceedingly advantageous to us and to our posterity, and we fix upon something that happened away back, as in some way or other being connected with this rise of prosperity., We find a race of men living in that day whom we claim as our fathers and grandfathers; they were iron men; they fought for the principle that they were contending for; and we understood that by what they then did it has followed that the degree of prosperity which we now enjoy has come to us., We hold this annual celebration to remind ourselves of all the good done in this process of time, of how it was done and who did it, and how we are historically connected with it; and we go from these meetings in better humor with ourselves, we feel more attached the one to the other, and more firmly bound to the country we inhabit., In every way we are better men in the age and race and country in which we live, for these celebrations., But after we have done all this we have not yet reached the whole., There is something else connected with it., We have--besides these, men descended by blood from our ancestors--among us perhaps half our people who are not descendants at all of these men; they are men who have come from Europe, German, Irish, French, and Scandinavian,--men that have come from Europe themselves, or whose ancestors have come hither and settled here, finding themselves our equals in all things., If they look back through this history to trace their connection with those days by blood, they find they have none, they cannot carry themselves back into that glorious epoch and make themselves feel that they are part of us; but when they look through that old Declaration of Independence, they find that those old men say that ""We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal""; and then they feel that that moral sentiment, taught in that day, evidences their relation to those men, that it is the father of all moral principle in them, and that they have a right to claim it as though they were blood of the blood, and flesh of the flesh, of the men who wrote that Declaration; and so they are., That is the electric cord in that Declaration that links the hearts of patriotic and liberty-loving men together, that will link those patriotic hearts as long as the love of freedom exists in the minds of men throughout the world., Now, sirs, for the purpose of squaring things with this idea of ""don't care if slavery is voted up or voted down,"" for sustaining the Dred Scott decision, for holding that the Declaration of Independence did not mean anything at all, we have Judge Douglas giving his exposition of what the Declaration of Independence means, and we have him saying that the people of America are equal to the people of England., According to his construction, you Germans are not connected with it., Now, I ask you in all soberness if all these things, if indulged in, if ratified, if confirmed and indorsed, if taught to our children, and repeated to them, do not tend to rub out the sentiment of liberty in the country, and to transform this government into a government of some other form., Those arguments that are made, that the inferior race are to be treated with as much allowance as they are capable of enjoying; that as much is to be done for them as their condition will allow,--what are these arguments?, They are the arguments that kings have made for enslaving the people in all ages of the world., You will find that all the arguments in favor of kingcraft were of this class; they always bestrode the necks of the people not that they wanted to do it, but because the people were better off for being ridden., That is their argument, and this argument of the Judge is the same old serpent that says, You work, and I eat; you toil, and I will enjoy the fruits of it., Turn in whatever way you will, whether it come from the mouth of a king, an excuse for enslaving the people of his country, or from the mouth of men of one race as a reason for enslaving the men of another race, it is all the same old serpent; and I hold, if that course of argumentation that is made for the purpose of convincing the public mind that we should not care about this should be granted, it does not stop with the negro., I should like to know, if taking this old Declaration of Independence, which declares that all men are equal upon principle, and making exceptions to it, where will it stop?, If one man says it does not mean a negro, why not another say it does not mean some other man?, If that Declaration is not the truth, let us get the statute book, in which we find it, and tear it out!, Who is so bold as to do it?, If it is not true, let us tear it out!, [Cries of ""No, no.""], Let us stick to it, then; let us stand firmly by it, then., It may be argued that there are certain conditions that make necessities and impose them upon us; and to the extent that a necessity is imposed upon a man, he must submit to it., I think that was the condition in which we found ourselves when we established this government., We had slavery among us, we could not get our Constitution unless we permitted them to remain in slavery, we could not secure the good we did secure if we grasped for more; and having by necessity submitted to that much, it does not destroy the principle that is the charter of our liberties., Let that charter stand as our standard., My friend has said to me that I am a poor hand to quote Scripture., I will try it again, however., It is said in one of the admonitions of our Lord, ""As your Father in heaven is perfect, be ye also perfect."", The Savior, I suppose, did not expect that any human creature could be perfect as the Father in heaven; but he said, ""As your Father in heaven is perfect, be ye also perfect."", He set that up as a standard; and he who did most towards reaching that standard attained the highest degree of moral perfection., So I say in relation to the principle that all men are created equal, let it be as nearly reached as we can., If we cannot give freedom to every creature, let us do nothing that will impose slavery upon any other creature., Let us then turn this government back into the channel in which the framers of the Constitution originally placed it., Let us stand firmly by each other., If we do not do so, we are turning in the contrary direction, that our friend Judge Douglas proposes--not intentionally--as working in the traces tends to make this one universal slave nation., He is one that runs in that direction, and as such I resist him., My friends, I have detained you about as long as I desired to do, and I have only to say: Let us discard all this quibbling about this man and the other man, this race and that race and the other race being inferior, and therefore they must be placed in an inferior position; discarding our standard that we have left us., Let us discard all these things, and unite as one people throughout this land, until we shall once more stand up declaring that all men are created equal., My friends, I could not, without launching off upon some new topic, which would detain you too long, continue to-night., I thank you for this most extensive audience that you have furnished me to-night., ...]",3
234,"[They have insisted that whatever of small irregularities existed in getting up the Lecompton Constitution were such as happen in the settlement of all new Territories., The question was, Was it a fair emanation of the people?, It was a question of fact, and not of principle., As to the principle, all were agreed., Judge Douglas voted with the Republicans upon that matter of fact., He and they, by their voices and votes, denied that it was a fair emanation of the people., The Administration affirmed that it was., With respect to the evidence bearing upon that question of fact, I readily agree that Judge Douglas and the Republicans had the right on their side, and that the Administration was wrong., But I state again that, as a matter of principle, there is no dispute upon the right of a people in a Territory, merging into a State, to form a constitution for themselves without outside interference from any quarter., This being so, what is Judge Douglas going to spend his life for?, Is he going to spend his life in maintaining a principle that nobody on earth opposes?, Does he expect to stand up in majestic dignity, and go through his apotheosis and become a god in the maintaining of a principle which neither man nor mouse in all God's creation is opposing?, Now something in regard to the Lecompton Constitution more specially; for I pass from this other question of popular sovereignty as the most arrant humbug that has ever been attempted on an intelligent community., As to the Lecompton Constitution, I have already said that on the question of fact, as to whether it was a fair emanation of the people or not, Judge Douglas, with the Republicans and some Americans, had greatly the argument against the Administration; and while I repeat this, I wish to know what there is in the opposition of Judge Douglas to the Lecompton Constitution that entitles him to be considered the only opponent to it,--as being par excellence the very quintessence of that opposition., I agree to the rightfulness of his opposition., He in the Senate and his class of men there formed the number three and no more., In the House of Representatives his class of men--the Anti-Lecompton Democrats--formed a number of about twenty., It took one hundred and twenty to defeat the measure, against one hundred and twelve., Of the votes of that one hundred and twenty, Judge Douglas's friends furnished twenty, to add to which there were six Americans and ninety-four Republicans., I do not say that I am precisely accurate in their numbers, but I am sufficiently so for any use I am making of it., Why is it that twenty shall be entitled to all the credit of doing that work, and the hundred none of it?, Why, if, as Judge Douglas says, the honor is to be divided and due credit is to be given to other parties, why is just so much given as is consonant with the wishes, the interests, and advancement of the twenty?, My understanding is, when a common job is done, or a common enterprise prosecuted, if I put in five dollars to your one, I have a right to take out five dollars to your one., But he does not so understand it., He declares the dividend of credit for defeating Lecompton upon a basis which seems unprecedented and incomprehensible., Let us see., Lecompton in the raw was defeated., It afterward took a sort of cooked-up shape, and was passed in the English bill., It is said by the Judge that the defeat was a good and proper thing., If it was a good thing, why is he entitled to more credit than others for the performance of that good act, unless there was something in the antecedents of the Republicans that might induce every one to expect them to join in that good work, and at the same time something leading them to doubt that he would?, Does he place his superior claim to credit on the ground that he performed a good act which was never expected of him?, He says I have a proneness for quoting Scripture., If I should do so now, it occurs that perhaps he places himself somewhat upon the ground of the parable of the lost sheep which went astray upon the mountains, and when the owner of the hundred sheep found the one that was lost, and threw it upon his shoulders and came home rejoicing, it was said that there was more rejoicing over the one sheep that was lost and had been found than over the ninety and nine in the fold., The application is made by the Saviour in this parable, thus: ""Verily, I say unto you, there is more rejoicing in heaven over one sinner that repenteth, than over ninety and nine just persons that need no repentance."", And now, if the Judge claims the benefit of this parable, let him repent., Let him not come up here and say: ""I am the only just person; and you are the ninety-nine sinners!"", Repentance before forgiveness is a provision of the Christian system, and on that condition alone will the Republicans grant his forgiveness., How will he prove that we have ever occupied a different position in regard to the Lecompton Constitution or any principle in it?, He says he did not make his opposition on the ground as to whether it was a free or slave constitution, and he would have you understand that the Republicans made their opposition because it ultimately became a slave constitution., To make proof in favor of himself on this point, he reminds us that he opposed Lecompton before the vote was taken declaring whether the State was to be free or slave., But he forgets to say that our Republican Senator, Trumbull, made a speech against Lecompton even before he did., Why did he oppose it?, Partly, as he declares, because the members of the convention who framed it were not fairly elected by the people; that the people were not allowed to vote unless they had been registered; and that the people of whole counties, some instances, were not registered., For these reasons he declares the Constitution was not an emanation, in any true sense, from the people., He also has an additional objection as to the mode of submitting the Constitution back to the people., But bearing on the question of whether the delegates were fairly elected, a speech of his, made something more than twelve months ago, from this stand, becomes important., It was made a little while before the election of the delegates who made Lecompton., In that speech he declared there was every reason to hope and believe the election would be fair; and if any one failed to vote, it would be his own culpable fault., I, a few days after, made a sort of answer to that speech., In that answer I made, substantially, the very argument with which he combated his Lecompton adversaries in the Senate last winter., I pointed to the facts that the people could not vote without being registered, and that the time for registering had gone by., I commented on it as wonderful that Judge Douglas could be ignorant of these facts which every one else in the nation so well knew., I now pass from popular sovereignty and Lecompton., I may have occasion to refer to one or both., When he was preparing his plan of campaign, Napoleon-like, in New York, as appears by two speeches I have heard him deliver since his arrival in Illinois, he gave special attention to a speech of mine, delivered here on the 16th of June last., He says that he carefully read that speech., He told us that at Chicago a week ago last night and he repeated it at Bloomington last night., Doubtless, he repeated it again to-day, though I did not hear him., In the first two places--Chicago and Bloomington I heard him; to-day I did not., He said he had carefully examined that speech,--when, he did not say; but there is no reasonable doubt it was when he was in New York preparing his plan of campaign., I am glad he did read it carefully., He says it was evidently prepared with great care., I freely admit it was prepared with care., I claim not to be more free from errors than others,--perhaps scarcely so much; but I was very careful not to put anything in that speech as a matter of fact, or make any inferences, which did not appear to me to be true and fully warrantable., If I had made any mistake, I was willing to be corrected; if I had drawn any inference in regard to Judge Douglas or any one else which was not warranted, I was fully prepared to modify it as soon as discovered., I planted myself upon the truth and the truth only, so far as I knew it, or could be brought to know it., Having made that speech with the most kindly feelings toward Judge Douglas, as manifested therein, I was gratified when I found that he had carefully examined it, and had detected no error of fact, nor any inference against him, nor any misrepresentations of which he thought fit to complain., In neither of the two speeches I have mentioned did he make any such complaint., I will thank any one who will inform me that he, in his speech to-day, pointed out anything I had stated respecting him as being erroneous., I presume there is no such thing., I have reason to be gratified that the care and caution used in that speech left it so that he, most of all others interested in discovering error, has not been able to point out one thing against him which he could say was wrong., He seizes upon the doctrines he supposes to be included in that speech, and declares that upon them will turn the issues of this campaign., He then quotes, or attempts to quote, from my speech., I will not say that he wilfully misquotes, but he does fail to quote accurately., His attempt at quoting is from a passage which I believe I can quote accurately from memory., I shall make the quotation now, with some comments upon it, as I have already said, in order that the Judge shall be left entirely without excuse for misrepresenting me., I do so now, as I hope, for the last time., I do this in great caution, in order that if he repeats his misrepresentation it shall be plain to all that he does so wilfully., If, after all, he still persists, I shall be compelled to reconstruct the course I have marked out for myself, and draw upon such humble resources, as I have, for a new course, better suited to the real exigencies of the case., I set out in this campaign with the intention of conducting it strictly as a gentleman, in substance at least, if not in the outside polish., The latter I shall never be; but that which constitutes the inside of a gentleman I hope I understand, and am not less inclined to practice than others., It was my purpose and expectation that this canvass would be conducted upon principle, and with fairness on both sides, and it shall not be my fault if this purpose and expectation shall be given up., He charges, in substance, that I invite a war of sections; that I propose all the local institutions of the different States shall become consolidated and uniform., What is there in the language of that speech which expresses such purpose or bears such construction?, I have again and again said that I would not enter into any of the States to disturb the institution of slavery., Judge Douglas said, at Bloomington, that I used language most able and ingenious for concealing what I really meant; and that while I had protested against entering into the slave States, I nevertheless did mean to go on the banks of the Ohio and throw missiles into Kentucky, to disturb them in their domestic institutions., I said in that speech, and I meant no more, that the institution of slavery ought to be placed in the very attitude where the framers of this government placed it and left it., I do not understand that the framers of our Constitution left the people of the free States in the attitude of firing bombs or shells into the slave States., I was not using that passage for the purpose for which he infers I did use it., I said:  ""We are now far advanced into the fifth year since a policy was created for the avowed object and with the confident promise of putting an end to slavery agitation., Under the operation of that policy that agitation has not only not ceased, but has constantly augmented., In my opinion it will not cease till a crisis shall have been reached and passed., 'A house divided against itself cannot stand.', I believe that this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free; it will become all one thing or all the other., Either the opponents of slavery will arrest the further spread of it, and place it where the public mind shall rest in the belief that it is in the course of ultimate extinction, or its advocates will push it forward till it shall become alike lawful in all the States, old as well as new, North as well as South."", Now, you all see, from that quotation, I did not express my wish on anything., In that passage I indicated no wish or purpose of my own; I simply expressed my expectation., Cannot the Judge perceive a distinction between a purpose and an expectation?, I have often expressed an expectation to die, but I have never expressed a wish to die., I said at Chicago, and now repeat, that I am quite aware this government has endured, half slave and half free, for eighty-two years., ...]",3
235,"[It so happens, singularly enough, that I never stood opposed to a decision of the Supreme Court till this, on the contrary, I have no recollection that he was ever particularly in favor of one till this., He never was in favor of any nor opposed to any, till the present one, which helps to nationalize slavery., Free men of Sangamon, free men of Illinois, free men everywhere, judge ye between him and me upon this issue., He says this Dred Scott case is a very small matter at most,--that it has no practical effect; that at best, or rather, I suppose, at worst, it is but an abstraction., I submit that the proposition that the thing which determines whether a man is free or a slave is rather concrete than abstract., I think you would conclude that it was, if your liberty depended upon it, and so would Judge Douglas, if his liberty depended upon it., But suppose it was on the question of spreading slavery over the new Territories that he considers it as being merely an abstract matter, and one of no practical importance., How has the planting of slavery in new countries always been effected?, It has now been decided that slavery cannot be kept out of our new Territories by any legal means., In what do our new Territories now differ in this respect from the old Colonies when slavery was first planted within them?, It was planted, as Mr. Clay once declared, and as history proves true, by individual men, in spite of the wishes of the people; the Mother Government refusing to prohibit it, and withholding from the people of the Colonies the authority to prohibit it for themselves., Mr. Clay says this was one of the great and just causes of complaint against Great Britain by the Colonies, and the best apology we can now make for having the institution amongst us., In that precise condition our Nebraska politicians have at last succeeded in placing our own new Territories; the government will not prohibit slavery within them, nor allow the people to prohibit it., I defy any man to find any difference between the policy which originally planted slavery in these Colonies and that policy which now prevails in our new Territories., If it does not go into them, it is only because no individual wishes it to go., The Judge indulged himself doubtless to-day with the question as to what I am going to do with or about the Dred Scott decision., Well, Judge, will you please tell me what you did about the bank decision?, Will you not graciously allow us to do with the Dred Scott decision precisely as you did with the bank decision?, You succeeded in breaking down the moral effect of that decision: did you find it necessary to amend the Constitution, or to set up a court of negroes in order to do it?, There is one other point., Judge Douglas has a very affectionate leaning toward the Americans and Old Whigs., Last evening, in a sort of weeping tone, he described to us a death-bed scene., He had been called to the side of Mr. Clay, in his last moments, in order that the genius of ""popular sovereignty"" might duly descend from the dying man and settle upon him, the living and most worthy successor., He could do no less than promise that he would devote the remainder of his life to ""popular sovereignty""; and then the great statesman departs in peace., By this part of the ""plan of the campaign"" the Judge has evidently promised himself that tears shall be drawn down the cheeks of all Old Whigs, as large as half-grown apples., Mr. Webster, too, was mentioned; but it did not quite come to a death-bed scene as to him., It would be amusing, if it were not disgusting, to see how quick these compromise-breakers administer on the political effects of their dead adversaries, trumping up claims never before heard of, and dividing the assets among themselves., If I should be found dead to-morrow morning, nothing but my insignificance could prevent a speech being made on my authority, before the end of next week., It so happens that in that ""popular sovereignty"" with which Mr. Clay was identified, the Missouri Compromise was expressly reversed; and it was a little singular if Mr. Clay cast his mantle upon Judge Douglas on purpose to have that compromise repealed., Again, the Judge did not keep faith with Mr. Clay when he first brought in his Nebraska Bill., He left the Missouri Compromise unrepealed, and in his report accompanying the bill he told the world he did it on purpose., The manes of Mr. Clay must have been in great agony till thirty days later, when ""popular sovereignty"" stood forth in all its glory., One more thing., Last night Judge Douglas tormented himself with horrors about my disposition to make negroes perfectly equal with white men in social and political relations., He did not stop to show that I have said any such thing, or that it legitimately follows from anything I have said, but he rushes on with his assertions., I adhere to the Declaration of Independence., If Judge Douglas and his friends are not willing to stand by it, let them come up and amend it., Let them make it read that all men are created equal except negroes., Let us have it decided whether the Declaration of Independence, in this blessed year of 1858, shall be thus amended., In his construction of the Declaration last year, he said it only meant that Americans in America were equal to Englishmen in England., Then, when I pointed out to him that by that rule he excludes the Germans, the Irish, the Portuguese, and all the other people who have come among us since the revolution, he reconstructs his construction., In his last speech he tells us it meant Europeans., I press him a little further, and ask if it meant to include the Russians in Asia; or does he mean to exclude that vast population from the principles of our Declaration of Independence?, I expect ere long he will introduce another amendment to his definition., He is not at all particular., He is satisfied with anything which does not endanger the nationalizing of negro slavery., It may draw white men down, but it must not lift negroes up., Who shall say, ""I am the superior, and you are the inferior""?, My declarations upon this subject of negro slavery may be misrepresented, but cannot be misunderstood., I have said that I do not understand the Declaration to mean that all men were created equal in all respects., They are not our equal in color; but I suppose that it does mean to declare that all men are equal in some respects; they are equal in their right to ""life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."", Certainly the negro is not our equal in color, perhaps not in many other respects; still, in the right to put into his mouth the bread that his own hands have earned, he is the equal of every other man, white or black., In pointing out that more has been given you, you cannot be justified in taking away the little which has been given him., All I ask for the negro is that if you do not like him, let him alone., If God gave him but little, that little let him enjoy., When our government was established we had the institution of slavery among us., We were in a certain sense compelled to tolerate its existence., It was a sort of necessity., We had gone through our struggle and secured our own independence., The framers of the Constitution found the institution of slavery amongst their own institutions at the time., They found that by an effort to eradicate it they might lose much of what they had already gained., They were obliged to bow to the necessity., They gave power to Congress to abolish the slave trade at the end of twenty years., They also prohibited it in the Territories where it did not exist., They did what they could, and yielded to the necessity for the rest., I also yield to all which follows from that necessity., What I would most desire would be the separation of the white and black races., One more point on this Springfield speech which Judge Douglas says he has read so carefully., I expressed my belief in the existence of a conspiracy to perpetuate and nationalize slavery., I did not profess to know it, nor do I now., I showed the part Judge Douglas had played in the string of facts constituting to my mind the proof of that conspiracy., I showed the parts played by others., I charged that the people had been deceived into carrying the last Presidential election, by the impression that the people of the Territories might exclude slavery if they chose, when it was known in advance by the conspirators that the court was to decide that neither Congress nor the people could so exclude slavery., These charges are more distinctly made than anything else in the speech., Judge Douglas has carefully read and reread that speech., He has not, so far as I know, contradicted those charges., In the two speeches which I heard he certainly did not., On this own tacit admission, I renew that charge., I charge him with having been a party to that conspiracy and to that deception for the sole purpose of nationalizing slavery., Will it be agreeable to you to make an arrangement for you and myself to divide time, and address the same audiences the present canvass?, Mr. Judd, who will hand you this, is authorized to receive your answer; and, if agreeable to you, to enter into the terms of such arrangement., Yours of yesterday, naming places, times, and terms for joint discussions between us, was received this morning., Although, by the terms, as you propose, you take four openings and closes, to my three, I accede, and thus close the arrangement., I direct this to you at Hillsborough, and shall try to have both your letter and this appear in the Journal and Register of Monday morning., When a man hears himself somewhat misrepresented, it provokes him, at least, I find it so with myself; but when misrepresentation becomes very gross and palpable, it is more apt to amuse him., The first thing I see fit to notice is the fact that Judge Douglas alleges, after running through the history of the old Democratic and the old Whig parties, that Judge Trumbull and myself made an arrangement in 1854, by which I was to have the place of General Shields in the United States Senate, and Judge Trumbull was to have the place of Judge Douglas., Now, all I have to say upon that subject is that I think no man not even Judge Douglas can prove it, because it is not true., I have no doubt he is ""conscientious"" in saying it., As to those resolutions that he took such a length of time to read, as being the platform of the Republican party in 1854, I say I never had anything to do with them, and I think Trumbull never had., Judge Douglas cannot show that either of us ever did have anything to do with them., I believe this is true about those resolutions: There was a call for a convention to form a Republican party at Springfield, and I think that my friend Mr. Lovejoy, who is here upon this stand, had a hand in it., I think this is true, and I think if he will remember accurately he will be able to recollect that he tried to get me into it, and I would not go in., I believe it is also true that I went away from Springfield when the convention was in session, to attend court in Tazewell county., It is true they did place my name, though without authority, upon the committee, and afterward wrote me to attend the meeting of the committee; but I refused to do so, and I never had anything to do with that organization., This is the plain truth about all that matter of the resolutions., Now, about this story that Judge Douglas tells of Trumbull bargaining to sell out the old Democratic party, and Lincoln agreeing to sell out the old Whig party, I have the means of knowing about that: Judge Douglas cannot have; and I know there is no substance to it whatever., Yet I have no doubt he is ""conscientious"" about it., I know that after Mr. Lovejoy got into the Legislature that winter, he complained of me that I had told all the old Whigs of his district that the old Whig party was good enough for them, and some of them voted against him because I told them so., Now, I have no means of totally disproving such charges as this which the Judge makes., A man cannot prove a negative; but he has a right to claim that when a man makes an affirmative charge, he must offer some proof to show the truth of what he says., ...]",3
236,"[I leave it to you to say whether, in the history of our government, this institution of slavery has not always failed to be a bond of union, and, on the contrary, been an apple of discord and an element of division in the house., I ask you to consider whether, so long as the moral constitution of men's minds shall continue to be the same, after this generation and assemblage shall sink into the grave, and another race shall arise, with the same moral and intellectual development we have, whether, if that institution is standing in the same irritating position in which it now is, it will not continue an element of division?, If so, then I have a right to say that, in regard to this question, the Union is a house divided against itself; and when the Judge reminds me that I have often said to him that the institution of slavery has existed for eighty years in some States, and yet it does not exist in some others, I agree to the fact, and I account for it by looking at the position in which our fathers originally placed it--restricting it from the new Territories where it had not gone, and legislating to cut off its source by the abrogation of the slave trade, thus putting the seal of legislation against its spread., The public mind did rest in the belief that it was in the course of ultimate extinction., But lately, I think--and in this I charge nothing on the Judge's motives--lately, I think that he, and those acting with him, have placed that institution on a new basis, which looks to the perpetuity and nationalization of slavery., And while it is placed upon this new basis, I say, and I have said, that I believe we shall not have peace upon the question until the opponents of slavery arrest the further spread of it, and place it where the public mind shall rest in the belief that it is in the course of ultimate extinction; or, on the other hand, that its advocates will push it forward until it shall become alike lawful in all the States, old as well as new, North as well as South., Now, I believe if we could arrest the spread, and place it where Washington and Jefferson and Madison placed it, it would be in the course of ultimate extinction, and the public mind would, as for eighty years past, believe that it was in the course of ultimate extinction., The crisis would be past, and the institution might be let alone for a hundred years, if it should live so long, in the States where it exists; yet it would be going out of existence in the way best for both the black and the white races., Well, then, let us talk about popular sovereignty!, what is popular sovereignty?, Is it the right of the people to have slavery or not have it, as they see fit, in the Territories?, I will state--and I have an able man to watch me--my understanding is that popular sovereignty, as now applied to the question of slavery, does allow the people of a Territory to have slavery if they want to, but does not allow them not to have it if they do not want it., I do not mean that if this vast concourse of people were in a Territory of the United States, any one of them would be obliged to have a slave if he did not want one; but I do say that, as I understand the Dred Scott decision, if any one man wants slaves, all the rest have no way of keeping that one man from holding them., When I made my speech at Springfield, of which the Judge complains, and from which he quotes, I really was not thinking of the things which he ascribes to me at all., I had no thought in the world that I was doing anything to bring about a war between the free and slave states., I had no thought in the world that I was doing anything to bring about a political and social equality of the black and white races., It never occurred to me that I was doing anything or favoring anything to reduce to a dead uniformity all the local institutions of the various States., But I must say, in all fairness to him, if he thinks I am doing something which leads to these bad results, it is none the better that I did not mean it., It is just as fatal to the country, if I have any influence in producing it, whether I intend it or not., But can it be true that placing this institution upon the original basis--the basis upon which our fathers placed it--can have any tendency to set the Northern and the Southern States at war with one another, or that it can have any tendency to make the people of Vermont raise sugar-cane, because they raise it in Louisiana, or that it can compel the people of Illinois to cut pine logs on the Grand Prairie, where they will not grow, because they cut pine logs in Maine, where they do grow?, The Judge says this is a new principle started in regard to this question., Does the Judge claim that he is working on the plan of the founders of government?, I think he says in some of his speeches indeed, I have one here now--that he saw evidence of a policy to allow slavery to be south of a certain line, while north of it it should be excluded, and he saw an indisposition on the part of the country to stand upon that policy, and therefore he set about studying the subject upon original principles, and upon original principles he got up the Nebraska Bill!, I am fighting it upon these ""original principles,"" fighting it in the Jeffersonian, Washingtonian, and Madisonian fashion., Now, my friends, I wish you to attend for a little while to one or two other things in that Springfield speech., My main object was to show, so far as my humble ability was capable of showing, to the people of this country what I believed was the truth,--that there was a tendency, if not a conspiracy, among those who have engineered this slavery question for the last four or five years, to make slavery perpetual and universal in this nation., Having made that speech principally for that object, after arranging the evidences that I thought tended to prove my proposition, I concluded with this bit of comment:  ""We cannot absolutely know that these exact adaptations are the result of preconcert; but when we see a lot of framed timbers, different portions of which we know have been gotten out at different times and places, and by different workmen--Stephen, Franklin, Roger, and James, for instance,--and when we see these timbers joined together, and see they exactly make the frame of a house or a mill, all the tenons and mortises exactly fitting, and all the lengths and proportions of the different pieces exactly adapted to their respective places, and not a piece too many or too few,--not omitting even the scaffolding,--or if a single piece be lacking, we see the place in the frame exactly fitted and prepared yet to bring such piece in,--in such a case we feel it impossible not to believe that Stephen and Franklin and Roger and James all understood one another from the beginning, and all worked upon a common plan or draft drawn before the first blow was struck."", When my friend Judge Douglas came to Chicago on the 9th of July, this speech having been delivered on the 16th of June, he made an harangue there, in which he took hold of this speech of mine, showing that he had carefully read it; and while he paid no attention to this matter at all, but complimented me as being a ""kind, amiable, and intelligent gentleman,"" notwithstanding I had said this, he goes on and eliminates, or draws out, from my speech this tendency of mine to set the States at war with one another, to make all the institutions uniform, and set the niggers and white people to marrying together., Then, as the Judge had complimented me with these pleasant titles (I must confess to my weakness), I was a little ""taken,"" for it came from a great man., I was not very much accustomed to flattery, and it came the sweeter to me., I was rather like the Hoosier, with the gingerbread, when he said he reckoned he loved it better than any other man, and got less of it., As the Judge had so flattered me, I could not make up my mind that he meant to deal unfairly with me; so I went to work to show him that he misunderstood the whole scope of my speech, and that I really never intended to set the people at war with one another., As an illustration, the next time I met him, which was at Springfield, I used this expression, that I claimed no right under the Constitution, nor had I any inclination, to enter into the slave States and interfere with the institutions of slavery., He says upon that: Lincoln will not enter into the slave States, but will go to the banks of the Ohio, on this side, and shoot over!, He runs on, step by step, in the horse-chestnut style of argument, until in the Springfield speech he says: ""Unless he shall be successful in firing his batteries until he shall have extinguished slavery in all the States the Union shall be dissolved."", Now, I don't think that was exactly the way to treat ""a kind, amiable, intelligent gentleman."", I know if I had asked the Judge to show when or where it was I had said that, if I didn't succeed in firing into the slave States until slavery should be extinguished, the Union should be dissolved, he could not have shown it., I understand what he would do., He would say: I don't mean to quote from you, but this was the result of what you say., But I have the right to ask, and I do ask now, Did you not put it in such a form that an ordinary reader or listener would take it as an expression from me?, In a speech at Springfield, on the night of the 17th, I thought I might as well attend to my own business a little, and I recalled his attention as well as I could to this charge of conspiracy to nationalize slavery., I called his attention to the fact that he had acknowledged in my hearing twice that he had carefully read the speech, and, in the language of the lawyers, as he had twice read the speech, and still had put in no plea or answer, I took a default on him., I insisted that I had a right then to renew that charge of conspiracy., Ten days afterward I met the Judge at Clinton,--that is to say, I was on the ground, but not in the discussion,--and heard him make a speech., Then he comes in with his plea to this charge, for the first time; and his plea when put in, as well as I can recollect it, amounted to this: that he never had any talk with Judge Taney or the President of the United States with regard to the Dred Scott decision before it was made., I (Lincoln) ought to know that the man who makes a charge without knowing it to be true falsifies as much as he who knowingly tells a falsehood; and, lastly, that he would pronounce the whole thing a falsehood; but, he would make no personal application of the charge of falsehood, not because of any regard for the ""kind, amiable, intelligent gentleman,"" but because of his own personal self-respect!, I have understood since then (but [turning to Judge Douglas] will not hold the Judge to it if he is not willing) that he has broken through the ""self-respect,"" and has got to saying the thing out., The Judge nods to me that it is so., It is fortunate for me that I can keep as good-humored as I do, when the Judge acknowledges that he has been trying to make a question of veracity with me., I know the Judge is a great man, while I am only a small man, but I feel that I have got him., I demur to that plea., I waive all objections that it was not filed till after default was taken, and demur to it upon the merits., What if Judge Douglas never did talk with Chief Justice Taney and the President before the Dred Scott decision was made, does it follow that he could not have had as perfect an understanding without talking as with it?, I am not disposed to stand upon my legal advantage., I am disposed to take his denial as being like an answer in chancery, that he neither had any knowledge, information, or belief in the existence of such a conspiracy., I am disposed to take his answer as being as broad as though he had put it in these words., And now, I ask, even if he had done so, have not I a right to prove it on him, and to offer the evidence of more than two witnesses, by whom to prove it; and if the evidence proves the existence of the conspiracy, does his broader answer denying all knowledge, information, or belief, disturb the fact?, It can only show that he was used by conspirators, and was not a leader of them., Now, in regard to his reminding me of the moral rule that persons who tell what they do not know to be true falsify as much as those who knowingly tell falsehoods., I remember the rule, and it must be borne in mind that in what I have read to you, I do not say that I know such a conspiracy to exist., To that I reply, I believe it., If the Judge says that I do not believe it, then he says what he does not know, and falls within his own rule, that he who asserts a thing which he does not know to be true, falsifies as much as he who knowingly tells a falsehood., I want to call your attention to a little discussion on that branch of the case, and the evidence which brought my mind to the conclusion which I expressed as my belief., If, in arraying that evidence I had stated anything which was false or erroneous, it needed but that Judge Douglas should point it out, and I would have taken it back, with all the kindness in the world., I do not deal in that way., If I have brought forward anything not a fact, if he will point it out, it will not even ruffle me to take it back., But if he will not point out anything erroneous in the evidence, is it not rather for him to show, by a comparison of the evidence, that I have reasoned falsely, than to call the ""kind, amiable, intelligent gentleman"" a liar?, If I have reasoned to a false conclusion, it is the vocation of an able debater to show by argument that I have wandered to an erroneous conclusion., I want to ask your attention to a portion of the Nebraska Bill, which Judge Douglas has quoted:  Thereupon Judge Douglas and others began to argue in favor of ""popular sovereignty,"" the right of the people to have slaves if they wanted them, and to exclude slavery if they did not want them., ""But,"" said, in substance, a Senator from Ohio (Mr. Chase, I believe), ""we more than suspect that you do not mean to allow the people to exclude slavery if they wish to; and if you do mean it, accept an amendment which I propose, expressly authorizing the people to exclude slavery."", I believe I have the amendment here before me, which was offered, and under which the people of the Territory, through their representatives, might, if they saw fit, prohibit the existence of slavery therein., And now I state it as a fact, to be taken back if there is any mistake about it, that Judge Douglas and those acting with him voted that amendment down., I now think that those men who voted it down had a real reason for doing so., They know what that reason was., It looks to us, since we have seen the Dred Scott decision pronounced, holding that ""under the Constitution"" the people cannot exclude slavery, I say it looks to outsiders, poor, simple, ""amiable, intelligent gentlemen,"" as though the niche was left as a place to put that Dred Scott decision in,--a niche which would have been spoiled by adopting the amendment., And now, I say again, if this was not the reason, it will avail the Judge much more to calmly and good-humoredly point out to these people what that other reason was for voting the amendment down, than, swelling himself up, to vociferate that he may be provoked to call somebody a liar., Again: There is in that same quotation from the Nebraska Bill this clause: ""It being the true intent and meaning of this bill not to legislate slavery into any Territory or State."", I have always been puzzled to know what business the word ""State"" had in that connection., Judge Douglas knows., He put it there., He knows what he put it there for., We outsiders cannot say what he put it there for., The law they were passing was not about States, and was not making provisions for States., What was it placed there for?, After seeing the Dred Scott decision, which holds that the people cannot exclude slavery from a Territory, if another Dred Scott decision shall come, holding that they cannot exclude it from a State, we shall discover that when the word was originally put there, it was in view of something which was to come in due time, we shall see that it was the other half of something., I now say again, if there is any different reason for putting it there, Judge Douglas, in a good-humored way, without calling anybody a liar, can tell what the reason was., When the Judge spoke at Clinton, he came very near making a charge of falsehood against me., He used, as I found it printed in a newspaper, which, I remember, was very nearly like the real speech, the following language: I confess this is rather a curious view, that out of respect for me he should consider I was making what I deemed rather a grave charge in fun., I confess it strikes me rather strangely., But I let it pass., As the Judge did not for a moment believe that there was a man in America whose heart was so ""corrupt"" as to make such a charge, and as he places me among the ""men in America"" who have hearts base enough to make such a charge, I hope he will excuse me if I hunt out another charge very like this; and if it should turn out that in hunting I should find that other, and it should turn out to be Judge Douglas himself who made it, I hope he will reconsider this question of the deep corruption of heart he has thought fit to ascribe to me., In Judge Douglas's speech of March 22, 1858, which I hold in my hand, he says: This is a part of the speech., You must excuse me from reading the entire article of the Washington Union, as Mr. Stuart read it for Mr. Douglas., The Judge goes on and sums up, as I think, correctly:  And a column nearly of the same sort., Then, when you come to look into the Lecompton Constitution, you find the same doctrine incorporated in it which was put forth editorially in the Union., What is it?, Then in the schedule is a provision that the Constitution may be amended after 1864 by a two-thirds vote:  I pass over some portions of the speech, and I hope that any one who feels interested in this matter will read the entire section of the speech, and see whether I do the Judge injustice., He proceeds:  I stop the quotation there, again requesting that it may all be read., I have read all of the portion I desire to comment upon., What is this charge that the Judge thinks I must have a very corrupt heart to make?, ...]",3
237,"[In my speech of an hour and a half, I attended to some other parts of his speech, and incidentally, as I thought, intimated to him that I would answer the rest of his interrogatories on condition only that he should agree to answer as many for me., He made no intimation at the time of the proposition, nor did he in his reply allude at all to that suggestion of mine., I do him no injustice in saying that he occupied at least half of his reply in dealing with me as though I had refused to answer his interrogatories., I now propose that I will answer any of the interrogatories, upon condition that he will answer questions from me not exceeding the same number., I give him an opportunity to respond., The Judge remains silent., I now say that I will answer his interrogatories, whether he answers mine or not; and that after I have done so, I shall propound mine to him., I have supposed myself, since the organization of the Republican party at Bloomington, in May, 1856, bound as a party man by the platforms of the party, then and since., If in any interrogatories which I shall answer I go beyond the scope of what is within these platforms, it will be perceived that no one is responsible but myself., Having said thus much, I will take up the Judge's interrogatories as I find them printed in the Chicago Times, and answer them seriatim., In order that there may be no mistake about it, I have copied the interrogatories in writing, and also my answers to them., The first one of these interrogatories is in these words:  Question 1.--""I desire to know whether Lincoln to-day stands, as he did in 1854, in favor of the unconditional repeal of the Fugitive Slave law?"", Answer:--I do not now, nor ever did, stand in favor of the unconditional repeal of the Fugitive Slave law., Q., 2.--""I desire him to answer whether he stands pledged to-day, as he did in 1854, against the admission of any more slave States into the Union, even if the people want them?"", Answer:--I do not now, nor ever did, stand pledged against the admission of any more slave States into the Union., Q., 3.--""I want to know whether he stands pledged against the admission of a new State into the Union with such a constitution as the people of that State may see fit to make?"", Answer:--I do not stand pledged against the admission of a new State into the Union, with such a constitution as the people of that State may see fit to make., Q., 4.--""I want to know whether he stands to-day pledged to the abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia?"", Answer:--I do not stand to-day pledged to the abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia., Q., 5.--""I desire him to answer whether he stands pledged to the prohibition of the slave-trade between the different States?"", Answer:--I do not stand pledged to the prohibition of the slave-trade between the different States., Q., 6.--""I desire to know whether he stands pledged to prohibit slavery in all the Territories of the United States, north as well as south of the Missouri Compromise line?"", Answer:--I am impliedly, if not expressly, pledged to a belief in the right and duty of Congress to prohibit slavery in all the United States 'Territories., Q., 7.--""I desire him to answer whether he is opposed to the acquisition of any new territory unless slavery is first prohibited therein?"", Answer:--I am not generally opposed to honest acquisition of territory; and, in any given case, I would or would not oppose such acquisition, accordingly as I might think such acquisition would or would not aggravate the slavery question among ourselves., Now, my friends, it will be perceived, upon an examination of these questions and answers, that so far I have only answered that I was not pledged to this, that, or the other., The Judge has not framed his interrogatories to ask me anything more than this, and I have answered in strict accordance with the interrogatories, and have answered truly, that I am not pledged at all upon any of the points to which I have answered., But I am not disposed to hang upon the exact form of his interrogatory., I am rather disposed to take up at least some of these questions, and state what I really think upon them., As to the first one, in regard to the Fugitive Slave law, I have never hesitated to say, and I do not now hesitate to say, that I think, under the Constitution of the United States, the people of the Southern States are entitled to a Congressional Fugitive Slave law., Having said that, I have had nothing to say in regard to the existing Fugitive Slave law, further than that I think it should have been framed so as to be free from some of the objections that pertain to it, without lessening its efficiency., And inasmuch as we are not now in an agitation in regard to an alteration or modification of that law, I would not be the man to introduce it as a new subject of agitation upon the general question of slavery., In regard to the other question, of whether I am pledged to the admission of any more slave States into the Union, I state to you very frankly that I would be exceedingly sorry ever to be put in a position of having to pass upon that question., I should be exceedingly glad to know that there would never be another slave State admitted into the Union; but I must add that if slavery shall be kept out of the Territories during the territorial existence of any one given Territory, and then the people shall, having a fair chance and a clear field, when they come to adopt the constitution, do such an extraordinary thing as to adopt a slave constitution, uninfluenced by the actual presence of the institution among them, I see no alternative, if we own the country, but to admit them into the Union., The third interrogatory is answered by the answer to the second, it being, as I conceive, the same as the second., The fourth one is in regard to the abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia., In relation to that, I have my mind very distinctly made up., I should be exceedingly glad to see slavery abolished in the District of Columbia., I believe that Congress possesses the constitutional power to abolish it., Yet as a member of Congress, I should not, with my present views, be in favor of endeavoring to abolish slavery in the District of Columbia, unless it would be upon these conditions: First, that the abolition should be gradual; second, that it should be on a vote of the majority of qualified voters in the District; and third, that compensation should be made to unwilling owners., With these three conditions, I confess I would be exceedingly glad to see Congress abolish slavery in the District of Columbia, and, in the language of Henry Clay, ""sweep from our capital that foul blot upon our nation."", In regard to the fifth interrogatory, I must say here that, as to the question of the abolition of the slave-trade between the different States, I can truly answer, as I have, that I am pledged to nothing about it., It is a subject to which I have not given that mature consideration that would make me feel authorized to state a position so as to hold myself entirely bound by it., In other words, that question has never been prominently enough before me to induce me to investigate whether we really have the constitutional power to do it., I could investigate it if I had sufficient time to bring myself to a conclusion upon that subject; but I have not done so, and I say so frankly to you here, and to Judge Douglas., I must say, however, that if I should be of opinion that Congress does possess the constitutional power to abolish the slave-trade among the different States, I should still not be in favor of the exercise of that power, unless upon some conservative principle as I conceive it, akin to what I have said in relation to the abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia., My answer as to whether I desire that slavery should be prohibited in all the Territories of the United States is full and explicit within itself, and cannot be made clearer by any comments of mine., So I suppose in regard to the question whether I am opposed to the acquisition of any more territory unless slavery is first prohibited therein, my answer is such that I could add nothing by way of illustration, or making myself better understood, than the answer which I have placed in writing., Now in all this the Judge has me, and he has me on the record., I suppose he had flattered himself that I was really entertaining one set of opinions for one place, and another set for another place; that I was afraid to say at one place what I uttered at another., What I am saying here I suppose I say to a vast audience as strongly tending to Abolitionism as any audience in the State of Illinois, and I believe I am saying that which, if it would be offensive to any persons and render them enemies to myself, would be offensive to persons in this audience., I now proceed to propound to the Judge the interrogatories, so far as I have framed them., I will bring forward a new installment when I get them ready., I will bring them forward now only reaching to number four., The first one is:  Question 1.--If the people of Kansas shall, by means entirely unobjectionable in all other respects, adopt a State constitution, and ask admission into the Union under it, before they have the requisite number of inhabitants according to the English bill,--some ninety-three thousand,--will you vote to admit them?, Q., 2.--Can the people of a United States Territory, in any lawful way, against the wish of any citizen of the United States, exclude slavery from its limits prior to the formation of a State constitution?, Q., 3., If the Supreme Court of the United States shall decide that States cannot exclude slavery from their limits, are you in favor of acquiescing in, adopting, and following such decision as a rule of political action?, Q., 4., Are you in favor of acquiring additional territory, in disregard of how such acquisition may affect the nation on the slavery question?, As introductory to these interrogatories which Judge Douglas propounded to me at Ottawa, he read a set of resolutions which he said Judge Trumbull and myself had participated in adopting, in the first Republican State Convention, held at Springfield in October, 1854., He insisted that I and Judge Trumbull, and perhaps the entire Republican party, were responsible for the doctrines contained in the set of resolutions which he read, and I understand that it was from that set of resolutions that he deduced the interrogatories which he propounded to me, using these resolutions as a sort of authority for propounding those questions to me., Now, I say here to-day that I do not answer his interrogatories because of their springing at all from that set of resolutions which he read., I answered them because Judge Douglas thought fit to ask them., I do not now, nor ever did, recognize any responsibility upon myself in that set of resolutions., When I replied to him on that occasion, I assured him that I never had anything to do with them., I repeat here to today that I never in any possible form had anything to do with that set of resolutions It turns out, I believe, that those resolutions were never passed in any convention held in Springfield., It turns out that they were never passed at any convention or any public meeting that I had any part in., I believe it turns out, in addition to all this, that there was not, in the fall of 1854, any convention holding a session in Springfield, calling itself a Republican State Convention; yet it is true there was a convention, or assemblage of men calling themselves a convention, at Springfield, that did pass some resolutions., But so little did I really know of the proceedings of that convention, or what set of resolutions they had passed, though having a general knowledge that there had been such an assemblage of men there, that when Judge Douglas read the resolutions, I really did not know but they had been the resolutions passed then and there., I did not question that they were the resolutions adopted., For I could not bring myself to suppose that Judge Douglas could say what he did upon this subject without knowing that it was true., I contented myself, on that occasion, with denying, as I truly could, all connection with them, not denying or affirming whether they were passed at Springfield., Now, it turns out that he had got hold of some resolutions passed at some convention or public meeting in Kane County., I wish to say here, that I don't conceive that in any fair and just mind this discovery relieves me at all., I had just as much to do with the convention in Kane County as that at Springfield., I am as much responsible for the resolutions at Kane County as those at Springfield,--the amount of the responsibility being exactly nothing in either case; no more than there would be in regard to a set of resolutions passed in the moon., I allude to this extraordinary matter in this canvass for some further purpose than anything yet advanced., Judge Douglas did not make his statement upon that occasion as matters that he believed to be true, but he stated them roundly as being true, in such form as to pledge his veracity for their truth., When the whole matter turns out as it does, and when we consider who Judge Douglas is, that he is a distinguished Senator of the United States; that he has served nearly twelve years as such; that his character is not at all limited as an ordinary Senator of the United States, but that his name has become of world-wide renown,--it is most extraordinary that he should so far forget all the suggestions of justice to an adversary, or of prudence to himself, as to venture upon the assertion of that which the slightest investigation would have shown him to be wholly false., I can only account for his having done so upon the supposition that that evil genius which has attended him through his life, giving to him an apparent astonishing prosperity, such as to lead very many good men to doubt there being any advantage in virtue over vice,--I say I can only account for it on the supposition that that evil genius has as last made up its mind to forsake him., And I may add that another extraordinary feature of the Judge's conduct in this canvass--made more extraordinary by this incident--is, that he is in the habit, in almost all the speeches he makes, of charging falsehood upon his adversaries, myself and others., I now ask whether he is able to find in anything that Judge Trumbull, for instance, has said, or in anything that I have said, a justification at all compared with what we have, in this instance, for that sort of vulgarity., I have been in the habit of charging as a matter of belief on my part that, in the introduction of the Nebraska Bill into Congress, there was a conspiracy to make slavery perpetual and national., I have arranged from time to time the evidence which establishes and proves the truth of this charge., I recurred to this charge at Ottawa., I shall not now have time to dwell upon it at very great length; but inasmuch as Judge Douglas, in his reply of half an hour, made some points upon me in relation to it, I propose noticing a few of them., The Judge insists that, in the first speech I made, in which I very distinctly made that charge, he thought for a good while I was in fun!, that I was playful; that I was not sincere about it; and that he only grew angry and somewhat excited when he found that I insisted upon it as a matter of earnestness., He says he characterized it as a falsehood so far as I implicated his moral character in that transaction., Well, I did not know, till he presented that view, that I had implicated his moral character., ...]",3
238,"[The people in the north end of the State were for stronger measures of opposition than we of the central and southern portions of the State, but we were all opposed to the Nebraska doctrine., We had that one feeling and that one sentiment in common., You at the north end met in your conventions and passed your resolutions., We in the middle of the State and farther south did not hold such conventions and pass the same resolutions, although we had in general a common view and a common sentiment., So that these meetings which the Judge has alluded to, and the resolutions he has read from, were local, and did not spread over the whole State., We at last met together in 1886, from all parts of the State, and we agreed upon a common platform., You, who held more extreme notions, either yielded those notions, or, if not wholly yielding them, agreed to yield them practically, for the sake of embodying the opposition to the measures which the opposite party were pushing forward at that time., We met you then, and if there was anything yielded, it was for practical purposes., We agreed then upon a platform for the party throughout the entire State of Illinois, and now we are all bound, as a party, to that platform., And I say here to you, if any one expects of me--in case of my election--that I will do anything not signified by our Republican platform and my answers here to-day, I tell you very frankly that person will be deceived., I do not ask for the vote of any one who supposes that I have secret purposes or pledges that I dare not speak out., Cannot the Judge be satisfied?, If he fears, in the unfortunate case of my election, that my going to Washington will enable me to advocate sentiments contrary to those which I expressed when you voted for and elected me, I assure him that his fears are wholly needless and groundless., Is the Judge really afraid of any such thing?, I'll tell you what he is afraid of., He is afraid we'll all pull together., This is what alarms him more than anything else., For my part, I do hope that all of us, entertaining a common sentiment in opposition to what appears to us a design to nationalize and perpetuate slavery, will waive minor differences on questions which either belong to the dead past or the distant future, and all pull together in this struggle., What are your sentiments?, If it be true that on the ground which I occupy--ground which I occupy as frankly and boldly as Judge Douglas does his,--my views, though partly coinciding with yours, are not as perfectly in accordance with your feelings as his are, I do say to you in all candor, go for him, and not for me., I hope to deal in all things fairly with Judge Douglas, and with the people of the State, in this contest., And if I should never be elected to any office, I trust I may go down with no stain of falsehood upon my reputation, notwithstanding the hard opinions Judge Douglas chooses to entertain of me., The Judge has again addressed himself to the Abolition tendencies of a speech of mine made at Springfield in June last., I have so often tried to answer what he is always saying on that melancholy theme that I almost turn with disgust from the discussion,--from the repetition of an answer to it., I trust that nearly all of this intelligent audience have read that speech., If you have, I may venture to leave it to you to inspect it closely, and see whether it contains any of those ""bugaboos"" which frighten Judge Douglas., The Judge complains that I did not fully answer his questions., If I have the sense to comprehend and answer those questions, I have done so fairly., If it can be pointed out to me how I can more fully and fairly answer him, I aver I have not the sense to see how it is to be done., He says I do not declare I would in any event vote for the admission of a slave State into the Union., If I have been fairly reported, he will see that I did give an explicit answer to his interrogatories; I did not merely say that I would dislike to be put to the test, but I said clearly, if I were put to the test, and a Territory from which slavery had been excluded should present herself with a State constitution sanctioning slavery,--a most extraordinary thing, and wholly unlikely to happen,--I did not see how I could avoid voting for her admission., But he refuses to understand that I said so, and he wants this audience to understand that I did not say so., Yet it will be so reported in the printed speech that he cannot help seeing it., He says if I should vote for the admission of a slave State I would be voting for a dissolution of the Union, because I hold that the Union cannot permanently exist half slave and half free., I repeat that I do not believe this government can endure permanently half slave and half free; yet I do not admit, nor does it at all follow, that the admission of a single slave State will permanently fix the character and establish this as a universal slave nation., The Judge is very happy indeed at working up these quibbles., Before leaving the subject of answering questions, I aver as my confident belief, when you come to see our speeches in print, that you will find every question which he has asked me more fairly and boldly and fully answered than he has answered those which I put to him., Is not that so?, The two speeches may be placed side by side, and I will venture to leave it to impartial judges whether his questions have not been more directly and circumstantially answered than mine., Judge Douglas says he made a charge upon the editor of the Washington Union, alone, of entertaining a purpose to rob the States of their power to exclude slavery from their limits., I undertake to say, and I make the direct issue, that he did not make his charge against the editor of the Union alone., I will undertake to prove by the record here that he made that charge against more and higher dignitaries than the editor of the Washington Union., I am quite aware that he was shirking and dodging around the form in which he put it, but I can make it manifest that he leveled his ""fatal blow"" against more persons than this Washington editor., Will he dodge it now by alleging that I am trying to defend Mr. Buchanan against the charge?, Not at all., Am I not making the same charge myself?, I am trying to show that you, Judge Douglas, are a witness on my side., I am not defending Buchanan, and I will tell Judge Douglas that in my opinion, when he made that charge, he had an eye farther north than he has to-day., He was then fighting against people who called him a Black Republican and an Abolitionist., It is mixed all through his speech, and it is tolerably manifest that his eye was a great deal farther north than it is to-day., The Judge says that though he made this charge, Toombs got up and declared there was not a man in the United States, except the editor of the Union, who was in favor of the doctrines put forth in that article., And thereupon I understand that the Judge withdrew the charge., Although he had taken extracts from the newspaper, and then from the Lecompton Constitution, to show the existence of a conspiracy to bring about a ""fatal blow,"" by which the States were to be deprived of the right of excluding slavery, it all went to pot as soon as Toombs got up and told him it was not true., It reminds me of the story that John Phoenix, the California railroad surveyor, tells., He says they started out from the Plaza to the Mission of Dolores., They had two ways of determining distances., One was by a chain and pins taken over the ground., The other was by a ""go-it-ometer,""--an invention of his own,--a three-legged instrument, with which he computed a series of triangles between the points., At night he turned to the chain-man to ascertain what distance they had come, and found that by some mistake he had merely dragged the chain over the ground, without keeping any record., By the ""go-it-ometer,"" he found he had made ten miles., Being skeptical about this, he asked a drayman who was passing how far it was to the Plaza., The drayman replied it was just half a mile; and the surveyor put it down in his book,--just as Judge Douglas says, after he had made his calculations and computations, he took Toombs's statement., I have no doubt that after Judge Douglas had made his charge, he was as easily satisfied about its truth as the surveyor was of the drayman's statement of the distance to the Plaza., Yet it is a fact that the man who put forth all that matter which Douglas deemed a ""fatal blow"" at State sovereignty was elected by the Democrats as public printer., Now, gentlemen, you may take Judge Douglas's speech of March 22, 1858, beginning about the middle of page 21, and reading to the bottom of page 24, and you will find the evidence on which I say that he did not make his charge against the editor of the Union alone., I cannot stop to read it, but I will give it to the reporters., Judge Douglas said:  Remember that this article was published in the Union on the 17th of November, and on the 18th appeared the first article giving the adhesion of the Union to the Lecompton Constitution., It was in these words:  I ask him if all this fuss was made over the editor of this newspaper., It would be a terribly ""fatal blow"" indeed which a single man could strike, when no President, no Cabinet officer, no member of Congress, was giving strength and efficiency to the movement., Out of respect to Judge Douglas's good sense I must believe he did n't manufacture his idea of the ""fatal"" character of that blow out of such a miserable scapegrace as he represents that editor to be., But the Judge's eye is farther south now., Then, it was very peculiarly and decidedly north., His hope rested on the idea of visiting the great ""Black Republican"" party, and making it the tail of his new kite., He knows he was then expecting from day to day to turn Republican, and place himself at the head of our organization., He has found that these despised ""Black Republicans"" estimate him by a standard which he has taught them none too well., Hence he is crawling back into his old camp, and you will find him eventually installed in full fellowship among those whom he was then battling, and with whom he now pretends to be at such fearful variance., There is very much in the principles that Judge Douglas has here enunciated that I most cordially approve, and over which I shall have no controversy with him., In so far as he has insisted that all the States have the right to do exactly as they please about all their domestic relations, including that of slavery, I agree entirely with him., He places me wrong in spite of all I can tell him, though I repeat it again and again, insisting that I have no difference with him upon this subject., I have made a great many speeches, some of which have been printed, and it will be utterly impossible for him to find anything that I have ever put in print contrary to what I now say upon this subject., I hold myself under constitutional obligations to allow the people in all the States, without interference, direct or indirect, to do exactly as they please; and I deny that I have any inclination to interfere with them, even if there were no such constitutional obligation., I can only say again that I am placed improperly--altogether improperly, in spite of all I can say--when it is insisted that I entertain any other view or purposes in regard to that matter., While I am upon this subject, I will make some answers briefly to certain propositions that Judge Douglas has put., He says, ""Why can't this Union endure permanently half slave and half free?"", I have said that I supposed it could not, and I will try, before this new audience, to give briefly some of the reasons for entertaining that opinion., Another form of his question is, ""Why can't we let it stand as our fathers placed it?"", That is the exact difficulty between us., I say that Judge Douglas and his friends have changed it from the position in which our fathers originally placed it., I say, in the way our father's originally left the slavery question, the institution was in the course of ultimate extinction, and the public mind rested in the belief that it was in the course of ultimate extinction., I say when this government was first established it was the policy of its founders to prohibit the spread of slavery into the new Territories of the United States, where it had not existed., But Judge Douglas and his friends have broken up that policy, and placed it upon a new basis, by which it is to become national and perpetual., All I have asked or desired anywhere is that it should be placed back again upon the basis that the fathers of our government originally placed it upon., I have no doubt that it would become extinct, for all time to come, if we but readopted the policy of the fathers, by restricting it to the limits it has already covered, restricting it from the new Territories., I do not wish to dwell at great length on this branch of the subject at this time, but allow me to repeat one thing that I have stated before., Brooks--the man who assaulted Senator Sumner on the floor of the Senate, and who was complimented with dinners, and silver pitchers, and gold-headed canes, and a good many other things for that feat--in one of his speeches declared that when this government was originally established, nobody expected that the institution of slavery would last until this day., That was but the opinion of one man, but it was such an opinion as we can never get from Judge Douglas or anybody in favor of slavery, in the North, at all., You can sometimes get it from a Southern man., He said at the same time that the framers of our government did not have the knowledge that experience has taught us; that experience and the invention of the cotton-gin have taught us that the perpetuation of slavery is a necessity., He insisted, therefore, upon its being changed from the basis upon which the fathers of the government left it to the basis of its perpetuation and nationalization., I insist that this is the difference between Judge Douglas and myself,--that Judge Douglas is helping that change along., ...]",3
239,"[What right have we then to hope that the trouble will cease,--that the agitation will come to an end,--until it shall either be placed back where it originally stood, and where the fathers originally placed it, or, on the other hand, until it shall entirely master all opposition?, This is the view I entertain, and this is the reason why I entertained it, as Judge Douglas has read from my Springfield speech., Now, my friends, there is one other thing that I feel myself under some sort of obligation to mention., Judge Douglas has here to-day--in a very rambling way, I was about saying--spoken of the platforms for which he seeks to hold me responsible., He says, ""Why can't you come out and make an open avowal of principles in all places alike?"", and he reads from an advertisement that he says was used to notify the people of a speech to be made by Judge Trumbull at Waterloo., In commenting on it he desires to know whether we cannot speak frankly and manfully, as he and his friends do., How, I ask, do his friends speak out their own sentiments?, A Convention of his party in this State met on the 21st of April at Springfield, and passed a set of resolutions which they proclaim to the country as their platform., This does constitute their platform, and it is because Judge Douglas claims it is his platform--that these are his principles and purposes--that he has a right to declare he speaks his sentiments ""frankly and manfully."", On the 9th of June Colonel John Dougherty, Governor Reynolds, and others, calling themselves National Democrats, met in Springfield and adopted a set of resolutions which are as easily understood, as plain and as definite in stating to the country and to the world what they believed in and would stand upon, as Judge Douglas's platform Now, what is the reason that Judge Douglas is not willing that Colonel Dougherty and Governor Reynolds should stand upon their own written and printed platform as well as he upon his?, Why must he look farther than their platform when he claims himself to stand by his platform?, Again, in reference to our platform: On the 16th of June the Republicans had their Convention and published their platform, which is as clear and distinct as Judge Douglas's., In it they spoke their principles as plainly and as definitely to the world., What is the reason that Judge Douglas is not willing I should stand upon that platform?, Why must he go around hunting for some one who is supporting me or has supported me at some time in his life, and who has said something at some time contrary to that platform?, Does the Judge regard that rule as a good one?, If it turn out that the rule is a good one for me--that I am responsible for any and every opinion that any man has expressed who is my friend,--then it is a good rule for him., I ask, is it not as good a rule for him as it is for me?, In my opinion, it is not a good rule for either of us., Do you think differently, Judge?, Judge Douglas says he does not think differently., I am glad of it., Then can he tell me why he is looking up resolutions of five or six years ago, and insisting that they were my platform, notwithstanding my protest that they are not, and never were my platform, and my pointing out the platform of the State Convention which he delights to say nominated me for the Senate?, I cannot see what he means by parading these resolutions, if it is not to hold me responsible for them in some way., If he says to me here that he does not hold the rule to be good, one way or the other, I do not comprehend how he could answer me more fully if he answered me at greater length., I will therefore put in as my answer to the resolutions that he has hunted up against me, what I, as a lawyer, would call a good plea to a bad declaration., I understand that it is an axiom of law that a poor plea may be a good plea to a bad declaration., I think that the opinions the Judge brings from those who support me, yet differ from me, is a bad declaration against me; but if I can bring the same things against him, I am putting in a good plea to that kind of declaration, and now I propose to try it., At Freeport, Judge Douglas occupied a large part of his time in producing resolutions and documents of various sorts, as I understood, to make me somehow responsible for them; and I propose now doing a little of the same sort of thing for him., In 1850 a very clever gentleman by the name of Thompson Campbell, a personal friend of Judge Douglas and myself, a political friend of Judge Douglas and opponent of mine, was a candidate for Congress in the Galena District., He was interrogated as to his views on this same slavery question., I have here before me the interrogatories, and Campbell's answers to them--I will read them:  I want to say here that Thompson Campbell was elected to Congress on that platform, as the Democratic candidate in the Galena District, against Martin P. Sweet., The time Campbell ran was in 1850., I have not the exact date here., It was some time in 1850 that these interrogatories were put and the answer given., Campbell was elected to Congress, and served out his term., I think a second election came up before he served out his term, and he was not re-elected., Whether defeated or not nominated, I do not know., [Mr. Campbell was nominated for re-election by the Democratic party, by acclamation.], At the end of his term his very good friend Judge Douglas got him a high office from President Pierce, and sent him off to California., Is not that the fact?, Just at the end of his term in Congress it appears that our mutual friend Judge Douglas got our mutual friend Campbell a good office, and sent him to California upon it., And not only so, but on the 27th of last month, when Judge Douglas and myself spoke at Freeport in joint discussion, there was his same friend Campbell, come all the way from California, to help the Judge beat me; and there was poor Martin P. Sweet standing on the platform, trying to help poor me to be elected., That is true of one of Judge Douglas's friends., So again, in that same race of 1850, there was a Congressional Convention assembled at Joliet, and it nominated R. S. Molony for Congress, and unanimously adopted the following resolution:  Subsequently the same interrogatories were propounded to Dr. Molony which had been addressed to Campbell as above, with the exception of the 6th, respecting the interstate slave trade, to which Dr. Molony, the Democratic nominee for Congress, replied as follows:  All I have to say in regard to Dr. Molony is that he was the regularly nominated Democratic candidate for Congress in his district; was elected at that time; at the end of his term was appointed to a land-office at Danville., (I never heard anything of Judge Douglas's instrumentality in this.), He held this office a considerable time, and when we were at Freeport the other day there were handbills scattered about notifying the public that after our debate was over R. S. Molony would make a Democratic speech in favor of Judge Douglas., That is all I know of my own personal knowledge., It is added here to this resolution, and truly I believe, that among those who participated in the Joliet Convention, and who supported its nominee, with his platform as laid down in the resolution of the Convention and in his reply as above given, we call at random the following names, all of which are recognized at this day as leading Democrats:  On the 28th of February of the same year a Democratic District Convention was held at Naperville to nominate a candidate for Circuit Judge., Among the delegates were Bowen and Kelly of Will; Captain Naper, H. H. Cody, Nathan Allen, of Du Page; W. M. Jackson, J. M. Strode, P. W. Platt, and Enos W. Smith of McHenry; J. Horssnan and others of Winnebago., Colonel Strode presided over the Convention., The following resolutions were unanimously adopted,--the first on motion of P. W. Platt, the second on motion of William M. Jackson:  I understand it was in 1850, but I do not know it., I do not state a thing and say I know it, when I do not., But I have the highest belief that this is so., I know of no way to arrive at the conclusion that there is an error in it., I mean to put a case no stronger than the truth will allow., But what I was going to comment upon is an extract from a newspaper in De Kalb County; and it strikes me as being rather singular, I confess, under the circumstances., There is a Judge Mayo in that county, who is a candidate for the Legislature, for the purpose, if he secures his election, of helping to re-elect Judge Douglas., He is the editor of a newspaper [De Kalb County Sentinel], and in that paper I find the extract I am going to read., It is part of an editorial article in which he was electioneering as fiercely as he could for Judge Douglas and against me., It was a curious thing, I think, to be in such a paper., I will agree to that, and the Judge may make the most of it:  That is one of Judge Douglas's friends., Now, I do not want to leave myself in an attitude where I can be misrepresented, so I will say I do not think the Judge is responsible for this article; but he is quite as responsible for it as I would be if one of my friends had said it., I think that is fair enough., I have here also a set of resolutions passed by a Democratic State Convention in Judge Douglas's own good State of Vermont, that I think ought to be good for him too:  At Freeport I answered several interrogatories that had been propounded to me by Judge Douglas at the Ottawa meeting., The Judge has not yet seen fit to find any fault with the position that I took in regard to those seven interrogatories, which were certainly broad enough, in all conscience, to cover the entire ground., In my answers, which have been printed, and all have had the opportunity of seeing, I take the ground that those who elect me must expect that I will do nothing which will not be in accordance with those answers., I have some right to assert that Judge Douglas has no fault to find with them., But he chooses to still try to thrust me upon different ground, without paying any attention to my answers, the obtaining of which from me cost him so much trouble and concern., At the same time I propounded four interrogatories to him, claiming it as a right that he should answer as many interrogatories for me as I did for him, and I would reserve myself for a future instalment when I got them ready., The Judge, in answering me upon that occasion, put in what I suppose he intends as answers to all four of my interrogatories., The first one of these interrogatories I have before me, and it is in these words:  As I read the Judge's answer in the newspaper, and as I remember it as pronounced at the time, he does not give any answer which is equivalent to yes or no,--I will or I won't., He answers at very considerable length, rather quarreling with me for asking the question, and insisting that Judge Trumbull had done something that I ought to say something about, and finally getting out such statements as induce me to infer that he means to be understood he will, in that supposed case, vote for the admission of Kansas., I only bring this forward now for the purpose of saying that if he chooses to put a different construction upon his answer, he may do it., But if he does not, I shall from this time forward assume that he will vote for the admission of Kansas in disregard of the English bill., He has the right to remove any misunderstanding I may have., I only mention it now, that I may hereafter assume this to be the true construction of his answer, if he does not now choose to correct me., The second interrogatory that I propounded to him was this:  To this Judge Douglas answered that they can lawfully exclude slavery from the Territory prior to the formation of a constitution., He goes on to tell us how it can be done., As I understand him, he holds that it can be done by the Territorial Legislature refusing to make any enactments for the protection of slavery in the Territory, and especially by adopting unfriendly legislation to it., For the sake of clearness, I state it again: that they can exclude slavery from the Territory, 1st, by withholding what he assumes to be an indispensable assistance to it in the way of legislation; and, 2d, by unfriendly legislation., If I rightly understand him, I wish to ask your attention for a while to his position., In the first place, the Supreme Court of the United States has decided that any Congressional prohibition of slavery in the Territories is unconstitutional; that they have reached this proposition as a conclusion from their former proposition, that the Constitution of the United States expressly recognizes property in slaves, and from that other Constitutional provision, that no person shall be deprived of property without due process of law., Hence they reach the conclusion that as the Constitution of the United States expressly recognizes property in slaves, and prohibits any person from being deprived of property without due process of law, to pass an Act of Congress by which a man who owned a slave on one side of a line would be deprived of him if he took him on the other side, is depriving him of that property without due process of law., That I understand to be the decision of the Supreme Court., I understand also that Judge Douglas adheres most firmly to that decision; and the difficulty is, how is it possible for any power to exclude slavery from the Territory, unless in violation of that decision?, That is the difficulty., In the Senate of the United States, in 1850, Judge Trumbull, in a speech substantially, if not directly, put the same interrogatory to Judge Douglas, as to whether the people of a Territory had the lawful power to exclude slavery prior to the formation of a constitution., Judge Douglas then answered at considerable length, and his answer will be found in the Congressional Globe, under date of June 9th, 1856., The Judge said that whether the people could exclude slavery prior to the formation of a constitution or not was a question to be decided by the Supreme Court., He put that proposition, as will be seen by the Congressional Globe, in a variety of forms, all running to the same thing in substance,--that it was a question for the Supreme Court., I maintain that when he says, after the Supreme Court have decided the question, that the people may yet exclude slavery by any means whatever, he does virtually say that it is not a question for the Supreme Court., He shifts his ground., I appeal to you whether he did not say it was a question for the Supreme Court?, Has not the Supreme Court decided that question?, when he now says the people may exclude slavery, does he not make it a question for the people?, Does he not virtually shift his ground and say that it is not a question for the Court, but for the people?, This is a very simple proposition,--a very plain and naked one., It seems to me that there is no difficulty in deciding it., ...]",3
240,"[And then again ""He laid up seven days."", He put this in print for the people of the country to read as a serious document., I think if he had been in his sober senses he would not have risked that barefacedness in the presence of thousands of his own friends who knew that I made speeches within six of the seven days at Henry, Marshall County, Augusta, Hancock County, and Macomb, McDonough County, including all the necessary travel to meet him again at Freeport at the end of the six days., Now I say there is no charitable way to look at that statement, except to conclude that he is actually crazy., There is another thing in that statement that alarmed me very greatly as he states it, that he was going to ""trot me down to Egypt."", Thereby he would have you infer that I would not come to Egypt unless he forced me--that I could not be got here unless he, giant-like, had hauled me down here., That statement he makes, too, in the teeth of the knowledge that I had made the stipulation to come down here and that he himself had been very reluctant to enter into the stipulation., More than all this: Judge Douglas, when he made that statement, must have been crazy and wholly out of his sober senses, or else he would have known that when he got me down here, that promise--that windy promise--of his powers to annihilate me, would n't amount to anything., Now, how little do I look like being carried away trembling?, Let the Judge go on; and after he is done with his half-hour, I want you all, if I can't go home myself, to let me stay and rot here; and if anything happens to the Judge, if I cannot carry him to the hotel and put him to bed, let me stay here and rot., I say, then, here is something extraordinary in this statement., I ask you if you know any other living man who would make such a statement?, I will ask my friend Casey, over there, if he would do such a thing?, Would he send that out and have his men take it as the truth?, Did the Judge talk of trotting me down to Egypt to scare me to death?, Why, I know this people better than he does., I was raised just a little east of here., I am a part of this people., But the Judge was raised farther north, and perhaps he has some horrid idea of what this people might be induced to do., But really I have talked about this matter perhaps longer than I ought, for it is no great thing; and yet the smallest are often the most difficult things to deal with., The Judge has set about seriously trying to make the impression that when we meet at different places I am literally in his clutches--that I am a poor, helpless, decrepit mouse, and that I can do nothing at all., This is one of the ways he has taken to create that impression., I don't know any other way to meet it except this., I don't want to quarrel with him--to call him a liar; but when I come square up to him I don't know what else to call him if I must tell the truth out., I want to be at peace, and reserve all my fighting powers for necessary occasions., My time now is very nearly out, and I give up the trifle that is left to the Judge, to let him set my knees trembling again, if he can., set my knees trembling again, if he can., It will be very difficult for an audience so large as this to hear distinctly what a speaker says, and consequently it is important that as profound silence be preserved as possible., While I was at the hotel to-day, an elderly gentleman called upon me to know whether I was really in favor of producing a perfect equality between the negroes and white people., While I had not proposed to myself on this occasion to say much on that subject, yet as the question was asked me I thought I would occupy perhaps five minutes in saying something in regard to it., I will say, then, that I am not, nor ever have been, in favor of bringing about in any way the social and political equality of the white and black races; that I am not, nor ever have been, in favor of making voters or jurors of negroes, nor of qualifying them to hold office, nor to intermarry with white people; and I will say, in addition to this, that there is a physical difference between the white and black races which I believe will forever forbid the two races living together on terms of social and political equality., And in as much as they cannot so live, while they do remain together there must be the position of superior and inferior, and I as much as any other man am in favor of having the superior position assigned to the white race., I say upon this occasion I do not perceive that because the white man is to have the superior position the negro should be denied everything., I do not understand that because I do not want a negro woman for a slave I must necessarily want her for a wife., My understanding is that I can just let her alone., I am now in my fiftieth year, and I certainly never have had a black woman for either a slave or a wife., So it seems to me quite possible for us to get along without making either slaves or wives of negroes., I will add to this that I have never seen, to my knowledge, a man, woman, or child who was in favor of producing a perfect equality, social and political, between negroes and white men., I recollect of but one distinguished instance that I ever heard of so frequently as to be entirely satisfied of its correctness, and that is the case of Judge Douglas's old friend Colonel Richard M. Johnson., I will also add to the remarks I have made (for I am not going to enter at large upon this subject), that I have never had the least apprehension that I or my friends would marry negroes if there was no law to keep them from it; but as Judge Douglas and his friends seem to be in great apprehension that they might, if there were no law to keep them from it, I give him the most solemn pledge that I will to the very last stand by the law of this State which forbids the marrying of white people with negroes., I will add one further word, which is this: that I do not understand that there is any place where an alteration of the social and political relations of the negro and the white man can be made, except in the State Legislature,--not in the Congress of the United States; and as I do not really apprehend the approach of any such thing myself, and as Judge Douglas seems to be in constant horror that some such danger is rapidly approaching, I propose as the best means to prevent it that the Judge be kept at home, and placed in the State Legislature to fight the measure., I do not propose dwelling longer at this time on this subject., When Judge Trumbull, our other Senator in Congress, returned to Illinois in the month of August, he made a speech at Chicago, in which he made what may be called a charge against Judge Douglas, which I understand proved to be very offensive to him., The Judge was at that time out upon one of his speaking tours through the country, and when the news of it reached him, as I am informed, he denounced Judge Trumbull in rather harsh terms for having said what he did in regard to that matter., I was traveling at that time, and speaking at the same places with Judge Douglas on subsequent days, and when I heard of what Judge Trumbull had said of Douglas, and what Douglas had said back again, I felt that I was in a position where I could not remain entirely silent in regard to the matter., Consequently, upon two or three occasions I alluded to it, and alluded to it in no other wise than to say that in regard to the charge brought by Trumbull against Douglas, I personally knew nothing, and sought to say nothing about it; that I did personally know Judge Trumbull; that I believed him to be a man of veracity; that I believed him to be a man of capacity sufficient to know very well whether an assertion he was making, as a conclusion drawn from a set of facts, was true or false; and as a conclusion of my own from that, I stated it as my belief if Trumbull should ever be called upon, he would prove everything he had said., I said this upon two or three occasions., Upon a subsequent occasion, Judge Trumbull spoke again before an audience at Alton, and upon that occasion not only repeated his charge against Douglas, but arrayed the evidence he relied upon to substantiate it., This speech was published at length; and subsequently at Jacksonville Judge Douglas alluded to the matter., In the course of his speech, and near the close of it, he stated in regard to myself what I will now read:  I have done simply what I have told you, to subject me to this invitation to notice the charge., I now wish to say that it had not originally been my purpose to discuss that matter at all But in-as-much as it seems to be the wish of Judge Douglas to hold me responsible for it, then for once in my life I will play General Jackson, and to the just extent I take the responsibility., I wish to say at the beginning that I will hand to the reporters that portion of Judge Trumbull's Alton speech which was devoted to this matter, and also that portion of Judge Douglas's speech made at Jacksonville in answer to it., I shall thereby furnish the readers of this debate with the complete discussion between Trumbull and Douglas., I cannot now read them, for the reason that it would take half of my first hour to do so., I can only make some comments upon them., Trumbull's charge is in the following words:  I will state, without quoting further, for all will have an opportunity of reading it hereafter, that Judge Trumbull brings forward what he regards as sufficient evidence to substantiate this charge., It will be perceived Judge Trumbull shows that Senator Bigler, upon the floor of the Senate, had declared there had been a conference among the senators, in which conference it was determined to have an enabling act passed for the people of Kansas to form a constitution under, and in this conference it was agreed among them that it was best not to have a provision for submitting the constitution to a vote of the people after it should be formed., He then brings forward to show, and showing, as he deemed, that Judge Douglas reported the bill back to the Senate with that clause stricken out., He then shows that there was a new clause inserted into the bill, which would in its nature prevent a reference of the constitution back for a vote of the people,--if, indeed, upon a mere silence in the law, it could be assumed that they had the right to vote upon it., These are the general statements that he has made., I propose to examine the points in Judge Douglas's speech in which he attempts to answer that speech of Judge Trumbull's., When you come to examine Judge Douglas's speech, you will find that the first point he makes is:  His striking out such a provision, if there was such a one in the bill, he argues, does not establish the proof that it was stricken out for the purpose of robbing the people of that right., I would say, in the first place, that that would be a most manifest reason for it., It is true, as Judge Douglas states, that many Territorial bills have passed without having such a provision in them., I believe it is true, though I am not certain, that in some instances constitutions framed under such bills have been submitted to a vote of the people with the law silent upon the subject; but it does not appear that they once had their enabling acts framed with an express provision for submitting the constitution to be framed to a vote of the people, then that they were stricken out when Congress did not mean to alter the effect of the law., That there have been bills which never had the provision in, I do not question; but when was that provision taken out of one that it was in?, More especially does the evidence tend to prove the proposition that Trumbull advanced, when we remember that the provision was stricken out of the bill almost simultaneously with the time that Bigler says there was a conference among certain senators, and in which it was agreed that a bill should be passed leaving that out., Judge Douglas, in answering Trumbull, omits to attend to the testimony of Bigler, that there was a meeting in which it was agreed they should so frame the bill that there should be no submission of the constitution to a vote of the people., The Judge does not notice this part of it., If you take this as one piece of evidence, and then ascertain that simultaneously Judge Douglas struck out a provision that did require it to be submitted, and put the two together, I think it will make a pretty fair show of proof that Judge Douglas did, as Trumbull says, enter into a plot to put in force a constitution for Kansas, without giving the people any opportunity of voting upon it., But I must hurry on., The next proposition that Judge Douglas puts is this:  This is a mere question of fact, and can be determined by evidence., I only want to ask this question: Why did not Judge Douglas say that these words were not stricken out of the Toomb's bill, or this bill from which it is alleged the provision was stricken out,--a bill which goes by the name of Toomb's, because he originally brought it forward?, I ask why, if the Judge wanted to make a direct issue with Trumbull, did he not take the exact proposition Trumbull made in his speech, and say it was not stricken out?, Trumbull has given the exact words that he says were in the Toomb's bill, and he alleges that when the bill came back, they were stricken out., Judge Douglas does not say that the words which Trumbull says were stricken out were not so stricken out, but he says there was no provision in the Toomb's bill to submit the constitution to a vote of the people., We see at once that he is merely making an issue upon the meaning of the words., He has not undertaken to say that Trumbull tells a lie about these words being stricken out, but he is really, when pushed up to it, only taking an issue upon the meaning of the words., Now, then, if there be any issue upon the meaning of the words, or if there be upon the question of fact as to whether these words were stricken out, I have before me what I suppose to be a genuine copy of the Toomb's bill, in which it can be shown that the words Trumbull says were in it were, in fact, originally there., If there be any dispute upon the fact, I have got the documents here to show they were there., If there be any controversy upon the sense of the words,--whether these words which were stricken out really constituted a provision for submitting the matter to a vote of the people,--as that is a matter of argument, I think I may as well use Trumbull's own argument., He says that the proposition is in these words:  ""That the following propositions be and the same are hereby offered to the said Convention of the people of Kansas when formed, for their free acceptance or rejection; which, if accepted by the Convention and ratified by the people at the election for the adoption of the constitution, shall be obligatory upon the United States and the said State of Kansas."", Now, Trumbull alleges that these last words were stricken out of the bill when it came back, and he says this was a provision for submitting the constitution to a vote of the people; and his argument is this:  ""Would it have been possible to ratify the land propositions at the election for the adoption of the constitution, unless such an election was to be held?"", This is Trumbull's argument., Now, Judge Douglas does not meet the charge at all, but he stands up and says there was no such proposition in that bill for submitting the constitution to be framed to a vote of the people., Trumbull admits that the language is not a direct provision for submitting it, but it is a provision necessarily implied from another provision., He asks you how it is possible to ratify the land proposition at the election for the adoption of the constitution, if there was no election to be held for the adoption of the constitution., And he goes on to show that it is not any less a law because the provision is put in that indirect shape than it would be if it were put directly., But I presume I have said enough to draw attention to this point, and I pass it by also., Another one of the points that Judge Douglas makes upon Trumbull, and at very great length, is, that Trumbull, while the bill was pending, said in a speech in the Senate that he supposed the constitution to be made would have to be submitted to the people., He asks, if Trumbull thought so then, what ground is there for anybody thinking otherwise now?, Fellow-citizens, this much may be said in reply: That bill had been in the hands of a party to which Trumbull did not belong., It had been in the hands of the committee at the head of which Judge Douglas stood., Trumbull perhaps had a printed copy of the original Toomb's bill., I have not the evidence on that point except a sort of inference I draw from the general course of business there., What alterations, or what provisions in the way of altering, were going on in committee, Trumbull had no means of knowing, until the altered bill was reported back., Soon afterwards, when it was reported back, there was a discussion over it, and perhaps Trumbull in reading it hastily in the altered form did not perceive all the bearings of the alterations., He was hastily borne into the debate, and it does not follow that because there was something in it Trumbull did not perceive, that something did not exist., More than this, is it true that what Trumbull did can have any effect on what Douglas did?, Suppose Trumbull had been in the plot with these other men, would that let Douglas out of it?, ...]",3
241,"[Is it a forgery?, Is it there or not?, It may not be there, but I want the Judge to take these pieces of evidence, and distinctly say they are forgeries if he dare do it., Well, sir, you had better not commit him., He gives other quotations,--another from Judge Douglas., He says:  Judge Trumbull says Douglas made that speech, and it is recorded., Does Judge Douglas say it is a forgery, and was not true?, Trumbull says somewhere, and I propose to skip it, but it will be found by any one who will read this debate, that he did distinctly bring it to the notice of those who were engineering the bill, that it lacked that provision; and then he goes on to give another quotation from Judge Douglas, where Judge Trumbull uses this language:  So I say., I do not know whether Judge Douglas will dispute this, and yet maintain his position that Trumbull's evidence ""was forged from beginning to end."", I will remark that I have not got these Congressional Globes with me., They are large books, and difficult to carry about, and if Judge Douglas shall say that on these points where Trumbull has quoted from them there are no such passages there, I shall not be able to prove they are there upon this occasion, but I will have another chance., Whenever he points out the forgery and says, ""I declare that this particular thing which Trumbull has uttered is not to be found where he says it is,"" then my attention will be drawn to that, and I will arm myself for the contest, stating now that I have not the slightest doubt on earth that I will find every quotation just where Trumbull says it is., Then the question is, How can Douglas call that a forgery?, How can he make out that it is a forgery?, What is a forgery?, It is the bringing forward something in writing or in print purporting to be of certain effect when it is altogether untrue., If you come forward with my note for one hundred dollars when I have never given such a note, there is a forgery., If you come forward with a letter purporting to be written by me which I never wrote, there is another forgery., If you produce anything in writing or in print saying it is so and so, the document not being genuine, a forgery has been committed., How do you make this forgery when every piece of the evidence is genuine?, If Judge Douglas does say these documents and quotations are false and forged, he has a full right to do so; but until he does it specifically, we don't know how to get at him., If he does say they are false and forged, I will then look further into it, and presume I can procure the certificates of the proper officers that they are genuine copies., I have no doubt each of these extracts will be found exactly where Trumbull says it is., Then I leave it to you if Judge Douglas, in making his sweeping charge that Judge Trumbull's evidence is forged from beginning to end, at all meets the case,--if that is the way to get at the facts., I repeat again, if he will point out which one is a forgery, I will carefully examine it, and if it proves that any one of them is really a forgery, it will not be me who will hold to it any longer., I have always wanted to deal with everyone I meet candidly and honestly., If I have made any assertion not warranted by facts, and it is pointed out to me, I will withdraw it cheerfully., But I do not choose to see Judge Trumbull calumniated, and the evidence he has brought forward branded in general terms ""a forgery from beginning to end."", This is not the legal way of meeting a charge, and I submit it to all intelligent persons, both friends of Judge Douglas and of myself, whether it is., The point upon Judge Douglas is this: The bill that went into his hands had the provision in it for a submission of the constitution to the people; and I say its language amounts to an express provision for a submission, and that he took the provision out., He says it was known that the bill was silent in this particular; but I say, Judge Douglas, it was not silent when you got it., It was vocal with the declaration, when you got it, for a submission of the constitution to the people., And now, my direct question to Judge Douglas is, to answer why, if he deemed the bill silent on this point, he found it necessary to strike out those particular harmless words., If he had found the bill silent and without this provision, he might say what he does now., If he supposes it was implied that the constitution would be submitted to a vote of the people, how could these two lines so encumber the statute as to make it necessary to strike them out?, How could he infer that a submission was still implied, after its express provision had been stricken from the bill?, I find the bill vocal with the provision, while he silenced it., He took it out, and although he took out the other provision preventing a submission to a vote of the people, I ask, Why did you first put it in?, I ask him whether he took the original provision out, which Trumbull alleges was in the bill., If he admits that he did take it, I ask him what he did it for., It looks to us as if he had altered the bill., If it looks differently to him,--if he has a different reason for his action from the one we assign him--he can tell it., I insist upon knowing why he made the bill silent upon that point when it was vocal before he put his hands upon it., I was told, before my last paragraph, that my time was within three minutes of being out., I presume it is expired now; I therefore close., It follows as a matter of course that a half-hour answer to a speech of an hour and a half can be but a very hurried one., I shall only be able to touch upon a few of the points suggested by Judge Douglas, and give them a brief attention, while I shall have to totally omit others for the want of time., Judge Douglas has said to you that he has not been able to get from me an answer to the question whether I am in favor of negro citizenship., So far as I know the Judge never asked me the question before., He shall have no occasion to ever ask it again, for I tell him very frankly that I am not in favor of negro citizenship., This furnishes me an occasion for saying a few words upon the subject., I mentioned in a certain speech of mine, which has been printed, that the Supreme Court had decided that a negro could not possibly be made a citizen; and without saying what was my ground of complaint in regard to that, or whether I had any ground of complaint, Judge Douglas has from that thing manufactured nearly everything that he ever says about my disposition to produce an equality between the negroes and the white people., If any one will read my speech, he will find I mentioned that as one of the points decided in the course of the Supreme Court opinions, but I did not state what objection I had to it., But Judge Douglas tells the people what my objection was when I did not tell them myself., Now, my opinion is that the different States have the power to make a negro a citizen under the Constitution of the United States if they choose., The Dred Scott decision decides that they have not that power., If the State of Illinois had that power, I should be opposed to the exercise of it., That is all I have to say about it., Judge Douglas has told me that he heard my speeches north and my speeches south; that he had heard me at Ottawa and at Freeport in the north and recently at Jonesboro in the south, and there was a very different cast of sentiment in the speeches made at the different points., I will not charge upon Judge Douglas that he wilfully misrepresents me, but I call upon every fair-minded man to take these speeches and read them, and I dare him to point out any difference between my speeches north and south., While I am here perhaps I ought to say a word, if I have the time, in regard to the latter portion of the Judge's speech, which was a sort of declamation in reference to my having said I entertained the belief that this government would not endure half slave and half free., I have said so, and I did not say it without what seemed to me to be good reasons., It perhaps would require more time than I have now to set forth these reasons in detail; but let me ask you a few questions., Have we ever had any peace on this slavery question?, When are we to have peace upon it, if it is kept in the position it now occupies?, How are we ever to have peace upon it?, That is an important question., To be sure, if we will all stop, and allow Judge Douglas and his friends to march on in their present career until they plant the institution all over the nation, here and wherever else our flag waves, and we acquiesce in it, there will be peace., But let me ask Judge Douglas how he is going to get the people to do that?, They have been wrangling over this question for at least forty years., This was the cause of the agitation resulting in the Missouri Compromise; this produced the troubles at the annexation of Texas, in the acquisition of the territory acquired in the Mexican War., Again, this was the trouble which was quieted by the Compromise of 1850, when it was settled ""forever"" as both the great political parties declared in their National Conventions., That ""forever"" turned out to be just four years, when Judge Douglas himself reopened it., When is it likely to come to an end?, He introduced the Nebraska Bill in 1854 to put another end to the slavery agitation., He promised that it would finish it all up immediately, and he has never made a speech since, until he got into a quarrel with the President about the Lecompton Constitution, in which he has not declared that we are just at the end of the slavery agitation., But in one speech, I think last winter, he did say that he did n't quite see when the end of the slavery agitation would come., Now he tells us again that it is all over and the people of Kansas have voted down the Lecompton Constitution., How is it over?, That was only one of the attempts at putting an end to the slavery agitation--one of these ""final settlements."", Is Kansas in the Union?, Has she formed a constitution that she is likely to come in under?, Is not the slavery agitation still an open question in that Territory?, Has the voting down of that constitution put an end to all the trouble?, Is that more likely to settle it than every one of these previous attempts to settle the slavery agitation?, Now, at this day in the history of the world we can no more foretell where the end of this slavery agitation will be than we can see the end of the world itself., The Nebraska-Kansas Bill was introduced four years and a half ago, and if the agitation is ever to come to an end we may say we are four years and a half nearer the end., So, too, we can say we are four years and a half nearer the end of the world, and we can just as clearly see the end of the world as we can see the end of this agitation., The Kansas settlement did not conclude it., If Kansas should sink to-day, and leave a great vacant space in the earth's surface, this vexed question would still be among us., I say, then, there is no way of putting an end to the slavery agitation amongst us but to put it back upon the basis where our fathers placed it; no way but to keep it out of our new Territories,--to restrict it forever to the old States where it now exists., Then the public mind will rest in the belief that it is in the course of ultimate extinction., That is one way of putting an end to the slavery agitation., The other way is for us to surrender and let Judge Douglas and his friends have their way and plant slavery over all the States; cease speaking of it as in any way a wrong; regard slavery as one of the common matters of property, and speak of negroes as we do of our horses and cattle., But while it drives on in its state of progress as it is now driving, and as it has driven for the last five years, I have ventured the opinion, and I say to-day, that we will have no end to the slavery agitation until it takes one turn or the other., I do not mean that when it takes a turn toward ultimate extinction it will be in a day, nor in a year, nor in two years., I do not suppose that in the most peaceful way ultimate extinction would occur in less than a hundred years at least; but that it will occur in the best way for both races, in God's own good time, I have no doubt., But, my friends, I have used up more of my time than I intended on this point., Now, in regard to this matter about Trumbull and myself having made a bargain to sell out the entire Whig and Democratic parties in 1854: Judge Douglas brings forward no evidence to sustain his charge, except the speech Matheny is said to have made in 1856, in which he told a cock-and-bull story of that sort, upon the same moral principles that Judge Douglas tells it here to-day., This is the simple truth., ...]",3
242,"[We have his own word that these alterations were made by him, and not by the committee., Now, I ask, what is the reason Judge Douglas is so chary about coming to the exact question?, What is the reason he will not tell you anything about How it was made, BY WHOM it was made, or that he remembers it being made at all?, Why does he stand playing upon the meaning of words and quibbling around the edges of the evidence?, If he can explain all this, but leaves it unexplained, I have the right to infer that Judge Douglas understood it was the purpose of his party, in engineering that bill through, to make a constitution, and have Kansas come into the Union with that constitution, without its being submitted to a vote of the people., If he will explain his action on this question, by giving a better reason for the facts that happened than he has done, it will be satisfactory., But until he does that--until he gives a better or more plausible reason than he has offered against the evidence in the case--I suggest to him it will not avail him at all that he swells himself up, takes on dignity, and calls people liars., Why, sir, there is not a word in Trumbull's speech that depends on Trumbull's veracity at all., He has only arrayed the evidence and told you what follows as a matter of reasoning., There is not a statement in the whole speech that depends on Trumbull's word., If you have ever studied geometry, you remember that by a course of reasoning Euclid proves that all the angles in a triangle are equal to two right angles., Euclid has shown you how to work it out., Now, if you undertake to disprove that proposition, and to show that it is erroneous, would you prove it to be false by calling Euclid a liar?, They tell me that my time is out, and therefore I close., A very large portion of the speech which Judge Douglas has addressed to you has previously been delivered and put in print., I do not mean that for a hit upon the Judge at all.---If I had not been interrupted, I was going to say that such an answer as I was able to make to a very large portion of it had already been more than once made and published., There has been an opportunity afforded to the public to see our respective views upon the topics discussed in a large portion of the speech which he has just delivered., I make these remarks for the purpose of excusing myself for not passing over the entire ground that the Judge has traversed., I however desire to take up some of the points that he has attended to, and ask your attention to them, and I shall follow him backwards upon some notes which I have taken, reversing the order, by beginning where he concluded., The Judge has alluded to the Declaration of Independence, and insisted that negroes are not included in that Declaration; and that it is a slander upon the framers of that instrument to suppose that negroes were meant therein; and he asks you: Is it possible to believe that Mr. Jefferson, who penned the immortal paper, could have supposed himself applying the language of that instrument to the negro race, and yet held a portion of that race in slavery?, Would he not at once have freed them?, I only have to remark upon this part of the Judge's speech (and that, too, very briefly, for I shall not detain myself, or you, upon that point for any great length of time), that I believe the entire records of the world, from the date of the Declaration of Independence up to within three years ago, may be searched in vain for one single affirmation, from one single man, that the negro was not included in the Declaration of Independence; I think I may defy Judge Douglas to show that he ever said so, that Washington ever said so, that any President ever said so, that any member of Congress ever said so, or that any living man upon the whole earth ever said so, until the necessities of the present policy of the Democratic party, in regard to slavery, had to invent that affirmation., And I will remind Judge Douglas and this audience that while Mr. Jefferson was the owner of slaves, as undoubtedly he was, in speaking upon this very subject he used the strong language that ""he trembled for his country when he remembered that God was just""; and I will offer the highest premium in my power to Judge Douglas if he will show that he, in all his life, ever uttered a sentiment at all akin to that of Jefferson., The next thing to which I will ask your attention is the Judge's comments upon the fact, as he assumes it to be, that we cannot call our public meetings as Republican meetings; and he instances Tazewell County as one of the places where the friends of Lincoln have called a public meeting and have not dared to name it a Republican meeting., He instances Monroe County as another, where Judge Trumbull and Jehu Baker addressed the persons whom the Judge assumes to be the friends of Lincoln calling them the ""Free Democracy."", I have the honor to inform Judge Douglas that he spoke in that very county of Tazewell last Saturday, and I was there on Tuesday last; and when he spoke there, he spoke under a call not venturing to use the word ""Democrat."", [Turning to Judge Douglas.], what think you of this?, So, again, there is another thing to which I would ask the Judge's attention upon this subject., In the contest of 1856 his party delighted to call themselves together as the ""National Democracy""; but now, if there should be a notice put up anywhere for a meeting of the ""National Democracy,"" Judge Douglas and his friends would not come., They would not suppose themselves invited., They would understand that it was a call for those hateful postmasters whom he talks about., Now a few words in regard to these extracts from speeches of mine which Judge Douglas has read to you, and which he supposes are in very great contrast to each other., Those speeches have been before the public for a considerable time, and if they have any inconsistency in them, if there is any conflict in them, the public have been able to detect it., When the Judge says, in speaking on this subject, that I make speeches of one sort for the people of the northern end of the State, and of a different sort for the southern people, he assumes that I do not understand that my speeches will be put in print and read north and south., I knew all the while that the speech that I made at Chicago, and the one I made at Jonesboro and the one at Charleston, would all be put in print, and all the reading and intelligent men in the community would see them and know all about my opinions., And I have not supposed, and do not now suppose, that there is any conflict whatever between them., But the Judge will have it that if we do not confess that there is a sort of inequality between the white and black races which justifies us in making them slaves, we must then insist that there is a degree of equality that requires us to make them our wives., Now, I have all the while taken a broad distinction in regard to that matter; and that is all there is in these different speeches which he arrays here; and the entire reading of either of the speeches will show that that distinction was made., Perhaps by taking two parts of the same speech he could have got up as much of a conflict as the one he has found., I have all the while maintained that in so far as it should be insisted that there was an equality between the white and black races that should produce a perfect social and political equality, it was an impossibility., This you have seen in my printed speeches, and with it I have said that in their right to ""life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness,"" as proclaimed in that old Declaration, the inferior races are our equals., And these declarations I have constantly made in reference to the abstract moral question, to contemplate and consider when we are legislating about any new country which is not already cursed with the actual presence of the evil,--slavery., I have never manifested any impatience with the necessities that spring from the actual presence of black people amongst us, and the actual existence of slavery amongst us where it does already exist; but I have insisted that, in legislating for new countries where it does not exist there is no just rule other than that of moral and abstract right!, With reference to those new countries, those maxims as to the right of a people to ""life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness"" were the just rules to be constantly referred to., There is no misunderstanding this, except by men interested to misunderstand it., I take it that I have to address an intelligent and reading community, who will peruse what I say, weigh it, and then judge whether I advanced improper or unsound views, or whether I advanced hypocritical, and deceptive, and contrary views in different portions of the country., I believe myself to be guilty of no such thing as the latter, though, of course, I cannot claim that I am entirely free from all error in the opinions I advance., The Judge has also detained us awhile in regard to the distinction between his party and our party., His he assumes to be a national party, ours a sectional one., He does this in asking the question whether this country has any interest in the maintenance of the Republican party., He assumes that our party is altogether sectional, that the party to which he adheres is national; and the argument is, that no party can be a rightful party--and be based upon rightful principles--unless it can announce its principles everywhere., I presume that Judge Douglas could not go into Russia and announce the doctrine of our national Democracy; he could not denounce the doctrine of kings and emperors and monarchies in Russia; and it may be true of this country that in some places we may not be able to proclaim a doctrine as clearly true as the truth of democracy, because there is a section so directly opposed to it that they will not tolerate us in doing so., Is it the true test of the soundness of a doctrine that in some places people won't let you proclaim it?, Is that the way to test the truth of any doctrine?, Why, I understood that at one time the people of Chicago would not let Judge Douglas preach a certain favorite doctrine of his., I commend to his consideration the question whether he takes that as a test of the unsoundness of what he wanted to preach., There is another thing to which I wish to ask attention for a little while on this occasion., What has always been the evidence brought forward to prove that the Republican party is a sectional party?, The main one was that in the Southern portion of the Union the people did not let the Republicans proclaim their doctrines amongst them., That has been the main evidence brought forward,--that they had no supporters, or substantially none, in the Slave States., The South have not taken hold of our principles as we announce them; nor does Judge Douglas now grapple with those principles., We have a Republican State Platform, laid down in Springfield in June last stating our position all the way through the questions before the country., We are now far advanced in this canvass., Judge Douglas and I have made perhaps forty speeches apiece, and we have now for the fifth time met face to face in debate, and up to this day I have not found either Judge Douglas or any friend of his taking hold of the Republican platform, or laying his finger upon anything in it that is wrong., I ask you all to recollect that., Judge Douglas turns away from the platform of principles to the fact that he can find people somewhere who will not allow us to announce those principles., If he had great confidence that our principles were wrong, he would take hold of them and demonstrate them to be wrong., But he does not do so., The only evidence he has of their being wrong is in the fact that there are people who won't allow us to preach them., I ask again, is that the way to test the soundness of a doctrine?, I ask his attention also to the fact that by the rule of nationality he is himself fast becoming sectional., I ask his attention to the fact that his speeches would not go as current now south of the Ohio River as they have formerly gone there I ask his attention to the fact that he felicitates himself to-day that all the Democrats of the free States are agreeing with him, while he omits to tell us that the Democrats of any slave State agree with him., If he has not thought of this, I commend to his consideration the evidence in his own declaration, on this day, of his becoming sectional too., I see it rapidly approaching., Whatever may be the result of this ephemeral contest between Judge Douglas and myself, I see the day rapidly approaching when his pill of sectionalism, which he has been thrusting down the throats of Republicans for years past, will be crowded down his own throat., Now, in regard to what Judge Douglas said (in the beginning of his speech) about the Compromise of 1850 containing the principles of the Nebraska Bill, although I have often presented my views upon that subject, yet as I have not done so in this canvass, I will, if you please, detain you a little with them., I have always maintained, so far as I was able, that there was nothing of the principle of the Nebraska Bill in the Compromise of 1850 at all,--nothing whatever., Where can you find the principle of the Nebraska Bill in that Compromise?, If anywhere, in the two pieces of the Compromise organizing the Territories of New Mexico and Utah., It was expressly provided in these two acts that when they came to be admitted into the Union they should be admitted with or without slavery, as they should choose, by their own constitutions., Nothing was said in either of those acts as to what was to be done in relation to slavery during the Territorial existence of those Territories, while Henry Clay constantly made the declaration (Judge Douglas recognizing him as a leader) that, in his opinion, the old Mexican laws would control that question during the Territorial existence, and that these old Mexican laws excluded slavery., How can that be used as a principle for declaring that during the Territorial existence as well as at the time of framing the constitution the people, if you please, might have slaves if they wanted them?, I am not discussing the question whether it is right or wrong; but how are the New Mexican and Utah laws patterns for the Nebraska Bill?, I maintain that the organization of Utah and New Mexico did not establish a general principle at all., It had no feature of establishing a general principle., The acts to which I have referred were a part of a general system of Compromises., They did not lay down what was proposed as a regular policy for the Territories, only an agreement in this particular case to do in that way, because other things were done that were to be a compensation for it., They were allowed to come in in that shape, because in another way it was paid for, considering that as a part of that system of measures called the Compromise of 1850, which finally included half-a-dozen acts., It included the admission of California as a free State, which was kept out of the Union for half a year because it had formed a free constitution., It included the settlement of the boundary of Texas, which had been undefined before, which was in itself a slavery question; for if you pushed the line farther west, you made Texas larger, and made more slave territory; while, if you drew the line toward the east, you narrowed the boundary and diminished the domain of slavery, and by so much increased free territory., It included the abolition of the slave trade in the District of Columbia., It included the passage of a new Fugitive Slave law., All these things were put together, and, though passed in separate acts, were nevertheless, in legislation (as the speeches at the time will show), made to depend upon each other., Each got votes with the understanding that the other measures were to pass, and by this system of compromise, in that series of measures, those two bills--the New Mexico and Utah bills--were passed: and I say for that reason they could not be taken as models, framed upon their own intrinsic principle, for all future Territories., And I have the evidence of this in the fact that Judge Douglas, a year afterward, or more than a year afterward, perhaps, when he first introduced bills for the purpose of framing new Territories, did not attempt to follow these bills of New Mexico and Utah; and even when he introduced this Nebraska Bill, I think you will discover that he did not exactly follow them., But I do not wish to dwell at great length upon this branch of the discussion., My own opinion is, that a thorough investigation will show most plainly that the New Mexico and Utah bills were part of a system of compromise, and not designed as patterns for future Territorial legislation; and that this Nebraska Bill did not follow them as a pattern at all., The Judge tells, in proceeding, that he is opposed to making any odious distinctions between free and slave States., I am altogether unaware that the Republicans are in favor of making any odious distinctions between the free and slave States., ...]",3
243,"[Now, remembering the provision of the Constitution which I have read--affirming that that instrument is the supreme law of the land; that the judges of every State shall be bound by it, any law or constitution of any State to the contrary notwithstanding; that the right of property in a slave is affirmed in that Constitution, is made, formed into, and cannot be separated from it without breaking it; durable as the instrument; part of the instrument;--what follows as a short and even syllogistic argument from it?, I think it follows, and I submit to the consideration of men capable of arguing whether, as I state it, in syllogistic form, the argument has any fault in it:  Nothing in the Constitution or laws of any State can destroy a right distinctly and expressly affirmed in the Constitution of the United States., The right of property in a slave is distinctly and expressly affirmed in the Constitution of the United States., Therefore, nothing in the Constitution or laws of any State can destroy the right of property in a slave., I believe that no fault can be pointed out in that argument; assuming the truth of the premises, the conclusion, so far as I have capacity at all to understand it, follows inevitably., There is a fault in it as I think, but the fault is not in the reasoning; but the falsehood in fact is a fault of the premises., I believe that the right of property in a slave is not distinctly and expressly affirmed in the Constitution, and Judge Douglas thinks it is., I believe that the Supreme Court and the advocates of that decision may search in vain for the place in the Constitution where the right of property in a slave is distinctly and expressly affirmed I say, therefore, that I think one of the premises is not true in fact., But it is true with Judge Douglas., It is true with the Supreme Court who pronounced it., They are estopped from denying it, and being estopped from denying it, the conclusion follows that, the Constitution of the United States being the supreme law, no constitution or law can interfere with it., It being affirmed in the decision that the right of property in a slave is distinctly and expressly affirmed in the Constitution, the conclusion inevitably follows that no State law or constitution can destroy that right., I then say to Judge Douglas and to all others that I think it will take a better answer than a sneer to show that those who have said that the right of property in a slave is distinctly and expressly affirmed in the Constitution, are not prepared to show that no constitution or law can destroy that right., I say I believe it will take a far better argument than a mere sneer to show to the minds of intelligent men that whoever has so said is not prepared, whenever public sentiment is so far advanced as to justify it, to say the other., This is but an opinion, and the opinion of one very humble man; but it is my opinion that the Dred Scott decision, as it is, never would have been made in its present form if the party that made it had not been sustained previously by the elections., My own opinion is, that the new Dred Scott decision, deciding against the right of the people of the States to exclude slavery, will never be made if that party is not sustained by the elections., I believe, further, that it is just as sure to be made as to-morrow is to come, if that party shall be sustained., I have said, upon a former occasion, and I repeat it now, that the course of arguement that Judge Douglas makes use of upon this subject (I charge not his motives in this), is preparing the public mind for that new Dred Scott decision., I have asked him again to point out to me the reasons for his first adherence to the Dred Scott decision as it is., I have turned his attention to the fact that General Jackson differed with him in regard to the political obligation of a Supreme Court decision., I have asked his attention to the fact that Jefferson differed with him in regard to the political obligation of a Supreme Court decision., Jefferson said that ""Judges are as honest as other men, and not more so."", And he said, substantially, that whenever a free people should give up in absolute submission to any department of government, retaining for themselves no appeal from it, their liberties were gone., I have asked his attention to the fact that the Cincinnati platform, upon which he says he stands, disregards a time-honored decision of the Supreme Court, in denying the power of Congress to establish a National Bank., I have asked his attention to the fact that he himself was one of the most active instruments at one time in breaking down the Supreme Court of the State of Illinois because it had made a decision distasteful to him,--a struggle ending in the remarkable circumstance of his sitting down as one of the new Judges who were to overslaugh that decision; getting his title of Judge in that very way., So far in this controversy I can get no answer at all from Judge Douglas upon these subjects., Not one can I get from him, except that he swells himself up and says, ""All of us who stand by the decision of the Supreme Court are the friends of the Constitution; all you fellows that dare question it in any way are the enemies of the Constitution."", Now, in this very devoted adherence to this decision, in opposition to all the great political leaders whom he has recognized as leaders, in opposition to his former self and history, there is something very marked., And the manner in which he adheres to it,--not as being right upon the merits, as he conceives (because he did not discuss that at all), but as being absolutely obligatory upon every one simply because of the source from whence it comes, as that which no man can gainsay, whatever it may be,--this is another marked feature of his adherence to that decision., It marks it in this respect, that it commits him to the next decision, whenever it comes, as being as obligatory as this one, since he does not investigate it, and won't inquire whether this opinion is right or wrong., So he takes the next one without inquiring whether it is right or wrong., He teaches men this doctrine, and in so doing prepares the public mind to take the next decision when it comes, without any inquiry., In this I think I argue fairly (without questioning motives at all) that Judge Douglas is most ingeniously and powerfully preparing the public mind to take that decision when it comes; and not only so, but he is doing it in various other ways., In these general maxims about liberty, in his assertions that he ""don't care whether slavery is voted up or voted down,""; that ""whoever wants slavery has a right to have it""; that ""upon principles of equality it should be allowed to go everywhere""; that ""there is no inconsistency between free and slave institutions""--in this he is also preparing (whether purposely or not) the way for making the institution of slavery national!, I repeat again, for I wish no misunderstanding, that I do not charge that he means it so; but I call upon your minds to inquire, if you were going to get the best instrument you could, and then set it to work in the most ingenious way, to prepare the public mind for this movement, operating in the free States, where there is now an abhorrence of the institution of slavery, could you find an instrument so capable of doing it as Judge Douglas, or one employed in so apt a way to do it?, I have said once before, and I will repeat it now, that Mr. Clay, when he was once answering an objection to the Colonization Society, that it had a tendency to the ultimate emancipation of the slaves, said that:  And I do think--I repeat, though I said it on a former occasion--that Judge Douglas and whoever, like him, teaches that the negro has no share, humble though it may be, in the Declaration of Independence, is going back to the era of our liberty and independence, and, so far as in him lies, muzzling the cannon that thunders its annual joyous return; that he is blowing out the moral lights around us, when he contends that whoever wants slaves has a right to hold them; that he is penetrating, so far as lies in his power, the human soul, and eradicating the light of reason and the love of liberty, when he is in every possible way preparing the public mind, by his vast influence, for making the institution of slavery perpetual and national., There is, my friends, only one other point to which I will call your attention for the remaining time that I have left me, and perhaps I shall not occupy the entire time that I have, as that one point may not take me clear through it., Among the interrogatories that Judge Douglas propounded to me at Freeport, there was one in about this language:  I answered, as I thought, in this way: that I am not generally opposed to the acquisition of additional territory, and that I would support a proposition for the acquisition of additional territory according as my supporting it was or was not calculated to aggravate this slavery question amongst us., I then proposed to Judge Douglas another interrogatory, which was correlative to that: ""Are you in favor of acquiring additional territory, in disregard of how it may affect us upon the slavery question?"", Judge Douglas answered,--that is, in his own way he answered it., I believe that, although he took a good many words to answer it, it was a little more fully answered than any other., The substance of his answer was that this country would continue to expand; that it would need additional territory; that it was as absurd to suppose that we could continue upon our present territory, enlarging in population as we are, as it would be to hoop a boy twelve years of age, and expect him to grow to man's size without bursting the hoops., I believe it was something like that., Consequently, he was in favor of the acquisition of further territory as fast as we might need it, in disregard of how it might affect the slavery question., I do not say this as giving his exact language, but he said so substantially; and he would leave the question of slavery, where the territory was acquired, to be settled by the people of the acquired territory., May be it is; let us consider that for a while., This will probably, in the run of things, become one of the concrete manifestations of this slavery question., If Judge Douglas's policy upon this question succeeds, and gets fairly settled down, until all opposition is crushed out, the next thing will be a grab for the territory of poor Mexico, an invasion of the rich lands of South America, then the adjoining islands will follow, each one of which promises additional slave-fields., And this question is to be left to the people of those countries for settlement., When we get Mexico, I don't know whether the Judge will be in favor of the Mexican people that we get with it settling that question for themselves and all others; because we know the Judge has a great horror for mongrels, and I understand that the people of Mexico are most decidedly a race of mongrels., I understand that there is not more than one person there out of eight who is pure white, and I suppose from the Judge's previous declaration that when we get Mexico, or any considerable portion of it, that he will be in favor of these mongrels settling the question, which would bring him somewhat into collision with his horror of an inferior race., It is to be remembered, though, that this power of acquiring additional territory is a power confided to the President and the Senate of the United States., It is a power not under the control of the representatives of the people any further than they, the President and the Senate, can be considered the representatives of the people., Let me illustrate that by a case we have in our history., When we acquired the territory from Mexico in the Mexican War, the House of Representatives, composed of the immediate representatives of the people, all the time insisted that the territory thus to be acquired should be brought in upon condition that slavery should be forever prohibited therein, upon the terms and in the language that slavery had been prohibited from coming into this country., That was insisted upon constantly and never failed to call forth an assurance that any territory thus acquired should have that prohibition in it, so far as the House of Representatives was concerned., But at last the President and Senate acquired the territory without asking the House of Representatives anything about it, and took it without that prohibition., They have the power of acquiring territory without the immediate representatives of the people being called upon to say anything about it, and thus furnishing a very apt and powerful means of bringing new territory into the Union, and, when it is once brought into the country, involving us anew in this slavery agitation., It is therefore, as I think, a very important question for due consideration of the American people, whether the policy of bringing in additional territory, without considering at all how it will operate upon the safety of the Union in reference to this one great disturbing element in our national politics, shall be adopted as the policy of the country., You will bear in mind that it is to be acquired, according to the Judge's view, as fast as it is needed, and the indefinite part of this proposition is that we have only Judge Douglas and his class of men to decide how fast it is needed., We have no clear and certain way of determining or demonstrating how fast territory is needed by the necessities of the country., Whoever wants to go out filibustering, then, thinks that more territory is needed., Whoever wants wider slave-fields feels sure that some additional territory is needed as slave territory., Then it is as easy to show the necessity of additional slave-territory as it is to assert anything that is incapable of absolute demonstration., Whatever motive a man or a set of men may have for making annexation of property or territory, it is very easy to assert, but much less easy to disprove, that it is necessary for the wants of the country., And now it only remains for me to say that I think it is a very grave question for the people of this Union to consider, whether, in view of the fact that this slavery question has been the only one that has ever endangered our Republican institutions, the only one that has ever threatened or menaced a dissolution of the Union, that has ever disturbed us in such a way as to make us fear for the perpetuity of our liberty,--in view of these facts, I think it is an exceedingly interesting and important question for this people to consider whether we shall engage in the policy of acquiring additional territory, discarding altogether from our consideration, while obtaining new territory, the question how it may affect us in regard to this, the only endangering element to our liberties and national greatness., The Judge's view has been expressed., I, in my answer to his question, have expressed mine., I think it will become an important and practical question., Our views are before the public., I am willing and anxious that they should consider them fully; that they should turn it about and consider the importance of the question, and arrive at a just conclusion as to whether it is or is not wise in the people of this Union, in the acquisition of new territory, to consider whether it will add to the disturbance that is existing amongst us--whether it will add to the one only danger that has ever threatened the perpetuity of the Union or our own liberties., I think it is extremely important that they shall decide, and rightly decide, that question before entering upon that policy., And now, my friends, having said the little I wish to say upon this head, whether I have occupied the whole of the remnant of my time or not, I believe I could not enter upon any new topic so as to treat it fully, without transcending my time, which I would not for a moment think of doing., I give way to Judge Douglas., I have had no immediate conference with Judge Douglas, but I will venture to say that he and I will perfectly agree that your entire silence, both when I speak and when he speaks, will be most agreeable to us., In the month of May, 1856, the elements in the State of Illinois which have since been consolidated into the Republican party assembled together in a State Convention at Bloomington., They adopted at that time what, in political language, is called a platform., In June of the same year the elements of the Republican party in the nation assembled together in a National Convention at Philadelphia., They adopted what is called the National Platform., In June, 1858,--the present year,--the Republicans of Illinois reassembled at Springfield, in State Convention, and adopted again their platform, as I suppose not differing in any essential particular from either of the former ones, but perhaps adding something in relation to the new developments of political progress in the country., The Convention that assembled in June last did me the honor, if it be one, and I esteem it such, to nominate me as their candidate for the United States Senate., I have supposed that, in entering upon this canvass, I stood generally upon these platforms., We are now met together on the 13th of October of the same year, only four months from the adoption of the last platform, and I am unaware that in this canvass, from the beginning until to-day, any one of our adversaries has taken hold of our platforms, or laid his finger upon anything that he calls wrong in them., In the very first one of these joint discussions between Senator Douglas and myself, Senator Douglas, without alluding at all to these platforms, or any one of them, of which I have spoken, attempted to hold me responsible for a set of resolutions passed long before the meeting of either one of these conventions of which I have spoken., And as a ground for holding me responsible for these resolutions, he assumed that they had been passed at a State Convention of the Republican party, and that I took part in that Convention., It was discovered afterward that this was erroneous, that the resolutions which he endeavored to hold me responsible for had not been passed by any State Convention anywhere, had not been passed at Springfield, where he supposed they had, or assumed that they had, and that they had been passed in no convention in which I had taken part., The Judge, nevertheless, was not willing to give up the point that he was endeavoring to make upon me, and he therefore thought to still hold me to the point that he was endeavoring to make, by showing that the resolutions that he read had been passed at a local convention in the northern part of the State, although it was not a local convention that embraced my residence at all, nor one that reached, as I suppose, nearer than one hundred and fifty or two hundred miles of where I was when it met, nor one in which I took any part at all., He also introduced other resolutions, passed at other meetings, and by combining the whole, although they were all antecedent to the two State Conventions and the one National Convention I have mentioned, still he insisted, and now insists, as I understand, that I am in some way responsible for them., At Jonesboro, on our third meeting, I insisted to the Judge that I was in no way rightfully held responsible for the proceedings of this local meeting or convention, in which I had taken no part, and in which I was in no way embraced; but I insisted to him that if he thought I was responsible for every man or every set of men everywhere, who happen to be my friends, the rule ought to work both ways, and he ought to be responsible for the acts and resolutions of all men or sets of men who were or are now his supporters and friends, and gave him a pretty long string of resolutions, passed by men who are now his friends, and announcing doctrines for which he does not desire to be held responsible., This still does not satisfy Judge Douglas., He still adheres to his proposition, that I am responsible for what some of my friends in different parts of the State have done, but that he is not responsible for what his have done., At least, so I understand him., But in addition to that, the Judge, at our meeting in Galesburgh, last week, undertakes to establish that I am guilty of a species of double dealing with the public; that I make speeches of a certain sort in the north, among the Abolitionists, which I would not make in the south, and that I make speeches of a certain sort in the south which I would not make in the north., I apprehend, in the course I have marked out for myself, that I shall not have to dwell at very great length upon this subject., As this was done in the Judge's opening speech at Galesburgh, I had an opportunity, as I had the middle speech then, of saying something in answer to it., He brought forward a quotation or two from a speech of mine delivered at Chicago, and then, to contrast with it, he brought forward an extract from a speech of mine at Charleston, in which he insisted that I was greatly inconsistent, and insisted that his conclusion followed, that I was playing a double part, and speaking in one region one way, and in another region another way., I have not time now to dwell on this as long as I would like, and wish only now to requote that portion of my speech at Charleston which the Judge quoted, and then make some comments upon it., This he quotes from me as being delivered at Charleston, and I believe correctly:  ""I will say, then, that I am not, nor ever have been, in favor of bringing about in any way the social and political equality of the white and black races; that I am not, nor ever have been, in favor of making voters or jurors of negroes, nor of qualifying them to hold office, nor to intermarry with white people; and I will say, in addition to this, that there is a physical difference between the white and black races which will forever forbid the two races living together on terms of social and political equality., And inasmuch as they cannot so live while they do remain together, there must be the position of superior and inferior., I am as much as any other man in favor of having the superior position assigned to the white race."", ...]",3
244,"[The Republican party think it wrong; we think it is a moral, a social, and a political wrong., We think it as a wrong not confining itself merely to the persons or the States where it exists, but that it is a wrong in its tendency, to say the least, that extends itself to the existence of the whole nation., Because we think it wrong, we propose a course of policy that shall deal with it as a wrong., We deal with it as with any other wrong, in so far as we can prevent its growing any larger, and so deal with it that in the run of time there may be some promise of an end to it., We have a due regard to the actual presence of it amongst us, and the difficulties of getting rid of it in any satisfactory way, and all the constitutional obligations thrown about it., I suppose that in reference both to its actual existence in the nation, and to our constitutional obligations, we have no right at all to disturb it in the States where it exists, and we profess that we have no more inclination to disturb it than we have the right to do it., We go further than that: we don't propose to disturb it where, in one instance, we think the Constitution would permit us., We think the Constitution would permit us to disturb it in the District of Columbia., Still, we do not propose to do that, unless it should be in terms which I don't suppose the nation is very likely soon to agree to,--the terms of making the emancipation gradual, and compensating the unwilling owners., Where we suppose we have the constitutional right, we restrain ourselves in reference to the actual existence of the institution and the difficulties thrown about it., We also oppose it as an evil so far as it seeks to spread itself., We insist on the policy that shall restrict it to its present limits., We don't suppose that in doing this we violate anything due to the actual presence of the institution, or anything due to the constitutional guaranties thrown around it., We oppose the Dred Scott decision in a certain way, upon which I ought perhaps to address you a few words., We do not propose that when Dred Scott has been decided to be a slave by the court, we, as a mob, will decide him to be free., We do not propose that, when any other one, or one thousand, shall be decided by that court to be slaves, we will in any violent way disturb the rights of property thus settled; but we nevertheless do oppose that decision as a political rule which shall be binding on the voter to vote for nobody who thinks it wrong, which shall be binding on the members of Congress or the President to favor no measure that does not actually concur with the principles of that decision., We do not propose to be bound by it as a political rule in that way, because we think it lays the foundation, not merely of enlarging and spreading out what we consider an evil, but it lays the foundation for spreading that evil into the States themselves., We propose so resisting it as to have it reversed if we can, and a new judicial rule established upon this subject., I will add this: that if there be any man who does not believe that slavery is wrong in the three aspects which I have mentioned, or in any one of them, that man is misplaced, and ought to leave us; while on the other hand, if there be any man in the Republican party who is impatient over the necessity springing from its actual presence, and is impatient of the constitutional guaranties thrown around it, and would act in disregard of these, he too is misplaced, standing with us., He will find his place somewhere else; for we have a due regard, so far as we are capable of understanding them, for all these things., This, gentlemen, as well as I can give it, is a plain statement of our principles in all their enormity., I will say now that there is a sentiment in the country contrary to me,--a sentiment which holds that slavery is not wrong, and therefore it goes for the policy that does not propose dealing with it as a wrong., That policy is the Democratic policy, and that sentiment is the Democratic sentiment., If there be a doubt in the mind of any one of this vast audience that this is really the central idea of the Democratic party in relation to this subject, I ask him to bear with me while I state a few things tending, as I think, to prove that proposition., In the first place, the leading man--I think I may do my friend Judge Douglas the honor of calling him such advocating the present Democratic policy never himself says it is wrong., He has the high distinction, so far as I know, of never having said slavery is either right or wrong., Almost everybody else says one or the other, but the Judge never does., If there be a man in the Democratic party who thinks it is wrong, and yet clings to that party, I suggest to him, in the first place, that his leader don't talk as he does, for he never says that it is wrong., In the second place, I suggest to him that if he will examine the policy proposed to be carried forward, he will find that he carefully excludes the idea that there is anything wrong in it., If you will examine the arguments that are made on it, you will find that every one carefully excludes the idea that there is anything wrong in slavery., Perhaps that Democrat who says he is as much opposed to slavery as I am will tell me that I am wrong about this., I wish him to examine his own course in regard to this matter a moment, and then see if his opinion will not be changed a little., You say it is wrong; but don't you constantly object to anybody else saying so?, Do you not constantly argue that this is not the right place to oppose it?, You say it must not be opposed in the free States, because slavery is not here; it must not be opposed in the slave States, because it is there; it must not be opposed in politics, because that will make a fuss; it must not be opposed in the pulpit, because it is not religion., Then where is the place to oppose it?, There is no suitable place to oppose it., There is no place in the country to oppose this evil overspreading the continent, which you say yourself is coming., Frank Blair and Gratz Brown tried to get up a system of gradual emancipation in Missouri, had an election in August, and got beat, and you, Mr. Democrat, threw up your hat, and hallooed ""Hurrah for Democracy!"", So I say, again, that in regard to the arguments that are made, when Judge Douglas Says he ""don't care whether slavery is voted up or voted down,"" whether he means that as an individual expression of sentiment, or only as a sort of statement of his views on national policy, it is alike true to say that he can thus argue logically if he don't see anything wrong in it; but he cannot say so logically if he admits that slavery is wrong., He cannot say that he would as soon see a wrong voted up as voted down., When Judge Douglas says that whoever or whatever community wants slaves, they have a right to have them, he is perfectly logical, if there is nothing wrong in the institution; but if you admit that it is wrong, he cannot logically say that anybody has a right to do wrong., When he says that slave property and horse and hog property are alike to be allowed to go into the Territories, upon the principles of equality, he is reasoning truly, if there is no difference between them as property; but if the one is property held rightfully, and the other is wrong, then there is no equality between the right and wrong; so that, turn it in anyway you can, in all the arguments sustaining the Democratic policy, and in that policy itself, there is a careful, studied exclusion of the idea that there is anything wrong in slavery., Let us understand this., I am not, just here, trying to prove that we are right, and they are wrong., I have been stating where we and they stand, and trying to show what is the real difference between us; and I now say that whenever we can get the question distinctly stated, can get all these men who believe that slavery is in some of these respects wrong to stand and act with us in treating it as a wrong,--then, and not till then, I think we will in some way come to an end of this slavery agitation., Since Judge Douglas has said to you in his conclusion that he had not time in an hour and a half to answer all I had said in an hour, it follows of course that I will not be able to answer in half an hour all that he said in an hour and a half., I wish to return to Judge Douglas my profound thanks for his public annunciation here to-day, to be put on record, that his system of policy in regard to the institution of slavery contemplates that it shall last forever., We are getting a little nearer the true issue of this controversy, and I am profoundly grateful for this one sentence., Judge Douglas asks you, Why cannot the institution of slavery, or rather, why cannot the nation, part slave and part free, continue as our fathers made it, forever?, In the first place, I insist that our fathers did not make this nation half slave and half free, or part slave and part free., I insist that they found the institution of slavery existing here., They did not make it so but they left it so because they knew of no way to get rid of it at that time., When Judge Douglas undertakes to say that, as a matter of choice, the fathers of the government made this nation part slave and part free, he assumes what is historically a falsehood., More than that: when the fathers of the government cut off the source of slavery by the abolition of the slave-trade, and adopted a system of restricting it from the new Territories where it had not existed, I maintain that they placed it where they understood, and all sensible men understood, it was in the course of ultimate extinction; and when Judge Douglas asks me why it cannot continue as our fathers made it, I ask him why he and his friends could not let it remain as our fathers made it?, It is precisely all I ask of him in relation to the institution of slavery, that it shall be placed upon the basis that our fathers placed it upon., Mr. Brooks, of South Carolina, once said, and truly said, that when this government was established, no one expected the institution of slavery to last until this day, and that the men who formed this government were wiser and better than the men of these days; but the men of these days had experience which the fathers had not, and that experience had taught them the invention of the cotton-gin, and this had made the perpetuation of the institution of slavery a necessity in this country., Judge Douglas could not let it stand upon the basis which our fathers placed it, but removed it, and put it upon the cotton-gin basis., It is a question, therefore, for him and his friends to answer, why they could not let it remain where the fathers of the government originally placed it., I hope nobody has understood me as trying to sustain the doctrine that we have a right to quarrel with Kentucky, or Virginia, or any of the slave States, about the institution of slavery,--thus giving the Judge an opportunity to be eloquent and valiant against us in fighting for their rights., I expressly declared in my opening speech that I had neither the inclination to exercise, nor the belief in the existence of, the right to interfere with the States of Kentucky or Virginia in doing as they pleased with slavery Or any other existing institution., Then what becomes of all his eloquence in behalf of the rights of States, which are assailed by no living man?, But I have to hurry on, for I have but a half hour., The Judge has informed me, or informed this audience, that the Washington Union is laboring for my election to the United States Senate., This is news to me,--not very ungrateful news either., [Turning to Mr. W. H. Carlin, who was on the stand]--I hope that Carlin will be elected to the State Senate, and will vote for me., [Mr. Carlin shook his head.], Carlin don't fall in, I perceive, and I suppose he will not do much for me; but I am glad of all the support I can get, anywhere, if I can get it without practicing any deception to obtain it., In respect to this large portion of Judge Douglas's speech in which he tries to show that in the controversy between himself and the Administration party he is in the right, I do not feel myself at all competent or inclined to answer him., I say to him, ""Give it to them,--give it to them just all you can!"", and, on the other hand, I say to Carlin, and Jake Davis, and to this man Wogley up here in Hancock, ""Give it to Douglas, just pour it into him!"", Now, in regard to this matter of the Dred Scott decision, I wish to say a word or two., After all, the Judge will not say whether, if a decision is made holding that the people of the States cannot exclude slavery, he will support it or not., He obstinately refuses to say what he will do in that case., The judges of the Supreme Court as obstinately refused to say what they would do on this subject., Before this I reminded him that at Galesburgh he said the judges had expressly declared the contrary, and you remember that in my Opening speech I told him I had the book containing that decision here, and I would thank him to lay his finger on the place where any such thing was said., He has occupied his hour and a half, and he has not ventured to try to sustain his assertion., He never will., But he is desirous of knowing how we are going to reverse that Dred Scott decision., Judge Douglas ought to know how., Did not he and his political friends find a way to reverse the decision of that same court in favor of the constitutionality of the National Bank?, Didn't they find a way to do it so effectually that they have reversed it as completely as any decision ever was reversed, so far as its practical operation is concerned?, And let me ask you, didn't Judge Douglas find a way to reverse the decision of our Supreme Court when it decided that Carlin's father--old Governor Carlin had not the constitutional power to remove a Secretary of State?, Did he not appeal to the ""MOBS,"" as he calls them?, Did he not make speeches in the lobby to show how villainous that decision was, and how it ought to be overthrown?, Did he not succeed, too, in getting an act passed by the Legislature to have it overthrown?, And did n't he himself sit down on that bench as one of the five added judges, who were to overslaugh the four old ones, getting his name of ""judge"" in that way, and no other?, If there is a villainy in using disrespect or making opposition to Supreme Court decisions, I commend it to Judge Douglas's earnest consideration., I know of no man in the State of Illinois who ought to know so well about how much villainy it takes to oppose a decision of the Supreme Court as our honorable friend Stephen A. Douglas., Judge Douglas also makes the declaration that I say the Democrats are bound by the Dred Scott decision, while the Republicans are not., In the sense in which he argues, I never said it; but I will tell you what I have said and what I do not hesitate to repeat to-day., I have said that as the Democrats believe that decision to be correct, and that the extension of slavery is affirmed in the National Constitution, they are bound to support it as such; and I will tell you here that General Jackson once said each man was bound to support the Constitution ""as he understood it."", Now, Judge Douglas understands the Constitution according to the Dred Scott decision, and he is bound to support it as he understands it., I understand it another way, and therefore I am bound to support it in the way in which I understand it., And as Judge Douglas believes that decision to be correct, I will remake that argument if I have time to do so., Let me talk to some gentleman down there among you who looks me in the face., We will say you are a member of the Territorial Legislature, and, like Judge Douglas, you believe that the right to take and hold slaves there is a constitutional right The first thing you do is to swear you will support the Constitution, and all rights guaranteed therein; that you will, whenever your neighbor needs your legislation to support his constitutional rights, not withhold that legislation., If you withhold that necessary legislation for the support of the Constitution and constitutional rights, do you not commit perjury?, I ask every sensible man if that is not so?, That is undoubtedly just so, say what you please., ...]",3
245,"[I have said that that evidence was very strong in the fact that when Dred Scott was declared to be a slave, the owner of him made him free, showing that he had had the case tried and the question settled for such use as could be made of that decision; he cared nothing about the property thus declared to be his by that decision., But my time is out, and I can say no more., I have been somewhat, in my own mind, complimented by a large portion of Judge Douglas's speech,--I mean that portion which he devotes to the controversy between himself and the present Administration., This is the seventh time Judge Douglas and myself have met in these joint discussions, and he has been gradually improving in regard to his war with the Administration., At Quincy, day before yesterday, he was a little more severe upon the Administration than I had heard him upon any occasion, and I took pains to compliment him for it., I then told him to give it to them with all the power he had; and as some of them were present, I told them I would be very much obliged if they would give it to him in about the same way., I take it he has now vastly improved upon the attack he made then upon the Administration., I flatter myself he has really taken my advice on this subject., All I can say now is to re-commend to him and to them what I then commended,--to prosecute the war against one another in the most vigorous manner., I say to them again: ""Go it, husband!--Go it, bear!"", There is one other thing I will mention before I leave this branch of the discussion,--although I do not consider it much of my business, anyway., I refer to that part of the Judge's remarks where he undertakes to involve Mr. Buchanan in an inconsistency., He reads something from Mr. Buchanan, from which he undertakes to involve him in an inconsistency; and he gets something of a cheer for having done so., I would only remind the Judge that while he is very valiantly fighting for the Nebraska Bill and the repeal of the Missouri Compromise, it has been but a little while since he was the valiant advocate of the Missouri Compromise., I want to know if Buchanan has not as much right to be inconsistent as Douglas has?, Has Douglas the exclusive right, in this country, of being on all sides of all questions?, Is nobody allowed that high privilege but himself?, Is he to have an entire monopoly on that subject?, So far as Judge Douglas addressed his speech to me, or so far as it was about me, it is my business to pay some attention to it., I have heard the Judge state two or three times what he has stated to-day, that in a speech which I made at Springfield, Illinois, I had in a very especial manner complained that the Supreme Court in the Dred Scott case had decided that a negro could never be a citizen of the United States., I have omitted by some accident heretofore to analyze this statement, and it is required of me to notice it now., In point of fact it is untrue., I never have complained especially of the Dred Scott decision because it held that a negro could not be a citizen, and the Judge is always wrong when he says I ever did so complain of it., I have the speech here, and I will thank him or any of his friends to show where I said that a negro should be a citizen, and complained especially of the Dred Scott decision because it declared he could not be one., I have done no such thing; and Judge Douglas, so persistently insisting that I have done so, has strongly impressed me with the belief of a predetermination on his part to misrepresent me., He could not get his foundation for insisting that I was in favor of this negro equality anywhere else as well as he could by assuming that untrue proposition., Let me tell this audience what is true in regard to that matter; and the means by which they may correct me if I do not tell them truly is by a recurrence to the speech itself., I spoke of the Dred Scott decision in my Springfield speech, and I was then endeavoring to prove that the Dred Scott decision was a portion of a system or scheme to make slavery national in this country., I pointed out what things had been decided by the court., I mentioned as a fact that they had decided that a negro could not be a citizen; that they had done so, as I supposed, to deprive the negro, under all circumstances, of the remotest possibility of ever becoming a citizen and claiming the rights of a citizen of the United States under a certain clause of the Constitution., I stated that, without making any complaint of it at all., I then went on and stated the other points decided in the case; namely, that the bringing of a negro into the State of Illinois and holding him in slavery for two years here was a matter in regard to which they would not decide whether it would make him free or not; that they decided the further point that taking him into a United States Territory where slavery was prohibited by Act of Congress did not make him free, because that Act of Congress, as they held, was unconstitutional., I mentioned these three things as making up the points decided in that case., I mentioned them in a lump, taken in connection with the introduction of the Nebraska Bill, and the amendment of Chase, offered at the time, declaratory of the right of the people of the Territories to exclude slavery, which was voted down by the friends of the bill., I mentioned all these things together, as evidence tending to prove a combination and conspiracy to make the institution of slavery national., In that connection and in that way I mentioned the decision on the point that a negro could not be a citizen, and in no other connection., Out of this Judge Douglas builds up his beautiful fabrication of my purpose to introduce a perfect social and political equality between the white and black races., His assertion that I made an ""especial objection"" (that is his exact language) to the decision on this account is untrue in point of fact., Now, while I am upon this subject, and as Henry Clay has been alluded to, I desire to place myself, in connection with Mr. Clay, as nearly right before this people as may be., I am quite aware what the Judge's object is here by all these allusions., He knows that we are before an audience having strong sympathies southward, by relationship, place of birth, and so on., He desires to place me in an extremely Abolition attitude., He read upon a former occasion, and alludes, without reading, to-day to a portion of a speech which I delivered in Chicago., In his quotations from that speech, as he has made them upon former occasions, the extracts were taken in such a way as, I suppose, brings them within the definition of what is called garbling,--taking portions of a speech which, when taken by themselves, do not present the entire sense of the speaker as expressed at the time., I propose, therefore, out of that same speech, to show how one portion of it which he skipped over (taking an extract before and an extract after) will give a different idea, and the true idea I intended to convey., It will take me some little time to read it, but I believe I will occupy the time that way., You have heard him frequently allude to my controversy with him in regard to the Declaration of Independence., I confess that I have had a struggle with Judge Douglas on that matter, and I will try briefly to place myself right in regard to it on this occasion., I said--and it is between the extracts Judge Douglas has taken from this speech, and put in his published speeches:  ""It may be argued that there are certain conditions that make necessities and impose them upon us, and to the extent that a necessity is imposed upon a man he must submit to it., I think that was the condition in which we found ourselves when we established this government., We had slaves among us, we could not get our Constitution unless we permitted them to remain in slavery, we could not secure the good we did secure if we grasped for more; and having by necessity submitted to that much, it does not destroy the principle that is the charter of our liberties., Let the charter remain as our standard."", Now, I have upon all occasions declared as strongly as Judge Douglas against the disposition to interfere with the existing institution of slavery., You hear me read it from the same speech from which he takes garbled extracts for the purpose of proving upon me a disposition to interfere with the institution of slavery, and establish a perfect social and political equality between negroes and white people., Allow me while upon this subject briefly to present one other extract from a speech of mine, more than a year ago, at Springfield, in discussing this very same question, soon after Judge Douglas took his ground that negroes were, not included in the Declaration of Independence:  There again are the sentiments I have expressed in regard to the Declaration of Independence upon a former occasion,--sentiments which have been put in print and read wherever anybody cared to know what so humble an individual as myself chose to say in regard to it., At Galesburgh, the other day, I said, in answer to Judge Douglas, that three years ago there never had been a man, so far as I knew or believed, in the whole world, who had said that the Declaration of Independence did not include negroes in the term ""all men."", I reassert it to-day., I assert that Judge Douglas and all his friends may search the whole records of the country, and it will be a matter of great astonishment to me if they shall be able to find that one human being three years ago had ever uttered the astounding sentiment that the term ""all men"" in the Declaration did not include the negro., Do not let me be misunderstood., I know that more than three years ago there were men who, finding this assertion constantly in the way of their schemes to bring about the ascendency and perpetuation of slavery, denied the truth of it., I know that Mr. Calhoun and all the politicians of his school denied the truth of the Declaration., I know that it ran along in the mouth of some Southern men for a period of years, ending at last in that shameful, though rather forcible, declaration of Pettit of Indiana, upon the floor of the United States Senate, that the Declaration of Independence was in that respect ""a self-evident lie,"" rather than a self-evident truth., But I say, with a perfect knowledge of all this hawking at the Declaration without directly attacking it, that three years ago there never had lived a man who had ventured to assail it in the sneaking way of pretending to believe it, and then asserting it did not include the negro., I believe the first man who ever said it was Chief Justice Taney in the Dred Scott case, and the next to him was our friend Stephen A. Douglas., And now it has become the catchword of the entire party., I would like to call upon his friends everywhere to consider how they have come in so short a time to view this matter in a way so entirely different from their former belief; to ask whether they are not being borne along by an irresistible current,--whither, they know not., In answer to my proposition at Galesburgh last week, I see that some man in Chicago has got up a letter, addressed to the Chicago Times, to show, as he professes, that somebody had said so before; and he signs himself ""An Old-Line Whig,"" if I remember correctly., In the first place, I would say he was not an old-line Whig., I am somewhat acquainted with old-line Whigs from the origin to the end of that party; I became pretty well acquainted with them, and I know they always had some sense, whatever else you could ascribe to them., I know there never was one who had not more sense than to try to show by the evidence he produces that some men had, prior to the time I named, said that negroes were not included in the term ""all men"" in the Declaration of Independence., What is the evidence he produces?, I will bring forward his evidence, and let you see what he offers by way of showing that somebody more than three years ago had said negroes were not included in the Declaration., He brings forward part of a speech from Henry Clay,--the part of the speech of Henry Clay which I used to bring forward to prove precisely the contrary., I guess we are surrounded to some extent to-day by the old friends of Mr. Clay, and they will be glad to hear anything from that authority., While he was in Indiana a man presented a petition to liberate his negroes, and he (Mr. Clay) made a speech in answer to it, which I suppose he carefully wrote out himself and caused to be published., I have before me an extract from that speech which constitutes the evidence this pretended ""Old-Line Whig"" at Chicago brought forward to show that Mr. Clay did n't suppose the negro was included in the Declaration of Independence., Hear what Mr. Clay said:  This is the entire quotation brought forward to prove that somebody previous to three years ago had said the negro was not included in the term ""all men"" in the Declaration., How does it do so?, In what way has it a tendency to prove that?, Mr. Clay says it is true as an abstract principle that all men are created equal, but that we cannot practically apply it in all eases., He illustrates this by bringing forward the cases of females, minors, and insane persons, with whom it cannot be enforced; but he says it is true as an abstract principle in the organization of society as well as in organized society and it should be kept in view as a fundamental principle., Let me read a few words more before I add some comments of my own., Mr. Clay says, a little further on:  Now, here in this same book, in this same speech, in this same extract, brought forward to prove that Mr. Clay held that the negro was not included in the Declaration of Independence, is no such statement on his part, but the declaration that it is a great fundamental truth which should be constantly kept in view in the organization of society and in societies already organized., But if I say a word about it; if I attempt, as Mr. Clay said all good men ought to do, to keep it in view; if, in this ""organized society,"" I ask to have the public eye turned upon it; if I ask, in relation to the organization of new Territories, that the public eye should be turned upon it, forthwith I am vilified as you hear me to-day., What have I done that I have not the license of Henry Clay's illustrious example here in doing?, Have I done aught that I have not his authority for, while maintaining that in organizing new Territories and societies this fundamental principle should be regarded, and in organized society holding it up to the public view and recognizing what he recognized as the great principle of free government?, And when this new principle--this new proposition that no human being ever thought of three years ago--is brought forward, I combat it as having an evil tendency, if not an evil design., I combat it as having a tendency to dehumanize the negro, to take away from him the right of ever striving to be a man., I combat it as being one of the thousand things constantly done in these days to prepare the public mind to make property, and nothing but property, of the negro in all the States of this Union., But there is a point that I wish, before leaving this part of the discussion, to ask attention to., I have read and I repeat the words of Henry Clay:  The principle upon which I have insisted in this canvass is in relation to laying the foundations of new societies., I have never sought to apply these principles to the old States for the purpose of abolishing slavery in those States., It is nothing but a miserable perversion of what I have said, to assume that I have declared Missouri, or any other slave State, shall emancipate her slaves; I have proposed no such thing., But when Mr. Clay says that in laying the foundations of society in our Territories where it does not exist, he would be opposed to the introduction of slavery as an element, I insist that we have his warrant--his license--for insisting upon the exclusion of that element which he declared in such strong and emphatic language was most hurtful to him., Judge Douglas has again referred to a Springfield speech in which I said ""a house divided against itself cannot stand."", The Judge has so often made the entire quotation from that speech that I can make it from memory., I used this language:  ""We are now far into the fifth year since a policy was initiated with the avowed object and confident promise of putting an end to the slavery agitation., Under the operation of this policy, that agitation has not only not ceased, but has constantly augmented., In my opinion it will not cease until a crisis shall have been reached and passed., 'A house divided against itself cannot stand.', ...]",3
246,"[And I understand as well as Judge Douglas, or anybody else, that these mutual accommodations are the cements which bind together the different parts of this Union; that instead of being a thing to ""divide the house,""--figuratively expressing the Union,--they tend to sustain it; they are the props of the house, tending always to hold it up., But when I have admitted all this, I ask if there is any parallel between these things and this institution of slavery?, I do not see that there is any parallel at all between them., Consider it., When have we had any difficulty or quarrel amongst ourselves about the cranberry laws of Indiana, or the oyster laws of Virginia, or the pine-lumber laws of Maine, or the fact that Louisiana produces sugar, and Illinois flour?, When have we had any quarrels over these things?, When have we had perfect peace in regard to this thing which I say is an element of discord in this Union?, We have sometimes had peace, but when was it?, It was when the institution of slavery remained quiet where it was., We have had difficulty and turmoil whenever it has made a struggle to spread itself where it was not., I ask, then, if experience does not speak in thunder-tones telling us that the policy which has given peace to the country heretofore, being returned to, gives the greatest promise of peace again., You may say, and Judge Douglas has intimated the same thing, that all this difficulty in regard to the institution of slavery is the mere agitation of office-seekers and ambitious Northern politicians., He thinks we want to get ""his place,"" I suppose., I agree that there are office-seekers amongst us., The Bible says somewhere that we are desperately selfish., I think we would have discovered that fact without the Bible., I do not claim that I am any less so than the average of men, but I do claim that I am not more selfish than Judge Douglas., But is it true that all the difficulty and agitation we have in regard to this institution of slavery spring from office-seeking, from the mere ambition of politicians?, Is that the truth?, How many times have we had danger from this question?, Go back to the day of the Missouri Compromise., Go back to the nullification question, at the bottom of which lay this same slavery question., Go back to the time of the annexation of Texas., Go back to the troubles that led to the Compromise of 1850., You will find that every time, with the single exception of the Nullification question, they sprung from an endeavor to spread this institution., There never was a party in the history of this country, and there probably never will be, of sufficient strength to disturb the general peace of the country., Parties themselves may be divided and quarrel on minor questions, yet it extends not beyond the parties themselves., But does not this question make a disturbance outside of political circles?, Does it not enter into the churches and rend them asunder?, What divided the great Methodist Church into two parts, North and South?, What has raised this constant disturbance in every Presbyterian General Assembly that meets?, What disturbed the Unitarian Church in this very city two years ago?, What has jarred and shaken the great American Tract Society recently, not yet splitting it, but sure to divide it in the end?, Is it not this same mighty, deep-seated power that somehow operates on the minds of men, exciting and stirring them up in every avenue of society,--in politics, in religion, in literature, in morals, in all the manifold relations of life?, Is this the work of politicians?, Is that irresistible power, which for fifty years has shaken the government and agitated the people, to be stifled and subdued by pretending that it is an exceedingly simple thing, and we ought not to talk about it?, If you will get everybody else to stop talking about it, I assure you I will quit before they have half done so., But where is the philosophy or statesmanship which assumes that you can quiet that disturbing element in our society which has disturbed us for more than half a century, which has been the only serious danger that has threatened our institutions,--I say, where is the philosophy or the statesmanship based on the assumption that we are to quit talking about it, and that the public mind is all at once to cease being agitated by it?, Yet this is the policy here in the North that Douglas is advocating, that we are to care nothing about it!, I ask you if it is not a false philosophy., Is it not a false statesmanship that undertakes to build up a system of policy upon the basis of caring nothing about the very thing that everybody does care the most about--a thing which all experience has shown we care a very great deal about?, The Judge alludes very often in the course of his remarks to the exclusive right which the States have to decide the whole thing for themselves., I agree with him very readily that the different States have that right., He is but fighting a man of straw when he assumes that I am contending against the right of the States to do as they please about it., Our controversy with him is in regard to the new Territories., We agree that when the States come in as States they have the right and the power to do as they please., We have no power as citizens of the free-States, or in our Federal capacity as members of the Federal Union through the General Government, to disturb slavery in the States where it exists., We profess constantly that we have no more inclination than belief in the power of the government to disturb it; yet we are driven constantly to defend ourselves from the assumption that we are warring upon the rights of the Sates., What I insist upon is, that the new Territories shall be kept free from it while in the Territorial condition., Judge Douglas assumes that we have no interest in them,--that we have no right whatever to interfere., I think we have some interest., I think that as white men we have., Do we not wish for an outlet for our surplus population, if I may so express myself?, Do we not feel an interest in getting to that outlet with such institutions as we would like to have prevail there?, If you go to the Territory opposed to slavery, and another man comes upon the same ground with his slave, upon the assumption that the things are equal, it turns out that he has the equal right all his way, and you have no part of it your way., If he goes in and makes it a slave Territory, and by consequence a slave State, is it not time that those who desire to have it a free State were on equal ground?, Let me suggest it in a different way., How many Democrats are there about here [""A thousand""] who have left slave States and come into the free State of Illinois to get rid of the institution of slavery?, [Another voice: ""A thousand and one.""], I reckon there are a thousand and one., I will ask you, if the policy you are now advocating had prevailed when this country was in a Territorial condition, where would you have gone to get rid of it?, Where would you have found your free State or Territory to go to?, And when hereafter, for any cause, the people in this place shall desire to find new homes, if they wish to be rid of the institution, where will they find the place to go to?, Now, irrespective of the moral aspect of this question as to whether there is a right or wrong in enslaving a negro, I am still in favor of our new Territories being in such a condition that white men may find a home,--may find some spot where they can better their condition; where they can settle upon new soil and better their condition in life., I am in favor of this, not merely (I must say it here as I have elsewhere) for our own people who are born amongst us, but as an outlet for free white people everywhere the world over--in which Hans, and Baptiste, and Patrick, and all other men from all the world, may find new homes and better their conditions in life., I have stated upon former occasions, and I may as well state again, what I understand to be the real issue in this controversy between Judge Douglas and myself., On the point of my wanting to make war between the free and the slave States, there has been no issue between us., So, too, when he assumes that I am in favor of producing a perfect social and political equality between the white and black races., These are false issues, upon which Judge Douglas has tried to force the controversy., There is no foundation in truth for the charge that I maintain either of these propositions., The real issue in this controversy--the one pressing upon every mind--is the sentiment on the part of one class that looks upon the institution of slavery as a wrong, and of another class that does not look upon it as a wrong., The sentiment that contemplates the institution of slavery in this country as a wrong is the sentiment of the Republican party., It is the sentiment around which all their actions, all their arguments, circle, from which all their propositions radiate., They look upon it as being a moral, social, and political wrong; and while they contemplate it as such, they nevertheless have due regard for its actual existence among us, and the difficulties of getting rid of it in any satisfactory way, and to all the constitutional obligations thrown about it., Yet, having a due regard for these, they desire a policy in regard to it that looks to its not creating any more danger., They insist that it should, as far as may be, be treated as a wrong; and one of the methods of treating it as a wrong is to make provision that it shall grow no larger., They also desire a policy that looks to a peaceful end of slavery at some time., These are the views they entertain in regard to it as I understand them; and all their sentiments, all their arguments and propositions, are brought within this range., I have said, and I repeat it here, that if there be a man amongst us who does not think that the institution of slavery is wrong in any one of the aspects of which I have spoken, he is misplaced, and ought not to be with us., And if there be a man amongst us who is so impatient of it as a wrong as to disregard its actual presence among us and the difficulty of getting rid of it suddenly in a satisfactory way, and to disregard the constitutional obligations thrown about it, that man is misplaced if he is on our platform., We disclaim sympathy with him in practical action., He is not placed properly with us., On this subject of treating it as a wrong, and limiting its spread, let me say a word., Has anything ever threatened the existence of this Union save and except this very institution of slavery?, What is it that we hold most dear amongst us?, Our own liberty and prosperity., What has ever threatened our liberty and prosperity, save and except this institution of slavery?, If this is true, how do you propose to improve the condition of things by enlarging slavery, by spreading it out and making it bigger?, You may have a wen or cancer upon your person, and not be able to cut it out, lest you bleed to death; but surely it is no way to cure it, to engraft it and spread it over your whole body., That is no proper way of treating what you regard a wrong., You see this peaceful way of dealing with it as a wrong, restricting the spread of it, and not allowing it to go into new countries where it has not already existed., That is the peaceful way, the old-fashioned way, the way in which the fathers themselves set us the example., On the other hand, I have said there is a sentiment which treats it as not being wrong., That is the Democratic sentiment of this day., I do not mean to say that every man who stands within that range positively asserts that it is right., That class will include all who positively assert that it is right, and all who, like Judge Douglas, treat it as indifferent and do not say it is either right or wrong., These two classes of men fall within the general class of those who do not look upon it as a wrong., And if there be among you anybody who supposes that he, as a Democrat, can consider himself ""as much opposed to slavery as anybody,"" I would like to reason with him., You never treat it as a wrong., What other thing that you consider as a wrong do you deal with as you deal with that?, ...]",3
247,"[But it cannot be made available to them without Congressional legislation., In the Judge's language, it is a ""barren right,"" which needs legislation before it can become efficient and valuable to the persons to whom it is guaranteed., And as the right is constitutional, I agree that the legislation shall be granted to it, and that not that we like the institution of slavery., We profess to have no taste for running and catching niggers, at least, I profess no taste for that job at all., Why then do I yield support to a Fugitive Slave law?, Because I do not understand that the Constitution, which guarantees that right, can be supported without it., And if I believed that the right to hold a slave in a Territory was equally fixed in the Constitution with the right to reclaim fugitives, I should be bound to give it the legislation necessary to support it., I say that no man can deny his obligation to give the necessary legislation to support slavery in a Territory, who believes it is a constitutional right to have it there., No man can, who does not give the Abolitionists an argument to deny the obligation enjoined by the Constitution to enact a Fugitive State law., Try it now., It is the strongest Abolition argument ever made., I say if that Dred Scott decision is correct, then the right to hold slaves in a Territory is equally a constitutional right with the right of a slaveholder to have his runaway returned., No one can show the distinction between them., The one is express, so that we cannot deny it., The other is construed to be in the Constitution, so that he who believes the decision to be correct believes in the right., And the man who argues that by unfriendly legislation, in spite of that constitutional right, slavery may be driven from the Territories, cannot avoid furnishing an argument by which Abolitionists may deny the obligation to return fugitives, and claim the power to pass laws unfriendly to the right of the slaveholder to reclaim his fugitive., I do not know how such an arguement may strike a popular assembly like this, but I defy anybody to go before a body of men whose minds are educated to estimating evidence and reasoning, and show that there is an iota of difference between the constitutional right to reclaim a fugitive and the constitutional right to hold a slave, in a Territory, provided this Dred Scott decision is correct, I defy any man to make an argument that will justify unfriendly legislation to deprive a slaveholder of his right to hold his slave in a Territory, that will not equally, in all its length, breadth, and thickness, furnish an argument for nullifying the Fugitive Slave law., Why, there is not such an Abolitionist in the nation as Douglas, after all!, such an Abolitionist in the nation as Douglas, after all!, Your letter introducing Mr. Faree was duly received., There was no opening to nominate him for Superintendent of Public Instruction, but through him Egypt made a most valuable contribution to the convention., I think it may be fairly said that he came off the lion of the day--or rather of the night., Can you not elect him to the Legislature?, It seems to me he would be hard to beat., What objection could be made to him?, What is your Senator Martin saying and doing?, What is Webb about?, Your letter enclosing the attack of the Times upon me was received this morning., Give yourself no concern about my voting against the supplies., Unless you are without faith that a lie can be successfully contradicted, there is not a word of truth in the charge, and I am just considering a little as to the best shape to put a contradiction in., Show this to whomever you please, but do not publish it in the paper., Yours of the 22nd, inclosing a draft of two hundred dollars, was duly received., I have paid it on the judgment, and herewith you have the receipt., I do not wish to say anything as to who shall be the Republican candidate for the Legislature in your district, further than that I have full confidence in Dr., Hull., Have you ever got in the way of consulting with McKinley in political matters?, He is true as steel, and his judgment is very good., The last I heard from him, he rather thought Weldon, of De Witt, was our best timber for representative, all things considered., But you there must settle it among yourselves., It may well puzzle older heads than yours to understand how, as the Dred Scott decision holds, Congress can authorize a Territorial Legislature to do everything else, and cannot authorize them to prohibit slavery., That is one of the things the court can decide, but can never give an intelligible reason for., In 1856 you gave me authority to draw on you for any sum not exceeding five hundred dollars., I see clearly that such a privilege would be more available now than it was then., I am aware that times are tighter now than they were then., Please write me at all events, and whether you can now do anything or not I shall continue grateful for the past., I write this to say that from the specimens of Douglas Democracy we occasionally see here from Madison, we learn that they are making very confident calculation of beating you and your friends for the lower house, in that county., They offer to bet upon it., Billings and Job, respectively, have been up here, and were each as I learn, talking largely about it., If they do so, it can only be done by carrying the Fillmore men of 1856 very differently from what they seem to [be] going in the other party., Below is the vote of 1856, in your district:  By this you will see, if you go through the calculation, that if they get one quarter of the Fillmore votes, and you three quarters, they will beat you 125 votes., If they get one fifth, and you four fifths, you beat them 179., In Madison, alone, if our friends get 1000 of the Fillmore votes, and their opponents the remainder, 658, we win by just two votes., This shows the whole field, on the basis of the election of 1856., Whether, since then, any Buchanan, or Fremonters, have shifted ground, and how the majority of new votes will go, you can judge better than I., Of course you, on the ground, can better determine your line of tactics than any one off the ground; but it behooves you to be wide awake and actively working., Don't neglect it; and write me at your first leisure., Yours as ever, Your kind and interesting letter of the 19th was duly received., Your suggestions as to placing one's self on the offensive rather than the defensive are certainly correct., That is a point which I shall not disregard., I spoke here on Saturday night., The speech, not very well reported, appears in the State journal of this morning., You doubtless will see it; and I hope that you will perceive in it that I am already improving., I would mail you a copy now, but have not one [at] hand., I thank you for your letter and shall be pleased to hear from you again., Your doleful letter of the 8th was received on my return from Chicago last night., I do hope you are worse scared than hurt, though you ought to know best., We must not lose the district., We must make a job of it, and save it., Lay hold of the proper agencies, and secure all the Americans you can, at once., I do hope, on closer inspection, you will find they are not half gone., Make a little test., Run down one of the poll-books of the Edwardsville precinct, and take the first hundred known American names., Then quietly ascertain how many of them are actually going for Douglas., I think you will find less than fifty., But even if you find fifty, make sure of the other fifty, that is, make sure of all you can, at all events., We will set other agencies to work which shall compensate for the loss of a good many Americans., Don't fail to check the stampede at once., Trumbull, I think, will be with you before long., There is much he cannot do, and some he can., I have reason to hope there will be other help of an appropriate kind., Write me again., I have a letter from a very true and intelligent man insisting that there is a plan on foot in La Salle and Bureau to run Douglas Republicans for Congress and for the Legislature in those counties, if they can only get the encouragement of our folks nominating pretty extreme abolitionists., It is thought they will do nothing if our folks nominate men who are not very obnoxious to the charge of abolitionism., Please have your eye upon this., Signs are looking pretty fair., Since we parted last evening no new thought has occurred to [me] on the subject of which we talked most yesterday., I have concluded, however, to speak at your town on Tuesday, August 31st, and have promised to have it so appear in the papers of to-morrow., Judge Trumbull has not yet reached here., Yours of the 6th received., If life and health continue I shall pretty likely be at Augusta on the 25th., Things look reasonably well., Will tell you more fully when I see you., Yours of the 18th, signed as secretary of the Republican club, is received., In the matter of making speeches I am a good deal pressed by invitations from almost all quarters, and while I hope to be at Urbana some time during the canvass, I cannot yet say when., Can you not see me at Monticello on the 6th of September?, Douglas and I, for the first time this canvass, crossed swords here yesterday; the fire flew some, and I am glad to know I am yet alive., There was a vast concourse of people--more than could get near enough to hear., As I would not be a slave, so I would not be a master., This expresses my idea of democracy., Whatever differs from this, to the extent of the difference, is no democracy., ...]",3
248,"[Perhaps I am wrong in saying that he is afraid, so I will correct myself by saying that he pretends to fear that the success of our party will result in the amalgamation of the blacks and whites., I think I can show plainly, from documents now before me, that Judge Douglas's fears are groundless., The census of 1800 tells us that in that year there were over four hundred thousand mulattoes in the United States., Now let us take what is called an Abolition State--the Republican, slavery-hating State of New Hampshire--and see how many mulattoes we can find within her borders., The number amounts to just one hundred and eighty-four., In the Old Dominion--in the Democratic and aristocratic State of Virginia--there were a few more mulattoes than the Census-takers found in New Hampshire., How many do you suppose there were?, Seventy-nine thousand, seven hundred and seventy-five--twenty-three thousand more than there were in all the free States!, In the slave States there were in 1800, three hundred and forty-eight thousand mulattoes all of home production; and in the free States there were less than sixty thousand mulattoes--and a large number of them were imported from the South., I have been requested to give a concise statement of the difference, as I understand it, between the Democratic and Republican parties, on the leading issues of the campaign., This question has been put to me by a gentleman whom I do not know., I do not even know whether he is a friend of mine or a supporter of Judge Douglas in this contest, nor does that make any difference., His question is a proper one., Lest I should forget it, I will give you my answer before proceeding with the line of argument I have marked out for this discussion., The difference between the Republican and the Democratic parties on the leading issues of this contest, as I understand it, is that the former consider slavery a moral, social and political wrong, while the latter do not consider it either a moral, a social or a political wrong; and the action of each, as respects the growth of the country and the expansion of our population, is squared to meet these views., I will not affirm that the Democratic party consider slavery morally, socially and politically right, though their tendency to that view has, in my opinion, been constant and unmistakable for the past five years., I prefer to take, as the accepted maxim of the party, the idea put forth by Judge Douglas, that he ""don't care whether slavery is voted down or voted up."", I am quite willing to believe that many Democrats would prefer that slavery should be always voted down, and I know that some prefer that it be always voted up; but I have a right to insist that their action, especially if it be their constant action, shall determine their ideas and preferences on this subject., Every measure of the Democratic party of late years, bearing directly or indirectly on the slavery question, has corresponded with this notion of utter indifference whether slavery or freedom shall outrun in the race of empire across to the Pacific--every measure, I say, up to the Dred Scott decision, where, it seems to me, the idea is boldly suggested that slavery is better than freedom., The Republican party, on the contrary, hold that this government was instituted to secure the blessings of freedom, and that slavery is an unqualified evil to the negro, to the white man, to the soil, and to the State., Regarding it as an evil, they will not molest it in the States where it exists, they will not overlook the constitutional guards which our fathers placed around it; they will do nothing that can give proper offence to those who hold slaves by legal sanction; but they will use every constitutional method to prevent the evil from becoming larger and involving more negroes, more white men, more soil, and more States in its deplorable consequences., They will, if possible, place it where the public mind shall rest in the belief that it is in course of ultimate peaceable extinction in God's own good time., And to this end they will, if possible, restore the government to the policy of the fathers, the policy of preserving the new Territories from the baneful influence of human bondage, as the Northwestern Territories were sought to be preserved by the Ordinance of 1787, and the Compromise Act of 1820., They will oppose, in all its length and breadth, the modern Democratic idea, that slavery is as good as freedom, and ought to have room for expansion all over the continent, if people can be found to carry it., All, or nearly all, of Judge Douglas's arguments are logical, if you admit that slavery is as good and as right as freedom, and not one of them is worth a rush if you deny it., This is the difference, as I understand it, between the Republican and Democratic parties., My friends, I have endeavored to show you the logical consequences of the Dred Scott decision, which holds that the people of a Territory cannot prevent the establishment of slavery in their midst., I have stated what cannot be gainsaid, that the grounds upon which this decision is made are equally applicable to the free States as to the free Territories, and that the peculiar reasons put forth by Judge Douglas for indorsing this decision commit him, in advance, to the next decision and to all other decisions corning from the same source., And when, by all these means, you have succeeded in dehumanizing the negro; when you have put him down and made it impossible for him to be but as the beasts of the field; when you have extinguished his soul in this world and placed him where the ray of hope is blown out as in the darkness of the damned, are you quite sure that the demon you have roused will not turn and rend you?, What constitutes the bulwark of our own liberty and independence?, It is not our frowning battlements, our bristling sea coasts, our army and our navy., These are not our reliance against tyranny All of those may be turned against us without making us weaker for the struggle., Our reliance is in the love of liberty which God has planted in us., Our defense is in the spirit which prizes liberty as the heritage of all men, in all lands everywhere., Destroy this spirit and you have planted the seeds of despotism at your own doors., Familiarize yourselves with the chains of bondage and you prepare your own limbs to wear them., Accustomed to trample on the rights of others, you have lost the genius of your own independence and become the fit subjects of the first cunning tyrant who rises among you., And let me tell you, that all these things are prepared for you by the teachings of history, if the elections shall promise that the next Dred Scott decision and all future decisions will be quietly acquiesced in by the people., A sweet plaintive song did I hear      And I fancied that she was the singer., May emotions as pure as that song set astir      Be the wont that the future shall bring her., I do not perceive how I can express myself more plainly than I have in the fore-going extracts., In four of them I have expressly disclaimed all intention to bring about social and political equality between the white and black races and in all the rest I have done the same thing by clear implication., I have made it equally plain that I think the negro is included in the word ""men"" used in the Declaration of Independence., I believe the declaration that ""all men are created equal"" is the great fundamental principle upon which our free institutions rest; that negro slavery is violative of that principle; but that, by our frame of government, that principle has not been made one of legal obligation; that by our frame of government, States which have slavery are to retain it, or surrender it at their own pleasure; and that all others--individuals, free States and national Government--are constitutionally bound to leave them alone about it., I believe our Government was thus framed because of the necessity springing from the actual presence of slavery, when it was framed., That such necessity does not exist in the Territories when slavery is not present., In his Mendenhall speech Mr. Clay says: ""Now as an abstract principle there is no doubt of the truth of that declaration (all men created equal), and it is desirable, in the original construction of society, to keep it in view as a great fundamental principle."", Again, in the same speech Mr. Clay says: ""If a state of nature existed and we were about to lay the foundations of society, no man would be more strongly opposed than I should to incorporate the institution of slavery among its elements."", Exactly so., In our new free Territories, a state of nature does exist., In them Congress lays the foundations of society; and in laying those foundations, I say, with Mr. Clay, it is desirable that the declaration of the equality of all men shall be kept in view as a great fundamental principle, and that Congress, which lays the foundations of society, should, like Mr. Clay, be strongly opposed to the incorporation of slavery and its elements., But it does not follow that social and political equality between whites and blacks must be incorporated because slavery must not., The declaration does not so require., -Since parting with you this morning I heard some things which make me believe that Edmunds and Morrill will spend this week among the National Democrats, trying to induce them to content themselves by voting for Jake Davis, and then to vote for the Douglas candidates for senator and representative., Have this headed off, if you can., Call Wagley's attention to it and have him and the National Democrat for Rep. to counteract it as far as they can., Yours of the 15th is just received., I wrote you the same day., As to the pecuniary matter, I am willing to pay according to my ability; but I am the poorest hand living to get others to pay., I have been on expenses so long without earning anything that I am absolutely without money now for even household purposes., Still, if you can put in two hundred and fifty dollars for me toward discharging the debt of the committee, I will allow it when you and I settle the private matter between us., This, with what I have already paid, and with an outstanding note of mine, will exceed my subscription of five hundred dollars., This, too, is exclusive of my ordinary expenses during the campaign, all of which, being added to my loss of time and business, bears pretty heavily upon one no better off in [this] world's goods than I; but as I had the post of honor, it is not for me to be over nice., You are feeling badly,--""And this too shall pass away,"" never fear., Yours of the 13th was received some days ago., The fight must go on., The cause of civil liberty must not be surrendered at the end of one or even one hundred defeats., Douglas had the ingenuity to be supported in the late contest both as the best means to break down and to uphold the slave interest., No ingenuity can keep these antagonistic elements in harmony long., Another explosion will soon come., I wish to preserve a set of the late debates (if they may be called so), between Douglas and myself., To enable me to do so, please get two copies of each number of your paper containing the whole, and send them to me by express; and I will pay you for the papers and for your trouble., I wish the two sets in order to lay one away in the [undecipherable word] and to put the other in a scrapbook., Remember, if part of any debate is on both sides of the sheet it will take two sets to make one scrap-book., I believe, according to a letter of yours to Hatch, you are ""feeling like h-ll yet."", Quit that--you will soon feel better., Another ""blow up"" is coming; and we shall have fun again., Douglas managed to be supported both as the best instrument to down and to uphold the slave power; but no ingenuity can long keep the antagonism in harmony., Being desirous of preserving in some permanent form the late joint discussion between Douglas and myself, ten days ago I wrote to Dr. Ray, requesting him to forward to me by express two sets of the numbers of the Tribune which contain the reports of those discussions., Up to date I have no word from him on the subject., Will you, if in your power, procure them and forward them to me by express?, If you will, I will pay all charges, and be greatly obliged, to boot., Hoping to visit you before long, I remain  Your very kind letter of Nov. 9th was duly received., I do not know that you expected or desired an answer; but glancing over the contents of yours again, I am prompted to say that, while I desired the result of the late canvass to have been different, I still regard it as an exceeding small matter., I think we have fairly entered upon a durable struggle as to whether this nation is to ultimately become all slave or all free, and though I fall early in the contest, it is nothing if I shall have contributed, in the least degree, to the final rightful result., I expect the result of the election went hard with you., So it did with me, too, perhaps not quite so hard as you may have supposed., I have an abiding faith that we shall beat them in the long run., Step by step the objects of the leaders will become too plain for the people to stand them., I write merely to let you know that I am neither dead nor dying., Please give my respects to your good family, and all inquiring friends., Legislation and adjudication must follow and conform to the progress of society., The progress of society now begins to produce cases of the transfer for debts of the entire property of railroad corporations; and to enable transferees to use and enjoy the transferred property, legislation and adjudication begin to be necessary., Shall this class of legislation just now beginning with us be general or special?, Section Ten of our Constitution requires that it should be general,  if possible., Special legislation always trenches upon the judicial department; and in so far violates Section Two of the Constitution., (Read it.), Just reasoning--policy--is in favor of general legislation--else the Legislature will be loaded down with the investigation of smaller cases--a work which the courts ought to perform, and can perform much more perfectly., How can the Legislature rightly decide the facts between P. & B. and S.C., It is said that under a general law, whenever a R. R. Co. gets tired of its debts, it may transfer fraudulently to get rid of them., ...]",3
249,"[There are three substantial objections to this: First, no party can command respect which sustains this year what it opposed last., Secondly, Douglas (who is the most dangerous enemy of liberty, because the most insidious one) would have little support in the North, and by consequence, no capital to trade on in the South, if it were not for his friends thus magnifying him and his humbug., But lastly, and chiefly, Douglas's popular sovereignty, accepted by the public mind as a just principle, nationalizes slavery, and revives the African slave trade inevitably., Taking slaves into new Territories, and buying slaves in Africa, are identical things, identical rights or identical wrongs, and the argument which establishes one will establish the other., Try a thousand years for a sound reason why Congress shall not hinder the people of Kansas from having slaves, and, when you have found it, it will be an equally good one why Congress should not hinder the people of Georgia from importing slaves from Africa., As to Governor Chase, I have a kind side for him., He was one of the few distinguished men of the nation who gave us, in Illinois, their sympathy last year., I never saw him, but suppose him to be able and right-minded; but still he may not be the most suitable as a candidate for the Presidency., I must say I do not think myself fit for the Presidency., As you propose a correspondence with me, I shall look for your letters anxiously., I have not met Dr. Reynolds since receiving your letter; but when I shall, I will present your respects as requested., Yours of the 3d is just received., There is some mistake about my expected attendance of the U.S. Court in your city on the 3d Tuesday of this month., I have had no thought of being there., It is bad to be poor., I shall go to the wall for bread and meat if I neglect my business this year as well as last., It would please me much to see the city and good people of Keokuk, but for this year it is little less than an impossibility., I am constantly receiving invitations which I am compelled to decline., I was pressingly urged to go to Minnesota; and I now have two invitations to go to Ohio., These last are prompted by Douglas going there; and I am really tempted to make a flying trip to Columbus and Cincinnati., I do hope you will have no serious trouble in Iowa., What thinks Grimes about it?, I have not known him to be mistaken about an election in Iowa., Present my respects to Col. Carter, and any other friends, and believe me  I cannot fail to remember that I appear for the first time before an audience in this now great State,--an audience that is accustomed to hear such speakers as Corwin, and Chase, and Wade, and many other renowned men; and, remembering this, I feel that it will be well for you, as for me, that you should not raise your expectations to that standard to which you would have been justified in raising them had one of these distinguished men appeared before you., You would perhaps be only preparing a disappointment for yourselves, and, as a consequence of your disappointment, mortification to me., I hope, therefore, that you will commence with very moderate expectations; and perhaps, if you will give me your attention, I shall be able to interest you to a moderate degree., Appearing here for the first time in my life, I have been somewhat embarrassed for a topic by way of introduction to my speech; but I have been relieved from that embarrassment by an introduction which the Ohio Statesman newspaper gave me this morning., In this paper I have read an article, in which, among other statements, I find the following:  I mention this now, at the opening of my remarks, for the purpose of making three comments upon it., The first I have already announced,--it furnishes me an introductory topic; the second is to show that the gentleman is mistaken; thirdly, to give him an opportunity to correct it., In the first place, in regard to this matter being a mistake., I have found that it is not entirely safe, when one is misrepresented under his very nose, to allow the misrepresentation to go uncontradicted., I therefore propose, here at the outset, not only to say that this is a misrepresentation, but to show conclusively that it is so; and you will bear with me while I read a couple of extracts from that very ""memorable"" debate with Judge Douglas last year, to which this newspaper refers., In the first pitched battle which Senator Douglas and myself had, at the town of Ottawa, I used the language which I will now read., Having been previously reading an extract, I continued as follows:  ""Now, gentlemen, I don't want to read at any greater length, but this is the true complexion of all I have ever said in regard to the institution of slavery and the black race., This is the whole of it; and anything that argues me into his idea of perfect social and political equality with the negro, is but a specious and fantastic arrangement of words, by which a man can prove a horse-chestnut to be a chestnut horse., I will say here, while upon this subject, that I have no purpose directly or indirectly to interfere with the institution of slavery in the States where it exists., I believe I have no lawful right to do so, and I have no inclination to do so., I have no purpose to introduce political and social equality between the white and the black races., There is a physical difference between the two which, in my judgment, will probably forbid their ever living together upon the footing of perfect equality; and inasmuch as it becomes a necessity that there must be a difference, I, as well as Judge Douglas, am in favor of the race to which I belong having the superior position., I have never said anything to the contrary, but I hold that, notwithstanding all this, there is no reason in the world why the negro is not entitled to all the natural rights enumerated in the Declaration of Independence,--the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness., I hold that he is as much entitled to these as the white man., I agree with judge Douglas, he is not my equal in many respects,--certainly not in color, perhaps not in moral or intellectual endowments., But in the right to eat the bread, without leave of anybody else, which his own hand earns, he is my equal, and the equal of Judge Douglas, and the equal of every living man."", Upon a subsequent occasion, when the reason for making a statement like this occurred, I said:  ""While I was at the hotel to-day an elderly gentleman called upon me to know whether I was really in favor of producing perfect equality between the negroes and white people., While I had not proposed to myself on this occasion to say much on that subject, yet, as the question was asked me, I thought I would occupy perhaps five minutes in saying something in regard to it., I will say, then, that I am not, nor ever have been, in favor of bringing about in any way the social and political equality of the white and black races; that I am not, nor ever have been, in favor of making voters or jurors of negroes, nor of qualifying them to hold office, or intermarry with the white people; and I will say in addition to this that there is a physical difference between the white and black races which I believe will forever forbid the two races living together on terms of social and political equality., And inasmuch as they can not so live, while they do remain together there must be the position of superior and inferior, and I, as much as any other man, am in favor of having the superior position assigned to the white race., I say upon this occasion I do not perceive that because the white man is to have the superior position, the negro should be denied everything., I do not understand that because I do not want a negro woman for a slave, I must necessarily want her for a wife., My understanding is that I can just let her alone., I am now in my fiftieth year, and I certainly never have had a black woman for either a slave or a wife., So it seems to me quite possible for us to get along without making either slaves or wives of negroes., I will add to this that I have never seen, to my knowledge, a man, woman, or child, who was in favor of producing perfect equality, social and political, between negroes and white men., I recollect of but one distinguished instance that I ever heard of so frequently as to be satisfied of its correctness, and that is the case of Judge Douglas's old friend Colonel Richard M. Johnson., I will also add to the remarks I have made (for I am not going to enter at large upon this subject), that I have never had the least apprehension that I or my friends would marry negroes, if there was no law to keep them from it; but as judge Douglas and his friends seem to be in great apprehension that they might, if there were no law to keep them from it, I give him the most solemn pledge that I will to the very last stand by the law of the State which forbids the marrying of white people with negroes."", There, my friends, you have briefly what I have, upon former occasions, said upon this subject to which this newspaper, to the extent of its ability, has drawn the public attention., In it you not only perceive, as a probability, that in that contest I did not at any time say I was in favor of negro suffrage, but the absolute proof that twice--once substantially, and once expressly--I declared against it., Having shown you this, there remains but a word of comment upon that newspaper article., It is this, that I presume the editor of that paper is an honest and truth-loving man, and that he will be greatly obliged to me for furnishing him thus early an opportunity to correct the misrepresentation he has made, before it has run so long that malicious people can call him a liar., The Giant himself has been here recently., I have seen a brief report of his speech., If it were otherwise unpleasant to me to introduce the subject of the negro as a topic for discussion, I might be somewhat relieved by the fact that he dealt exclusively in that subject while he was here., I shall, therefore, without much hesitation or diffidence, enter upon this subject., The American people, on the first day of January, 1854, found the African slave trade prohibited by a law of Congress., In a majority of the States of this Union, they found African slavery, or any other sort of slavery, prohibited by State constitutions., They also found a law existing, supposed to be valid, by which slavery was excluded from almost all the territory the United States then owned., This was the condition of the country, with reference to the institution of slavery, on the first of January, 1854., A few days after that, a bill was introduced into Congress, which ran through its regular course in the two branches of the national legislature, and finally passed into a law in the month of May, by which the Act of Congress prohibiting slavery from going into the Territories of the United States was repealed., In connection with the law itself, and, in fact, in the terms of the law, the then existing prohibition was not only repealed, but there was a declaration of a purpose on the part of Congress never thereafter to exercise any power that they might have, real or supposed, to prohibit the extension or spread of slavery., This was a very great change; for the law thus repealed was of more than thirty years' standing., Following rapidly upon the heels of this action of Congress, a decision of the Supreme Court is made, by which it is declared that Congress, if it desires to prohibit the spread of slavery into the Territories, has no constitutional power to do so., Not only so, but that decision lays down principles which, if pushed to their logical conclusion,--I say pushed to their logical conclusion,--would decide that the constitutions of free States, forbidding slavery, are themselves unconstitutional., Mark me, I do not say the judges said this, and let no man say I affirm the judges used these words; but I only say it is my opinion that what they did say, if pressed to its logical conclusion, will inevitably result thus., Looking at these things, the Republican party, as I understand its principles and policy, believes that there is great danger of the institution of slavery being spread out and extended until it is ultimately made alike lawful in all the States of this Union; so believing, to prevent that incidental and ultimate consummation is the original and chief purpose of the Republican organization., I say ""chief purpose"" of the Republican organization; for it is certainly true that if the National House shall fall into the hands of the Republicans, they will have to attend to all the other matters of national house-keeping, as well as this., The chief and real purpose of the Republican party is eminently conservative., It proposes nothing save and except to restore this government to its original tone in regard to this element of slavery, and there to maintain it, looking for no further change in reference to it than that which the original framers of the Government themselves expected and looked forward to., The chief danger to this purpose of the Republican party is not just now the revival of the African slave trade, or the passage of a Congressional slave code, or the declaring of a second Dred Scott decision, making slavery lawful in all the States., These are not pressing us just now., They are not quite ready yet., The authors of these measures know that we are too strong for them; but they will be upon us in due time, and we will be grappling with them hand to hand, if they are not now headed off., They are not now the chief danger to the purpose of the Republican organization; but the most imminent danger that now threatens that purpose is that insidious Douglas popular sovereignty., This is the miner and sapper., While it does not propose to revive the African slave trade, nor to pass a slave code, nor to make a second Dred Scott decision, it is preparing us for the onslaught and charge of these ultimate enemies when they shall be ready to come on, and the word of command for them to advance shall be given., I say this ""Douglas popular sovereignty""; for there is a broad distinction, as I now understand it, between that article and a genuine popular sovereignty., I believe there is a genuine popular sovereignty., I think a definition of ""genuine popular sovereignty,"" in the abstract, would be about this: That each man shall do precisely as he pleases with himself, and with all those things which exclusively concern him., Applied to government, this principle would be, that a general government shall do all those things which pertain to it, and all the local governments shall do precisely as they please in respect to those matters which exclusively concern them., I understand that this government of the United States, under which we live, is based upon this principle; and I am misunderstood if it is supposed that I have any war to make upon that principle., Now, what is judge Douglas's popular sovereignty?, It is, as a principle, no other than that if one man chooses to make a slave of another man neither that other man nor anybody else has a right to object., Applied in government, as he seeks to apply it, it is this: If, in a new Territory into which a few people are beginning to enter for the purpose of making their homes, they choose to either exclude slavery from their limits or to establish it there, however one or the other may affect the persons to be enslaved, or the infinitely greater number of persons who are afterwards to inhabit that Territory, or the other members of the families of communities, of which they are but an incipient member, or the general head of the family of States as parent of all, however their action may affect one or the other of these, there is no power or right to interfere., That is Douglas's popular sovereignty applied., He has a good deal of trouble with popular sovereignty., His explanations explanatory of explanations explained are interminable., The most lengthy, and, as I suppose, the most maturely considered of this long series of explanations is his great essay in Harper's Magazine., I will not attempt to enter on any very thorough investigation of his argument as there made and presented., I will nevertheless occupy a good portion of your time here in drawing your attention to certain points in it., Such of you as may have read this document will have perceived that the judge early in the document quotes from two persons as belonging to the Republican party, without naming them, but who can readily be recognized as being Governor Seward of New York and myself., It is true that exactly fifteen months ago this day, I believe, I for the first time expressed a sentiment upon this subject, and in such a manner that it should get into print, that the public might see it beyond the circle of my hearers; and my expression of it at that time is the quotation that Judge Douglas makes., ...]",3
250,"[When it does pertain to them, is when they are sufficient to be formed into an organized political community, and he fixes the minimum for that at ten thousand, and the maximum at twenty thousand., Now, I would like to know what is to be done with the nine thousand?, Are they all to be treated, until they are large enough to be organized into a political community, as wanderers upon the public land, in violation of law?, And if so treated and driven out, at what point of time would there ever be ten thousand?, If they were not driven out, but remained there as trespassers upon the public land in violation of the law, can they establish slavery there?, No; the judge says popular sovereignty don't pertain to them then., Can they exclude it then?, No; popular sovereignty don't pertain to them then., I would like to know, in the case covered by the essay, what condition the people of the Territory are in before they reach the number of ten thousand?, But the main point I wish to ask attention to is, that the question as to when they shall have reached a sufficient number to be formed into a regular organized community is to be decided ""by Congress."", Judge Douglas says so., Well, gentlemen, that is about all we want., No, that is all the Southerners want., That is what all those who are for slavery want., They do not want Congress to prohibit slavery from coming into the new Territories, and they do not want popular sovereignty to hinder it; and as Congress is to say when they are ready to be organized, all that the South has to do is to get Congress to hold off., Let Congress hold off until they are ready to be admitted as a State, and the South has all it wants in taking slavery into and planting it in all the Territories that we now have or hereafter may have., In a word, the whole thing, at a dash of the pen, is at last put in the power of Congress; for if they do not have this popular sovereignty until Congress organizes them, I ask if it at last does not come from Congress?, If, at last, it amounts to anything at all, Congress gives it to them., I submit this rather for your reflection than for comment., After all that is said, at last, by a dash of the pen, everything that has gone before is undone, and he puts the whole question under the control of Congress., After fighting through more than three hours, if you undertake to read it, he at last places the whole matter under the control of that power which he has been contending against, and arrives at a result directly contrary to what he had been laboring to do., He at last leaves the whole matter to the control of Congress., There are two main objects, as I understand it, of this Harper's Magazine essay., One was to show, if possible, that the men of our Revolutionary times were in favor of his popular sovereignty, and the other was to show that the Dred Scott decision had not entirely squelched out this popular sovereignty., I do not propose, in regard to this argument drawn from the history of former times, to enter into a detailed examination of the historical statements he has made., I have the impression that they are inaccurate in a great many instances,--sometimes in positive statement, but very much more inaccurate by the suppression of statements that really belong to the history., But I do not propose to affirm that this is so to any very great extent, or to enter into a very minute examination of his historical statements., I avoid doing so upon this principle,--that if it were important for me to pass out of this lot in the least period of time possible, and I came to that fence, and saw by a calculation of my known strength and agility that I could clear it at a bound, it would be folly for me to stop and consider whether I could or not crawl through a crack., So I say of the whole history contained in his essay where he endeavored to link the men of the Revolution to popular sovereignty., It only requires an effort to leap out of it, a single bound to be entirely successful., If you read it over, you will find that he quotes here and there from documents of the Revolutionary times, tending to show that the people of the colonies were desirous of regulating their own concerns in their own way, that the British Government should not interfere; that at one time they struggled with the British Government to be permitted to exclude the African slave trade,--if not directly, to be permitted to exclude it indirectly, by taxation sufficient to discourage and destroy it., From these and many things of this sort, judge Douglas argues that they were in favor of the people of our own Territories excluding slavery if they wanted to, or planting it there if they wanted to, doing just as they pleased from the time they settled upon the Territory., Now, however his history may apply and whatever of his argument there may be that is sound and accurate or unsound and inaccurate, if we can find out what these men did themselves do upon this very question of slavery in the Territories, does it not end the whole thing?, If, after all this labor and effort to show that the men of the Revolution were in favor of his popular sovereignty and his mode of dealing with slavery in the Territories, we can show that these very men took hold of that subject, and dealt with it, we can see for ourselves how they dealt with it., It is not a matter of argument or inference, but we know what they thought about it., It is precisely upon that part of the history of the country that one important omission is made by Judge Douglas., He selects parts of the history of the United States upon the subject of slavery, and treats it as the whole, omitting from his historical sketch the legislation of Congress in regard to the admission of Missouri, by which the Missouri Compromise was established and slavery excluded from a country half as large as the present United States., All this is left out of his history, and in nowise alluded to by him, so far as I can remember, save once, when he makes a remark, that upon his principle the Supreme Court were authorized to pronounce a decision that the act called the Missouri Compromise was unconstitutional., All that history has been left out., But this part of the history of the country was not made by the men of the Revolution., There was another part of our political history, made by the very men who were the actors in the Revolution, which has taken the name of the Ordinance of '87., Let me bring that history to your attention., In 1784, I believe, this same Mr. Jefferson drew up an ordinance for the government of the country upon which we now stand, or, rather, a frame or draft of an ordinance for the government of this country, here in Ohio, our neighbors in Indiana, us who live in Illinois, our neighbors in Wisconsin and Michigan., In that ordinance, drawn up not only for the government of that Territory, but for the Territories south of the Ohio River, Mr. Jefferson expressly provided for the prohibition of slavery., Judge Douglas says, and perhaps is right, that that provision was lost from that ordinance., I believe that is true., When the vote was taken upon it, a majority of all present in the Congress of the Confederation voted for it; but there were so many absentees that those voting for it did not make the clear majority necessary, and it was lost., But three years after that, the Congress of the Confederation were together again, and they adopted a new ordinance for the government of this Northwest Territory, not contemplating territory south of the river, for the States owning that territory had hitherto refrained from giving it to the General Government; hence they made the ordinance to apply only to what the Government owned., In fact, the provision excluding slavery was inserted aside, passed unanimously, or at any rate it passed and became a part of the law of the land., Under that ordinance we live., First here in Ohio you were a Territory; then an enabling act was passed, authorizing you to form a constitution and State Government, provided it was republican and not in conflict with the Ordinance of '87., When you framed your constitution and presented it for admission, I think you will find the legislation upon the subject will show that, whereas you had formed a constitution that was republican, and not in conflict with the Ordinance of '87, therefore you were admitted upon equal footing with the original States., The same process in a few years was gone through with in Indiana, and so with Illinois, and the same substantially with Michigan and Wisconsin., Not only did that Ordinance prevail, but it was constantly looked to whenever a step was taken by a new Territory to become a State., Congress always turned their attention to it, and in all their movements upon this subject they traced their course by that Ordinance of '87., When they admitted new States, they advertised them of this Ordinance, as a part of the legislation of the country., They did so because they had traced the Ordinance of '87 throughout the history of this country., Begin with the men of the Revolution, and go down for sixty entire years, and until the last scrap of that Territory comes into the Union in the form of the State of Wisconsin, everything was made to conform with the Ordinance of '87, excluding slavery from that vast extent of country., I omitted to mention in the right place that the Constitution of the United States was in process of being framed when that Ordinance was made by the Congress of the Confederation; and one of the first Acts of Congress itself, under the new Constitution itself, was to give force to that Ordinance by putting power to carry it out in the hands of the new officers under the Constitution, in the place of the old ones, who had been legislated out of existence by the change in the Government from the Confederation to the Constitution., Not only so, but I believe Indiana once or twice, if not Ohio, petitioned the General Government for the privilege of suspending that provision and allowing them to have slaves., A report made by Mr. Randolph, of Virginia, himself a slaveholder, was directly against it, and the action was to refuse them the privilege of violating the Ordinance of '87., This period of history, which I have run over briefly, is, I presume, as familiar to most of this assembly as any other part of the history of our country., I suppose that few of my hearers are not as familiar with that part of history as I am, and I only mention it to recall your attention to it at this time., And hence I ask how extraordinary a thing it is that a man who has occupied a position upon the floor of the Senate of the United States, who is now in his third term, and who looks to see the government of this whole country fall into his own hands, pretending to give a truthful and accurate history o the slavery question in this country, should so entirely ignore the whole of that portion of our history--the most important of all., Is it not a most extraordinary spectacle that a man should stand up and ask for any confidence in his statements who sets out as he does with portions of history, calling upon the people to believe that it is a true and fair representation, when the leading part and controlling feature of the whole history is carefully suppressed?, But the mere leaving out is not the most remarkable feature of this most remarkable essay., His proposition is to establish that the leading men of the Revolution were for his great principle of nonintervention by the government in the question of slavery in the Territories, while history shows that they decided, in the cases actually brought before them, in exactly the contrary way, and he knows it., Not only did they so decide at that time, but they stuck to it during sixty years, through thick and thin, as long as there was one of the Revolutionary heroes upon the stage of political action., Through their whole course, from first to last, they clung to freedom., And now he asks the community to believe that the men of the Revolution were in favor of his great principle, when we have the naked history that they themselves dealt with this very subject matter of his principle, and utterly repudiated his principle, acting upon a precisely contrary ground., It is as impudent and absurd as if a prosecuting attorney should stand up before a jury and ask them to convict A as the murderer of B, while B was walking alive before them., I say, again, if judge Douglas asserts that the men of the Revolution acted upon principles by which, to be consistent with themselves, they ought to have adopted his popular sovereignty, then, upon a consideration of his own argument, he had a right to make you believe that they understood the principles of government, but misapplied them, that he has arisen to enlighten the world as to the just application of this principle., He has a right to try to persuade you that he understands their principles better than they did, and, therefore, he will apply them now, not as they did, but as they ought to have done., He has a right to go before the community and try to convince them of this, but he has no right to attempt to impose upon any one the belief that these men themselves approved of his great principle., There are two ways of establishing a proposition., One is by trying to demonstrate it upon reason, and the other is, to show that great men in former times have thought so and so, and thus to pass it by the weight of pure authority., Now, if Judge Douglas will demonstrate somehow that this is popular sovereignty,--the right of one man to make a slave of another, without any right in that other or any one else to object,--demonstrate it as Euclid demonstrated propositions,--there is no objection., But when he comes forward, seeking to carry a principle by bringing to it the authority of men who themselves utterly repudiate that principle, I ask that he shall not be permitted to do it., I see, in the judge's speech here, a short sentence in these words: ""Our fathers, when they formed this government under which we live, understood this question just as well, and even better than, we do now."", That is true; I stick to that., I will stand by Judge Douglas in that to the bitter end., And now, Judge Douglas, come and stand by me, and truthfully show how they acted, understanding it better than we do., All I ask of you, Judge Douglas, is to stick to the proposition that the men of the Revolution understood this subject better than we do now, and with that better understanding they acted better than you are trying to act now., I wish to say something now in regard to the Dred Scott decision, as dealt with by Judge Douglas., In that ""memorable debate"" between Judge Douglas and myself, last year, the judge thought fit to commence a process of catechising me, and at Freeport I answered his questions, and propounded some to him., Among others propounded to him was one that I have here now., The substance, as I remember it, is, ""Can the people of a United States Territory, under the Dred Scott decision, in any lawful way, against the wish of any citizen of the United States, exclude slavery from its limits, prior to the formation of a State constitution?"", He answered that they could lawfully exclude slavery from the United States Territories, notwithstanding the Dred Scot decision., There was something about that answer that has probably been a trouble to the judge ever since., The Dred Scott decision expressly gives every citizen of the United States a right to carry his slaves into the United States Territories., And now there was some inconsistency in saying that the decision was right, and saying, too, that the people of the Territory could lawfully drive slavery out again., When all the trash, the words, the collateral matter, was cleared away from it, all the chaff was fanned out of it, it was a bare absurdity,--no less than that a thing may be lawfully driven away from where it has a lawful right to be., Clear it of all the verbiage, and that is the naked truth of his proposition,--that a thing may be lawfully driven from the place where it has a lawful right to stay., Well, it was because the judge could n't help seeing this that he has had so much trouble with it; and what I want to ask your especial attention to, just now, is to remind you, if you have not noticed the fact, that the judge does not any longer say that the people can exclude slavery., He does not say so in the copyright essay; he did not say so in the speech that he made here; and, so far as I know, since his re-election to the Senate he has never said, as he did at Freeport, that the people of the Territories can exclude slavery., He desires that you, who wish the Territories to remain free, should believe that he stands by that position; but he does not say it himself., He escapes to some extent the absurd position I have stated, by changing his language entirely., What he says now is something different in language, and we will consider whether it is not different in sense too., It is now that the Dred Scott decision, or rather the Constitution under that decision, does not carry slavery into the Territories beyond the power of the people of the Territories to control it as other property., He does not say the people can drive it out, but they can control it as other property., ...]",3
251,"[They will be ready for Jeff., Davis and Stephens and other leaders of that company to sound the bugle for the revival of the slave trade, for the second Dred Scott decision, for the flood of slavery to be poured over the free States, while we shall be here tied down and helpless and run over like sheep., It is to be a part and parcel of this same idea to say to men who want to adhere to the Democratic party, who have always belonged to that party, and are only looking about for some excuse to stick to it, but nevertheless hate slavery, that Douglas's popular sovereignty is as good a way as any to oppose slavery., They allow themselves to be persuaded easily, in accordance with their previous dispositions, into this belief, that it is about as good a way of opposing slavery as any, and we can do that without straining our old party ties or breaking up old political associations., We can do so without being called negro-worshipers., We can do that without being subjected to the jibes and sneers that are so readily thrown out in place of argument where no argument can be found., So let us stick to this popular sovereignty,--this insidious popular sovereignty., Now let me call your attention to one thing that has really happened, which shows this gradual and steady debauching of public opinion, this course of preparation for the revival of the slave trade, for the Territorial slave code, and the new Dred Scott decision that is to carry slavery into the Free States., Did you ever, five years ago, hear of anybody in the world saying that the negro had no share in the Declaration of National Independence; that it does not mean negroes at all; and when ""all men"" were spoken of, negroes were not included?, I am satisfied that five years ago that proposition was not put upon paper by any living being anywhere., I have been unable at any time to find a man in an audience who would declare that he had ever known of anybody saying so five years ago., But last year there was not a Douglas popular sovereign in Illinois who did not say it., Is there one in Ohio but declares his firm belief that the Declaration of Independence did not mean negroes at all?, I do not know how this is; I have not been here much; but I presume you are very much alike everywhere., Then I suppose that all now express the belief that the Declaration of Independence never did mean negroes., I call upon one of them to say that he said it five years ago., If you think that now, and did not think it then, the next thing that strikes me is to remark that there has been a change wrought in you,--and a very significant change it is, being no less than changing the negro, in your estimation, from the rank of a man to that of a brute., They are taking him down and placing him, when spoken of, among reptiles and crocodiles, as Judge Douglas himself expresses it., Is not this change wrought in your minds a very important change?, Public opinion in this country is everything., In a nation like ours, this popular sovereignty and squatter sovereignty have already wrought a change in the public mind to the extent I have stated., There is no man in this crowd who can contradict it., Now, if you are opposed to slavery honestly, as much as anybody, I ask you to note that fact, and the like of which is to follow, to be plastered on, layer after layer, until very soon you are prepared to deal with the negro every where as with the brute., If public sentiment has not been debauched already to this point, a new turn of the screw in that direction is all that is wanting; and this is constantly being done by the teachers of this insidious popular sovereignty., You need but one or two turns further, until your minds, now ripening under these teachings, will be ready for all these things, and you will receive and support, or submit to, the slave trade, revived with all its horrors, a slave code enforced in our Territories, and a new Dred Scott decision to bring slavery up into the very heart of the free North., This, I must say, is but carrying out those words prophetically spoken by Mr. Clay,--many, many years ago,--I believe more than thirty years, when he told an audience that if they would repress all tendencies to liberty and ultimate emancipation they must go back to the era of our independence, and muzzle the cannon which thundered its annual joyous return on the Fourth of July; they must blow out the moral lights around us; they must penetrate the human soul, and eradicate the love of liberty: but until they did these things, and others eloquently enumerated by him, they could not repress all tendencies to ultimate emancipation., I ask attention to the fact that in a pre-eminent degree these popular sovereigns are at this work: blowing out the moral lights around us; teaching that the negro is no longer a man, but a brute; that the Declaration has nothing to do with him; that he ranks with the crocodile and the reptile; that man, with body and soul, is a matter of dollars and cents., I suggest to this portion of the Ohio Republicans, or Democrats, if there be any present, the serious consideration of this fact that there is now going on among you a steady process of debauching public opinion on this subject., With this, my friends, I bid you adieu., This is the first time in my life that I have appeared before an audience in so great a city as this: I therefore--though I am no longer a young man--make this appearance under some degree of embarrassment., But I have found that when one is embarrassed, usually the shortest way to get through with it is to quit talking or thinking about it, and go at something else., I understand that you have had recently with you my very distinguished friend Judge Douglas, of Illinois; and I understand, without having had an opportunity (not greatly sought, to be sure) of seeing a report of the speech that he made here, that he did me the honor to mention my humble name., I suppose that he did so for the purpose of making some objection to some sentiment at some time expressed by me., I should expect, it is true, that judge Douglas had reminded you, or informed you, if you had never before heard it, that I had once in my life declared it as my opinion that this government cannot endure permanently, half slave and half free; that a house divided against itself cannot stand, and, as I had expressed it, I did not expect the house to fall, that I did not expect the Union to be dissolved, but that I did expect that it would cease to be divided, that it would become all one thing, or all the other; that either the opponents of slavery would arrest the further spread of it, and place it where the public mind would rest in the belief that it was in the course of ultimate extinction, or the friends of slavery will push it forward until it becomes alike lawful in all the States, old or new, free as well as slave., I did, fifteen months ago, express that opinion, and upon many occasions Judge Douglas has denounced it, and has greatly, intentionally or unintentionally, misrepresented my purpose in the expression of that opinion., I presume, without having seen a report of his speech, that he did so here., I presume that he alluded also to that opinion, in different language, having been expressed at a subsequent time by Governor Seward of New York, and that he took the two in a lump and denounced them; that he tried to point out that there was something couched in this opinion which led to the making of an entire uniformity of the local institutions of the various States of the Union, in utter disregard of the different States, which in their nature would seem to require a variety of institutions and a variety of laws, conforming to the differences in the nature of the different States., Not only so: I presume he insisted that this was a declaration of war between the free and slave States, that it was the sounding to the onset of continual war between the different States, the slave and free States., This charge, in this form, was made by Judge Douglas on, I believe, the 9th of July, 1858, in Chicago, in my hearing., On the next evening, I made some reply to it., I informed him that many of the inferences he drew from that expression of mine were altogether foreign to any purpose entertained by me, and in so far as he should ascribe these inferences to me, as my purpose, he was entirely mistaken; and in so far as he might argue that, whatever might be my purpose, actions conforming to my views would lead to these results, he might argue and establish if he could; but, so far as purposes were concerned, he was totally mistaken as to me., When I made that reply to him, I told him, on the question of declaring war between the different States of the Union, that I had not said that I did not expect any peace upon this question until slavery was exterminated; that I had only said I expected peace when that institution was put where the public mind should rest in the belief that it was in course of ultimate extinction; that I believed, from the organization of our government until a very recent period of time, the institution had been placed and continued upon such a basis; that we had had comparative peace upon that question through a portion of that period of time, only because the public mind rested in that belief in regard to it, and that when we returned to that position in relation to that matter, I supposed we should again have peace as we previously had., I assured him, as I now, assure you, that I neither then had, nor have, or ever had, any purpose in any way of interfering with the institution of slavery, where it exists., I believe we have no power, under the Constitution of the United States, or rather under the form of government under which we live, to interfere with the institution of slavery, or any other of the institutions of our sister States, be they free or slave States., I declared then, and I now re-declare, that I have as little inclination to interfere with the institution of slavery where it now exists, through the instrumentality of the General Government, or any other instrumentality, as I believe we have no power to do so., I accidentally used this expression: I had no purpose of entering into the slave States to disturb the institution of slavery., So, upon the first occasion that Judge Douglas got an opportunity to reply to me, he passed by the whole body of what I had said upon that subject, and seized upon the particular expression of mine that I had no purpose of entering into the slave States to disturb the institution of slavery., ""Oh, no,"" said he, ""he [Lincoln] won't enter into the slave States to disturb the institution of slavery, he is too prudent a man to do such a thing as that; he only means that he will go on to the line between the free and slave States, and shoot over at them., This is all he means to do., He means to do them all the harm he can, to disturb them all he can, in such a way as to keep his own hide in perfect safety."", Well, now, I did not think, at that time, that that was either a very dignified or very logical argument but so it was, I had to get along with it as well as I could., It has occurred to-me here to-night that if I ever do shoot over the line at the people on the other side of the line into a slave State, and purpose to do so, keeping my skin safe, that I have now about the best chance I shall ever have., I should not wonder if there are some Kentuckians about this audience--we are close to Kentucky; and whether that be so or not, we are on elevated ground, and, by speaking distinctly, I should not wonder if some of the Kentuckians would hear me on the other side of the river., For that reason I propose to address a portion of what I have to say to the Kentuckians., I say, then, in the first place, to the Kentuckians, that I am what they call, as I understand it, a ""Black Republican."", I think slavery is wrong, morally and politically., I desire that it should be no further spread in--these United States, and I should not object if it should gradually terminate in the whole Union., While I say this for myself, I say to you Kentuckians that I understand you differ radically with me upon this proposition; that you believe slavery is a good thing; that slavery is right; that it ought to be extended and perpetuated in this Union., Now, there being this broad difference between us, I do not pretend, in addressing myself to you Kentuckians, to attempt proselyting you; that would be a vain effort., I do not enter upon it., I only propose to try to show you that you ought to nominate for the next Presidency, at Charleston, my distinguished friend Judge Douglas., In all that there is a difference between you and him, I understand he is sincerely for you, and more wisely for you than you are for yourselves., I will try to demonstrate that proposition., Understand, now, I say that I believe he is as sincerely for you, and more wisely for you, than you are for yourselves., What do you want more than anything else to make successful your views of slavery,--to advance the outspread of it, and to secure and perpetuate the nationality of it?, What do you want more than anything else?, What--is needed absolutely?, What is indispensable to you?, Why, if I may, be allowed to answer the question, it is to retain a hold upon the North, it is to retain support and strength from the free States., If you can get this support and strength from the free States, you can succeed., If you do not get this support and this strength from the free States, you are in the minority, and you are beaten at once., If that proposition be admitted,--and it is undeniable,--then the next thing I say to you is, that Douglas, of all the men in this nation, is the only man that affords you any hold upon the free States; that no other man can give you any strength in the free States., This being so, if you doubt the other branch of the proposition, whether he is for you--whether he is really for you, as I have expressed it,--I propose asking your attention for a while to a few facts., The issue between you and me, understand, is, that I think slavery is wrong, and ought not to be outspread; and you think it is right, and ought to be extended and perpetuated., [A voice, ""Oh, Lord!""], That is my Kentuckian I am talking to now., I now proceed to try to show you that Douglas is as sincerely for you and more wisely for you than you are for yourselves., In the first place, we know that in a government like this, in a government of the people, where the voice of all the men of the country, substantially, enters into the execution--or administration, rather--of the government, in such a government, what lies at the bottom of all of it is public opinion., I lay down the proposition, that Judge Douglas is not only the man that promises you in advance a hold upon the North, and support in the North, but he constantly moulds public opinion to your ends; that in every possible way he can he constantly moulds the public opinion of the North to your ends; and if there are a few things in which he seems to be against you,--a few things which he says that appear to be against you, and a few that he forbears to say which you would like to have him say you ought to remember that the saying of the one, or the forbearing to say the other, would lose his hold upon the North, and, by consequence, would lose his capacity to serve you., Upon this subject of moulding public opinion I call your attention to the fact--for a well established fact it is--that the Judge never says your institution of slavery is wrong., There is not a public man in the United States, I believe, with the exception of Senator Douglas, who has not, at some time in his life, declared his opinion whether the thing is right or wrong; but Senator Douglas never declares it is wrong., He leaves himself at perfect liberty to do all in your favor which he would be hindered from doing if he were to declare the thing to be wrong., On the contrary, he takes all the chances that he has for inveigling the sentiment of the North, opposed to slavery, into your support, by never saying it is right., This you ought to set down to his credit: You ought to give him full credit for this much; little though it be, in comparison to the whole which he does for you., Some other, things I will ask your attention to., He said upon the floor of the United States Senate, and he has repeated it, as I understand, a great many times, that he does not care whether slavery is ""voted up or voted down."", This again shows you, or ought to show you, if you would reason upon it, that he does not believe it to be wrong; for a man may say when he sees nothing wrong in a thing; that he, dues not care whether it be voted up or voted down but no man can logically say that he cares not whether a thing goes up or goes down which to him appears to be wrong., You therefore have a demonstration in this that to Judge Douglas's mind your favorite institution, which you would have spread out and made perpetual, is no wrong., Another thing he tells you, in a speech made at Memphis in Tennessee, shortly after the canvass in Illinois, last year., He there distinctly told the people that there was a ""line drawn by the Almighty across this continent, on the one side of which the soil must always be cultivated by slaves""; that he did not pretend to know exactly where that line was, but that there was such a line., I want to ask your attention to that proposition again; that there is one portion of this continent where the Almighty has signed the soil shall always be cultivated by slaves; that its being cultivated by slaves at that place is right; that it has the direct sympathy and authority of the Almighty., Whenever you can get these Northern audiences to adopt the opinion that slavery is right on the other side of the Ohio, whenever you can get them, in pursuance of Douglas's views, to adopt that sentiment, they will very readily make the other argument, which is perfectly logical, that that which is right on that side of the Ohio cannot be wrong on this, and that if you have that property on that side of the Ohio, under the seal and stamp of the Almighty, when by any means it escapes over here it is wrong to have constitutions and laws ""to devil"" you about it., So Douglas is moulding the public opinion of the North, first to say that the thing is right in your State over the Ohio River, and hence to say that that which is right there is not wrong here, and that all laws and constitutions here recognizing it as being wrong are themselves wrong, and ought to be repealed and abrogated., He will tell you, men of Ohio, that if you choose here to have laws against slavery, it is in conformity to the idea that your climate is not suited to it, that your climate is not suited to slave labor, and therefore you have constitutions and laws against it., Let us attend to that argument for a little while and see if it be sound., You do not raise sugar-cane (except the new-fashioned sugar-cane, and you won't raise that long), but they do raise it in Louisiana., You don't raise it in Ohio, because you can't raise it profitably, because the climate don't suit it., They do raise it in Louisiana, because there it is profitable., Now, Douglas will tell you that is precisely the slavery question: that they do have slaves there because they are profitable, and you don't have them here because they are not profitable., If that is so, then it leads to dealing with the one precisely as with the other., ...]",3
252,"[There was nothing said in the Constitution in regard to the spread of slavery into the Territory., I grant that; but there was something very important said about it by the same generation of men in the adoption of the old Ordinance of '87, through the influence of which you here in Ohio, our neighbors in Indiana, we in Illinois, our neighbors in Michigan and Wisconsin, are happy, prosperous, teeming millions of free men., That generation of men, though not to the full extent members of the convention that framed the Constitution, were to some extent members of that convention, holding seats at the same time in one body and the other, so that if there was any compromise on either of these subjects, the strong evidence is that that compromise was in favor of the restriction of slavery from the new Territories., But Douglas says that he is unalterably opposed to the repeal of those laws because, in his view, it is a compromise of the Constitution., You Kentuckians, no doubt, are somewhat offended with that., You ought not to be!, You ought to be patient!, You ought to know that if he said less than that, he would lose the power of ""lugging"" the Northern States to your support., Really, what you would push him to do would take from him his entire power to serve you., And you ought to remember how long, by precedent, Judge Douglas holds himself obliged to stick by compromises., You ought to remember that by the time you yourselves think you are ready to inaugurate measures for the revival of the African slave trade, that sufficient time will have arrived, by precedent, for Judge Douglas to break through, that compromise., He says now nothing more strong than he said in 1849 when he declared in favor of Missouri Compromise,--and precisely four years and a quarter after he declared that Compromise to be a sacred thing, which ""no ruthless hand would ever daze to touch,"" he himself brought forward the measure ruthlessly to destroy it., By a mere calculation of time it will only be four years more until he is ready to take back his profession about the sacredness of the Compromise abolishing the slave trade., Precisely as soon as you are ready to have his services in that direction, by fair calculation, you may be sure of having them., But you remember and set down to Judge Douglas's debt, or discredit, that he, last year, said the people of Territories can, in spite of the Dred Scott decision, exclude your slaves from those Territories; that he declared, by ""unfriendly legislation"" the extension of your property into the new Territories may be cut off, in the teeth of the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States., He assumed that position at Freeport on the 27th of August, 1858., He said that the people of the Territories can exclude slavery, in so many words: You ought, however, to bear in mind that he has never said it since., You may hunt in every speech that he has since made, and he has never used that expression once., He has never seemed to notice that he is stating his views differently from what he did then; but by some sort of accident, he has always really stated it differently., He has always since then declared that ""the Constitution does not carry slavery into the Territories of the United States beyond the power of the people legally to control it, as other property."", Now, there is a difference in the language used upon that former occasion and in this latter day., There may or may not be a difference in the meaning, but it is worth while considering whether there is not also a difference in meaning., What is it to exclude?, Why, it is to drive it out., It is in some way to put it out of the Territory., It is to force it across the line, or change its character so that, as property, it is out of existence., But what is the controlling of it ""as other property""?, Is controlling it as other property the same thing as destroying it, or driving it away?, I should think not., I should think the controlling of it as other property would be just about what you in Kentucky should want., I understand the controlling of property means the controlling of it for the benefit of the owner of it., While I have no doubt the Supreme Court of the United States would say ""God speed"" to any of the Territorial Legislatures that should thus control slave property, they would sing quite a different tune if, by the pretence of controlling it, they were to undertake to pass laws which virtually excluded it,--and that upon a very well known principle to all lawyers, that what a Legislature cannot directly do, it cannot do by indirection; that as the Legislature has not the power to drive slaves out, they have no power, by indirection, by tax, or by imposing burdens in any way on that property, to effect the same end, and that any attempt to do so would be held by the Dred Scott court unconstitutional., Douglas is not willing to stand by his first proposition that they can exclude it, because we have seen that that proposition amounts to nothing more nor less than the naked absurdity that you may lawfully drive out that which has a lawful right to remain., He admitted at first that the slave might be lawfully taken into the Territories under the Constitution of the United States, and yet asserted that he might be lawfully driven out., That being the proposition, it is the absurdity I have stated., He is not willing to stand in the face of that direct, naked, and impudent absurdity; he has, therefore, modified his language into that of being ""controlled as other property."", The Kentuckians don't like this in Douglas!, I will tell you where it will go., He now swears by the court., He was once a leading man in Illinois to break down a court, because it had made a decision he did not like., But he now not only swears by the court, the courts having got to working for you, but he denounces all men that do not swear by the courts, as unpatriotic, as bad citizens., When one of these acts of unfriendly legislation shall impose such heavy burdens as to, in effect, destroy property in slaves in a Territory, and show plainly enough that there can be no mistake in the purpose of the Legislature to make them so burdensome, this same Supreme Court will decide that law to be unconstitutional, and he will be ready to say for your benefit ""I swear by the court; I give it up""; and while that is going on he has been getting all his men to swear by the courts, and to give it up with him., In this again he serves you faithfully, and, as I say, more wisely than you serve yourselves., Again: I have alluded in the beginning of these remarks to the fact that Judge Douglas has made great complaint of my having expressed the opinion that this government ""cannot endure permanently, half slave and half free."", He has complained of Seward for using different language, and declaring that there is an ""irrepressible conflict"" between the principles of free and slave labor., [A voice: ""He says it is not original with Seward., That it is original with Lincoln.""], I will attend to that immediately, sir., Since that time, Hickman of Pennsylvania expressed the same sentiment., He has never denounced Mr. Hickman: why?, There is a little chance, notwithstanding that opinion in the mouth of Hickman, that he may yet be a Douglas man., That is the difference!, It is not unpatriotic to hold that opinion if a man is a Douglas man., But neither I, nor Seward, nor Hickman is entitled to the enviable or unenviable distinction of having first expressed that idea., That same idea was expressed by the Richmond Enquirer, in Virginia, in 1856,--quite two years before it was expressed by the first of us., And while Douglas was pluming himself that in his conflict with my humble self, last year, he had ""squelched out"" that fatal heresy, as he delighted to call it, and had suggested that if he only had had a chance to be in New York and meet Seward he would have ""squelched"" it there also, it never occurred to him to breathe a word against Pryor., I don't think that you can discover that Douglas ever talked of going to Virginia to ""squelch"" out that idea there., No., More than that., That same Roger A. Pryor was brought to Washington City and made the editor of the par excellence Douglas paper, after making use of that expression, which, in us, is so unpatriotic and heretical., From all this, my Kentucky friends may see that this opinion is heretical in his view only when it is expressed by men suspected of a desire that the country shall all become free, and not when expressed by those fairly known to entertain the desire that the whole country shall become slave., When expressed by that class of men, it is in nowise offensive to him., In this again, my friends of Kentucky, you have Judge Douglas with you., There is another reason why you Southern people ought to nominate Douglas at your convention at Charleston., That reason is the wonderful capacity of the man,--the power he has of doing what would seem to be impossible., Let me call your attention to one of these apparently impossible things:  Douglas had three or four very distinguished men of the most extreme anti-slavery views of any men in the Republican party expressing their desire for his re-election to the Senate last year., That would, of itself, have seemed to be a little wonderful; but that wonder is heightened when we see that Wise of Virginia, a man exactly opposed to them, a man who believes in the divine right of slavery, was also expressing his desire that Douglas should be reelected; that another man that may be said to be kindred to Wise, Mr. Breckinridge, the Vice-President, and of your own State, was also agreeing with the anti-slavery men in the North that Douglas ought to be re-elected., Still to heighten the wonder, a senator from Kentucky, whom I have always loved with an affection as tender and endearing as I have ever loved any man, who was opposed to the anti-slavery men for reasons which seemed sufficient to him, and equally opposed to Wise and Breckinridge, was writing letters into Illinois to secure the reelection of Douglas., Now, that all these conflicting elements should be brought, while at daggers' points with one another, to support him, is a feat that is worthy for you to note and consider., It is quite probable that each of these classes of men thought, by the re-election of Douglas, their peculiar views would gain something: it is probable that the anti-slavery men thought their views would gain something; that Wise and Breckinridge thought so too, as regards their opinions; that Mr. Crittenden thought that his views would gain something, although he was opposed to both these other men., It is probable that each and all of them thought that they were using Douglas; and it is yet an unsolved problem whether he was not using them all., If he was, then it is for you to consider whether that power to perform wonders is one for you lightly to throw away., There is one other thing that I will say to you, in this relation., It is but my opinion, I give it to you without a fee., It is my opinion that it is for you to take him or be defeated; and that if you do take him you may be beaten., You will surely be beaten if you do not take him., We, the Republicans and others forming the opposition of the country, intend to ""stand by our guns,"" to be patient and firm, and in the long run to beat you, whether you take him or not., We know that before we fairly beat you we have to beat you both together., We know that you are ""all of a feather,"" and that we have to beat you all together, and we expect to do it., We don't intend to be very impatient about it., We mean to be as deliberate and calm about it as it is possible to be, but as firm and resolved as it is possible for men to be., When we do as we say,--beat you,--you perhaps want to know what we will do with you., I will tell you, so far as I am authorized to speak for the opposition, what we mean to do with you., We mean to treat you, as near as we possibly can, as Washington, Jefferson, and Madison treated you., We mean to leave you alone, and in no way interfere with your institution; to abide by all and every compromise of the Constitution, and, in a word, coming back to the original proposition, to treat you, so far as degenerated men (if we have degenerated) may, according to the examples of those noble fathers, Washington, Jefferson, and Madison., We mean to remember that you are as good as we; that there is no difference between us other than the difference of circumstances., We mean to recognize and bear in mind always that you have as good hearts in your bosoms as other people, or as we claim to have, and treat you accordingly., We mean to marry your girls when we have a chance, the white ones I mean; and I have the honor to inform you that I once did have a chance in that way., I have told you what we mean to do., I want to know, now, when that thing takes place, what do you mean to do?, I often hear it intimated that you mean to divide the Union whenever a Republican, or anything like it, is elected President of the United States., ""That is so,"" one of them says; I wonder if he is a Kentuckian?, Well, then, I  want to know what you are going to do with your half of it?, Are you going to split the Ohio down through, and push your half off a piece?, Or are you going to keep it right alongside of us outrageous fellows?, Or are you going to build up a wall some way between your country and ours, by which that movable property of yours can't come over here any more, to the danger of your losing it?, Do you think you can better yourselves, on that subject, by leaving us here under no obligation whatever to return those specimens of your movable property that come hither?, You have divided the Union because we would not do right with you, as you think, upon that subject; when we cease to be under obligations to do anything for you, how much better off do you think you will be?, Will you make war upon us and kill us all?, Why, gentlemen, I think you are as gallant and as brave men as live; that you can fight as bravely in a good cause, man for man, as any other people living; that you have shown yourselves capable of this upon various occasions: but, man for man, you are not better than we are, and there are not so many of you as there are of us., ...]",3
253,"[Some men assume that there is necessary connection between capital and labor, and that connection draws within it the whole of the labor of the community., They assume that nobody works unless capital excites them to work., They begin next to consider what is the best way., They say there are but two ways: one is to hire men, and to allure them to labor by their consent; the other is to buy the men, and drive them, to it, and that is slavery., Having assumed that, they proceed to discuss the question of whether the laborers themselves are better off in the condition of slaves or of hired laborers, and they usually decide that they are better off in the condition of slaves., In the first place, I say that the whole thing is a mistake., That there is a certain relation between capital and labor, I admit., That it does exist, and rightfully exists, I think is true., That men who are industrious, and sober, and honest in the pursuit of their own interests should after a while accumulate capital, and after that should be allowed to enjoy it in peace, and also, if they should choose, when they have accumulated it, to use it to save themselves from actual labor, and hire other people to labor for them, is right., In doing so they do not wrong the man they employ, for they find men who have not of their own land to work upon, or shops to work in, and who are benefited by working for others, hired laborers, receiving their capital for it., Thus a few men, that own capital, hire a few others, and these establish the relation of capital and labor rightfully, a relation of which I make no complaint., But I insist that that relation, after all, does not embrace more than one eighth of the labor of the country., I have taken upon myself in the name of some of you to say that we expect upon these principles to ultimately beat them., In order to do so, I think we want and must have a national policy in regard to the institution of slavery that acknowledges and deals with that institution as being wrong., Whoever desires the prevention of the spread of slavery and the nationalization of that institution yields all when he yields to any policy that either recognizes slavery as being right or as being an indifferent thing., Nothing will make you successful but setting up a policy which shall treat the thing as being wrong: When I say this, I do not mean to say that this General Government is charged with the duty of redressing or preventing all the wrongs in the world, but I do think that it is charged with preventing and redressing all wrongs which are wrongs to itself., This Government is expressly charged with the duty of providing for the general welfare., We believe that the spreading out and perpetuity of the institution of slavery impairs the general welfare., We believe--nay, we know--that that is the only thing that has ever threatened the perpetuity of the Union itself., The only thing which has ever menaced the destruction of the government under which we live is this very thing., To repress this thing, we think, is, Providing for the general welfare., Our friends in Kentucky differ from us., We need not make our argument for them, but we who think it is wrong in all its relations, or in some of them at least, must decide as to our own actions and our own course, upon our own judgment., I say that we must not interfere with the institution of slavery in the States where it exists, because the Constitution forbids it, and the general welfare does not require us to do so., We must not withhold an efficient Fugitive Slave law, because the Constitution requires us, as I understand it, not to withhold such a law., But we must prevent the outspreading of the institution, because neither the Constitution nor general welfare requires us to extend it., We must prevent the revival of the African slave trade, and the enacting by Congress of a Territorial slave code., We must prevent each of these things being done by either Congresses or courts., The people of these United States are the rightful masters of both Congresses and courts, not to overthrow the Constitution, but to overthrow the men who pervert the Constitution., To do these things we must employ instrumentalities., We must hold conventions; we must adopt platforms, if we conform to ordinary custom; we must nominate candidates; and we must carry elections., In all these things, I think that we ought to keep in view our real purpose, and in none do anything that stands adverse to our purpose., If we shall adopt a platform that fails to recognize or express our purpose, or elect a man that declares himself inimical to our purpose, we not only take nothing by our success, but we tacitly admit that we act upon no other principle than a desire to have ""the loaves and fishes,"" by which, in the end, our apparent success is really an injury to us., I know that this is very desirable with me, as with everybody else, that all the elements of the opposition shall unite in the next Presidential election and in all future time., I am anxious that that should be; but there are things seriously to be considered in relation to that matter., If the terms can be arranged, I am in favor of the union., But suppose we shall take up some man, and put him upon one end or the other of the ticket, who declares himself against us in regard to the prevention of the spread of slavery, who turns up his nose and says he is tired of hearing anything more about it, who is more against us than against the enemy, what will be the issue?, Why, he will get no slave States, after all,--he has tried that already until being beat is the rule for him., If we nominate him upon that ground, he will not carry a slave State; and not only so, but that portion of our men who are high-strung upon the principle we really fight for will not go for him, and he won't get a single electoral vote anywhere, except, perhaps, in the State of Maryland., There is no use in saying to us that we are stubborn and obstinate because we won't do some such thing as this., We cannot do it., We cannot get our men to vote it., I speak by the card, that we cannot give the State of Illinois in such case by fifty thousand., We would be flatter down than the ""Negro Democracy"" themselves have the heart to wish to see us., After saying this much let me say a little on the other side., There are plenty of men in the slave States that are altogether good enough for me to be either President or Vice-President, provided they will profess their sympathy with our purpose, and will place themselves on the ground that our men, upon principle, can vote for them., There are scores of them, good men in their character for intelligence and talent and integrity., If such a one will place himself upon the right ground, I am for his occupying one place upon the next Republican or opposition ticket., I will heartily go for him., But unless he does so place himself, I think it a matter of perfect nonsense to attempt to bring about a union upon any other basis; that if a union be made, the elements will scatter so that there can be no success for such a ticket, nor anything like success., The good old maxims of the Bible axe applicable, and truly applicable, to human affairs, and in this, as in other things, we may say here that he who is not for us is against us; he who gathereth not with us, scattereth., I should be glad to have some of the many good and able and noble men of the South to place themselves where we can confer upon them the high honor of an election upon one or the other end of our ticket., It would do my soul good to do that thing., It would enable us to teach them that, inasmuch as we select one of their own number to carry out our principles, we are free from the charge that we mean more than we say., But, my friends, I have detained you much longer than I expected to do., I believe I may do myself the compliment to say that you have stayed and heard me with great patience, for which I return you my most sincere thanks., I am here just now attending court., Yesterday, before I left Springfield, your brother, Dr. William S. Wallace, showed me a letter of yours, in which you kindly mention my name, inquiring for my tariff views, and suggest the propriety of my writing a letter upon the subject., I was an old Henry-Clay-Tariff Whig., In old times I made more speeches on that subject than any other., I have not since changed my views., I believe yet, if we could have a moderate, carefully adjusted protective tariff, so far acquiesced in as not to be a perpetual subject of political strife, squabbles changes, and uncertainties, it would be better for us., Still it is my opinion that just now the revival of that question will not advance the cause itself, or the man who revives it., I have not thought much on the subject recently, but my general impression is that the necessity for a protective tariff will ere long force its old opponents to take it up; and then its old friends can join in and establish it on a more firm and durable basis., We, the Old Whigs, have been entirely beaten out on the tariff question, and we shall not be able to re-establish the policy until the absence of it shall have demonstrated the necessity for it in the minds of men heretofore opposed to it., With this view, I should prefer to not now write a public letter on the subject., I therefore wish this to be considered confidential., I shall be very glad to receive a letter from you., Yours of October 27 is received., When a mortgage is given to secure two notes, and one of the notes is sold and assigned, if the mortgaged premises are only sufficient to pay one note, the one assigned will take it all., Also, an execution from a judgment on the assigned note may take it all; it being the same thing in substance., There is redemption on execution sales from the United States Court just as from any other court., You did not mention the name of the plaintiff or defendant in the suit, and so I can tell nothing about it as to sales, bids, etc., Write again., But you Democrats are for the Union; and you greatly fear the success of the Republicans would destroy the Union., Why?, Do the Republicans declare against the Union?, Nothing like it., Your own statement of it is that if the Black Republicans elect a President, you ""won't stand it."", You will break up the Union., If we shall constitutionally elect a President, it will be our duty to see that you submit., Old John Brown has been executed for treason against a State., We cannot object, even though he agreed with us in thinking slavery wrong., That cannot excuse violence, bloodshed and treason., It could avail him nothing that he might think himself right., So, if we constitutionally elect a President, and therefore you undertake to destroy the Union, it will be our duty to deal with you as old John Brown has been dealt with., We shall try to do our duty., We hope and believe that in no section will a majority so act as to render such extreme measures necessary., Your favor of the 12th is at hand, and it gives me pleasure to be able to answer it., It is not my intention to take part in any of the rivalries for the gubernatorial nomination; but the fear of being misunderstood upon that subject ought not to deter me from doing justice to Mr. Judd, and preventing a wrong being done to him by the use of nay name in connection with alleged wrongs to me., In answer to your first question, as to whether Mr. Judd was guilty of any unfairness to me at the time of Senator Trumbull's election, I answer unhesitatingly in the negative; Mr. Judd owed no political allegiance to any party whose candidate I was., He was in the Senate, holding over, having been elected by a Democratic Constituency., He never was in any caucus of the friends who sought to make me U. S. Senator, never gave me any promises or pledges to support me, and subsequent events have greatly tended to prove the wisdom, politically, of Mr. Judd's course., The election of Judge Trumbull strongly tended to sustain and preserve the position of that lion of the Democrats who condemned the repeal of the Missouri Compromise, and left them in a position of joining with us in forming the Republican party, as was done at the Bloomington convention in 1856., During the canvass of 1858 for the senatorship my belief was, and still is, that I had no more sincere and faithful friend than Mr. Judd--certainly none whom I trusted more., His position as chairman of the State Central Committee led to my greater intercourse with him, and to my giving him a larger share of my confidence, than with or to almost any other friend; and I have never suspected that that confidence was, to any degree, misplaced., My relations with Mr. Judo since the organization of the Republican party, in, our State, in 1856, and especially since the adjournment of the Legislature in Feb., 1857, have been so very intimate that I deem it an impossibility that he could have been dealing treacherously with me., He has also, at all times, appeared equally true and faithful to the party., In his position as chairman of the committee, I believe he did all that any man could have done., The best of us are liable to commit errors, which become apparent by subsequent developments; but I do not know of a single error, even, committed by Mr. Judd, since he and I have acted together politically., ...]",3
254,"[The question of Federal control of slavery in the Territories seems not to have been directly before the convention which framed the original Constitution; and hence it is not recorded that the ""thirty-nine,"" or any of them, while engaged on that instrument, expressed any opinion on that precise question., In 1789, by the first Congress which sat under the Constitution, an act was passed to enforce the Ordinance of '87, including the prohibition of slavery in the Northwestern Territory., The bill for this act was reported by one of the ""thirty-nine,"" Thomas Fitzsimmons, then a member of the House of Representatives from Pennsylvania., It went through all its stages without a word of opposition, and finally passed both branches without yeas and nays, which is equivalent to a unanimous passage., In this Congress there were sixteen of the thirty-nine fathers who framed the original Constitution., They were John Langdon, Nicholas Gilman, Wm., S. Johnnson, Roger Sherman, Robert Morris, Thos., Fitzsimmons, William Few, Abraham Baldwin, Rufus King, William Paterson, George Claimer, Richard Bassett, George Read, Pierce Butler, Daniel Carroll, James Madison., This shows that, in their understanding, no line dividing local from Federal authority, nor anything in the Constitution, properly forbade Congress to prohibit slavery in the Federal territory; else both their fidelity to correct principles and their oath to support the Constitution would have constrained them to oppose the prohibition., Again: George Washington, another of the ""thirty nine,"" was then President of the United States, and, as such, approved and signed the bill; thus completing its validity as a law, and thus showing that, in his understanding, no line dividing local from Federal authority, nor anything in the Constitution, forbade the Federal Government to control as to slavery in Federal territory., No great while after the adoption of the original Constitution, North Carolina ceded to the Federal Government the country now constituting the State of Tennessee; and, a few years later, Georgia ceded that which now constitutes the States of Mississippi and Alabama., In both deeds of cession it was made a condition by the ceding States that the Federal Government should not prohibit slavery in the ceded country., Besides this, slavery was then actually in the ceded country., Under these circumstances, Congress, on taking charge of these countries, did not absolutely prohibit slavery within them., But they did interfere with it--take control of it--even there, to a certain extent., In 1798, Congress organized the Territory of Mississippi: In the act of organization they prohibited the bringing of slaves into the Territory from any place without the United States, by fine and giving freedom to slaves so brought., This act passed both branches of Congress without yeas and nays., In that Congress were three of the ""thirty-nine"" who framed the original Constitution., They were John Langdon, George Read, and Abraham Baldwin., They all, probably, voted for it., Certainly they would have placed their opposition to it upon record, if, in their understanding, any line dividing local from Federal authority, or anything in the Constitution, properly forbade the Federal Government to control as to slavery in Federal territory., In 1803, the Federal Government purchased the Louisiana country., Our former territorial acquisitions came from certain of our own States; but this Louisiana country was acquired from a foreign nation., In 1804, Congress gave a territorial organization to that part of it which now constitutes the State of Lousiana., New Orleans, lying within that part, was an old and comparatively large city., There were other considerable towns and settlements, and slavery was extensively and thoroughly intermingled with the people., Congress did not, in the Territorial Act, prohibit slavery; but they did interfere with it take control of it--in a more marked and extensive way than they did in the case of Mississippi., The substance of the provision therein made in relation to slaves was:  First., That no slave should be imported into the Territory from foreign parts., Second., That no slave should be carried into it who had been imported into the United States since the first day of May, 1798., Third., That no slave should be carried into it except by the owner, and for his own use as a settler; the penalty in all the cases being a fine upon the violator of the law, and freedom to the slave., This act also was passed without yeas and nays., In the Congress which passed it there were two of the ""thirty-nine."", They were Abraham Baldwin and Jonathan Dayton., As stated in the case of Mississippi, it is probable they both voted for it., They would not have allowed it to pass without recording their opposition to it, if, in their understanding, it violated either the line properly dividing local from Federal authority, or any provision of the Constitution., In 1819-20 came and passed the Missouri question., Many votes were taken, by yeas and nays, in both branches of Congress, upon the various phases of the general question., Two of the ""thirty-nine""--Rufus King and Charles Pinckney were members of that Congress., Mr. King steadily voted for slavery prohibition and against all compromises, while Mr. Pinckney as steadily voted against slavery prohibition, and against all compromises., By this, Mr. King showed that, in his understanding, no line dividing local from Federal authority, nor anything in the Constitution, was violated by Congress prohibiting slavery in Federal territory; while Mr. Pinckney, by his vote, showed that in his understanding there was some sufficient reason for opposing such prohibition in that case., The cases I have mentioned are the only acts of the ""thirty-nine,"" or of any of them, upon the direct issue, which I have been able to discover., To enumerate the persons who thus acted, as being four in 1784, two in 1787, seventeen in 1789, three in 1798, two in 1804, and two in 1819-20--there would be thirty of them., But this would be counting, John Langdon, Roger Sherman, William Few, Rufus King, and George Read, each twice, and Abraham Baldwin three times., The true number of those of the ""thirty-nine"" whom I have shown to have acted upon the question which, by the text, they understood better than we, is twenty-three, leaving sixteen not shown to have acted upon it in any way., Here, then, we have twenty-three out of our thirty-nine fathers ""who framed the Government under which we live,"" who have, upon their official responsibility and their corporal oaths, acted upon the very question which the text affirms they ""understood just as well, and even better than we do now""; and twenty-one of them--a clear majority of the whole ""thirty-nine""--so acting upon it as to make them guilty of gross political impropriety and wilful perjury, if, in their understanding, any proper division between local and Federal authority, or anything in the Constitution they had made themselves, and sworn to support, forbade the Federal Government to control as to slavery in the Federal Territories., Thus the twenty-one acted; and, as actions speak louder than words, so actions under such responsibilities speak still louder., Two of the twenty-three voted against Congressional prohibition of slavery in the Federal Territories, in the instances in which they acted upon the question., But for what reasons they so voted is not known., They may have done so because they thought a proper division of local from Federal authority, or some provision or principle of the Constitution, stood in the way; or they may, without any such question, have voted against the prohibition on what appeared to them to be sufficient grounds of expediency., No one who has sworn to support the Constitution can conscientiously vote for what he understands to be an unconstitutional measure, however expedient he may think it; but one may and ought to vote against a measure which he deems constitutional, if, at the same time, he deems it inexpedient., It therefore would be unsafe to set down even the two who voted against the prohibition as having done so because, in their understanding, any proper division of local from Federal authority, or anything in the Constitution, forbade the Federal Government to control as to slavery in Federal territory., The remaining sixteen of the ""thirty-nine,"" so far as I have discovered, have left no record of their understanding upon the direct question of Federal control on slavery in the Federal Territories., But there is much reason to believe that their understanding upon that question would not have appeared different from that of their twenty-three compeers, had it been manifested at all., For the purpose of adhering rigidly to the text, I have purposely omitted whatever understanding may have been manifested by any person, however distinguished, other than the thirty-nine fathers who framed the original Constitution; and, for the same reason, I have also omitted whatever understanding may have been manifested by any of the ""thirty tine"" even on any other phase of the general question of slavery., If we should look into their acts and declarations on those other phases, as the foreign slave trade, and the morality and policy of slavery generally, it would appear to us that on the direct question of Federal control of slavery in Federal Territories, the sixteen, if they had acted at all, would probably have acted just as the twenty-three did., Among that sixteen were several of the most noted anti-slavery men of those times--as Dr. Franklin, Alexander Hamilton, and Gouverneur Morris while there was not one now known to have been otherwise, unless it may be John Rutledge, of South Carolina., The sum of the whole is, that of our thirty-nine fathers who framed the original Constitution, twenty-one--a clear majority of the whole--certainly understood that no proper division of local from Federal authority, nor any part of the Constitution, forbade the Federal Government to control slavery in the Federal Territories; whilst all the rest probably had the same understanding., Such, unquestionably, was the understanding of our fathers who framed the original Constitution; and the text affirms that they understood the question ""better than we."", But, so far, I have been considering the understanding of the question manifested by the framers of the original Constitution., In and by the original instrument, a mode was provided for amending it; and, as I have already stated, the present frame of ""the Government under which we live"" consists of that original, and twelve amendatory articles framed and adopted since., Those who now insist that Federal control of slavery in Federal Territories violates the Constitution, point us to the provisions which they suppose it thus violates; and, as I understand, they all fix upon provisions in these amendatory articles, and not in the original instrument., The Supreme Court, in the Dred Scott case, plant themselves upon the fifth amendment, which provides that no person shall be deprived of ""life, liberty, or property without due process of law""; while Senator Douglas and his peculiar adherents plant themselves upon the tenth amendment, providing that ""the powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution"" ""are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people."", Now, it so happens that these amendments were framed by the first Congress which sat under the Constitution--the identical Congress which passed the act already mentioned, enforcing the prohibition of slavery in the Northwestern Territory., Not only was it the same Congress, but they were the identical same individual men who, at the same session, and at the same time within the session, had under consideration, and in progress toward maturity, these Constitutional amendments, and this act prohibiting slavery in all the territory the nation then owned., The Constitutional amendments were introduced before and passed after the act enforcing the Ordinance of '87; so that, during the whole pendency of the act to enforce the Ordinance, the Constitutional amendments were also pending., The seventy-six members of that Congress, including sixteen of the framers of the original Constitution, as before stated, were pre-eminently our fathers who framed that part of ""the Government under which we live,"" which is now claimed as forbidding the Federal Government to control slavery in the Federal Territories., Is it not a little presumptuous in any one at this day to affirm that the two things which that Congress deliberately framed, and carried to maturity at the same time, are absolutely inconsistent with each other?, And does not such affirmation become impudently absurd when coupled with the other affirmation from the same mouth, that those who did the two things alleged to be inconsistent understood whether they really were inconsistent better than we--better than he who affirms that they are inconsistent?, It is surely safe to assume that the thirty-nine framers of the original Constitution, and the seventy-six members of the Congress which framed the amendments thereto, taken together, do certainly include those who may be fairly called ""our fathers who framed the Government under which we live."", And, so assuming, I defy any man to show that any one of them ever, in his whole life, declared that, in his understanding, any proper division of local from Federal authority, or any part of the Constitution, forbade the Federal Government to control as to slavery in the Federal Territories., I go a step further., I defy any one to show that any living man in the world ever did, prior to the beginning of the present century (and I might almost say prior to the beginning of the last half of the present century), declare that, in his understanding, any proper division of local from Federal authority, or any part of the Constitution, forbade the Federal Government to control as to slavery in the Federal Territories., To those who now so declare, I give not only ""our fathers who framed the Government under which we live,"" but with them all other living men within the century in which it was framed, among whom to search, and they shall not be able to find the evidence of a single man agreeing with them., Now and here let me guard a little against being misunderstood., I do not mean to say we are bound to follow implicitly in whatever our fathers did., To do so would be to discard all the lights of current experience to reject all progress, all improvement., What I do say is that, if we would supplant the opinions and policy of our fathers in any case, we should do so upon evidence so conclusive, and argument so clear, that even their great authority, fairly considered and weighed, cannot stand; and most surely not in a case whereof we ourselves declare they understood the question better than we., If any man at this day sincerely believes that proper division of local from Federal authority, or any part of the Constitution, forbids the Federal Government to control as to slavery in the Federal Territories, he is right to say so, and to enforce his position by all truthful evidence and fair argument which he can., But he has no right to mislead others who have less access to history, and less leisure to study it, into the false belief that ""our fathers who framed the Government under which we live"" were of the same opinion thus substituting falsehood and deception for truthful evidence and fair argument., If any man at this day sincerely believes ""our fathers, who framed the Government under which we live,"" used and applied principles, in other cases, which ought to have led them to understand that a proper division of local from Federal authority, or some part of the Constitution, forbids the Federal Government to control as to slavery in the Federal Territories, he is right to say so., But he should, at the same time, brave the responsibility of declaring that, in his opinion, he understands their principles better than they did themselves; and especially should he not shirk that responsibility by asserting that they ""understood the question just as well, and even better than we do now."", But enough!, Let all who believe that ""our fathers, who framed the Government under which we live, understood this question just as well, and even better than we do now,"" speak as they spoke, and act as they acted upon it., This is all Republicans ask--all Republicans desire--in relation to slavery., As those fathers marked it, so let it be again marked, as an evil not to be extended, but to be tolerated and protected only because of, and so far as, its actual presence among us makes that toleration and protection a necessity., Let all the guaranties those fathers gave it be not grudgingly, but fully and fairly maintained., For this Republicans contend, and with this, so far as I know or believe, they will be content., And now, if they would listen--as I suppose they will not--I would address a few words to the Southern people., I would say to them: You consider yourselves a reasonable and a just people; and I consider that in the general qualities of reason and justice you are not inferior to any other people., Still, when you speak of us Republicans, you do so only to denounce us as reptiles, or, at the best, as no better than outlaws., You will grant a hearing to pirates or murderers, but nothing like it to ""Black Republicans."", In all your contentions with one another, each of you deems an unconditional condemnation of ""Black Republicanism"" as the first thing to be attended to., Indeed, such condemnation of us seems to be an indispensable prerequisite license, so to speak among you, to be admitted or permitted to speak at all: Now; can you, or not, be prevailed upon to pause, and to consider whether this is quite just to us, or even to yourselves?, Bring forward your charges and specifications, and then be patient long enough to hear us deny or justify., You say we are sectional., We deny it., That makes an issue; and the burden of proof is upon you., ...]",3
255,"[Mr. Jefferson did not mean to say, nor do I, that the power of emancipation is in the Federal Government., He spoke of Virginia; and, as to the power of emancipation, I speak of the slave holding States only., The Federal Government, however, as we insist, has the power of restraining the extension of the institution--the power to insure that a slave insurrection shall never occur on any American soil which is now free from slavery., John Brown's effort was peculiar., It was not a slave insurrection., It was an attempt by white men to get up a revolt among slaves, in which the slaves refused to participate., In fact, it was so absurd that the slaves, with all their ignorance, saw plainly enough it could not succeed., That affair, in its philosophy, corresponds with the many attempts related in history at the assassination of kings and emperors., An enthusiast broods over the oppression of a people till he fancies himself commissioned by Heaven to liberate them., He ventures the attempt, which ends in little else than his own execution., Orsini's attempt on Louis Napoleon and John Brown's attempt at Harper's Ferry were, in their philosophy, precisely the same., The eagerness to cast blame on old England in the one case, and on New England in the other, does not disprove the sameness of the two things., And how much would it avail you, if you could, by the use of John Brown, Helper's Book, and the like, break up the Republican organization?, Human action can be modified to some extent, but human nature cannot be changed., There is a judgment and a feeling against slavery in this nation, which cast at least a million and a half of votes., You cannot destroy that judgment and feeling--that sentiment--by breaking up the political organization which rallies around it., You can scarcely scatter and disperse an army which has been formed into order in the face of your heaviest fire; but if you could, how much would you gain by forcing the sentiment which created it out of the peaceful channel of the ballot-box, into some other channel?, What would that other channel probably be?, Would the number of John Browns be lessened or enlarged by the operation?, But you will break up the Union rather than submit to a denial of your constitutional rights., That has a somewhat reckless sound; but it would be palliated, if not fully justified, were we proposing, by the mere force of numbers, to deprive you of some right plainly written down in the Constitution., But we are proposing no such thing., When you make these declarations, you have a specific and well-understood allusion to an assumed constitutional right of yours to take slaves into the Federal Territories, and to hold them there as property., But no such right is specifically written in the Constitution., That instrument is literally silent about any such right., We, on the contrary, deny that such a right has any existence in the Constitution, even by implication., Your purpose, then, plainly stated, is that you will destroy the Government unless you be allowed to construe and enforce the Constitution as you please on all points in dispute between you and us., You will rule or ruin, in all events., This, plainly stated, is your language., Perhaps you will say the Supreme Court has decided the disputed constitutional question in your favor., Not quite so., But, waiving the lawyer's distinction between dictum and decision, the court have decided the question for you in a sort of way., The court have substantially said it is your constitutional right to take slaves into the Federal Territories, and to hold them there as property., When I say, the decision was made in a sort of way, I mean it was made in a divided court, by a bare majority of the judges, and they not quite agreeing with one another in the reasons for making it; that it is so made as that its avowed supporters disagree with one another about its meaning, and that it was mainly based upon a mistaken statement of fact--the statement in the opinion that ""the right of property in a slave is distinctly and expressly affirmed in the Constitution."", An inspection of the Constitution will show that the right of property in a slave is not ""distinctly and expressly affirmed"" in it., Bear in mind, the judges do not pledge their judicial opinion that such right is impliedly affirmed in the Constitution; but they pledge their veracity that it is ""distinctly and expressly"" affirmed there--""distinctly,"" that is, not mingled with anything else; ""expressly,"" that is, in words meaning just that, without the aid of any inference, and susceptible of no other meaning., If they had only pledged their judicial opinion that such right is affirmed in the instrument by implication, it would be open to others to show that neither the word ""slave"" nor ""slavery"" is to be found in the Constitution, nor the word ""property"" even, in any connection with language alluding to the things slave or slavery; and that wherever in that instrument the slave is alluded to, he is called a ""person""; and wherever his master's legal right in relation to him is alluded to, it is spoken of as ""service or labor which may be due,"" as a debt payable in service or labor., Also, it would be open to show, by contemporaneous history, that this mode of alluding to slaves and slavery, instead of speaking of them, was employed on purpose to exclude from the Constitution the idea that there could be property in man., To show all this, is easy and certain., When this obvious mistake of the judges shall be brought to their notice, is it not reasonable to expect that they will withdraw the mistaken statement, and reconsider the conclusion based upon it?, And then it is to be remembered that ""our fathers; who framed the Government under which we live"",--the men who made the Constitution--decided this same constitutional question in our favor, long ago; decided it without division among themselves, when making the decision, without division among themselves about the meaning of it after it was made, and, so far as any evidence is left, without basing it upon any mistaken statement of facts., Under all these circumstances, do you really feel yourselves justified to break up this Government unless such a court decision as yours is shall be at once submitted to as a conclusive and final rule of political action?, But you will not abide the election of a Republican President!, In that supposed event, you say, you will destroy the Union; and then, you say, the great crime of having destroyed it will be upon us!, That is cool., A highwayman holds a pistol to my ear, and mutters through his teeth, ""stand and deliver, or I shall kill you, and then you'll be a murderer!"", To be sure, what the robber demanded of me-my money was my own, and I had a clear right to keep it; but it was no more my own than my vote is my own; and the threat of death to me, to extort my money, and the threat of destruction to the Union, to extort my vote, can scarcely be distinguished in principle., A few words now to Republicans: It is exceedingly desirable that all parts of this great confederacy shall be at peace and in harmony one with another., Let us Republicans do our part to have it so., Even though much provoked, let us do nothing through passion and ill temper., Even though the Southern people will not so much as listen to us, let us calmly consider their demands, and yield to them if, in our deliberate view of our duty, we possibly can., Judging by all they say and do, and by the subject and nature of their controversy with us, let us determine, if we can, what will satisfy them., Will they be satisfied if the Territories be unconditionally surrendered to them?, We know they will not., In all their present complaints against us, the Territories are scarcely mentioned., Invasions and insurrections are the rage now., Will it satisfy them if, in the future, we have nothing to do with invasions and, insurrections?, We know it will not., We so know because we know we never had anything to do with invasions and insurrections; and yet this total abstaining does not exempt us from the charge and the denunciation., The question recurs, what will satisfy them?, Simply this: We must not only let them alone, but we must, somehow, convince them that we do let them alone., This, we know by experience, is no easy task., We have been so trying to convince them from the very beginning of our organization, but with no success., In all our platforms and speeches we have constantly protested our purpose to let them alone; but this has had no tendency to convince them., Alike unavailing to convince them is the fact that they have never detected a man of us in any attempt to disturb them., These natural and apparently adequate means all failing, what will convince them?, This, and this only: cease to call slavery wrong, and join them in calling it right., And this must be done thoroughly--done in acts as well as in words., Silence will not be tolerated--we must place ourselves avowedly with them., Senator Douglas's new sedition law must be enacted and enforced, suppressing all declarations that slavery is wrong, whether made in politics, in presses, in pulpits; or in private., We must arrest and return their fugitive slaves with greedy pleasure., We must pull down our free State constitutions., The whole atmosphere must be disinfected from all taint of opposition to slavery, before they will cease to believe that all their troubles proceed from us., I am quite aware they do not state their case precisely in this way., Most of them would probably say to us, ""Let us alone, do nothing to us, and say what you please about slavery."", But we do let them alone have never disturbed them--so that after all it is what we say which dissatisfies them., They will continue to accuse us of doing, until we cease saying., I am also aware they have not as yet, in terms, demanded the overthrow of our free State constitutions., Yet those constitutions declare the wrong of slavery, with more solemn emphasis than do all other sayings against it; and when all these other sayings shall have been silenced, the overthrow of these constitutions will be demanded, and nothing be left to resist the demand., It is nothing to the contrary, that they do not demand the whole of this just now., Demanding what they do, and for the reason they do, they can voluntarily stop nowhere short of this consummation., Holding, as they do, that slavery is morally right, and socially elevating, they cannot cease to demand a full national recognition of it, as a legal right and a social blessing., Nor can we justifiably withhold this on any ground save our conviction that slavery is wrong., If slavery is right, all words, acts, laws, and constitutions against it are themselves wrong, and should be silenced and swept away., If it is right, we cannot justly object to its nationality its universality; if it is wrong, they cannot justly insist upon its extension--its enlargement., All they ask we could readily grant if we thought slavery right; all we ask they could as readily grant, if they thought it wrong., Their thinking it right and our thinking it wrong is the precise fact upon which depends the whole controversy., Thinking it right, as they do, they are not to blame for desiring its full recognition, as being right; but thinking it wrong, as we do, can we yield to them?, Can we cast our votes with their view, and against our own?, In view of our moral, social, and political responsibilities, can we do this?, Wrong as we think slavery is, we can yet afford to let it alone where it is, because that much is due to the necessity arising from its actual presence in the nation; but can we, while our votes will prevent it, allow it to spread into the national Territories, and to overrun us here in these free States?, If our sense of duty forbids this, then let us stand by our duty, fearlessly and effectively., Let us be diverted by none of those sophistical contrivances wherewith we are so industriously plied and belabored-contrivances such as groping for some middle ground between the right and the wrong, vain as the search for a man who should be neither a living man nor a dead man-such as a policy of ""don't care"" on a question about which all true men do care--such as Union appeals beseeching true Union men to yield to Disunionists, reversing the divine rule, and calling, not the sinners, but the righteous to repentance--such as invocations to Washington, imploring men to unsay what Washington said, and undo what Washington did., Neither let us be slandered from our duty by false accusations against us, nor frightened from it by menaces of destruction to the Government nor of dungeons to ourselves., LET US HAVE FAITH THAT RIGHT MAKES MIGHT, AND IN THAT FAITH LET US, TO THE END, DARE TO DO OUR DUTY AS WE UNDERSTAND IT., If the Republican party of this nation shall ever have the national House entrusted to its keeping, it will be the duty of that party to attend to all the affairs of national housekeeping., Whatever matters of importance may come up, whatever difficulties may arise in its way of administration of the Government, that party will then have to attend to., It will then be compelled to attend to other questions, besides this question which now assumes an overwhelming importance--the question of slavery., It is true that in the organization of the Republican party this question of slavery was more important than any other: indeed, so much more important has it become that no more national question can even get a hearing just at present., The old question of tariff--a matter that will remain one of the chief affairs of national house-keeping to all time; the question of the management of financial affairs; the question of the disposition of the public domain how shall it be managed for the purpose of getting it well settled, and of making there the homes of a free and happy people?, ...]",3
256,"[Much more if I found it in bed with my neighbor's children, and I had bound myself by a solemn compact not to meddle with his children under any circumstances, it would become me to let that particular mode of getting rid of the gentleman alone., But if there was a bed newly made up, to which the children were to be taken, and it was proposed to take a batch of young snakes and put them there with them, I take it no man would say there was any question how I ought to decide!, That is just the case., The new Territories are the newly made bed to which our children are to go, and it lies with the nation to say whether they shall have snakes mixed up with them or not., It does not seem as if there could be much hesitation what our policy should be!, Now I have spoken of a policy based on the idea that slavery is wrong, and a policy based on the idea that it is right., But an effort has been made for a policy that shall treat it as neither right nor wrong., It is based upon utter indifference., Its leading advocate [Douglas] has said, ""I don't care whether it be voted up or down."", ""It is merely a matter of dollars and cents."", ""The Almighty has drawn a line across this continent, on one side of which all soil must forever be cultivated by slave labor, and on the other by free."", ""When the struggle is between the white man and the negro, I am for the white man; when it is between the negro and the crocodile, I am for the negro."", Its central idea is indifference., It holds that it makes no more difference to us whether the Territories become free or slave States than whether my neighbor stocks his farm with horned cattle or puts in tobacco., All recognize this policy, the plausible sugar-coated name of which is ""popular sovereignty."", This policy chiefly stands in the way of a permanent settlement of the question., I believe there is no danger of its becoming the permanent policy of the country, for it is based on a public indifference., There is nobody that ""don't care."", All the people do care one way or the other!, I do not charge that its author, when he says he ""don't care,"" states his individual opinion; he only expresses his policy for the government., I understand that he has never said as an individual whether he thought slavery right or wrong--and he is the only man in the nation that has not!, Now such a policy may have a temporary run; it may spring up as necessary to the political prospects of some gentleman; but it is utterly baseless: the people are not indifferent, and it can therefore have no durability or permanence., But suppose it could: Then it could be maintained only by a public opinion that shall say, ""We don't care."", There must be a change in public opinion; the public mind must be so far debauched as to square with this policy of caring not at all., The people must come to consider this as ""merely a question of dollars and cents,"" and to believe that in some places the Almighty has made slavery necessarily eternal., This policy can be brought to prevail if the people can be brought round to say honestly, ""We don't care""; if not, it can never be maintained., It is for you to say whether that can be done., You are ready to say it cannot, but be not too fast!, Remember what a long stride has been taken since the repeal of the Missouri Compromise!, Do you know of any Democrat, of either branch of the party--do you know one who declares that he believes that the Declaration of Independence has any application to the negro?, Judge Taney declares that it has not, and Judge Douglas even vilifies me personally and scolds me roundly for saying that the Declaration applies to all men, and that negroes are men., Is there a Democrat here who does not deny that the Declaration applies to the negro?, Do any of you know of one?, Well, I have tried before perhaps fifty audiences, some larger and some smaller than this, to find one such Democrat, and never yet have I found one who said I did not place him right in that., I must assume that Democrats hold that, and now, not one of these Democrats can show that he said that five years ago!, I venture to defy the whole party to produce one man that ever uttered the belief that the Declaration did not apply to negroes, before the repeal of the Missouri Compromise!, Four or five years ago we all thought negroes were men, and that when ""all men"" were named, negroes were included., But the whole Democratic party has deliberately taken negroes from the class of men and put them in the class of brutes., Turn it as you will it is simply the truth!, Don't be too hasty, then, in saying that the people cannot be brought to this new doctrine, but note that long stride., One more as long completes the journey from where negroes are estimated as men to where they are estimated as mere brutes--as rightful property!, That saying ""In the struggle between white men and the negro,"" etc., which I know came from the same source as this policy--that saying marks another step., There is a falsehood wrapped up in that statement., ""In the struggle between the white man and the negro"" assumes that there is a struggle, in which either the white man must enslave the negro or the negro must enslave the white., There is no such struggle!, It is merely the ingenious falsehood to degrade and brutalize the negro., Let each let the other alone, and there is no struggle about it., If it was like two wrecked seamen on a narrow plank, when each must push the other off or drown himself, I would push the negro off or a white man either, but it is not; the plank is large enough for both., This good earth is plenty broad enough for white man and negro both, and there is no need of either pushing the other off., So that saying, ""In the struggle between the negro and the crocodile,"" etc., is made up from the idea that down where the crocodile inhabits, a white man can't labor; it must be nothing else but crocodile or negro; if the negro does not the crocodile must possess the earth; in that case he declares for the negro., The meaning of the whole is just this: As a white man is to a negro, so is a negro to a crocodile; and as the negro may rightfully treat the crocodile, so may the white man rightfully treat the negro., This very dear phrase coined by its author, and so dear that he deliberately repeats it in many speeches, has a tendency to still further brutalize the negro, and to bring public opinion to the point of utter indifference whether men so brutalized are enslaved or not., When that time shall come, if ever, I think that policy to which I refer may prevail., But I hope the good freemen of this country will never allow it to come, and until then the policy can never be maintained., Now consider the effect of this policy., We in the States are not to care whether freedom or slavery gets the better, but the people in the Territories may care., They are to decide, and they may think what they please; it is a matter of dollars and cents!, But are not the people of the Territories detailed from the States?, If this feeling of indifference this absence of moral sense about the question prevails in the States, will it not be carried into the Territories?, Will not every man say, ""I don't care, it is nothing to me""?, If any one comes that wants slavery, must they not say, ""I don't care whether freedom or slavery be voted up or voted down""?, It results at last in nationalizing the institution of slavery., Even if fairly carried out, that policy is just as certain to nationalize slavery as the doctrine of Jeff Davis himself., These are only two roads to the same goal, and ""popular sovereignty"" is just as sure and almost as short as the other., What we want, and all we want, is to have with us the men who think slavery wrong., But those who say they hate slavery, and are opposed to it, but yet act with the Democratic party--where are they?, Let us apply a few tests., You say that you think slavery is wrong, but you denounce all attempts to restrain it., Is there anything else that you think wrong that you are not willing to deal with as wrong?, Why are you so careful, so tender, of this one wrong and no other?, You will not let us do a single thing as if it was wrong; there is no place where you will even allow it to be called wrong!, We must not call it wrong in the free States, because it is not there, and we must not call it wrong in the slave States, because it is there; we must not call it wrong in politics because that is bringing morality into politics, and we must not call it wrong in the pulpit because that is bringing politics into religion; we must not bring it into the Tract Society or the other societies, because those are such unsuitable places--and there is no single place, according to you, where this wrong thing can properly be called wrong!, Perhaps you will plead that if the people of the slave States should themselves set on foot an effort for emancipation, you would wish them success, and bid them God-speed., Let us test that: In 1858 the emancipation party of Missouri, with Frank Blair at their head, tried to get up a movement for that purpose, and having started a party contested the State., Blair was beaten, apparently if not truly, and when the news came to Connecticut, you, who knew that Frank Blair was taking hold of this thing by the right end, and doing the only thing that you say can properly be done to remove this wrong--did you bow your heads in sorrow because of that defeat?, Do you, any of you, know one single Democrat that showed sorrow over that result?, Not one!, On the contrary every man threw up his hat, and hallooed at the top of his lungs, ""Hooray for Democracy!"", Now, gentlemen, the Republicans desire to place this great question of slavery on the very basis on which our fathers placed it, and no other., It is easy to demonstrate that ""our fathers, who framed this Government under which we live,"" looked on slavery as wrong, and so framed it and everything about it as to square with the idea that it was wrong, so far as the necessities arising from its existence permitted., In forming the Constitution they found the slave trade existing, capital invested in it, fields depending upon it for labor, and the whole system resting upon the importation of slave labor., They therefore did not prohibit the slave trade at once, but they gave the power to prohibit it after twenty years., Why was this?, What other foreign trade did they treat in that way?, Would they have done this if they had not thought slavery wrong?, Another thing was done by some of the same men who framed the Constitution, and afterwards adopted as their own the act by the first Congress held under that Constitution, of which many of the framers were members, that prohibited the spread of slavery into Territories., Thus the same men, the framers of the Constitution, cut off the supply and prohibited the spread of slavery, and both acts show conclusively that they considered that the thing was wrong., If additional proof is wanted it can be found in the phraseology of the Constitution., When men are framing a supreme law and chart of government, to secure blessings and prosperity to untold generations yet to come, they use language as short and direct and plain as can be found, to express their meaning In all matters but this of slavery the framers of the Constitution used the very clearest, shortest, and most direct language., But the Constitution alludes to slavery three times without mentioning it once The language used becomes ambiguous, roundabout, and mystical., They speak of the ""immigration of persons,"" and mean the importation of slaves, but do not say so., In establishing a basis of representation they say ""all other persons,"" when they mean to say slaves--why did they not use the shortest phrase?, In providing for the return of fugitives they say ""persons held to service or labor."", If they had said slaves it would have been plainer, and less liable to misconstruction., Why did n't they do it?, We cannot doubt that it was done on purpose., Only one reason is possible, and that is supplied us by one of the framers of the Constitution--and it is not possible for man to conceive of any other--they expected and desired that the system would come to an end, and meant that when it did, the Constitution should not show that there ever had been a slave in this good free country of ours., I will dwell on that no longer., I see the signs of approaching triumph of the Republicans in the bearing of their political adversaries., A great deal of their war with us nowadays is mere bushwhacking., ...]",3
257,"[You produce your proof; and what is it?, Why, that our party has no existence in your section--gets no votes in your section., The fact is substantially true; but does it prove the issue?, If it does, then in case we should, without change of principle, begin to get votes in your section, we should thereby cease to be sectional., You cannot escape this conclusion; and yet, are you willing to abide by it?, If you are, you will probably soon find that we have ceased to be sectional, for we shall get votes in your section this very year., The fact that we get no votes in your section is a fact of your making and not of ours., And if there be fault in that fact, that fault is primarily yours, and remains so until you show that we repel you by some wrong principle or practice., If we  ours; but this brings you to where you ought to have started--to a discussion of the right or wrong of our principle., If our principle, put in practice, would wrong your section for the benefit of ours, or for any other object, then our principle, and we with it, are sectional, and are justly opposed and denounced as such., Meet us, then, on the question of whether our principle put in practice would wrong your section; and so meet it as if it were possible that something may be said on our side., Do you accept the challenge?, No?, Then you really believe that the principle which our fathers who framed the Government under which we live thought so clearly right as to adopt it, and indorse it again and again, upon their official oaths, is in fact so clearly wrong as to demand our condemnation without a moment's consideration., Some of you delight to flaunt in our faces the warning against sectional parties given by Washington in his Farewell Address., Less than eight years before Washington gave that warning, he had, as President of the United States, approved and signed an act of Congress enforcing the prohibition of slavery in the Northwestern Territory, which act embodied the policy of government upon that subject, up to and at the very moment he penned that warning; and about one year after he penned it he wrote La Fayette that he considered that prohibition a wise measure, expressing in the same connection his hope that we should sometime have a confederacy of free States., Bearing this in mind, and seeing that sectionalism has since arisen upon this same subject, is that warning a weapon in your hands against us, or in our hands against you?, Could Washington himself speak, would he cast the blame of that sectionalism upon us, who sustain his policy, or upon you, who repudiate it?, We respect that warning of Washington, and we commend it to you, together with his example pointing to the right application of it., But you say you are conservative--eminently conservative--while we are revolutionary, destructive, or something of the sort., What is conservatism?, Is it not adherence to the old and tried, against the new and untried?, We stick to, contend for, the identical old policy on the point in controversy which was adopted by our fathers who framed the Government under which we live; while you with one accord reject and scout and spit upon that old policy, and insist upon substituting something new., True, you disagree among yourselves as to what that substitute shall be., You have considerable variety of new propositions and plans, but you are unanimous in rejecting and denouncing the old policy of the fathers., Some of you are for reviving the foreign slave-trade; some for a congressional slave code for the Territories; some for Congress forbidding the Territories to prohibit slavery within their limits; some for maintaining slavery in the Territories through the judiciary; some for the ""gur-reat pur-rinciple"" that if one man would enslave another, no third man should object--fantastically called ""popular sovereignty."", But never a man among you in favor of prohibition of slavery in Federal Territories, according to the practice of our fathers who framed the Government under which we live., Not one of all your various plans can show a precedent or an advocate in the century within which our Government originated., And yet you draw yourselves up and say, ""We are eminently conservative."", It is exceedingly desirable that all parts of this great confederacy shall be at peace, and in harmony one with another., Let us Republicans do our part to have it so., Even though much provoked, let us do nothing through passion and ill-temper., Even though the Southern people will not so much as listen to us, let us calmly consider their demands, and yield to them if, in our deliberate view of our duty, we possibly can., Judging by all they say and do, and by the subject and nature of their controversy with us, let us determine, if we can, what will satisfy them., Will they be satisfied if the Territories be unconditionally surrendered to them?, We know they will not., In all their present complaints against us, the Territories are scarcely mentioned., Invasions and insurrections are the rage now., Will it satisfy them, in the future, if we have nothing to do with invasions and insurrections?, We know it will not., We so know because we know we never had anything to do with invasions and insurrections;

and secondly, I have not and cannot get the money., I say, in the main, the use of money is wrong; but for certain objects in a political contest, the use of some is both right and indispensable., With me, as with yourself, the long struggle has been one of great pecuniary loss., I now distinctly say this--if you shall be appointed a delegate to Chicago, I will furnish one hundred dollars to bear the expenses of the trip., Reaching home three days ago, I found your letter of February 26th., Considering your difficulty of hearing, I think you had better settle in Chicago, if, as you say, a good man already in fair practice there will take you into partnership., If you had not that difficulty, I still should think it an even balance whether you would not better remain in Chicago, with such a chance for copartnership., If I went west, I think I would go to Kansas, to Leavenworth or Atchison., Both of them are and will continue to be fine growing places., I believe I have said all I can, and I have said it with the deepest interest for your welfare., Reaching home yesterday, I found yours of the 23d March, inclosing a slip from The Middleport Press., It is not true that I ever charged anything for a political speech in my life; but this much is true: Last October I was requested by letter to deliver some sort of speech in Mr. Beecher's church, in Brooklyn--two hundred dollars being offered in the first letter., I wrote that I could do it in February, provided they would take a political speech if I could find time to get up no other., They agreed; and subsequently I informed them the speech would have to be a political one., When I reached New York, I for the first time learned that the place was changed to ""Cooper Institute."", I made the speech, and left for New Hampshire, where I have a son at school, neither asking for pay nor having any offered me., Three days after a check for two hundred dollars was sent to me at New Hampshire; and I took it, and did not know it was wrong., My understanding now is--though I knew nothing of it at the time--that they did charge for admittance to the Cooper Institute, and that they took in more than twice two hundred dollars., ...]",3
258,"[The people of the South have too much of good sense and good temper to attempt the ruin of the government rather than see it administered as it was administered by the men who made it., At least so I hope and believe., I thank you both for your own letter and a sight of that of Mr. Botts., Yours of the 13th was received this morning., Douglas is managing the Bell element with great adroitness., He had his men in Kentucky to vote for the Bell candidate, producing a result which has badly alarmed and damaged Breckenridge, and at the same time has induced the Bell men to suppose that Bell will certainly be President, if they can keep a few of the Northern States away from us by throwing them to Douglas., But you, better than I, understand all this., I think there will be the most extraordinary effort ever made to carry New York for Douglas., You and all others who write me from your State think the effort cannot succeed, and I hope you are right., Still, it will require close watching and great efforts on the other side., Herewith I send you a copy of a letter written at New York, which sufficiently explains itself, and which may or may not give you a valuable hint., You have seen that Bell tickets have been put on the track both here and in Indiana., In both cases the object has been, I think, the same as the Hunt movement in New York--to throw States to Douglas., In our State, we know the thing is engineered by Douglas men, and we do not believe they can make a great deal out of it., Yours of the 27th is duly received., It consists almost exclusively of a historical detail of some local troubles, among some of our friends in Pennsylvania; and I suppose its object is to guard me against forming a prejudice against Mr. McC------____, I have not heard near so much upon that subject as you probably suppose; and I am slow to listen to criminations among friends, and never expose their quarrels on either side., My sincere wish is that both sides will allow bygones to be bygones, and look to the present and future only., I am annoyed some by a letter from a friend in Chicago, in which the following passage occurs: ""Hamlin has written Colfax that two members of Congress will, he fears, be lost in Maine, the first and sixth districts; and that Washburne's majority for governor will not exceed six thousand."", I had heard something like this six weeks ago, but had been assured since that it was not so., Your secretary of state,--Mr. Smith, I think,--whom you introduced to me by letter, gave this assurance; more recently, Mr. Fessenden, our candidate for Congress in one of those districts, wrote a relative here that his election was sure by at least five thousand, and that Washburne's majority would be from 14,000 to 17,000; and still later, Mr. Fogg, of New Hampshire, now at New York serving on a national committee, wrote me that we were having a desperate fight in Maine, which would end in a splendid victory for us., Such a result as you seem to have predicted in Maine, in your letter to Colfax, would, I fear, put us on the down-hill track, lose us the State elections in Pennsylvania and Indiana, and probably ruin us on the main turn in November., You must not allow it., Yours of the 5th was received last evening., I was right glad to see it., It contains the freshest ""posting"" which I now have., It relieved me some from a little anxiety I had about Maine., Jo Medill, on August 30th, wrote me that Colfax had a letter from Mr. Hamlin saying we were in great danger of losing two members of Congress in Maine, and that your brother would not have exceeding six thousand majority for Governor., I addressed you at once, at Galena, asking for your latest information., As you are at Washington, that letter you will receive some time after the Maine election., I cannot give you details, but it is entirely certain that Pennsylvania and Indiana have gone Republican very largely., Pennsylvania 25,000, and Indiana 5000 to 10,000., Ohio of course is safe., I certainly am in no temper and have no purpose to embitter the feelings of the South, but whether I am inclined to such a course as would in fact embitter their feelings you can better judge by my published speeches than by anything I would say in a short letter if I were inclined now, as I am not, to define my position anew., Your very agreeable letter of the 15th is received., I regret the necessity of saying I have no daughter., I have three sons--one seventeen, one nine, and one seven., They with their mother constitute my whole family., As to the whiskers, as I have never worn any, do you not think that people would call it a piece of silly affectation were I to begin wearing them now?, I am your true friend and sincere well-wisher,  Your very kind letter of the 20th was duly received, for which please accept my thanks., I have another letter, from a writer unknown to me, saying the officers of the army at Fort Kearny have determined in case of Republican success at the approaching Presidential election, to take themselves, and the arms at that point, south, for the purpose of resistance to the government., While I think there are many chances to one that this is a humbug, it occurs to me that any real movement of this sort in the Army would leak out and become known to you., In such case, if it would not be unprofessional or dishonorable (of which you are to be judge), I shall be much obliged if you will apprise me of it., I am anxious for a personal interview with you at as early a day as possible., Can you, without much inconvenience, meet me at Chicago?, If you can, please name as early a day as you conveniently can, and telegraph me, unless there be sufficient time before the day named to communicate by mail., Yours of the 9th is just received., I can only answer briefly., Rest fully assured that the good people of the South who will put themselves in the same temper and mood towards me which you do will find no cause to complain of me., Please excuse me on this occasion from making a speech., I thank you in common with all those who have thought fit by their votes to indorse the Republican cause., I rejoice with you in the success which has thus far attended that cause., Yet in all our rejoicings let us neither express nor cherish any hard feelings toward any citizen who by his vote has differed with us., Let us at all times remember that all American citizens are brothers of a common country, and should dwell together in the bonds of fraternal feeling., Let me again beg you to accept my thanks, and to excuse me from further speaking at this time., I have read in the newspapers your speech recently delivered (I think) before the Georgia Legislature, or its assembled members., If you have revised it, as is probable, I shall be much obliged if you will send me a copy., Yours of the 4th was duly received., The inclosed to Governor Seward covers two notes to him, copies of which you find open for your inspection., Consult with Judge Trumbull; and if you and he see no reason to the contrary, deliver the letter to Governor Seward at once., If you see reason to the contrary write me at once., I have an intimation that Governor Banks would yet accept a place in the Cabinet., Please ascertain and write me how this is,  Your long letter received., Prevent, as far as possible, any of our friends from demoralizing themselves and our cause by entertaining propositions for compromise of any sort on ""slavery extension."", There is no possible compromise upon it but which puts us under again, and leaves all our work to do over again., Whether it be a Missouri line or Eli Thayer's popular sovereignty, it is all the same., Let either be done, and immediately filibustering and extending slavery recommences., On that point hold firm, as with a chain of steel., Yours of the 11th was received two days ago., Should the convocation of governors of which you speak seem desirous to know my views on the present aspect of things, tell them you judge from my speeches that I will be inflexible on the territorial question; but I probably think either the Missouri line extended, or Douglas's and Eli Thayer's popular sovereignty would lose us everything we gain by the election; that filibustering for all south of us and making slave States of it would follow in spite of us, in either case; also that I probably think all opposition, real and apparent, to the fugitive slave clause of the Constitution ought to be withdrawn., I believe you can pretend to find but little, if anything, in my speeches, about secession., But my opinion is that no State can in any way lawfully get out of the Union without the consent of the others; and that it is the duty of the President and other government functionaries to run the machine as it is., Last night I received your letter giving an account of your interview with General Scott, and for which I thank you., Please present my respects to the General, and tell him, confidentially, I shall be obliged to him to be as well prepared as he can to either hold or retake the forts, as the case may require, at and after the inauguration., Your obliging answer to my short note is just received, and for which please accept my thanks., I fully appreciate the present peril the country is in, and the weight of responsibility on me., Do the people of the South really entertain fear that a Republican administration would, directly or indirectly, interfere with the slaves, or with them about the slaves?, If they do, I wish to assure you, as once a friend, and still, I hope, not an enemy, that there is no cause for such fears., The South would be in no more danger in this respect than it was in the days of Washington., I suppose, however, this does not meet the case., You think slavery is right and ought to be extended, while we think it is wrong and ought to be restricted., That, I suppose, is the rub., It certainly is the only substantial difference between us., Resolved: That the fugitive slave clause of the Constitution ought to be enforced by a law of Congress, with efficient provisions for that object, not obliging private persons to assist in its execution, but punishing all who resist it, and with the usual safeguards to liberty, securing free men against being surrendered as slaves., That all State laws, if there be such, really or apparently in conflict with such law of Congress, ought to be repealed; and no opposition to the execution of such law of Congress ought to be made., That the Federal Union must be preserved., Prepared for the consideration of the Republican members of the Senate Committee of Thirteen., I am much obliged by the receipt of yours of the 18th., The most we can do now is to watch events, and be as well prepared as possible for any turn things may take., If the forts fall, my judgment is that they are to be retaken., When I shall determine definitely my time of starting to Washington, I will notify you., Without supposing that you and I are any nearer together, politically, than heretofore, allow me to tender you my sincere thanks for your Union resolution, expressive of views upon which we never were, and, I trust, never will be at variance., I need a man of Democratic antecedents from New England., I cannot get a fair share of that element in without., This stands in the way of Mr. Adams., I think of Governor Banks, Mr. Welles, and Mr. Tuck., Which of them do the New England delegation prefer?, Or shall I decide for myself?, Yours without signature was received last night., I have been considering your suggestions as to my reaching Washington somewhat earlier than is usual., It seems to me the inauguration is not the most dangerous point for us., ...]",3
259,"[Twenty-four hours ago, at the capital of Indiana, I said to myself, ""I have never seen so many people assembled together in winter weather."", I am no longer able to say that., But it is what might reasonably have been expected--that this great city of Cincinnati would thus acquit herself on such an occasion., My friends, I am entirely overwhelmed by the magnificence of the reception which has been given, I will not say to me, but to the President-elect of the United States of America., Most heartily do I thank you, one and all, for it., I have spoken but once before this in Cincinnati., That was a year previous to the late Presidential election., On that occasion, in a playful manner, but with sincere words, I addressed much of what I said to the Kentuckians., I gave my opinion that we, as Republicans, would ultimately beat them as Democrats, but that they could postpone that result longer by nominating Senator Douglas for the Presidency than they could by any other way., They did not, in any true sense of the word, nominate Mr. Douglas, and the result has come certainly as soon as ever I expected., I also told them how I expected they would be treated after they should have been beaten, and I now wish to call their attention to what I then said upon that subject., I then said:  ""When we do as we say, beat you, you perhaps want to know what we will do with you., I will tell you, as far as I am authorized to speak for the Opposition, what we mean to do with you., We mean to treat you, as near as we possibly can, as Washington, Jefferson, and Madison treated you., We mean to leave you alone, and in no way to interfere with your institutions; to abide by all and every compromise of the Constitution, and, in a word, coming back to the original proposition, to treat you so far as degenerate men, if we have degenerated, may, according to the example of those noble fathers, Washington, Jefferson, and Madison., ""We mean to remember that you are as good as we; that there is no difference between us other than the difference of circumstances., We mean to recognize and bear in mind always that you have as good hearts in your bosoms as other people, or as we claim to have, and treat you accordingly."", Fellow-citizens of Kentucky--friends and brethren, may I call you in my new position?--I see no occasion and feel no inclination to retract a word of this., If it shall not be made good, be assured the fault shall not be mine., I thank you and those whom you represent for the compliment you have paid me by tendering me this address., In so far as there is an allusion to our present national difficulties, which expresses, as you have said, the views of the gentlemen present, I shall have to beg pardon for not entering fully upon the questions which the address you have now read suggests., I deem it my duty--a duty which I owe to my constituents--to you, gentlemen, that I should wait until the last moment for a development of the present national difficulties before I express myself decidedly as to what course I shall pursue., I hope, then, not to be false to anything that you have expected of me., I agree with you, Mr. Chairman, that the working men are the basis of all governments, for the plain reason that they are all the more numerous, and as you added that those were the sentiments of the gentlemen present, representing not only the working class, but citizens of other callings than those of the mechanic, I am happy to concur with you in these sentiments, not only of the native-born citizens, but also of the Germans and foreigners from other countries., Mr. Chairman, I hold that while man exists it is his duty to improve not only his own condition, but to assist in ameliorating the condition of mankind; and therefore, without entering upon the details of the question, I will simply say that I am for those means which will give the greatest good to the greatest number., In regard to the Homestead law, I have to say that, in so far as the government lands can be disposed of, I am in favor of cutting up the wild lands into parcels, so that every poor man may have a home., In regard to the Germans and foreigners, I esteem them no better than other people, nor any worse., It is not my nature, when I see a people borne down by the weight of their shackles--the oppression of tyranny--to make their life more bitter by heaping upon them greater burdens; but rather would I do all in my power to raise the yoke than to add anything that would tend to crush them., Inasmuch as our own country is extensive and new, and the countries of Europe are densely populated, if there are any abroad who desire to make this the land of their adoption, it is not in my heart to throw aught in their way to prevent them from coming to the United States., Mr. Chairman and gentlemen, I will bid you an affectionate farewell., It is true, as has been said by the president of the Senate, that very great responsibility rests upon me in the position to which the votes of the American people have called me., I am deeply sensible of that weighty responsibility., I cannot but know what you all know, that without a name, perhaps without a reason why I should have a name, there has fallen upon me a task such as did not rest even upon the Father of his Country; and so feeling, I can turn and look for that support without which it will be impossible for me to perform that great task., I turn, then, and look to the American people and to that God who has never forsaken them., Allusion has been made to the interest felt in relation to the policy of the new administration., In this I have received from some a degree of credit for having kept silence, and from others some deprecation., I still think that I was right., In the varying and repeatedly shifting scenes of the present, and without a precedent which could enable me to judge by the past, it has seemed fitting that before speaking upon the difficulties of the country I should have gained a view of the whole field, being at liberty to modify and change the course of policy as future events may make a change necessary., I have not maintained silence from any want of real anxiety., It is a good thing that there is no more than anxiety, for there is nothing going wrong., It is a consoling circumstance that when we look out there is nothing that really hurts anybody., We entertain different views upon political questions, but nobody is suffering anything., This is a most consoling circumstance, and from it we may conclude that all we want is time, patience, and a reliance on that God who has never forsaken this people., Fellow-citizens, what I have said I have said altogether extemporaneously, and I will now come to a close., I fear that the great confidence placed in my ability is unfounded., Indeed, I am sure it is., Encompassed by vast difficulties as I am, nothing shall be wanting on my part, if sustained by God and the American people., I believe the devotion to the Constitution is equally great on both sides of the river., It is only the different understanding of that instrument that causes difficulty., The only dispute on both sides is, ""What are their rights?"", If the majority should not rule, who would be the judge?, Where is such a judge to be found?, We should all be bound by the majority of the American people; if not, then the minority must control., Would that be right?, Would it be just or generous?, Assuredly not., I reiterate that the majority should rule., If I adopt a wrong policy, the opportunity for condemnation will occur in four years' time., Then I can be turned out, and a better man with better views put in my place., I most cordially thank his Honor Mayor Wilson, and the citizens of Pittsburg generally, for their flattering reception., I am the more grateful because I know that it is not given to me alone, but to the cause I represent, which clearly proves to me their good-will, and that sincere feeling is at the bottom of it., And here I may remark that in every short address I have made to the people, in every crowd through which I have passed of late, some allusion has been made to the present distracted condition of the country., It is natural to expect that I should say something on this subject; but to touch upon it at all would involve an elaborate discussion of a great many questions and circumstances, requiring more time than I can at present command, and would, perhaps, unnecessarily commit me upon matters which have not yet fully developed themselves., The condition of the country is an extraordinary one, and fills the mind of every patriot with anxiety., It is my intention to give this subject all the consideration I possibly can before specially deciding in regard to it, so that when I do speak it may be as nearly right as possible., When I do speak I hope I may say nothing in opposition to the spirit of the Constitution, contrary to the integrity of the Union, or which will prove inimical to the liberties of the people, or to the peace of the whole country., And furthermore, when the time arrives for me to speak on this great subject, I hope I may say nothing to disappoint the people generally throughout the country, especially if the expectation has been based upon anything which I may have heretofore said., Notwithstanding the troubles across the river [the speaker pointing southwardly across the Monongahela, and smiling], there is no crisis but an artificial one., What is there now to warrant the condition of affairs presented by our friends over the river?, Take even their own view of the questions involved, and there is nothing to justify the course they are pursuing., I repeat, then, there is no crisis, excepting such a one as may be gotten up at any time by turbulent men aided by designing politicians, My advice to them, under such circumstances, is to keep cool., If the great American people only keep their temper on both sides of the line, the troubles will come to an end, and the question which now distracts the country will be settled, just as surely as all other difficulties of a like character which have originated in this government have been adjusted., Let the people on both sides keep their self-possession, and just as other clouds have cleared away in due time, so will this great nation continue to prosper as heretofore., But, fellow-citizens, I have spoken longer on this subject than I intended at the outset., It is often said that the tariff is the specialty of Pennsylvania., Assuming that direct taxation is not to be adopted, the tariff question must be as durable as the government itself., It is a question of national housekeeping., It is to the government what replenishing the meal-tub is to the family., Every varying circumstances will require frequent modifications as to the amount needed and the sources of supply., So far there is little difference of opinion among the people., It is as to whether, and how far, duties on imports shall be adjusted to favor home production in the home market, that controversy begins., One party insists that such adjustment oppresses one class for the advantage of another; while the other party argues that, with all its incidents, in the long run all classes are benefited., In the Chicago platform there is a plank upon this subject which should be a general law to the incoming administration., We should do neither more nor less than we gave the people reason to believe we would when they gave us their votes., Permit me, fellow-citizens, to read the tariff plank of the Chicago platform, or rather have it read in your hearing by one who has younger eyes., As with all general propositions, doubtless, there will be shades of difference in construing this., I have by no means a thoroughly matured judgment upon this subject, especially as to details; some general ideas are about all., I have long thought it would be to our advantage to produce any necessary article at home which can be made of as good quality and with as little labor at home as abroad, at least by the difference of the carrying from abroad., In such case the carrying is demonstrably a dead loss of labor., For instance, labor being the true standard of value, is it not plain that if equal labor get a bar of railroad iron out of a mine in England and another out of a mine in Pennsylvania, each can be laid down in a track at home cheaper than they could exchange countries, at least by the carriage?, If there be a present cause why one can be both made and carried cheaper in money price than the other can be made without carrying, that cause is an unnatural and injurious one, and ought gradually, if not rapidly, to be removed., The condition of the treasury at this time would seem to render an early revision of the tariff indispensable., The Morrill [tariff] bill, now pending before Congress, may or may not become a law., I am not posted as to its particular provisions, but if they are generally satisfactory, and the bill shall now pass, there will be an end for the present., If, however, it shall not pass, I suppose the whole subject will be one of the most pressing and important for the next Congress., By the Constitution, the executive may recommend measures which he may think proper, and he may veto those he thinks improper, and it is supposed that he may add to these certain indirect influences to affect the action of Congress., My political education strongly inclines me against a very free use of any of these means by the executive to control the legislation of the country., As a rule, I think it better that Congress should originate as well as perfect its measures without external bias., I therefore would rather recommend to every gentleman who knows he is to be a member of the next Congress to take an enlarged view, and post himself thoroughly, so as to contribute his part to such an adjustment of the tariff as shall produce a sufficient revenue, and in its other bearings, so far as possible, be just and equal to all sections of the country and classes of the people., We have been marching about two miles through snow, rain, and deep mud., ...]",3
260,"[If the election had fallen to any of the more distinguished citizens who received the support of the people, this same honor should have greeted him that greets me this day, in testimony of the universal, unanimous devotion of the whole people to the Constitution, the Union, and to the perpetual liberties of succeeding generations in this country., I have neither the voice nor the strength to address you at any greater length., I beg you will therefore accept my most grateful thanks for this manifest devotion--not to me, but the institutions of this great and glorious country., It is with feelings of great diffidence, and, I may say, with feelings of awe, perhaps greater than I have recently experienced, that I meet you here in this place., The history of this great State, the renown of those great men who have stood here, and have spoken here, and have been heard here, all crowd around my fancy, and incline me to shrink from any attempt to address you., Yet I have some confidence given me by the generous manner in which you have invited me, and by the still more generous manner in which you have received me, to speak further., You have invited and received me without distinction of party., I cannot for a moment suppose that this has been done in any considerable degree with reference to my personal services, but that it is done in so far as I am regarded, at this time, as the representative of the majesty of this great nation., I doubt not this is the truth, and the whole truth of the case, and this is as it should be., It is much more gratifying to me that this reception has been given to me as the elected representative of a free people, than it could possibly be if tendered merely as an evidence of devotion to me, or to any one man personally., And now I think it were more fitting that I should close these hasty remarks., It is true that, while I hold myself, without mock modesty, the humblest of all individuals that have ever been elevated to the Presidency, I have a more difficult task to perform than any one of them., You have generously tendered me the support--the united support--of the great Empire State., For this, in behalf of the nation--in behalf of the present and future of the nation--in behalf of civil and religious liberty for all time to come, most gratefully do I thank you., I do not propose to enter into an explanation of any particular line of policy, as to our present difficulties, to be adopted by the incoming administration., I deem it just to you, to myself, to all, that I should see everything, that I should hear everything, that I should have every light that can be brought within my reach, in order that, when I do so speak, I shall have enjoyed every opportunity to take correct and true ground; and for this reason I do not propose to speak at this time of the policy of the Government., But when the time comes, I shall speak, as well as I am able, for the good of the present and future of this country for the good both of the North and of the South--for the good of the one and the other, and of all sections of the country., In the meantime, if we have patience, if we restrain ourselves, if we allow ourselves not to run off in a passion, I still have confidence that the Almighty, the Maker of the universe, will, through the instrumentality of this great and intelligent people, bring us through this as He has through all the other difficulties of our country., Relying on this, I again thank you for this generous reception., I thank you very kindly for this great reception., Since I left my home it has not been my fortune to meet an assemblage more numerous and more orderly than this., I am the more gratified at this mark of your regard since you assure me it is tendered, not to the individual but to the high office you have called me to fill., I have neither strength nor time to make any extended remarks on this occasion, and I can only repeat to you my sincere thanks for the kind reception you have thought proper to extend to me., It is altogether impossible I should make myself heard by any considerable portion of this vast assemblage; but, although I appear before you mainly for the purpose of seeing you, and to let you see rather than hear me, I cannot refrain from saying that I am highly gratified--as much here, indeed, under the circumstances, as I have been anywhere on my route--to witness this noble demonstration--made, not in honor of an individual, but of the man who at this time humbly, but earnestly, represents the majesty of the nation., This reception, like all the others that have been tendered to me, doubtless emanates from all the political parties, and not from one alone., As such I accept it the more gratefully, since it indicates an earnest desire on the part of the whole people, with out regard to political differences, to save--not the country, because the country will save itself but to save the institutions of the country, those institutions under which, in the last three quarters of a century, we have grown to a great, and intelligent, and a happy people--the greatest, the most intelligent, and the happiest people in the world., These noble manifestations indicate, with unerring certainty, that the whole people are willing to make common cause for this object; that if, as it ever must be, some have been successful in the recent election and some have been beaten, if some are satisfied and some are dissatisfied, the defeated party are not in favor of sinking the ship, but are desirous of running it through the tempest in safety, and willing, if they think the people have committed an error in their verdict now, to wait in the hope of reversing it and setting it right next time., I do not say that in the recent election the people did the wisest thing, that could have been done--indeed, I do not think they did; but I do say that in accepting the great trust committed to me, which I do with a determination to endeavor to prove worthy of it, I must rely upon you, upon the people of the whole country, for support; and with their sustaining aid, even I, humble as I am, cannot fail to carry the ship of state safely through the storm., I have now only to thank you warmly for your kind attendance, and bid you all an affectionate farewell., I see that you are providing a platform for me., I shall have to decline standing upon it, because the president of the company tells me that I shall not have time to wait until it is brought to me., As I said yesterday, under similar circumstances at another gathering, you must not draw the inference that I have any intention of deserting any platform with which I have a legitimate connection because I do not stand on yours., Allow me to thank you for this splendid reception, and I now bid you farewell., I have but a moment to stand before you to listen to and return your kind greeting., I thank you for this reception, and for the pleasant manner in which it is tendered to me by our mutual friends., I will say in a single sentence, in regard to the difficulties that lie before me and our beloved country, that if I can only be as generously and unanimously sustained as the demonstrations I have witnessed indicate I shall be, I shall not fail; but without your sustaining hands I am sure that neither I nor any other man can hope to surmount these difficulties., I trust that in the course I shall pursue I shall be sustained not only by the party that elected me, but by the patriotic people of the whole country., I appear before you not to make a speech., I have not sufficient time, if I had the strength, to repeat speeches at every station where the people kindly gather to welcome me as we go along., If I had the strength, and should take the time, I should not get to Washington until after the inauguration, which you must be aware would not fit exactly., That such an untoward event might not transpire, I know you will readily forego any further remarks; and I close by bidding you farewell., I have stepped before you merely in compliance with what appears to be your wish, and not with the purpose of making a speech., I do not propose making a speech this afternoon., I could not be heard by any but a small fraction of you, at best; but, what is still worse than that, I have nothing just now to say that is worthy of your hearing., I beg you to believe that I do not now refuse to address you from any disposition to disoblige you, but to the contrary., But, at the same time, I beg of you to excuse me for the present., I am rather an old man to avail myself of such an excuse as I am now about to do., Yet the truth is so distinct, and presses itself so distinctly upon me, that I cannot well avoid it--and that is, that I did not understand when I was brought into this room that I was to be brought here to make a speech., It was not intimated to me that I was brought into the room where Daniel Webster and Henry Clay had made speeches, and where one in my position might be expected to do something like those men or say something worthy of myself or my audience., I therefore beg you to make allowance for the circumstances in which I have been by surprise brought before you., Now I have been in the habit of thinking and sometimes speaking upon political questions that have for some years past agitated the country; and, if I were disposed to do so, and we could take up some one of the issues, as the lawyers call them, and I were called upon to make an argument about it to the best of my ability, I could do so without much preparation., But that is not what you desire to have done here to-night., I have been occupying a position, since the Presidential election, of silence--of avoiding public speaking, of avoiding public writing., I have been doing so because I thought, upon full consideration, that was the proper course for me to take., I am brought before you now, and required to make a speech, when you all approve more than anything else of the fact that I have been keeping silence., And now it seems to me that the response you give to that remark ought to justify me in closing just here., I have not kept silence since the Presidential election from any party wantonness, or from any indifference to the anxiety that pervades the minds of men about the aspect of the political affairs of this country., I have kept silence for the reason that I supposed it was peculiarly proper that I should do so until the time came when, according to the custom of the country, I could speak officially., I still suppose that, while the political drama being enacted in this country at this time is rapidly shifting its scenes--forbidding an anticipation with any degree of certainty to-day of what we shall see to-morrow--it is peculiarly fitting that I should see it all, up to the last minute, before I should take ground that I might be disposed, by the shifting of the scenes afterward, also to shift., I have said several times upon this journey, and I now repeat it to you, that when the time does come, I shall then take the ground that I think is right--right for the North, for the South, for the East, for the West, for the whole country., And in doing so I hope to feel no necessity pressing upon me to say anything in conflict with the Constitution, in conflict with the continued union of these States, in conflict with the perpetuation of the liberties of this people, or anything in conflict with anything whatever that I have ever given you reason to expect from me., And now, my friends, have I said enough?, [Loud cries of ""No, no!"", and, ""Three cheers for LINCOLN!""], Now, my friends, there appears to be a difference of opinion between you and me, and I really feel called upon to decide the question myself., It is with feelings of deep gratitude that I make my acknowledgments for the reception that has been given me in the great commercial city of New York., I cannot but remember that it is done by the people who do not, by a large majority, agree with me in political sentiment., It is the more grateful to me because in this I see that for the great principles of our Government the people are pretty nearly or quite unanimous., In regard to the difficulties that confront us at this time, and of which you have seen fit to speak so becomingly and so justly, I can only say I agree with the sentiments expressed., In my devotion to the Union I hope I am behind no man in the nation., As to my wisdom in conducting affairs so as to tend to the preservation of the Union, I fear too great confidence may have been placed in me., I am sure I bring a heart devoted to the work., There is nothing that could ever bring me to consent--willingly to consent--to the destruction of this Union (in which not only the great city of New York, but the whole country, has acquired its greatness), unless it would be that thing for which the Union itself was made., I understand that the ship is made for the carrying and preservation of the cargo; and so long as the ship is safe with the cargo, it shall not be abandoned., This Union shall never be abandoned, unless the possibility of its existence shall cease to exist without the necessity of throwing passengers and cargo overboard., So long, then, as it is possible that the prosperity and liberties of this people can be preserved within this Union, it shall be my purpose at all tunes to preserve it., And now, Mr. Mayor, renewing my thanks for this cordial reception, allow me to come to a close., I shall only thank you briefly for this very kind reception given me, not personally, but as the temporary representative of the majesty of the nation., To the kindness of your hearts, and of the hearts of your brethren in your State, I should be very proud to respond, but I shall not have strength to address you or other assemblages at length, even if I had the time to do so., I appear before you, therefore, for little else than to greet you, and to briefly say farewell., You have done me the very high honor to present your reception courtesies to me through your great man a man with whom it is an honor to be associated anywhere, and in owning whom no State can be poor., He has said enough, and by the saying of it suggested enough, to require a response of an hour, well considered., I could not in an hour make a worthy response to it., I therefore, ladies and gentlemen of New Jersey, content myself with saying, most heartily do I indorse all the sentiments he has expressed., Allow me, most gratefully, to bid you farewell., I thank you for this reception at the city of Newark., With regard to the great work of which you speak, I will say that I bring to it a heart filled with love for my country, and an honest desire to do what is right., I am sure, however, that I have not the ability to do anything unaided of God, and that without His support and that of this free, happy, prosperous, and intelligent people, no man can succeed in doing that the importance of which we all comprehend., Again thanking you for the reception you have given me, I will now bid you farewell, and proceed upon my journey., I have been invited by your representatives to the Legislature to visit this the capital of your honored State, and in acknowledging their kind invitation, compelled to respond to the welcome of the presiding officers of each body, and I suppose they intended I should speak to you through them, as they are the representatives of all of you; and if I were to speak again here, I should only have to repeat in a great measure much that I have said, which would be disgusting to my friends around me who have met here., I have no speech to make, but merely appear to see you and let you look at me; and as to the latter I think I have greatly the best of the bargain., My friends, allow me to bid you farewell., I am very grateful to you for the honorable reception of which I have been the object., I cannot but remember the place that New Jersey holds in our early history., In the Revolutionary struggle few of the States among the Old Thirteen had more of the battle-fields of the country within their limits than New Jersey., May I be pardoned if, upon this occasion, I mention that away back in my childhood, the earliest days of my being able to read, I got hold of a small book, such a one as few of the younger members have ever seen Weems's Life of Washington., I remember all the accounts there given of the battle-fields and struggles for the liberties of the country; and none fixed themselves upon my imagination so deeply as the struggle here at Trenton, New Jersey., The crossing of the river, the contest with the Hessians, the great hardships endured at that time, all fixed themselves on my memory more than any single Revolutionary event; and you all know, for you have all been boys, how these early impressions last longer than any others., I recollect thinking then, boy even though I was, that there must have been something more than common that these men struggled for., I am exceedingly anxious that that thing that something even more than national independence, that something that held out a great promise to all the people of the world to all time to come--I am exceedingly anxious that this Union, the Constitution, and the liberties of the people shall be perpetuated in accordance with the original idea for which that struggle was made; and I shall be most happy indeed if I shall be a humble instrument in the hands of the Almighty, and of this his almost chosen people, for perpetuating the object of that great struggle., ...]",3
261,"[Allusion has been made to the fact--the interesting fact perhaps we should say--that I for the first time appear at the capital of the great commonwealth of Pennsylvania upon the birthday of the Father of his Country., In connection with that beloved anniversary connected with the history of this country, I have already gone through one exceedingly interesting scene this morning in the ceremonies at Philadelphia., Under the kind conduct of gentlemen there, I was for the first time allowed the privilege of standing in old Independence Hall to have a few words addressed to me there, and opening up to me an opportunity of manifesting my deep regret that I had not more time to express something of my own feelings excited by the occasion, that had been really the feelings of my whole life., Besides this, our friends there had provided a magnificent flag of the country., They had arranged it so that I was given the honor of raising it to the head of its staff, and when it went up I was pleased that it went to its place by the strength of my own feeble arm., When, according to the arrangement, the cord was pulled, and it floated gloriously to the wind, without an accident, in the bright, glowing sunshine of the morning, I could not help hoping that there was in the entire success of that beautiful ceremony at least something of an omen of what is to come., Nor could I help feeling then, as I have often felt, that in the whole of that proceeding I was a very humbled instrument., I had not provided the flag; I had not made the arrangements for elevating it to its place; I had applied but a very small portion of even my feeble strength in raising it., In the whole transaction I was in the hands of the people who had arranged it, and if I can have the same generous co-operation of the people of this nation, I think the flag of our country may yet be kept flaunting gloriously., I recur for a moment but to repeat some words uttered at the hotel in regard to what has been said about the military support which the General Government may expect from the commonwealth of Pennsylvania in a proper emergency., To guard against any possible mistake do I recur to this., It is not with any pleasure that I contemplate the possibility that a necessity may arise in this country for the use of the military arm., While I am exceedingly gratified to see the manifestation upon your streets of your military force here, and exceedingly gratified at your promise to use that force upon a proper emergency--while I make these acknowledgments I desire to repeat, in order to preclude any possible misconstruction, that I do most sincerely hope that we shall have no use for them; that it will never become their duty to shed blood, and most especially never to shed fraternal blood., I promise that so far as I may have wisdom to direct, if so painful a result shall in any wise be brought about, it shall be through no fault of mine., Allusion has also been made by one of your honored speakers to some remarks recently made by myself at Pittsburg in regard to what is supposed to be the especial interest of this great commonwealth of Pennsylvania., I now wish only to say in regard to that matter, that the few remarks which I uttered on that occasion were rather carefully worded., I took pains that they should be so., I have seen no occasion since to add to them or subtract from them., I leave them precisely as they stand, adding only now that I am pleased to have an expression from you, gentlemen of Pennsylvania, signifying that they are satisfactory to you., And now, gentlemen of the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, allow me again to return to you my most sincere thanks., I thank you, and through you the municipal authorities of this city who accompany you, for this welcome., And as it is the first time in my life, since the present phase of politics has presented itself in this country, that I have said anything publicly within a region of country where the institution of slavery exists, I will take this occasion to say that I think very much of the ill feeling that has existed and still exists between the people in the section from which I came and the people here, is dependent upon a misunderstanding of one another., I therefore avail myself of this opportunity to assure you, Mr. Mayor, and all the gentlemen present, that I have not now, and never have had, any other than as kindly feelings toward you as to the people of my own section., I have not now, and never have had, any disposition to treat you in any respect otherwise than as my own neighbors., I have not now any purpose to withhold from you any of the benefits of the Constitution, under any circumstances, that I would not feel myself constrained to withhold from my own neighbors; and I hope, in a word, that when we shall become better acquainted--and I say it with great confidence--we shall like each other better., I thank you for the kindness of this reception., I suppose that I may take this as a compliment paid to me, and as such please accept my thanks for it., I have reached this city of Washington under circumstances considerably differing from those under which any other man has ever reached it., I am here for the purpose of taking an official position amongst the people, almost all of whom were politically opposed to me, and are yet opposed to me, as I suppose., I propose no lengthy address to you., I only propose to say, as I did on yesterday, when your worthy mayor and board of aldermen called upon me, that I thought much of the ill feeling that has existed between you and the people of your surroundings and that people from among whom I came, has depended, and now depends, upon a misunderstanding., I hope that, if things shall go along as prosperously as I believe we all desire they may, I may have it in my power to remove something of this misunderstanding; that I may be enabled to convince you, and the people of your section of the country, that we regard you as in all things our equals, and in all things entitled to the same respect and the same treatment that we claim for ourselves; that we are in no wise disposed, if it were in our power, to oppress you, to deprive you of any of your rights under the Constitution of the United States, or even narrowly to split hairs with you in regard to these rights, but are determined to give you, as far as lies in our hands, all your rights under the Constitution--not grudgingly, but fully and fairly., I hope that, by thus dealing with you, we will become better acquainted, and be better friends., And now, my friends, with these few remarks, and again returning my thanks for this compliment, and expressing my desire to hear a little more of your good music, I bid you good-night., Gentlemen, it is evident that some one must take the responsibility of these appointments, and I will do it., My Cabinet is completed., The positions are not definitely assigned, and will not be until I announce them privately to the gentlemen whom I have selected as my Constitutional advisers., In compliance with a custom as old as the Government itself, I appear before you to address you briefly, and to take in your presence the oath prescribed by the Constitution of the United States to be taken by the President ""before he enters on the execution of his office."", I do not consider it necessary at present for me to discuss those matters of administration about which there is no special anxiety or excitement., Apprehension seems to exist among the people of the Southern States that by the accession of a Republican administration their property and their peace and personal security are to be endangered., There has never been any reasonable cause for such apprehension., Indeed, the most ample evidence to the contrary has all the while existed and been open to their inspection., It is found in nearly all the published speeches of him who now addresses you., I do but quote from one of those speeches when I declare that  ""I have no purpose, directly or indirectly, to interfere with the institution of slavery in the States where it exists., I believe I have no lawful right to do so, and I have no inclination to do so."", Those who nominated and elected me did so with full knowledge that I had made this and many similar declarations, and had never recanted them., And, more than this, they placed in the platform for my acceptance, and as a law to themselves and to me, the clear and emphatic resolution which I now read:  ""Resolved, That the maintenance inviolate of the rights of the States, and especially the right of each State to order and control its own domestic institutions according to its own judgment exclusively, is essential to that balance of power on which the perfection and endurance of our political fabric depend, and we denounce the lawless invasion by armed force of the soil of any State or Territory, no matter under what pretext, as amongst the gravest of crimes."", I now reiterate these sentiments; and, in doing so, I only press upon the public attention the most conclusive evidence of which the case is susceptible, that the property, peace, and security of no section are to be in any wise endangered by the now incoming administration., I add, too, that all the protection which, consistently with the Constitution and the laws, can be given, will be cheerfully given to all the States when lawfully demanded, for whatever cause--as cheerfully to one section as to another., There is much controversy about the delivering up of fugitives from service or labor., The clause I now read is as plainly written in the Constitution as any other of its provisions:  ""No person held to service or labor in one State, under the laws thereof, escaping into another, shall in consequence of any law or regulation therein be discharged from such service or labor, but shall be delivered up on claim of the party to whom such service or labor may be due."", It is scarcely questioned that this provision was intended by those who made it for the reclaiming of what we call fugitive slaves; and the intention of the lawgiver is the law., All members of Congress swear their support to the whole Constitution--to this provision as much as to any other., To the proposition, then, that slaves whose cases come within the terms of this clause ""shall be delivered up,"" their oaths are unanimous., Now, if they would make the effort in good temper, could they not with nearly equal unanimity frame and pass a law by means of which to keep good that unanimous oath?, There is some difference of opinion whether this clause should be enforced by national or by State authority; but surely that difference is not a very material one., If the slave is to be surrendered, it can be of but little consequence to him or to others by which authority it is done., And should any one in any case be content that his oath shall go unkept on a merely unsubstantial controversy as to how it shall be kept?, Again, in any law upon this subject, ought not all the safeguards of liberty known in civilized and humane jurisprudence to be introduced, so that a free man be not, in any case, surrendered as a slave?, And might it not be well at the same time to provide by law for the enforcement of that clause in the Constitution which guarantees that ""the citizens of each State shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in the several States""?, I take the official oath to-day with no mental reservations, and with no purpose to construe the Constitution or laws by any hypercritical rules., And, while I do not choose now to specify particular acts of Congress as proper to be enforced, I do suggest that it will be much safer for all, both in official and private stations, to conform to and abide by all those acts which stand unrepealed, than to violate any of them, trusting to find impunity in having them held to be unconstitutional., It is seventy-two years since the first inauguration of a President under our national Constitution., During that period fifteen different and greatly distinguished citizens have, in succession, administered the executive branch of the Government., They have conducted it through many perils, and generally with great success., Yet, with all this scope of precedent, I now enter upon the same task for the brief constitutional term of four years under great and peculiar difficulty., A disruption of the Federal Union, heretofore only menaced, is now formidably attempted., I hold that, in contemplation of universal law and of the Constitution, the Union of these States is perpetual., Perpetuity is implied, if not expressed, in the fundamental law of all national governments., It is safe to assert that no government proper ever had a provision in its organic law for its own termination., Continue to execute all the express provisions of our national Constitution, and the Union will endure forever--it being impossible to destroy it except by some action not provided for in the instrument itself., Again, if the United States be not a government proper, but an association of States in the nature of contract merely, can it as a contract be peaceably unmade by less than all the parties who made it?, One party to a contract may violate it--break it, so to speak; but does it not require all to lawfully rescind it?, Descending from these general principles, we find the proposition that in legal contemplation the Union is perpetual confirmed by the history of the Union itself., The Union is much older than the Constitution., It was formed, in fact, by the Articles of Association in 1774., It was matured and continued by the Declaration of Independence in 1776., It was further matured, and the faith of all the then thirteen States expressly plighted and engaged that it should be perpetual, by the Articles of Confederation in 1778., And, finally, in 1787 one of the declared objects for ordaining and establishing the Constitution was ""to form a more perfect Union."", But if the destruction of the Union by one or by a part only of the States be lawfully possible, the Union is less perfect than before the Constitution, having lost the vital element of perpetuity., It follows from these views that no State upon its own mere motion can lawfully get out of the Union; that resolves and ordinances to that effect are legally void; and that acts of violence, within any State or States, against the authority of the United States, are insurrectionary or revolutionary, according to circumstances., I therefore consider that, in view of the Constitution and the laws, the Union is unbroken; and to the extent of my ability I shall take care, as the Constitution itself expressly enjoins upon me, that the laws of the Union be faithfully executed in all the States., Doing this I deem to be only a simple duty on my part; and I shall perform it so far as practicable, unless my rightful masters, the American people, shall withhold the requisite means, or in some authoritative manner direct the contrary., I trust this will not be regarded as a menace, but only as the declared purpose of the Union that it will constitutionally defend and maintain itself., In doing this there needs to be no bloodshed or violence; and there shall be none, unless it be forced upon the national authority., The power confided to me will be used to hold, occupy, and possess the property and places belonging to the Government, and to collect the duties and imposts; but beyond what may be necessary for these objects, there will be no invasion, no using of force against or among the people anywhere., Where hostility to the United States, in any interior locality, shall be so great and universal as to prevent competent resident citizens from holding the Federal offices, there will be no attempt to force obnoxious strangers among the people for that object., While the strict legal right may exist in the government to enforce the exercise of these offices, the attempt to do so would be so irritating, and so nearly impracticable withal, that I deem it better to forego for the time the uses of such offices., The mails, unless repelled, will continue to be furnished in all parts of the Union., So far as possible, the people everywhere shall have that sense of perfect security which is most favorable to calm thought and reflection., The course here indicated will be followed unless current events and experience shall show a modification or change to be proper, and in every case and exigency my best discretion will be exercised according to circumstances actually existing, and with a view and a hope of a peaceful solution of the national troubles and the restoration of fraternal sympathies and affections., That there are persons in one section or another who seek to destroy the Union at all events, and are glad of any pretext to do it, I will neither affirm nor deny; but if there be such, I need address no word to them., To those, however, who really love the Union may I not speak?, Before entering upon so grave a matter as the destruction of our national fabric, with all its benefits, its memories, and its hopes, would it not be wise to ascertain precisely why we do it?, Will you hazard so desperate a step while there is any possibility that any portion of the ills you fly from have no real existence?, Will you, while the certain ills you fly to are greater than all the real ones you fly from--will you risk the commission of so fearful a mistake?, All profess to be content in the Union if all constitutional rights can be maintained., Is it true, then, that any right, plainly written in the Constitution, has been denied?, I think not., Happily the human mind is so constituted that no party can reach to the audacity of doing this., ...]",3
262,"[Please consider and answer by 9 A.M. to-morrow., As I have so frequently said heretofore, when I have had occasion to address the people of the Keystone, in my visits to that State, I can now but repeat the assurance of my gratification at the support you gave me at the election, and at the promise of a continuation of that support which is now tendered to me., Allusion has been made to the hope that you entertain that you have a President and a government., In respect to that I wish to say to you that in the position I have assumed I wish to do more than I have ever given reason to believe I would do., I do not wish you to believe that I assume to be any better than others who have gone before me., I prefer rather to have it understood that if we ever have a government on the principles we profess, we should remember, while we exercise our opinion, that others have also rights to the exercise of their opinions, and that we should endeavor to allow these rights, and act in such a manner as to create no bad feeling., I hope we have a government and a President., I hope, and wish it to be understood, that there may be no allusion to unpleasant differences., We must remember that the people of all the States are entitled to all the privileges and immunities of the citizens of the several States., We should bear this in mind, and act in such a way as to say nothing insulting or irritating., I would inculcate this idea, so that we may not, like Pharisees, set ourselves up to be better than other people., Now, my friends, my public duties are pressing to-day, and will prevent my giving more time to you., Indeed, I should not have left them now, but I could not well deny myself to so large and respectable a body., I am thankful for this renewed assurance of kind feeling and confidence, and the support of the old Bay State, in so far as you, Mr. Chairman, have expressed, in behalf of those whom you represent, your sanction of what I have enunciated in my inaugural address., This is very grateful to my feelings., The object was one of great delicacy, in presenting views at the opening of an administration under the peculiar circumstances attending my entrance upon the official duties connected with the Government., I studied all the points with great anxiety, and presented them with whatever of ability and sense of justice I could bring to bear., If it met the approbation of our good friends in Massachusetts, I shall be exceedingly gratified, while I hope it will meet the approbation of friends everywhere., I am thankful for the expressions of those who have voted with us; and like every other man of you, I like them as certainly as I do others., As the President in the administration of the Government, I hope to be man enough not to know one citizen of the United States from another, nor one section from another., I shall be gratified to have good friends of Massachusetts and others who have thus far supported me in these national views still to support me in carrying them out., Herewith is the diplomatic address and my reply., To whom the reply should be addressed--that is, by what title or style--I do not quite understand, and therefore I have left it blank., Will you please bring with you to-day the message from the War Department, with General Scott's note upon it, which we had here yesterday?, I wish to examine the General's opinion, which I have not yet done., Please accept my sincere thanks for your kind congratulations., It affords me pleasure to confirm the confidence you so generously express in the friendly disposition of the United States, through me, towards the sovereigns and governments you respectively represent., With equal satisfaction I accept the assurance you are pleased to give, that the same disposition is reciprocated by your sovereigns, your governments, and yourselves., Allow me to express the hope that these friendly relations may remain undisturbed, and also my fervent wishes for the health and happiness of yourselves personally., What think you of sending ministers at once as follows: Dayton to England; Fremont to France; Clay to Spain; Corwin to Mexico?, We need to have these points guarded as strongly and quickly as possible., This is suggestion merely, and not dictation., God help me., It is said I have offended you., I hope you will tell me how., Yours very truly,   I am entirely unconscious that you have any way offended me., I cherish no sentiment towards you but that of kindness and confidence., Very glad to know that I haven't., The bearer of this, Mr. C. T. Hempstow, is a Virginian who wishes to get, for his son, a small place in your Dept., I think Virginia should be heard, in such cases., Assuming it to be possible to now provision Fort Sumter, under all the circumstances is it wise to attempt it?, Please give me your opinion in writing on this question., The Senate has transmitted to me a copy of the message sent by my predecessor to that body on the 21st of February last, proposing to take its advice on the subject of a proposition made by the British Government through its minister here to refer the matter in controversy between that government and the Government of the United States to the arbitrament of the King of Sweden and Norway, the King of the Netherlands, or the Republic of the Swiss Confederation., In that message my predecessor stated that he wished to present to the Senate the precise questions following, namely:  ""Will the Senate approve a treaty referring to either of the sovereign powers above named the dispute now existing between the governments of the United States and Great Britain concerning the boundary line between Vancouver's Island and the American continent?, In case the referee shall find himself unable to decide where the line is by the description of it in the treaty of June 15, 1846, shall he be authorized to establish a line according to the treaty as nearly as possible?, Which of the three powers named by Great Britain as an arbiter shall be chosen by the United States?"", I find no reason to disapprove of the course of my predecessor in this important matter; but, on the contrary, I not only shall receive the advice of the Senate thereon cheerfully, but I respectfully ask the Senate for their advice on the three questions before recited., AI believe it is a necessity with us to make the appointments I mentioned last night--that is, Charles F. Adams to England, William L. Dayton to France, George P. Marsh to Sardinia, and Anson Burlingame to Austria., These gentlemen all have my highest esteem, but no one of them is originally suggested by me except Mr. Dayton., Mr. Adams I take because you suggested him, coupled with his eminent fitness for the place., Mr. Marsh and Mr. Burlingame I take because of the intense pressure of their respective States, and their fitness also., The objection to this card is that locally they are so huddled up--three being in New England and two from a single State., I have considered this, and will not shrink from the responsibility., This, being done, leaves but five full missions undisposed of--Rome, China, Brazil, Peru, and Chili., And then what about Carl Schurz; or, in other words, what about our German friends?, Shall we put the card through, and arrange the rest afterward?, What say you?, I did see and talk with Master Geo., Evans Patten last May at Springfield, Ill., I have received a copy of the resolution of the Senate, passed on the 25th instant, requesting me, if in my opinion not incompatible with the public interest, to communicate to the Senate the despatches of Major Robert Anderson to the War Department during the time he has been in command of Fort Sumter., On examination of the correspondence thus called for, I have, with the highest respect for the Senate, come to the conclusion that at the present moment the publication of it would be inexpedient., I desire that an expedition to move by sea be got ready to sail as early as the 6th of April next, the whole according to memorandum attached, and that you cooperate with the Secretary of the Navy for that object., Steamers Pocahontas at Norfolk, Paunee at Washington, Harriet Lane at New York, to be under sailing orders for sea, with stores, etc., for one month., Three hundred men to be kept ready for departure from on board the receiving-ships at New York., Two hundred men to be ready to leave Governor's Island in New York., Supplies for twelve months for one hundred men to be put in portable shape, ready for instant shipping., A large steamer and three tugs conditionally engaged., Cousin Lizzie shows me your letter of the 27th., The question of giving her the Springfield post-office troubles me., You see I have already appointed William Jayne a Territorial governor and Judge Trumbull's brother to a land-office., Will it do for me to go on and justify the declaration that Trumbull and I have divided out all the offices among our relatives?, Dr. Wallace, you know, is needy, and looks to me; and I personally owe him much., I see by the papers, a vote is to be taken as to the post-office., Could you not set up Lizzie and beat them all?, She, being here, need know nothing of it, so therefore there would be no indelicacy on her part., Fit out the Powhatan to go to sea at the earnest possible moment under sealed orders., Orders by a confidential messenger go forward to-morrow., You will proceed to New York, and with the least possible delay, assuming command of any naval steamer available, proceed to Pensacola Harbor, and at any cost or risk prevent any expedition from the mainland reaching Fort Pickens or Santa Rosa Island., You will exhibit this order to any naval officer at Pensacola, if you deem it necessary, after you have established yourself within the harbor, and will request co-operation by the entrance of at least one other steamer., This order, its object, and your destination will be communicated to no person whatever until you reach the harbor of Pensacola., All officers of the army and navy to whom this order may be exhibited will aid by every means in their power the expedition under the command of Colonel Harvey Brown, supplying him with men and material, and co-operating with him as he may desire., Circumstances render it necessary to place in command of your ship (and for a special purpose) an officer who is fully informed and instructed in relation to the wishes of the Government, and you will therefore consider yourself detached., But in taking this step the Government does not in the least reflect upon your efficiency or patriotism; on the contrary, have the fullest confidence in your ability to perform any duty required of you., Hoping soon to be able to give you a better command than the one you now enjoy, and trusting that you will have full confidence in the disposition of the Government toward you, I remain, etc.,  Some thoughts for the President's Consideration,  First., We are at the end of a month's administration, and yet without a policy either domestic or foreign., Second., This, however, is not culpable, and it has even been unavoidable., The presence of the Senate, with the need to meet applications for patronage, have prevented attention to other and more grave matters., Third., But further delay to adopt and prosecute our policies for both domestic and foreign affairs would not only bring scandal on the administration, but danger upon the country., Fourth., To do this we must dismiss the applicants for office., But how?, I suggest that we make the local appointments forthwith, leaving foreign or general ones for ulterior and occasional action., Fifth., The policy at home., I am aware that my views are singular, and perhaps not sufficiently explained., My system is built upon this idea as a ruling one, namely, that we must CHANGE THE QUESTION BEFORE THE PUBLIC FROM ONE UPON SLAVERY, OR ABOUT SLAVERY, for a question upon UNION OR DISUNION: In other words, from what would be regarded as a party question, to one of patriotism or union., The occupation or evacuation of Fort Sumter, although not in fact a slavery or a party question, is so regarded., Witness the temper manifested by the Republicans in the free States, and even by the Union men in the South., ...]",3
263,"[In witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed., Done at the city of Washington, this twenty seventh day of April, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-one, and of the independence of the United States the eighty-fifth., I have desired as sincerely as any man, and I sometimes think more than any other man, that our present difficulties might be settled without the shedding of blood., I will not say that all hope has yet gone; but if the alternative is presented whether the Union is to be broken in fragments and the liberties of the people lost, or blood be shed, you will probably make the choice with which I shall not be dissatisfied., You are engaged in suppressing an insurrection against the laws of the United States., If at any point on or in the vicinity of any military line which is now or which shall be used between the City of Philadelphia and the city of Washington you find resistance which renders it necessary to suspend the writ of habeas corpus for the public safety, you personally, or through the officer in command at the point at which resistance occurs, are authorized to suspend that writ., The President of the United States directs that you enroll in the military service of the United States the loyal citizens of Saint Louis and vicinity, not exceeding, with those heretofore enlisted, ten thousand in number, for the purpose of maintaining the authority of the United States; for the protection of the peaceful inhabitants of Missouri; and you will, if deemed necessary for that purpose by yourself, by Messrs. Oliver F. Ferny, John How, James O. Broadhead, Samuel T. Glover, J. Wilzie, Francis P. Blair, Jr., proclaim martial law in the city of Saint Louis., The additional force hereby authorized shall be discharged in part or in whole, if enlisted., As soon as it appears to you and the gentlemen above mentioned that there is no danger of an attempt on the part of the enemies of the Government to take military possession of the city of Saint Louis, or put the city in control of the combination against the Government of the United States; and whilst such additional force remains in the service the same shall be governed by the Rules and Articles of War, and such special regulations as you may prescribe., I shall like the force hereafter directed to be enrolled to be under your command., The arms and other military stores in the Saint Louis Arsenal not needed for the forces of the United States in Missouri must be removed to Springfield, or some other safe place of deposit in the State of Illinois, as speedily as practicable, by the ordnance officers in charge at Saint Louis., It is revolutionary times, and therefore I do not object to the irregularity of this., W. S.  I sincerely regret that the failure of the late attempt to provision Fort Sumter should be the source of any annoyance to you., The practicability of your plan was not, in fact, brought to a test., By reason of a gale, well known in advance to be possible and not improbable, the tugs, an essential part of the plan, never reached the ground; while, by an accident for which you were in no wise responsible, and possibly I to some extent was, you were deprived of a war vessel, with her men, which you deemed of great importance to the enterprise., I most cheerfully and truly declare that the failure of the undertaking has not lowered you a particle, while the qualities you developed in the effort have greatly heightened you in my estimation., For a daring and dangerous enterprise of a similar character you would to-day be the man of all my acquaintances whom I would select., You and I both anticipated that the cause of the country would be advanced by making the attempt to provision Fort Sumter, even if it should fail; and it is no small consolation now to feel that our anticipation is justified by the result., Whereas existing exigencies demand immediate and adequate measures for the protection of the National Constitution and the preservation of the National Union by the suppression of the insurrectionary combinations now existing in several States for opposing the laws of the Union and obstructing the execution thereof, to which end a military force in addition to that called forth by my proclamation of the 15th day of April in the present year appears to be indispensably necessary:  Now, therefore, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States and Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy thereof and of the militia of the several States when called into actual service, do hereby call into the service of the United States 42,034 volunteers to serve for the period of three years, unless sooner discharged, and to be mustered into service as infantry and cavalry., The proportions of each arm and the details of enrollment and organization will be made known through the Department of War., And I also direct that the Regular Army of the United States be increased by the addition of eight regiments of infantry, one regiment of cavalry, and one regiment of artillery, making altogether a maximum aggregate increase of 22,714 officers and enlisted men, the details of which increase will also be made known through the Department of War., And I further direct the enlistment for not less than one or more than three years of 18,000 seamen, in addition to the present force, for the naval service of the United States., The details of the enlistment and organization will be made known through the Department of the Navy., The call for volunteers hereby made and the direction for the increase of the Regular Army and for the enlistment of seamen hereby given, together with the plan of organization adopted for the volunteer and for the regular forces hereby authorized, will be submitted to Congress as soon as assembled., In the meantime I earnestly invoke the co-operation of all good citizens in the measures hereby adopted for the effectual suppression of unlawful violence, for the impartial enforcement of constitutional laws, and for the speediest possible restoration of peace and order, and with these of happiness and prosperity, throughout our country., In testimony whereof I have hereunto set my band and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed   Please advise me at the close of each day what troops left during the day, where going, and by what route; what remaining at New York, and what expected in the next day., Give the numbers, as near as convenient, and what corps they are., This information, reaching us daily, will be very useful as well as satisfactory., Know ye that, reposing special trust and confidence in the patriotism, valor, fidelity, and ability of Colonel Robert Anderson, U. S. Army, I have empowered him, and do hereby empower him, to receive into the army of the United States as many regiments of volunteer troops from the State of Kentucky and from the western part of the State of Virginia as shall be willing to engage in the Service of the United States for the term of three years, upon the terms and according to the plan proposed by the proclamation of May 3, 1861, and General Orders No., 15, from the War Department, of May 4, 1861., The troops whom he receives shall be on the same footing in every respect as those of the like kind called for in the proclamation above cited, except that the officers shall be commissioned by the United States., He is therefore carefully and diligently to discharge the duty hereby devolved upon him by doing and performing all manner of things thereunto belonging., Given under my hand, at the city of Washington, this 7th day of May, A. D. 1861, and in the eighty-fifth year of the independence of the United States., Whereas an insurrection exists in the State of Florida, by which the lives, liberty, and property of loyal citizens of the United States are endangered:  And whereas it is deemed proper that all needful measures should be taken for the protection of such citizens and all officers of the United States in the discharge of their public duties in the State aforesaid:  Now, therefore, be it known that I, Abraham LINCOLN, President of the United States, do hereby direct the commander of the forces of the United States on the Florida coast to permit no person to exercise any office or authority upon the islands of Key West, the Tortugas, and Santa Rosa, which may be inconsistent with the laws and Constitution of the United States, authorizing him at the same time, if he shall find it necessary, to suspend there the writ of habeas corpus, and to remove from the vicinity of the United States fortresses all dangerous or suspected persons., In witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.Lieut., D. D. Porter was placed in command of the steamer Powhatan, and Captain Samuel Mercer was detached therefrom, by my special order, and neither of them is responsible for any apparent or real irregularity on their part or in connection with that vessel., Hereafter Captain Porter is relieved from that special service and placed under the direction of the Navy Department, from which he will receive instructions and to which he will report., Mr. Dallas, in a brief despatch of May 2d (No., 333), tells us that Lord John Russell recently requested an interview with him on account of the solicitude which his lordship felt concerning the effect of certain measures represented as likely to be adopted by the President., In that conversation the British secretary told Mr. Dallas that the three representatives of the Southern Confederacy were then in London, that Lord John Russell had not yet seen them, but that he was not unwilling to see them unofficially., He further informed Mr. Dallas that an understanding exists between the British and French governments which would lead both to take one and the same course as to recognition., His lordship then referred to the rumor of a meditated blockade by us of Southern ports, and a discontinuance of them as ports of entry., Mr. Dallas answered that he knew nothing on those topics, and therefore  could say nothing., He added that you were expected to arrive in two weeks., Upon this statement Lord John Russell acquiesced in the expediency of waiting for the full knowledge you were expected to bring., Mr. Dallas transmitted to us some newspaper reports of ministerial explanations made in Parliament., You will base no proceedings on parliamentary debates further than to seek explanations when necessary and communicate them to this department., We intend to have a clear and simple record of whatever issue may arise between us and Great Britain., The President is surprised and grieved regrets that Mr. Dallas did not protest against the proposed unofficial intercourse between the British Government and the missionaries of the insurgents as well as against the demand for explanations made by the British Government., It is due, however, to Mr. Dallas to say that our instructions had been given only to you and not to him, and that his loyalty and fidelity, too rare in these times [among our late representatives abroad, are confessed and] are appreciated., Intercourse of any kind with the so-called commissioners is liable to be construed as a recognition of the authority which appointed them., Such intercourse would be none the less wrongful hurtful to us for being called unofficial, and it might be even more injurious, because we should have no means of knowing what points might be resolved by it., Moreover, unofficial intercourse is useless and meaningless if it is not expected to ripen into official intercourse and direct recognition., It is left doubtful here whether the proposed unofficial intercourse has yet actually begun., Your own [present] antecedent instructions are deemed explicit enough, and it is hoped that you have not misunderstood them., You will in any event desist from all intercourse whatever, unofficial as well as official, with the British Government, so long as it shall continue intercourse of either kind with the domestic enemies of this country confining yourself to a delivery of a copy of this paper to the Secretary of State., After doing this., When intercourse shall have been arrested for this cause, you will communicate with this department and receive further directions., Lord John Russell has informed us of an understanding between the British and French governments that they will act together in regard to our affairs., This communication, however, loses something of its value from the circumstance that the communication was withheld until after knowledge of the fact had been acquired by us from other sources., We know also another fact that has not yet been officially communicated to us--namely, that other European States are apprised by France and England of their agreement, and are expected to concur with or follow them in whatever measures they adopt on the subject of recognition., The United States have been impartial and just in all their conduct toward the several nations of Europe., They will not complain, however, of the combination now announced by the two leading powers, although they think they had a right to expect a more independent, if not a more friendly, course from each of them., You will take no notice of that or any other alliance., Whenever the European governments shall see fit to communicate directly with us, we shall be, as heretofore, frank and explicit in our reply., As to the blockade, you will say that by our own laws of nature and the laws of nature and the laws of nations, this Government has a clear right to suppress insurrection., An exclusion of commerce from national ports which have been seized by the insurgents, in the equitable form of blockade, is the proper means to that end., You will [admit] not insist that our blockade is [not] to be respected if it be not maintained by a competent force; but passing by that question as not now a practical, or at least an urgent, one, you will add that [it] the blockade is now, and it will continue to be so maintained, and therefore we expect it to be respected by Great Britain., You will add that we have already revoked the exequatur of a Russian consul who had enlisted in the military service of the insurgents, and we shall dismiss or demand the recall of every foreign agent, consular or diplomatic, who shall either disobey the Federal laws or disown the Federal authority., As to the recognition of the so-called Southern Confederacy, it is not to be made a subject of technical definition., It is, of course, [quasi] direct recognition to publish an acknowledgment of the sovereignty and independence of a new power., It is [quasi] direct recognition to receive its ambassadors, ministers, agents, or commissioners officially., A concession of belligerent rights is liable to be construed as a recognition of them., No one of these proceedings will [be borne] pass [unnoticed] unquestioned by the United States in this case., Hitherto recognition has been moved only on the assumption that the so-called Confederate States are de facto a self-sustaining power., Now, after long forbearance, designed to soothe discontent and avert the need of civil war, the land and naval forces of the United States have been put in motion to repress the insurrection., The true character of the pretended new State is at once revealed., It is seen to be a power existing in pronunciamento only, It has never won a field., It has obtained no forts that were not virtually betrayed into its hands or seized in breach of trust., It commands not a single port on the coast nor any highway out from its pretended capital by land., Under these circumstances Great Britain is called upon to intervene and give it body and independence by resisting our measures of suppression., British recognition would be British intervention to create within our own territory a hostile state by overthrowing this republic itself., [When this act of intervention is distinctly performed, we from that hour shall cease to be friends, and become once more, as we have twice before been forced to be, enemies of Great Britain.], As to the treatment of privateers in the insurgent service, you will say that this is a question exclusively our own., We treat them as pirates., They are our own citizens, or persons employed by our citizens, preying on the commerce of our country., If Great Britain shall choose to recognize them as lawful belligerents, and give them shelter from our pursuit and punishment, the laws of nations afford an adequate and proper remedy [and we shall avail ourselves of it., And while you need not say this in advance, be sure that you say nothing inconsistent with it.], Happily, however, her Britannic Majesty's government can avoid all these difficulties., It invited us in 1856 to accede to the declaration of the Congress of Paris, of which body Great Britain was herself a member, abolishing privateering everywhere in all cases and forever., You already have our authority to propose to her our accession to that declaration., If she refuse to receive it, it can only be because she is willing to become the patron of privateering when aimed at our devastation., These positions are not elaborately defended now, because to vindicate them would imply a possibility of our waiving them., 1 We are not insensible of the grave importance of  1 (Drop all from this line to the end, and in lieu of it write, ""This paper is for your own guidance only, and not [sic] to be read or shown to any one.""), this occasion., We see how, upon the result of the debate in which we are engaged, a war may ensue between the United States and one, two, or even more European nations., War in any case is as exceptionable from the habits as it is revolting from the sentiments of the American people., But if it come, it will be fully seen that it results from the action of Great Britain, not our own; that Great Britain will have decided to fraternize with our domestic enemy, either without waiting to hear from you our remonstrances and our warnings, or after having heard them., War in defense of national life is not immoral, and war in defense of independence is an inevitable part of the discipline of nations., The dispute will be between the European and the American branches of the British race., ...]",3
264,"[Finding this condition of things, and believing it to be an imperative duty upon the incoming executive to prevent, if possible, the consummation of such attempt to destroy the Federal Union, a choice of means to that end became indispensable., This choice was made and was declared in the inaugural address., The policy chosen looked to the exhaustion of all peaceful measures before a resort to any stronger ones., It sought only to hold the public places and property not already wrested from the government, and to collect the revenue, relying for the rest on time, discussion, and the ballot-box., It promised a continuance of the mails, at government expense, to the very people who were resisting the government; and it gave repeated pledges against any disturbance to any of the people, or any of their rights., Of all that which a President might constitutionally and justifiably do in such a case, everything was forborne without which it was believed possible to keep the government on foot., On the 5th of March (the present incumbent's first full day in office), a letter of Major Anderson, commanding at Fort Sumter, written on the 28th of February and received at the War Department on the 4th of March, was by that department placed in his hands., This letter expressed the professional opinion of the writer that reinforcements could not be thrown into that fort within the time for his relief, rendered necessary by the limited supply of provisions, and with a view of holding possession of the same, with a force of less than twenty thousand good and well-disciplined men., This opinion was concurred in by all the officers of his command, and their memoranda on the subject were made inclosures of Major Anderson's letter., The whole was immediately laid before Lieutenant-General Scott, who at once concurred with Major Anderson in opinion., On reflection, however, he took full time, consulting with other officers, both of the army and the navy, and at the end of four days came reluctantly but decidedly to the same conclusion as before., He also stated at the same time that no such sufficient force was then at the control of the government, or could be raised and brought to the ground within the time when the provisions in the fort would be exhausted., In a purely military point of view, this reduced the duty of the administration in the case to the mere matter of getting the garrison safely out of the fort., It was believed, however, that to so abandon that position, under the circumstances, would be utterly ruinous; that the necessity under which it was to be done would not be fully understood; that by many it would be construed as a part of a voluntary policy; that at home it would discourage the friends of the Union, embolden its adversaries, and go far to insure to the latter a recognition abroad; that in fact, it would be our national destruction consummated., This could not be allowed., Starvation was not yet upon the garrison, and ere it would be reached Fort Pickens might be reinforced., This last would be a clear indication of policy, and would better enable the country to accept the evacuation of Fort Sumter as a military necessity., An order was at once directed to be sent for the landing of the troops from the steamship Brooklyn into Fort Pickens., This order could not go by land, but must take the longer and slower route by sea., The first return news from the order was received just one week before the fall of Fort Sumter., The news itself was that the officer commanding the Sabine, to which vessel the troops had been transferred from the Brooklyn, acting upon some quasi armistice of the late administration (and of the existence of which the present administration, up to the time the order was despatched, had only too vague and uncertain rumors to fix attention), had refused to land the troops., To now reinforce Fort Pickens before a crisis would be reached at Fort Sumter was impossible--rendered so by the near exhaustion of provisions in the latter-named fort., In precaution against such a conjuncture, the government had, a few days before, commenced preparing an expedition as well adapted as might be to relieve Fort Sumter, which expedition was intended to be ultimately used, or not, according to circumstances., The strongest anticipated case for using it was now presented, and it was resolved to send it forward., As had been intended in this contingency, it was also resolved to notify the governor of South Carolina that he might expect an attempt would be made to provision the fort; and that, if the attempt should not be resisted, there would be no effort to throw in men, arms, or ammunition, without further notice, or in case of an attack upon the fort., This notice was accordingly given; whereupon the fort was attacked and bombarded to its fall, without even awaiting the arrival of the provisioning expedition., It is thus seen that the assault upon and reduction of Fort Sumter was in no sense a matter of self-defense on the part of the assailants., They well knew that the garrison in the fort could by no possibility commit aggression upon them., They knew--they were expressly notified--that the giving of bread to the few brave and hungry men of the garrison was all which would on that occasion be attempted, unless themselves, by resisting so much, should provoke more., They knew that this government desired to keep the garrison in the fort, not to assail them, but merely to maintain visible possession, and thus to preserve the Union from actual and immediate dissolution--trusting, as hereinbefore stated, to time, discussion, and the ballot-box for final adjustment; and they assailed and reduced the fort for precisely the reverse object--to drive out the visible authority of the Federal Union, and thus force it to immediate dissolution., That this was their object the executive well understood; and having said to them in the inaugural address, ""You can have no conflict without being yourselves the aggressors,"" he took pains not only to keep this declaration good, but also to keep the case so free from the power of ingenious sophistry that the world should not be able to misunderstand it., By the affair at Fort Sumter, with its surrounding circumstances, that point was reached., Then and thereby the assailants of the government began the conflict of arms, without a gun in sight or in expectancy to return their fire, save only the few in the fort sent to that harbor years before for their own protection, and still ready to give that protection in whatever was lawful., In this act, discarding all else, they have forced upon the country the distinct issue, ""immediate dissolution or blood."", And this issue embraces more than the fate of these United States., It presents to the whole family of man the question whether a constitutional republic or democracy--a government of the people by the same people--can or cannot maintain its territorial integrity against its own domestic foes., It presents the question whether discontented individuals, too few in numbers to control administration according to organic law in any case, can always, upon the pretenses made in this case, or on any other pretenses, or arbitrarily without any pretense, break up their government, and thus practically put an end to free government upon the earth., It forces us to ask: Is there in all republics this inherent and fatal weakness?, Must a government, of necessity, be too strong for the liberties of its own people, or too weak to maintain its own existence?, So viewing the issue, no choice was left but to call out the war power of the government, and so to resist force employed for its destruction by force for its preservation., The call was made, and the response of the country was most gratifying, surpassing in unanimity and spirit the most sanguine expectation., Yet none of the States commonly called slave States, except Delaware, gave a regiment through regular State organization., A few regiments have been organized within some others of those States by individual enterprise, and received into the government service., Of course the seceded States, so called (and to which Texas had been joined about the time of the inauguration), gave no troops to the cause of the Union., The border States, so called, were not uniform in their action, some of them being almost for the Union, while in others--as Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Arkansas--the Union sentiment was nearly repressed and silenced., The course taken in Virginia was the most remarkable--perhaps the most important., A convention elected by the people of that State to consider this very question of disrupting the Federal Union was in session at the capital of Virginia when Fort Sumter fell., To this body the people had chosen a large majority of professed Union men., Almost immediately after the fall of Sumter, many members of that majority went over to the original disunion minority, and with them adopted an ordinance for withdrawing the State from the Union., Whether this change was wrought by their great approval of the assault upon Sumter, or their great resentment at the government's resistance to that assault, is not definitely known., Although they submitted the ordinance for ratification to a vote of the people, to be taken on a day then somewhat more than a month distant, the convention and the Legislature (which was also in session at the same time and place), with leading men of the State not members of either, immediately commenced acting as if the State were already out of the Union., They pushed military preparations vigorously forward all over the State., They seized the United States armory at Harper's Ferry, and the navy-yard at Gosport, near Norfolk., They received perhaps invited--into their State large bodies of troops, with their warlike appointments, from the so-called seceded States., They formally entered into a treaty of temporary alliance and co-operation with the so-called ""Confederate States,"" and sent members to their congress at Montgomery., And finally, they permitted the insurrectionary government to be transferred to their capital at Richmond., The people of Virginia have thus allowed this giant insurrection to make its nest within her borders; and this government has no choice left but to deal with it where it finds it., And it has the less regret as the loyal citizens have, in due form, claimed its protection., Those loyal citizens this government is bound to recognize and protect, as being Virginia., In the border States, so called,--in fact, the middle States,--there are those who favor a policy which they call ""armed neutrality""; that is, an arming of those States to prevent the Union forces passing one way, or the disunion the other, over their soil., This would be disunion completed., Figuratively speaking, it would be the building of an impassable wall along the line of separation--and yet not quite an impassable one, for under the guise of neutrality it would tie the hands of Union men and freely pass supplies from among them to the insurrectionists, which it could not do as an open enemy., At a stroke it would take all the trouble off the hands of secession, except only what proceeds from the external blockade., It would do for the disunionists that which, of all things, they most desire--feed them well and give them disunion without a struggle of their own., It recognizes no fidelity to the Constitution, no obligation to maintain the Union; and while very many who have favored it are doubtless loyal citizens, it is, nevertheless, very injurious in effect., Recurring to the action of the government, it may be stated that at first a call was made for 75,000 militia; and, rapidly following this, a proclamation was issued for closing the ports of the insurrectionary districts by proceedings in the nature of blockade., So far all was believed to be strictly legal., At this point the insurrectionists announced their purpose to enter upon the practice of privateering., Other calls were made for volunteers to serve for three years, unless sooner discharged, and also for large additions to the regular army and navy., These measures, whether strictly legal or not, were ventured upon, under what appeared to be a popular demand and a public necessity; trusting then, as now, that Congress would readily ratify them., It is believed that nothing has been done beyond the constitutional competency of Congress., Soon after the first call for militia, it was considered a duty to authorize the commanding general in proper cases, according to his discretion, to suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus, or, in other words, to arrest and detain, without resort to the ordinary processes and forms of law, such individuals as he might deem dangerous to the public safety., This authority has purposely been exercised but very sparingly., Nevertheless, the legality and propriety of what has been done under it are questioned, and the attention of the country has been called to the proposition that one who has sworn to ""take care that the laws be faithfully executed"" should not himself violate them., Of course some consideration was given to the questions of power and propriety before this matter was acted upon., The whole of the laws which were required to be faithfully executed were being resisted and failing of execution in nearly one third of the States., Must they be allowed to finally fail of execution, even had it been perfectly clear that by the use of the means necessary to their execution some single law, made in such extreme tenderness of the citizen's liberty that, practically, it relieves more of the guilty than of the innocent, should to a very limited extent be violated?, To state the question more directly, are all the laws but one to go unexecuted, and the government itself go to pieces lest that one be violated?, Even in such a case, would not the official oath be broken if the government should be overthrown when it was believed that disregarding the single law would tend to preserve it?, But it was not believed that this question was presented., It was not believed that any law was violated., The provision of the Constitution that ""the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended, unless when, in cases of rebellion or invasion, the public safety may require it,"" is equivalent to a provision--is a provision--that such privilege may be suspended when, in case of rebellion or invasion, the public safety does require it., It was decided that we have a case of rebellion, and that the public safety does require the qualified suspension of the privilege of the writ which was authorized to be made., Now it is insisted that Congress, and not the executive, is vested with this power., But the Constitution itself is silent as to which or who is to exercise the power; and as the provision was plainly made for a dangerous emergency, it cannot be believed the framers of the instrument intended that in every case the danger should run its course until Congress could be called together, the very assembling of which might be prevented, as was intended in this case, by the rebellion., No more extended argument is now offered, as an opinion at some length will probably be presented by the attorney-general., Whether there shall be any legislation upon the subject, and if any, what, is submitted entirely to the better judgment of Congress., The forbearance of this government had been so extraordinary and so long continued as to lead some foreign nations to shape their action as if they supposed the early destruction of our national Union was probable., While this, on discovery, gave the executive some concern, he is now happy to say that the sovereignty and rights of the United States are now everywhere practically respected by foreign powers; and a general sympathy with the country is manifested throughout the world., The reports of the Secretaries of the Treasury, War, and the Navy will give the information in detail deemed necessary and convenient for your deliberation and action; while the executive and all the departments will stand ready to supply omissions, or to communicate new facts considered important for you to know., It is now recommended that you give the legal means for making this contest a short and decisive one: that you place at the control of the government for the work at least four hundred thousand men and $400,000,000., That number of men is about one-tenth of those of proper ages within the regions where, apparently, all are willing to engage; and the sum is less than a twenty-third part of the money value owned by the men who seem ready to devote the whole., A debt of $600,000,000 now is a less sum per head than was the debt of our Revolution when we came out of that struggle; and the money value in the country now bears even a greater proportion to what it was then than does the population., Surely each man has as strong a motive now to preserve our liberties as each had then to establish them., A right result at this time will be worth more to the world than ten times the men and ten times the money., The evidence reaching us from the country leaves no doubt that the material for the work is abundant, and that it needs only the hand of legislation to give it legal sanction, and the hand of the executive to give it practical shape and efficiency., One of the greatest perplexities of the government is to avoid receiving troops faster than it can provide for them., In a word, the people will save their government if the government itself will do its part only indifferently well., It might seem, at first thought, to be of little difference whether the present movement at the South be called ""secession"" or ""rebellion."", The movers, however, well understand the difference., ...]",3
265,"[On the side of the Union it is a struggle for maintaining in the world that form and substance of government whose leading object is to elevate the condition of men to lift artificial weights from all shoulders; to clear the paths of laudable pursuit for all; to afford all an unfettered start, and a fair chance in the race of life., Yielding to partial and temporary departures, from necessity; this is the leading object of the government for whose existence we contend., I am most happy to believe that the plain people understand and appreciate this., It is worthy of note that, while in this the government's hour of trial large numbers of those in the army and navy who have been favored with the offices have resigned and proved false to the hand which had pampered them, not one common soldier or common sailor is known to have deserted his flag., Great honor is due to those officers who remained true, despite the example of their treacherous associates; but the greatest honor, and most important fact of all, is the unanimous firmness of the common soldiers and common sailors., To the last man, so far as known, they have successfully resisted the traitorous efforts of those whose commands, but an hour before, they obeyed as absolute law., This is the patriotic instinct of the plain people., They understand, without an argument, that the destroying of the government which was made by Washington means no good to them., Our popular government has often been called an experiment., Two points in it our people have already settled--the successful establishing and the successful administering of it., One still remains--its successful maintenance against a formidable internal attempt to overthrow it., It is now for them to demonstrate to the world that those who can fairly carry an election can also suppress a rebellion; that ballots are the rightful and peaceful successors of bullets; and that when ballots have fairly and constitutionally decided, there can be no successful appeal back to bullets; that there can be no successful appeal, except to ballots themselves, at succeeding elections., Such will be a great lesson of peace: teaching men that what they cannot take by an election, neither can they take it by a war; teaching all the folly of being the beginners of a war., Lest there be some uneasiness in the minds of candid men as to what is to be the course of the government toward the Southern States after the rebellion shall have been suppressed, the executive deems it proper to say it will be his purpose then, as ever, to be guided by the Constitution and the laws; and that he probably will have no different understanding of the powers and duties of the Federal Government relatively to the rights of the States and the people, under the Constitution, than that expressed in the inaugural address., He desires to preserve the government, that it may be administered for all as it was administered by the men who made it., Loyal citizens everywhere have the right to claim this of their government, and the government has no right to withhold or neglect it., It is not perceived that in giving it there is any coercion, any conquest, or any subjugation, in any just sense of those terms., The Constitution provides, and all the States have accepted the provision, that ""the United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a republican form of government."", But if a State may lawfully go out of the Union, having done so it may also discard the republican form of government, so that to prevent its going out is an indispensable means to the end of maintaining the guarantee mentioned; and when an end is lawful and obligatory, the indispensable means to it are also lawful and obligatory., It was with the deepest regret that the executive found the duty of employing the war power in defense of the government forced upon him., He could but perform this duty or surrender the existence of the government., No compromise by public servants could, in this case, be a cure; not that compromises are not often proper, but that no popular government can long survive a marked precedent that those who carry an election can only save the government from immediate destruction by giving up the main point upon which the people gave the election., The people themselves, and not their servants, can safely reverse their own deliberate decisions., As a private citizen the executive could not have consented that these institutions shall perish; much less could he in betrayal of so vast and so sacred a trust as these free people had confided to him., He felt that he had no moral right to shrink, nor even to count the chances of his own life, in what might follow., In full view of his great responsibility he has, so far, done what he has deemed his duty., You will now, according to your own judgment, perform yours., He sincerely hopes that your views and your action may so accord with his as to assure all faithful citizens who have been disturbed in their rights of a certain and speedy restoration to them, under the Constitution and the laws., And having thus chosen our course, without guile and with pure purpose, let us renew our trust in God, and go forward without fear and with manly hearts., Please ask the Comr., of Indian Affairs, and of the Gen'l Land Office to come with you, and see me at once., I want the assistance of all of you in overhauling the list of appointments a little before I send them to the Senate., In answer to the resolution of the House of Representatives of the 9th instant, requesting a copy of correspondence upon the subject of the incorporation of the Dominican republic with the Spanish monarchy, I transmit a report from the Secretary of State; to whom the resolution was referred., I transmit to Congress a copy of correspondence between the Secretary of State and her Britannic Majesty's envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary accredited to this government, relative to the exhibition of the products of industry of all nations, which is to take place at London in the course of next year., As citizens of the United States may justly pride themselves upon their proficiency in industrial arts, it is desirable that they should have proper facilities toward taking part in the exhibition., With this view I recommend such legislation by Congress at this session as may be necessary for that purpose., As the United States have, in common with Great Britain and France, a deep interest in the preservation and development of the fisheries adjacent to the northeastern coast and islands of this continent, it seems proper that we should concert with the governments of those countries such measures as may be conducive to those important objects., With this view I transmit to Congress a copy of a correspondence between the Secretary of State and the British minister here, in which the latter proposes, on behalf of his government, the appointment of a joint commission to inquire into the matter, in order that such ulterior measures may be adopted as may be advisable for the objects proposed., Such legislation recommended as may be necessary to enable the executive to provide for a commissioner on behalf of the United States:  I have agreed, and do agree, that the two Indian regiments named within shall be accepted if the act of Congress shall admit it., Let there be no further question about it., 1., Let the plan for making the blockade effective be pushed forward with all possible despatch., 2., Let the volunteer forces at Fort Monroe and vicinity under General Butler be constantly drilled, disciplined, and instructed without more for the present., 3., Let Baltimore be held as now, with a gentle but firm and certain hand., 4., Let the force now under Patterson or Banks be strengthened and made secure in its position., 5., Let the forces in Western Virginia act till further orders according to instructions or orders from General McClellan., 6., [Let] General Fremont push forward his organization and operations in the West as rapidly as possible, giving rather special attention to Missouri., 7., Let the forces late before Manassas, except the three-months men, be reorganized as rapidly as possible in their camps here and about Arlington., 8., Let the three-months forces who decline to enter the longer service be discharged as rapidly as circumstances will permit., 9., Let the new volunteer forces be brought forward as fast as possible, and especially into the camps on the two sides of the river here., When the foregoing shall be substantially attended to:  1., Let Manassas Junction (or some point on one or other of the railroads near it) and Strasburg be seized, and permanently held, with an open line from Washington to Manassas, and an open line from Harper's Ferry to Strasburg the military men to find the way of doing these., 2., This done, a joint movement from Cairo on Memphis; and from Cincinnati on East Tennessee., Together with the regiments of three years' volunteers which the government already has in service in your State, enough to make eight in all, if tendered in a reasonable time, will be accepted, the new regiments to be taken, as far as convenient, from the three months' men and officers just discharged, and to be organized, equipped, and sent forward as fast as single regiments are ready, On the same terms as were those already in the service from that State., This order is entered in the War Department, and the Governor of New Jersey is authorized to furnish the regiments with wagons and horses., In answer to the resolution of the House of Representatives of the 22d instant; requesting a copy of the correspondence between this, government and foreign powers with reference to maritime right, I transmit a report from the Secretary of State., In answer to the resolution of the House of Representatives of the 15th instant, requesting a copy of the correspondence between this government and foreign powers on the subject of the existing insurrection in the United States, I transmit a report from the Secretary of State., The bearer, Mr. ------, wants ------ in the custom house at Baltimore., If his recommendations are satisfactory, and I recollect them to have been so, the fact that he is urged by the Methodists should be in his favor, as they complain of us some., In answer to the resolution of the House of Representatives of the 24th instant, asking the grounds, reasons, and evidence upon which the police Commissioners of Baltimore were arrested and are now detained as prisoners at Port McHenry, I have to state that it is judged to be incompatible with the public interest at this time to furnish the information called for by the resolution., In answer to the resolution of the Senate of the 19th instant requesting information concerning the quasi armistice alluded to in my message of the 4th instant, I transmit a report from the Secretary of the Navy., In answer to the resolution of the Senate of the 23d instant requesting information concerning the imprisonment of Lieutenant John J. Worden (John L. Worden) of the United States navy, I transmit a report from the Secretary of the Navy., The Marshals of the United States in the vicinity of forts where political prisoners are held will supply decent lodging and sustenance for such prisoners unless they shall prefer to provide in those respects for themselves, in which case they will be allowed to do so by the commanding officer in charge., Approved, and the Secretary of the State will transmit the order to the Marshals, to the Lieutenant-General, and the Secretary of the Interior., In answer to the resolution of the House of Representatives of yesterday, requesting information regarding the imprisonment of loyal citizens of the United States by the forces now in rebellion against this government, I transmit a report from the Secretary of State, and the copy of a telegraphic despatch by which it was accompanied., In answer to the resolution of your honorable body of date July 31, 1861, requesting the President to inform the Senate whether the Hon., James H. Lane, a member of that body from Kansas, has been appointed a brigadier-general in the army of the United States, and if so, whether he has accepted such appointment, I have the honor to transmit herewith certain papers, numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7, which, taken together, explain themselves, and which contain all the information I possess upon the questions propounded., It was my intention, as shown by my letter of June 20, 1861, to appoint Hon., James H. Lane, of Kansas, a brigadier-general of United States volunteers in anticipation of the act of Congress, since passed, for raising such volunteers; and I have no further knowledge upon the subject, except as derived from the papers herewith enclosed., The within paper, as you see, is by HON., John S. Phelps and HON., Frank P. Blair, Jr., both members of the present Congress from Missouri., The object is to get up an efficient force of Missourians in the southwestern part of the State., It ought to be done, and Mr. Phelps ought to have general superintendence of it., I see by a private report to me from the department that eighteen regiments are already accepted from Missouri., Can it not be arranged that part of them (not yet organized, as I understand) may be taken from the locality mentioned and put under the control of Mr. Phelps, and let him have discretion to accept them for a shorter term than three years--or the war--understanding, however, that he will get them for the full term if he can?, I hope this can be done, because Mr. Phelps is too zealous and efficient and understands his ground too well for us to lose his service., Of course provision for arming, equipping, etc., must be made., Mr. Phelps is here, and wishes to carry home with him authority for this matter., Whereas a joint committee of both houses of Congress has waited on the President of the United States and requested him to ""recommend a day of public humiliation, prayer, and fasting to be observed by the people of the United States with religious solemnities and the offering of fervent supplications to Almighty God for the safety and welfare of these States, His blessings on their arms, and a speedy restoration of peace""; and  Whereas it is fit and becoming in all people at all times to acknowledge and revere the supreme government of God, to bow in humble submission to His chastisements, to confess and deplore their sins and transgressions in the full conviction that the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, and to pray with all fervency and contrition for the pardon of their past offences and for a blessing upon their present and prospective action; and  Whereas when our own beloved country, once, by the blessing of God, united, prosperous, and happy, is now afflicted with faction and civil war, it is peculiarly fit for us to recognize the hand of God in this terrible visitation, and in sorrowful remembrance of our own faults and crimes as a nation and as individuals to humble ourselves before Him and to pray for His mercy-to pray that we may be spared further punishment, though most justly deserved, that our arms may be blessed and made effectual for the re-establishment of order, law, and peace throughout the wide extent of our country, and that the inestimable boon of civil and religious liberty, earned under His guidance and blessing by the labors and sufferings of our fathers, may be restored in all its original excellence., Therefore I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States, do appoint the last Thursday in September next as a day of humiliation, prayer, and fasting for all the people of the nation., And I do earnestly recommend to all the people, and especially to all ministers and teachers of religion of all denominations and to all heads of families, to observe and keep that day according to their several creeds and modes of worship in all humility and with all religious solemnity, to the end that the united prayer of the nation may ascend to the Throne of Grace and bring down plentiful blessings upon our country., You must make a job for the bearer of this--make a job of it with the collector and have it done., You can do it for me and you must., Start your four regiments to St. Louis at the earliest moment possible., Get such harness as may be necessary for your rifled gums., Do not delay a single regiment, but hasten everything forward as soon as any one regiment is ready., Have your three additional regiments organized at once., We shall endeavor to send you the arms this week., Been answering your messages since day before yesterday., Do you receive the answers?, ...]",3
266,"[Now as to policy., No doubt the thing was popular in some quarters, and would have been more so if it had been a general declaration of emancipation., The Kentucky Legislature would not budge till that proclamation was modified; and General Anderson telegraphed me that on the news of General Fremont having actually issued deeds of manumission, a whole company of our volunteers threw down their arms and disbanded., I was so assured as to think it probable that the very arms we had furnished Kentucky would be turned against us., I think to lose Kentucky is nearly the same as to lose the whole game., Kentucky gone, we cannot hold Missouri, nor, as I think, Maryland., These all against us, and the job on our hands is too large for us., We would as well consent to separation at once, including the surrender of this Capital., On the contrary, if you will give up your restlessness for new positions, and back me manfully on the grounds upon which you and other kind friends gave me the election and have approved in my public documents, we shall go through triumphantly., You must not understand I took my course on the proclamation because of Kentucky., I took the same ground in a private letter to General Fremont before I heard from Kentucky., You think I am inconsistent because I did not also forbid General Fremont to shoot men under the proclamation., I understand that part to be within military law, but I also think, and so privately wrote General Fremont, that it is impolitic in this, that our adversaries have the power, and will certainly exercise it, to shoot as many of our men as we shoot of theirs., I did not say this in the public letter, because it is a subject I prefer not to discuss in the hearing of our enemies., There has been no thought of removing General Fremont on any ground connected with his proclamation, and if there has been any wish for his removal on any ground, our mutual friend Sam., Glover can probably tell you what it was., I hope no real necessity for it exists on any ground., On or about the 5th of October (the exact date to be determined hereafter) I wish a movement made to seize and hold a point on the railroad connecting Virginia and Tennessee near the mountain-pass called Cumberland Gap., That point is now guarded against us by Zollicoffer, with 6000 or 8000 rebels at Barboursville Ky.,--say twenty-five miles from the Gap, toward Lexington., We have a force of 5000 or 6000 under General Thomas, at Camp Dick Robinson, about twenty-five miles from Lexington and seventy-five from Zollicoffer's camp, On the road between the two., There is not a railroad anywhere between Lexington and the point to be seized, and along the whole length of which the Union sentiment among the people largely predominates., We have military possession of the railroad from Cincinnati to Lexington, and from Louisville to Lexington, and some home guards, under General Crittenden, are on the latter line., We have possession of the railroad from Louisville to Nashville, Tenn., so far as Muldraugh's Hill, about forty miles, and the rebels have possession of that road all south of there., At the Hill we have a force of 8000, under General Sherman, and about an equal force of rebels is a very short distance south, under General Buckner., We have a large force at Paducah, and a smaller at Port Holt, both on the Kentucky side, with some at Bird's Point, Cairo, Mound City, Evansville, and New Albany, all on the other side, and all which, with the gunboats on the river, are perhaps sufficient to guard the Ohio from Louisville to its mouth., About supplies of troops, my general idea is that all from Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, and Kansas, not now elsewhere, be left to Fremont., All from Indiana and Michigan, not now elsewhere, be sent to Anderson at Louisville., All from Ohio needed in western Virginia be sent there, and any remainder be sent to Mitchell at Cincinnati, for Anderson., All east of the mountains be appropriated to McClellan and to the coast., As to movements, my idea is that the one for the coast and that on Cumberland Gap be simultaneous, and that in the meantime preparation, vigilant watching, and the defensive only be acted upon; this, however, not to apply to Fremont's operations in northern and middle Missouri., That before these movements Thomas and Sherman shall respectively watch but not attack Zollicoffer and Buckner., That when the coast and Gap movements shall be ready Sherman is merely to stand fast, while all at Cincinnati and all at Louisville, with all on the line, concentrate rapidly at Lexington, and thence to Thomas's camp, joining him, and the whole thence upon the Gap., It is for the military men to decide whether they can find a pass through the mountains at or near the Gap which cannot be defended by the enemy with a greatly inferior force, and what is to be done in regard to this., The coast and Gap movements made, Generals McClellan and Fremont, in their respective departments, will avail themselves of any advantages the diversions may present., [He was entirely unable to get this started, Sherman would have taken an active part if given him, the others were too busy getting lines of communication guarded--and discovering many ""critical"" supply items that had not been sent them., Also the commanding general did not like it., D.W.]  Please see Mr. Walker, well vouched as a Union man and son-in-law of Governor Morehead, and pleading for his release., I understand the Kentucky arrests were not made by special direction from here, and I am willing if you are that any of the parties may be released when James Guthrie and James Speed think they should be., I have received from Mr. Thayer, Consul-General of the United States at Alexandria, a full account of the liberal, enlightened, and energetic proceedings which, on his complaint, you have adopted in bringing to speedy and condign punishment the parties, subjects of your Highness in Upper Egypt, who were concerned in an act of criminal persecution against Faris, an agent of certain Christian missionaries in Upper Egypt., I pray your Highness to be assured that these proceedings, at once so prompt and so just, will be regarded as a new and unmistakable proof equally of your Highness's friendship for the United States and of the firmness, integrity and wisdom, with which the government of your Highness is conducted., Wishing you great prosperity and success, I am your friend,  The military line of the United States for the suppression of the insurrection may be extended so far as Bangor, in Maine., You and any officer acting under your authority are hereby authorized to suspend the writ of habeas corpus in any place between that place and the city of Washington., How is this?, I supposed I was appointing for register of wills a citizen of this District., Now the commission comes to me ""Moses Kelly, of New Hampshire."", I do not like this., The lady bearer of this says she has two sons who want to work., Set them at it if possible., Wanting to work is so rare a want that it should be encouraged., Your despatch of yesterday received and shown to General McClellan., I have promised him not to direct his army here without his consent., I do not think I shall come to Annapolis., Herewith is a document--half letter, half order--which, wishing you to see, but not to make public, I send unsealed., Please read it and then inclose it to the officer who may be in command of the Department of the West at the time it reaches him., I cannot now know whether Fremont or Hunter will then be in command., On receipt of this, with the accompanying inclosures, you will take safe, certain, and suitable measures to have the inclosure addressed to Major-General Fremont delivered to him with all reasonable despatch, subject to these conditions only: that if, when General Fremont shall be reached by the messenger--yourself or any one sent by you--he shall then have, in personal command, fought and won a battle, or shall then be actually in a battle, or shall then be in the immediate presence of the enemy in expectation of a battle, it is not to be delivered, but held for further orders., After, and not till after, the delivery to General Fremont, let the inclosure addressed to General Hunter be delivered to him., Major-General Fremont, of the United States Army, the present commander of the Western Department of the same, will, on the receipt of this order, call Major-General Hunter, of the United States Volunteers, to relieve him temporarily in that command, when he (Major-General Fremont) will report to general headquarters by letter for further orders., The command of the Department of the West having devolved upon you, I propose to offer you a few suggestions., Knowing how hazardous it is to bind down a distant commander in the field to specific lines and operations, as so much always depends on a knowledge of localities and passing events, it is intended, therefore, to leave a considerable margin for the exercise of your judgment and discretion., The main rebel army (Price's) west of the Mississippi is believed to have passed Dade County in full retreat upon northwestern Arkansas, leaving Missouri almost freed from the enemy, excepting in the southeast of the State., Assuming this basis of fact, it seems desirable, as you are not likely to overtake Price, and are in danger of making too long a line from your own base of supplies and reinforcements, that you should give up the pursuit, halt your main army, divide it into two corps of observation, one occupying Sedalia and the other Rolla, the present termini of railroads; then recruit the condition of both corps by re-establishing and improving their discipline and instructions, perfecting their clothing and equipments, and providing less uncomfortable quarters., Of course, both railroads must be guarded and kept open, judiciously employing just so much force as is necessary for this., From these two points, Sedalia and Rolla, and especially in judicious cooperation with Lane on the Kansas border, it would be so easy to concentrate and repel any army of the enemy returning on Missouri from the southwest, that it is not probable any such attempt will be made before or during the approaching cold weather., Before spring the people of Missouri will probably be in no favorable mood to renew for next year the troubles which have so much afflicted and impoverished them during this., If you adopt this line of policy, and if, as I anticipate, you will see no enemy in great force approaching, you will have a surplus of force which you can withdraw from these points and direct to others as may be needed, the railroads furnishing ready means of reinforcing these main points if occasion requires., Doubtless local uprisings will for a time continue to occur, but these can be met by detachments and local forces of our own, and will ere long tire out of themselves., While, as stated in the beginning of the letter, a large discretion must be and is left with yourself, I feel sure that an indefinite pursuit of Price or an attempt by this long and circuitous route to reach Memphis will be exhaustive beyond endurance, and will end in the loss of the whole force engaged in it., The following order from the President of the United States, announcing the retirement from active command of the honored veteran Lieutenant general Winfield Scott, will be read by the army with profound regret:  On the 1st day of November, A.D. 1861, upon his own application to the President of the United States, Brevet Lieutenant-General Winfield Scott is ordered to be placed, and hereby is placed, upon the list of retired officers of the army of the United States, without reduction in his current pay, subsistence, or allowances., The American people will hear with sadness and deep emotion that General Scott has withdrawn from the active control of the army, while the President and a unanimous Cabinet express their own and the nation's sympathy in his personal affliction and their profound sense of the important public services rendered by him to his country during his long and brilliant career, among which will ever be gratefully distinguished his faithful devotion to the Constitution, the Union, and the flag when assailed by parricidal rebellion., The President is pleased to direct that Major general George B. McClellan assume the command of the army of the United States., The headquarters of the army will be established in the city of Washington., All communications intended for the commanding general will hereafter be addressed direct to the adjutant-general., The duplicate returns, orders, and other papers heretofore sent to the assistant adjutant-general, headquarters of the army, will be discontinued., The Governor of the State of Missouri, acting under the direction of the convention of that State, proposes to the Government of the United States that he will raise a military force to serve within the State as State militia during the war there, to cooperate with the troops in the service of the United States in repelling the invasion of the State and suppressing rebellion therein; the said State militia to be embodied and to be held in the camp and in the field, drilled, disciplined, and governed according to the Army Regulations and subject to the Articles of War; the said State militia not to be ordered out of the State except for the immediate defense of the State of Missouri, but to co-operate with the troops in the service of the United States in military operations within the State or necessary to its defense, and when officers of the State militia act with officers in the service of the United States of the same grade the officers of the United States service shall command the combined force; the State militia to be armed, equipped, clothed, subsisted, transported, and paid by the United States during such time as they shall be actually engaged as an embodied military force in service in accordance with regulations of the United States Army or general orders as issued from time to time., In order that the Treasury of the United States may not be burdened with the pay of unnecessary officers, the governor proposes that, although the State law requires him to appoint upon the general staff an adjutant-general, a commissary-general, an inspector-general, a quartermaster-general, a paymaster-general, and a surgeon-general, each with the rank of colonel of cavalry, yet he proposes that the Government of the United States pay only the adjutant-general, the quartermaster-general, and inspector-general, their services being necessary in the relations which would exist between the State militia and the United States., The governor further proposes that while he is allowed by the State law to appoint aides-de-camp to the governor at his discretion, with the rank of colonel, three only shall be reported to the United States for payment., He also proposes that the State militia shall be commanded by a single major-general and by such number of brigadier-generals as shall allow one for a brigade of not less than four regiments, and that no greater number of staff officers shall be appointed for regimental, brigade, and division duties than as provided for in the act of Congress of the 22d July, 1861; and that, whatever be the rank of such officers as fixed by the law of the State, the compensation that they shall receive from the United States shall only be that which belongs to the rank given by said act of Congress to officers in the United States service performing the same duties., The field officers of a regiment in the State militia are one colonel, one lieutenant-colonel, and one major, and the company officers are a captain, a first lieutenant, and a second lieutenant., The governor proposes that, as the money to be disbursed is the money of the United States, such staff officers in the service of the United States as may be necessary to act as disbursing officers for the State militia shall be assigned by the War Department for that duty; or, if such cannot be spared from their present duty, he will appoint such persons disbursing officers for the State militia as the President of the United States may designate., Such regulations as may be required, in the judgment of the President, to insure regularity of returns and to protect the United States from any fraudulent practices shall be observed and obeyed by all in office in the State militia., The above propositions are accepted on the part of the United States, and the Secretary of War is directed to make the necessary orders upon the Ordnance, Quartermaster's, Commissary, Pay, and Medical departments to carry this agreement into effect., He will cause the necessary staff officers in the United States service to be detailed for duty in connection with the Missouri State militia, and will order them to make the necessary provision in their respective offices for fulfilling this agreement., All requisitions upon the different officers of the United States under this agreement to be made in substance in the same mode for the Missouri State militia as similar requisitions are made for troops in the service of the United States; and the Secretary of War will cause any additional regulations that may be necessary to insure regularity and economy in carrying this agreement into effect to be adopted and communicated to the Governor of Missouri for the government of the Missouri State militia., This plan approved, with the modification that the governor stipulates that when he commissions a major-general of militia it shall be the same person at the time in command of the United States Department of the West; and in case the United States shall change such commander of the department, he (the governor) will revoke the State commission given to the person relieved and give one to the person substituted to the United States command of said department., I receive with great pleasure a Minister from Sweden., That pleasure is enhanced by the information which preceded your arrival here, that his Majesty, your sovereign, had selected you to fill the mission upon the grounds of your derivation from an ancestral stock identified with the most glorious era of your country's noble history, and your own eminent social and political standing in Sweden., This country, sir, maintains, and means to maintain, the rights of human nature, and the capacity of men for self-government., The history of Sweden proves that this is the faith of the people of Sweden, and we know that it is the faith and practice of their respected sovereign., Rest assured, therefore, that we shall be found always just and paternal in our transactions with your government, and that nothing will be omitted on my part to make your residence in this capital agreeable to yourself and satisfactory to your government., No written authority is found here to declare and enforce martial law in this department., Please send me such written authority and telegraph me that it has been sent by mail., If General McClellan and General Halleck deem it necessary to declare and maintain martial law in Saint Louis, the same is hereby authorized., I have thought over the interview which Mr. Gilmore has had with Mr. Greeley, and the proposal that Greeley has made to Gilmore, namely, that he [Gilmore] shall communicate to him [Greeley] all that he learns from you of the inner workings of the administration, in return for his [Greeley's] giving such aid as he can to the new magazine, and allowing you [Walker] from time to time the use of his [Greeley's] columns when it is desirable to feel of, or forestall, public opinion on important subjects., The arrangement meets my unqualified approval, and I shall further it to the extent of my ability, by opening to you--as I do now--fully the policy of the Government,--its present views and future intentions when formed, giving you permission to communicate them to Gilmore for Greeley; and in case you go to Europe I will give these things direct to Gilmore., But all this must be on the express and explicit understanding that the fact of these communications coming from me shall be absolutely confidential,--not to be disclosed by Greeley to his nearest friend, or any of his subordinates., He will be, in effect, my mouthpiece, but I must not be known to be the speaker., I need not tell you that I have the highest confidence in Mr. Greeley., He is a great power., Having him firmly behind me will be as helpful to me as an army of one hundred thousand men., ...]",3
267,"[If useful, no State should be denied them; if not useful, no State should have them., Let them be provided for all or abolished as to all., Three modifications occur to me, either of which, I think, would be an improvement upon our present system., Let the Supreme Court be of convenient number in every event; then, first, let the whole country be divided into circuits of convenient size, the Supreme judges to serve in a number of them corresponding to their own number, and independent circuit judges be provided for all the rest; or, secondly, let the Supreme judges be relieved from circuit duties and circuit judges provided for all the circuits; or, thirdly, dispense with circuit courts altogether, leaving the judicial functions wholly to the district courts and an independent Supreme Court., I respectfully recommend to the consideration of Congress the present condition of the statute laws, with the hope that Congress will be able to find an easy remedy for many of the inconveniences and evils which constantly embarrass those engaged in the practical administration of them., Since the Organization of the government, Congress has enacted some 5000 acts and joint resolutions, which fill more than 6000 closely printed pages and are scattered through many volumes., Many of these acts have been drawn in haste and without sufficient caution, so that their provisions are often obscure in themselves or in conflict with each other, or at least so doubtful as to render it very difficult for even the best-informed persons to ascertain precisely what the statute law really is., It seems to me very important that the statute laws should be made as plain and intelligible as possible, and be reduced to as small a compass as may consist with the fullness and precision of the will of the Legislature and the perspicuity of its language., This well done would, I think, greatly facilitate the labors of those whose duty it is to assist in the administration of the laws, and would be a lasting benefit to the people, by placing before them in a more accessible and intelligible form the laws which so deeply concern their interests and their duties., I am informed by some whose opinions I respect that all the acts of Congress now in force and of a permanent and general nature might be revised and rewritten so as to be embraced in one volume (or at most two volumes) of ordinary and convenient size; and I respectfully recommend to Congress to consider of the subject, and if my suggestion be approved to devise such plan as to their wisdom shall seem most proper for the attainment of the end proposed., One of the unavoidable consequences of the present insurrection is the entire suppression in many places of all the ordinary means of administering civil justice by the officers and in the forms of existing law., This is the case, in whole or in part, in all the insurgent States; and as our armies advance upon and take possession of parts of those States the practical evil becomes more apparent., There are no courts or officers to whom the citizens of other States may apply for the enforcement of their lawful claims against citizens of the insurgent States, and there is a vast amount of debt constituting such claims., Some have estimated it as high as $200,000,000, due in large part from insurgents in open rebellion to loyal citizens who are even now making great sacrifices in the discharge of their patriotic duty to support the government., Under these circumstances I have been urgently solicited to establish, by military power, courts to administer summary justice in such cases., I have thus far declined to do it, not because I had any doubt that the end proposed--the collection of the debts--was just and right in itself, but because I have been unwilling to go beyond the pressure of necessity in the unusual exercise of power., But the powers of Congress, I suppose, are equal to the anomalous occasion, and therefore I refer the whole matter to Congress, with the hope that a plan maybe devised for the administration of justice in all such parts of the insurgent States and Territories as may be under the control of this government, whether by a voluntary return to allegiance and order or by the power of our arms; this, however, not to be a permanent institution, but a temporary substitute, and to cease as soon as the ordinary courts can be reestablished in peace., It is important that some more convenient means should be provided, if possible, for the adjustment of claims against the government, especially in view of their increased number by reason of the war., It is as much the duty of government to render prompt justice against itself in favor of citizens as it is to administer the same between private individuals., The investigation and adjudication of claims in their nature belong to the judicial department., Besides, it is apparent that the attention of Congress will be more than usually engaged for some time to come with great national questions., It was intended by the organization of the Court of Claims mainly to remove this branch of business from the halls of Congress; but, while the court has proved to be an effective and valuable means of investigation, it in great degree fails to effect the object of its creation for want of power to make its judgments final., Fully aware of the delicacy, not to say the danger of the subject, I commend to your careful consideration whether this power of making judgments final may not properly be given to the court, reserving the right of appeal on questions of law to the Supreme Court, with such other provisions as experience may have shown to be necessary., I ask attention to the report of the Postmaster general, the following being a summary statement of the condition of the department:  The revenue from all sources during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1861, including the annual permanent appropriation of $700,000 for the transportation of ""free mail matter,"" was $9,049,296.40, being about 2 per cent., less than the revenue for 1860., The expenditures were $13,606,759.11, showing a decrease of more than 8 per cent., as compared with those of the previous year and leaving an excess of expenditure over the revenue for the last fiscal year of $4,557,462.71., The gross revenue for the year ending June 30, 1863, is estimated at an increase of 4 per cent., on that of 1861, making $8,683,000, to which should be added the earnings of the department in carrying free matter, viz., $700,000, making $9,383,000., The total expenditures for 1863 are estimated at $12,528,000, leaving an estimated deficiency of $3,145,000 to be supplied from the treasury in addition to the permanent appropriation., The present insurrection shows, I think, that the extension of this District across the Potomac River at the time of establishing the capital here was eminently wise, and consequently that the relinquishment of that portion of it which lies within the State of Virginia was unwise and dangerous., I submit for your consideration the expediency of regaining that part of the District and the restoration of the original boundaries thereof through negotiations with the State of Virginia., The report of the Secretary of the Interior, with the accompanying documents, exhibits the condition of the several branches of the public business pertaining to that department., The depressing influences of the insurrection have been specially felt in the operations of the Patent and General Land Offices., The cash receipts from the sales of public lands during the past year have exceeded the expenses of our land system only about $200,000., The sales have been entirely suspended in the Southern States, while the interruptions to the business of the country and the diversion of large numbers of men from labor to military service have obstructed settlements in the new States and Territories of the Northwest., The receipts of the Patent Office have declined in nine months about $100,000.00 rendering a large reduction of the force employed necessary to make it self-sustaining., The demands upon the Pension Office will be largely increased by the insurrection., Numerous applications for pensions, based upon the casualties of the existing war, have already been made., There is reason to believe that many who are now upon the pension rolls and in receipt of the bounty of the government are in the ranks of the insurgent army or giving them aid and comfort., The Secretary of the Interior has directed a suspension of the payment of the pensions of such persons upon proof of their disloyalty., I recommend that Congress authorize that officer to cause the names of such persons to be stricken from the pension rolls., The relations of the government with the Indian tribes have been greatly disturbed by the insurrection, especially in the southern superintendency and in that of New Mexico., The Indian country south of Kansas is in the possession of insurgents from Texas and Arkansas., The agents of the United States appointed since the 4th of March for this superintendency have been unable to reach their posts, while the most of those who were in office before that time have espoused the insurrectionary cause, and assume to exercise the powers of agents by virtue of commissions from the insurrectionists., It has been stated in the public press that a portion of those Indians have been organized as a military force and are attached to the army of the insurgents., Although the government has no official information upon this subject, letters have been written to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs by several prominent chiefs giving assurance of their loyalty to the United States and expressing a wish for the presence of Federal troops to protect them., It is believed that upon the repossession of the country by the Federal forces the Indians will readily cease all hostile demonstrations and resume their former relations to the government., Agriculture, confessedly the largest interest of the nation, has not a department nor a bureau, but a clerkship only, assigned to it in the government., While it is fortunate that this great interest is so independent in its nature as not to have demanded and extorted more from the government, I respectfully ask Congress to consider whether something more cannot be given voluntarily with general advantage., Annual reports exhibiting the condition of our agriculture, commerce, and manufactures would present a fund of information of great practical value to the country., While I make no suggestion as to details, I venture the opinion that an agricultural and statistical bureau might profitably be organized., The execution of the laws for the suppression of the African slave trade has been confided to the Department of the Interior., It is a subject of gratulation that the efforts which have been made for the suppression of this inhuman traffic have been recently attended with unusual success., Five vessels being fitted out for the slave trade have been seized and condemned., Two mates of vessels engaged in the trade and one person in equipping a vessel as a slaver have been convicted and subjected to the penalty of fine and imprisonment, and one captain, taken with a cargo of Africans on board his vessel, has been convicted of the highest grade of offense under our laws, the punishment of which is death., The Territories of Colorado, Dakota, and Nevada, created by the last Congress, have been organized, and civil administration has been inaugurated therein under auspices especially gratifying when it is considered that the leaven of treason was found existing in some of these new countries when the Federal officers arrived there., The abundant natural resources of these Territories, with the security and protection afforded by organized government, will doubtless invite to them a large immigration when peace shall restore the business of the country to its accustomed channels., I submit the resolutions of the Legislature of Colorado, which evidence the patriotic spirit of the people of the Territory., So far the authority of the United States has been upheld in all the Territories, as it is hoped it will be in the future., I commend their interests and defense to the enlightened and generous care of Congress., I recommend to the favorable consideration of Congress the interests of the District of Columbia., The insurrection has been the cause of much suffering and sacrifice to its inhabitants, and as they have no representative in Congress that body should not overlook their just claims upon the government., At your late session a joint resolution was adopted authorizing the President to take measures for facilitating a proper representation of the industrial interests of the United States at the exhibition of the industry of all nations to be holden at London in the year 1862., I regret to say I have been unable to give personal attention to this subject--a subject at once so interesting in itself and so extensively and intimately connected with the material prosperity of the world., Through the Secretaries of State and of the Interior a plan or system has been devised and partly matured, and which will be laid before you., Under and by virtue of the act of Congress entitled ""An act to confiscate property used for insurrectionary purposes,"" approved August 6, 1861, the legal claims of certain persons to the labor and service of certain other persons have become forfeited, and numbers of the latter thus liberated are already dependent on the United States, and must be provided for in some way., Besides this, it is not impossible that some of the States will pass similar enactments for their own benefit respectively, and by operation of which persons of the same class will be thrown upon them for disposal., In such case I recommend that Congress provide for accepting such persons from such States, according to some mode of valuation, in lieu, pro tanto, of direct taxes, or upon some other plan to be agreed on with such States respectively; that such persons, on such acceptance by the General Government, be at once deemed free, and that in any event steps be taken for colonizing both classes (or the one first mentioned if the other shall not be brought into existence) at some place or places in a climate congenial to them., It might be well to consider, too, whether the free colored people already in the United States could not, so far as individuals may desire, be included in such colonization., To carry out the plan of colonization may involve the acquiring of territory, and also the appropriation of money beyond that to be expended in the territorial acquisition., Having practised the acquisition of territory for nearly sixty years, the question of constitutional power to do so is no longer an open one with us., The power was questioned at first by Mr. Jefferson, who, however, in the purchase of Louisiana, yielded his scruples on the plea of great expediency., If it be said that the only legitimate object of acquiring territory is to furnish homes for white men, this measure effects that object, for emigration of colored men leaves additional room for white men remaining or coming here., Mr. Jefferson, however, placed the importance of procuring Louisiana more on political and commercial grounds than on providing room for population., On this whole proposition, including the appropriation of money with the acquisition of territory, does not the expediency amount to absolute necessity--that without which the government itself cannot be perpetuated?, The war continues., In considering the policy to be adopted for suppressing the insurrection I have been anxious and careful that the inevitable conflict for this purpose shall not degenerate into a violent and remorseless revolutionary struggle., I have therefore in every case thought it proper to keep the integrity of the Union prominent as the primary object of the contest on our part, leaving all questions which are not of vital military importance to the more deliberate action of the Legislature., In the exercise of my best discretion I have adhered to the blockade of the ports held by the insurgents, instead of putting in force by proclamation the law of Congress enacted at the late session for closing those ports., So also, obeying the dictates of prudence, as well as the obligations of law, instead of transcending I have adhered to the act of Congress to confiscate property used for insurrectionary purposes., If a new law upon the same subject shall be proposed, its propriety will be duly considered., The Union must be preserved, and hence all indispensable means must be employed., We should not be in haste to determine that radical and extreme measures, which may reach the loyal as well as the disloyal, are indispensable., The inaugural address at the beginning of the Administration and the message to Congress at the late special session were both mainly devoted to topics domestic controversy out of which the insurrection and consequent war have sprung., Nothing now occurs to add or subtract to or from the principles or general purposes stated and expressed in those documents., The last ray of hope for preserving the Union peaceably expired at the assault upon Fort Sumter, and a general review of what has occurred since may not be unprofitable., What was painfully uncertain then is much better defined and more distinct now, and the progress of events is plainly in the right direction., The insurgents confidently claimed a strong support from north of Mason and Dixon's line, and the friends of the Union were not free from apprehension on the point., This, however, was soon settled definitely, and on the right side., South of the line noble little Delaware led off right from the first., Maryland was made to seem against the Union., Our soldiers were assaulted, bridges were burned, and railroads torn up within her limits, and we were many days at one time without the ability to bring a single regiment over her soil to the capital., Now her bridges and railroads are repaired and open to the government; she already gives seven regiments to the cause of the Union, and none to the enemy; and her people, at a regular election, have sustained the Union by a larger majority and a larger aggregate vote than they ever before gave to any candidate or any question., Kentucky, too, for some time in doubt, is now decidedly and, I think, unchangeably ranged on the side of the Union., Missouri is comparatively quiet, and, I believe, can, not again be overrun by the insurrectionists., These three States of Maryland, Kentucky, and Missouri, neither of which would promise a single soldier at first, have now an aggregate of not less than forty thousand in the field for the Union, while of their citizens certainly not more than a third of that number, and they of doubtful whereabouts and doubtful existence, are in arms against us., After a somewhat bloody struggle of months, winter closes on the Union people of western Virginia, leaving them masters of their own country., An insurgent force of about fifteen hundred, for months dominating the narrow peninsular region constituting the counties of Accomac and Northampton, and known as Eastern Shore of Virginia, together with some contiguous parts of Maryland, have laid down their arms, and the people there have renewed their allegiance to and accepted the protection of the old flag., This leaves no armed insurrectionist north of the Potomac or east of the Chesapeake., ...]",3
268,"[Please do not lose time in this matter., In view of the recent declaration of the people of Maryland of their adhesion to the Union, so distinctly made in their recent election, the President directs that all the prisoners who having heretofore been arrested in that State are now detained in military custody by the President's authority, be released from their imprisonment on the following conditions, namely: that if they were holding any civil or military offices when arrested, the terms of which have expired, they shall not resume or reclaim such office; and secondly, all persons availing themselves of this proclamation shall engage by oath or parole of honor to maintain the Union and the Constitution of the United States, and in no way to aid or abet by arms, counsel, conversation, or information of any kind the existing insurrection against the Government of the United States., To guard against misapprehension it is proper to state that this proclamation does not apply to prisoners of war., I transmit to Congress a copy of a letter to the Secretary of State from James R. Partridge, secretary to the executive committee to the in exhibition to be held in London in the course present year, and a copy of the correspond which it refers, relative to a vessel for the of taking such articles as persons in this country may wish to exhibit on that occasion., As it appears no naval vessel can be spared for the purpose, I recommend that authority be given to charter a suitable merchant vessel, in order that facilities similar to those afforded by the government exhibition of 1851 may also be extended to citizens of the United States who may desire to contribute to the exhibition of this year., Have arms gone forward for East Tennessee?, Please tell me the progress and condition of the movement in that direction., Answer., Your despatch of yesterday has been received, and it disappoints and distresses me., I have shown it to General McClellan, who says he will write you to-day., I am not competent to criticize your views, and therefore what I offer is in justification of myself., Of the two, I would rather have a point on the railroad south of Cumberland Gap than Nashville., First, because it cuts a great artery of the enemy's communication, which Nashville does not; and secondly, because it is in the midst of loyal people who would rally around it, while Nashville is not., Again, I cannot see why the movement on East Tennessee would not be a diversion in your favor rather than a disadvantage, assuming that a movement toward Nashville is the main object., But my distress is that our friends in East Tennessee are being hanged and driven to despair, and even now, I fear, are thinking of taking rebel arms for the sake of personal protection., In this we lose the most valuable stake we have in the South., My despatch, to which yours is an answer, was sent with the knowledge of Senator Johnson and Representative Maynard of East Tennessee, and they will be upon me to know the answer, which I cannot safely show them., They would despair, possibly resign to go and save their families somehow, or die with them., I do not intend this to be an order in any sense, but merely, as intimated before, to show you the grounds of my anxiety., Please name as early a day as you safely can on or before which you can be ready to move southward in concert with Major-General Halleck., Delay is ruining us, and it is indispensable for me to have something definite., I send a like despatch to Major-General Halleck., I transmit to Congress a translation of an instruction to the minister of his Majesty the Emperor of Austria accredited to this government, and a copy of a note to that minister from the Secretary of State relative to the questions involved in the taking from the British steamer Trent of certain citizens of the United States by order of Captain Wilkes of the United States Navy., This correspondence may be considered as a sequel to that previously communicated to Congress relating to the same subject., In reply to your Excellency's letter of the 1st instant, I have to state that on receiving your telegram I immediately communicated with General Buell and have since sent him all the information I could obtain of the enemy's movements about Columbus and Camp Beauregard., No considerable force has been sent from those places to Bowling Green., They have about 22,000 men at Columbus, and the place is strongly fortified., I have at Cairo, Port Holt, and Paducah only about 15,000, which, after leaving guards at these places, would give me but little over 10,000 men with which to assist General Buell., It would be madness to attempt anything serious with such a force, and I cannot at the present time withdraw any from Missouri without risking the loss of this State., The troops recently raised in other States of this department have, without my knowledge, been sent to Kentucky and Kansas., I am satisfied that the authorities at Washington do not appreciate the difficulties with which we have to contend here., The operations of Lane, Jennison, and others have so enraged the people of Missouri that it is estimated that there is a majority of 80,000 against the government., We are virtually in an enemy's country., Price and others have a considerable army in the southwest, against which I am operating with all my available force., This city and most of the middle and northern counties are insurrectionary,--burning bridges, destroying telegraph lines, etc.,--and can be kept down only by the presence of troops., A large portion of the foreign troops organized by General Fremont are unreliable; indeed, many of them are already mutinous., They have been tampered with by politicians, and made to believe that if they get up a mutiny and demand Fremont's return the government will be forced to restore him to duty here., It is believed that some high officers are in the plot I have already been obliged to disarm several of these organizations, and I am daily expecting more serious outbreaks., Another grave difficulty is the want of proper general officers to command the troops and enforce order and discipline, and especially to protect public property from robbery and plunder., Some of the brigadier-generals assigned to this department are entirely ignorant of their duties and unfit for any command., I assure you, Mr. President, it is very difficult to accomplish much with such means., I am in the condition of a carpenter who is required to build a bridge with a dull axe, a broken saw, and rotten timber., It is true that I have some very good green timber, which will answer the purpose as soon as I can get it into shape and season it a little., I know nothing of General Buell's intended operations, never having received any information in regard to the general plan of campaign., If it be intended that his column shall move on Bowling Green while another moves from Cairo or Paducah on Columbus or Camp Beauregard, it will be a repetition of the same strategic error which produced the disaster of Bull Run., To operate on exterior lines against an enemy occupying a central position will fail, as it always has failed, in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred., It is condemned by every military authority I have ever read., General Buell's army and the forces at Paducah occupy precisely the same position in relation to each other and to the enemy as did the armies of McDowell and Patterson before the battle of Bull Run., I will be greatly obliged if you will arrange; somehow with General Butler to officer his two un-officered regiments., Your despatch of yesterday is received, in which you say, ""I received your letter and General McClellan's, and will at once devote my efforts to your views and his."", In the midst of my many cares I have not seen, nor asked to see, General McClellan's letter to you., For my own views, I have not offered and do not now offer them as orders; and while I am glad to have them respectfully considered, I would blame you to follow them contrary to your own clear judgment, unless I should put them in the form of orders., As to General McClellan's views, you understand your duty in regard to them better than I do., With this preliminary I state my general idea of this war to be, that we have the greater numbers and the enemy has the greater facility of concentrating forces upon points of collision; that we must fail unless we can find some way of making our advantage an overmatch for his; and that this can only be done by menacing him with superior forces at different points at the same time, so that we can safely attack one or both if he makes no change; and if he weakens one to strengthen the other, forbear to attack the strengthened one, but seize and hold the weakened one, gaining so much., To illustrate: Suppose last summer, when Winchester ran away to reinforce Manassas, we had forborne to attack Manassas, but had seized and held Winchester., I mention this to illustrate and not to criticise., I did not lose confidence in McDowell, and I think less harshly of Patterson than some others seem to...., Applying the principle to your case, my idea is that Halleck shall menace Columbus and ""down river"" generally, while you menace Bowling Green and East Tennessee., If the enemy shall concentrate at Bowling Green, do not retire from his front, yet do not fight him there either, but seize Columbus and East Tennessee, one or both, left exposed by the concentration at Bowling Green., It is a matter of no small anxiety to me, and which I am sure you will not overlook, that the East Tennessee line is so long and over so bad a road., Having to-day written General Buell a letter, it occurs to me to send General Halleck a copy of it., The Germans are true and patriotic and so far as they have got cross in Missouri it is upon mistake and misunderstanding., Without a knowledge of its contents, Governor Koerner, of Illinois, will hand you this letter., He is an educated and talented German gentleman, as true a man as lives., With his assistance you can set everything right with the Germans.... My clear judgment is that, with reference to the German element in your command, you should have Governor Koerner with you; and if agreeable to you and him, I will make him a brigadier-general, so that he can afford to give his time., He does not wish to command in the field, though he has more military knowledge than some who do., If he goes into the place, he will simply be an efficient, zealous, and unselfish assistant to you., I say all this upon intimate personal acquaintance with Governor Koerner., I transmit to Congress a translation of an instruction to the minister of his Majesty the King of Prussia accredited to this government, and a copy of a note to that minister from the Secretary of State relating to the capture and detention of certain citizens of the United States, passengers on board the British steamer Trent, by order of Captain Wilkes of the United States Navy., You or any officer you may designate will in your discretion suspend the writ of habeas corpus so far as may relate to Major Chase, lately of the Engineer Corps of the Army of the United States, now alleged to be guilty of treasonable practices against this government., Ordered, That the 22d day of February, 1862, be the day for a general movement of the land and the naval forces of the United States against the insurgent forces., That especially the army at and about Fortress Monroe, the Army of the Potomac, the Army of Western Virginia, the army near Munfordville, Kentucky, the army and flotilla at Cairo, and a naval force in the Gulf of Mexico, be ready for a movement on that day., That all other forces, both land and naval, with their respective commanders, obey existing orders for the time, and be ready to obey additional orders when duly given., That the heads of departments, and especially the Secretaries of War and of the Navy, with all their subordinates, and the General-in-chief, with all other commanders and subordinates of land and naval forces, will severally be held to their strict and full responsibilities for the prompt execution of this order., It is my wish that the expedition commonly called the ""Lane Expedition"" shall be, as much as has been promised at the adjutant-general's office, under the supervision of General McClellan, and not any more., I have not intended, and do not now intend, that it shall be a great, exhausting affair, but a snug, sober column of 10,000 or 15,000., General Lane has been told by me many times that he is under the command of General Hunter, and assented to it as often as told., It was the distinct agreement between him and me, when I appointed him, that he was to be under Hunter., Ordered, That all the disposable force of the Army of the Potomac, after providing safely for the defence of Washington, be formed into an expedition for the immediate object of seizing and occupying a point upon the railroad southwestward of what is known as Manassas Junction, all details to be in the discretion of the commander-in-chief, and the expedition to move before or on the 22d day of February next., You and I have distinct and different plans for a movement of the Army of the Potomac--yours to be down the Chesapeake, up the Rappahannock to Urbana, and across land to the terminus of the railroad on the York River; mine to move directly to a point on the railroad southwest of Manassas., If you will give me satisfactory answers to the following questions, I shall gladly yield my plan to yours., First., Does not your plan involve a greatly larger expenditure of time and money than mine?, Second., Wherein is a victory more certain by your plan than mine?, Third., Wherein is a victory more valuable by your plan than mine?, Fourth., In fact, would it not be less valuable in this, that it would break no great line of the enemy's communications, while mine would?, Fifth., In case of disaster, would not a retreat be more difficult by your plan than mine?, First., Suppose the enemy should attack us in force before we reach the Occoquan, what?, Second., Suppose the enemy in force shall dispute the crossing of the Occoquan, what?, In view of this, might it not be safest for us to cross the Occoquan at Coichester, rather than at the village of Occoquan?, This would cost the enemy two miles of travel to meet us, but would, on the contrary, leave us two miles farther from our ultimate destination., Third., Suppose we reach Maple Valley without an attack, will we not be attacked there in force by the enemy marching by the several roads from Manassas; and if so, what?, Yours of January 30th just received., ...]",3
269,"[In the annual message last December, I thought fit to say, ""The Union must be preserved, and hence all indispensable means must be employed."", I said this not hastily, but deliberately., War has been made and continues to be an indispensable means to this end., A practical reacknowledgment of the national authority would render the war unnecessary, and it would at once cease., If, however, resistance continues, the war must also continue; and it is impossible to foresee all the incidents which may attend and all the ruin which may follow it., Such as may seem indispensable or may obviously promise great efficiency toward ending the struggle must and will come., The proposition now made (though an offer only), I hope it may be esteemed no offense to ask whether the pecuniary consideration tendered would not be of more value to the States and private persons concerned than are the institution and property in it in the present aspect of affairs., While it is true that the adoption of the proposed resolution would be merely initiatory, and not within itself a practical measure, it is recommended in the hope that it would soon lead to important practical results., In full view of my great responsibility to my God and to my country, I earnestly beg the attention of Congress and the people to the subject., The government at my special request a few months since contracted for fourteen batteries of the James rifled gun, 6-pounder calibre, and a limited quantity of the James projectiles, weighing about fourteen pounds each., The reports showing the superiority of this gun and projectile, both as regards range, accuracy, and execution, for field service over that of all others at the battle of Fort Donelson, leads me to request that there be furnished to the State of Illinois in the shortest time practicable seven batteries of 12-pounder calibre James rifled guns, with carriages, harness, implements, etc., complete and ready for field service, together with the following fixed ammunition to each gun, viz., 225 shells, 225 canister, and 50 solid projectiles, weighing about 24 pounds each, and also 200 shells, 100 canister, and 100 solid projectiles for each of the guns of the fourteen batteries named above, weighing about 14 pounds each, all to be of the James model., The within is from the Governor of Illinois., I understand the seven additional batteries now sought are to be 6-gun batteries, and the object is to mix them with the fourteen batteries they already have so as to make each battery consist of four 6-pounders and two 12-pounders., I shall be very glad to have the requisition filled if it can be without detriment to the service., Ordered: 1., That the major-general commanding the Army of the Potomac proceed forthwith to organize that part of the said army destined to enter upon active operations (including the reserve, but excluding the troops to be left in the fortifications about Washington) into four army corps, to be commanded according to seniority of rank, as follows:  First Corps to consist of four divisions, and to be commanded by Major-General I. McDowell., Second Corps to consist of three divisions, and to be commanded by Brigadier-General E. V. Sumner., Third Corps to consist of three divisions, and to be commanded by Brigadier-General S. P. Heintzelman., Fourth Corps to consist of three divisions, and to be commanded by Brigadier-General E. D. Keyes., 2., That the divisions now commanded by the officers above assigned to the commands of army corps shall be embraced in and form part of their respective corps., 3., The forces left for the defense of Washington will be placed in command of Brigadier-General James S. Wadsworth, who shall also be military governor of the District of Columbia., 4., That this order be executed with such promptness and dispatch as not to delay the commencement of the operations already directed to be underwritten by the Army of the Potomac., 5., A fifth army corps, to be commanded by Major general N. P. Banks, will be formed from his own and General Shields's (late General Lander's) divisions., Ordered: That no change of the base of operations of the Army of the Potomac shall be made without leaving in and about Washington such a force as in the opinion of the general-in-chief and the commanders of all the army corps shall leave said city entirely secure., That no more than two army corps (about 50,000 troops) of said Army of the Potomac shall be moved en route for a new base of operations until the navigation of the Potomac from Washington to the Chesapeake Bay shall be freed from enemy's batteries and other obstructions, or until the President shall hereafter give express permission., That any movements as aforesaid en route for a new base of operations which may be ordered by the general-in-chief, and which may be intended to move upon the Chesapeake Bay, shall begin to move upon the bay as early as the 18th day of March instant, and the general-in-chief shall be responsible that it so move as early as that day., Ordered, That the army and navy co-operate in an immediate effort to capture the enemy's batteries upon the Potomac between Washington and the Chesapeake Bay., Yesterday, on my return from church, I found Mr. Postmaster-General Blair in my room, writing the above note, which he immediately suspended, and verbally communicated the President's invitation, and stated that the President's purpose was to have some conversation with the delegations of Kentucky, Missouri, Maryland, Virginia, and Delaware, in explanation of his message of the 6th instant., This morning these delegations, or such of them as were in town, assembled at the White House at the appointed time, and after some little delay were admitted to an audience., Mr. Leary and myself were the only members from Maryland present, and, I think, were the only members of the delegation at that time in the city., I know that Mr. Pearoe, of the Senate, and Messrs. Webster and Calvert, of the House, were absent., After the usual salutations, and we were seated, the President said, in substance, that he had invited us to meet him to have some conversation with us in explanation of his message of the 6th; that since he had sent it in several of the gentlemen then present had visited him, but had avoided any allusion to the message, and he therefore inferred that the import of the message had been misunderstood, and was regarded as inimical to the interests we represented; and he had resolved he would talk with us, and disabuse our minds of that erroneous opinion., The President then disclaimed any intent to injure the interests or wound the sensibilities of the slave States., On the contrary, his purpose was to protect the one and respect the other; that we were engaged in a terrible, wasting, and tedious war; immense armies were in the field, and must continue in the field as long as the war lasts; that these armies must, of necessity, be brought into contact with slaves in the States we represented and in other States as they advanced; that slaves would come to the camps, and continual irritation was kept up; that he was constantly annoyed by conflicting and antagonistic complaints: on the one side a certain class complained if the slave was not protected by the army; persons were frequently found who, participating in these views, acted in a way unfriendly to the slaveholder; on the other hand, slaveholders complained that their rights were interfered with, their slaves induced to abscond and protected within the lines; these complaints were numerous, loud and deep; were a serious annoyance to him and embarrassing to the progress of the war; that it kept alive a spirit hostile to the government in the States we represented; strengthened the hopes of the Confederates that at some day the border States would unite with them, and thus tend to prolong the war; and he was of opinion, if this resolution should be adopted by Congress and accepted by our States, these causes of irritation and these hopes would be removed, and more would be accomplished toward shortening the war than could be hoped from the greatest victory achieved by Union armies; that he made this proposition in good faith, and desired it to be accepted, if at all, voluntarily, and in the same patriotic spirit in which it was made; that emancipation was a subject exclusively under the control of the States, and must be adopted or rejected by each for itself; that he did not claim nor had this government any right to coerce them for that purpose; that such was no part of his purpose in making this proposition, and he wished it to be clearly understood; that he did not expect us there to be prepared to give him an answer, but he hoped we would take the subject into serious consideration, confer with one another, and then take such course as we felt our duty and the interests of our constituents required of us., The President replied that he must not be expected to quarrel with the New York Tribune before the right time; he hoped never to have to do it; he would not anticipate events., In respect to emancipation in Missouri, he said that what had been observed by Mr. Noell was probably true, but the operation of these natural causes had not prevented the irritating conduct to which he had referred, or destroyed the hopes of the Confederates that Missouri would at some time merge herself alongside of them, which, in his judgment, the passage of this resolution by Congress and its acceptance by Missouri would accomplish., The President replied that he had no designs beyond the actions of the States on this particular subject., He should lament their refusal to accept it, but he had no designs beyond their refusal of it., The President replied that he thought there could not be., He then went off into a course of remarks not qualifying the foregoing declaration nor material to be repeated to a just understanding of his meaning., The President replied that, unless he was expelled by the act of God or the Confederate armies he should occupy that house for three years; and as long as he remained there Maryland had nothing to fear either for her institutions or her interests on the points referred to., The President: ""That [meaning a publication of what he said] will not do; it would force me into a quarrel before the proper time ""; and, again intimating, as he had before done, that a quarrel with the ""Greeley faction"" was impending, he said he did not wish to encounter it before the proper time, nor at all if it could be avoided., The President replied: ""As you may suppose, I have considered that; and the proposition now submitted does not encounter any constitutional difficulty., It proposes simply to co-operate with any State by giving such State pecuniary aid""; and he thought that the resolution, as proposed by him, would be considered rather as the expression of a sentiment than as involving any constitutional question., The President said he saw and felt the force of the objection; it was a fearful responsibility, and every gentleman must do as he thought best; that he did not know how this scheme was received by the members from the free States; some of them had spoken to him and received it kindly; but for the most part they were as reserved and chary as we had been, and he could not tell how they would vote., And in reply to some expression of Mr. Hall as to his own opinion regarding slavery, he said he did not pretend to disguise his anti-slavery feeling; that he thought it was wrong, and should continue to think so; but that was not the question we had to deal with now., Slavery existed, and that, too, as well by the act of the North as of the South; and in any scheme to get rid of it the North as well as the South was morally bound to do its full and equal share., He thought the institution wrong and ought never to have existed; but yet he recognized the rights of property which had grown out of it, and would respect those rights as fully as similar rights in any other property; that property can exist and does legally exist., He thought such a law wrong, but the rights of property resulting must be respected; he would get rid of the odious law, not by violating the rights, but by encouraging the proposition and offering inducements to give it up., Major-General McClellan having personally taken the field at the head of the Army of the Potomac, until otherwise ordered he is relieved from the command of the other military departments, he retaining command of the Department of the Potomac., Ordered further, That the departments now under the respective commands of Generals Halleck and Hunter, together with so much of that under General Buell as lies west of a north and south line indefinitely drawn through Knoxville, Tenn., be consolidated and designated the Department of the Mississippi, and that until otherwise ordered Major General Halleck have command of said department., Ordered also, That the country west of the Department of the Potomac and east of the Department of the Mississippi be a military department, to be called the Mountain Department, and that the same be commanded by Major-General Fremont., That all the commanders of departments, after the receipt of this order by them, respectively report severally and directly to the Secretary of War, and that prompt, full, and frequent reports will be expected of all and each of them., The President, having considered the plan of operations agreed upon by yourself and the commanders of army corps, makes no objection to the same but gives the following directions as to its execution:  1., Leave such force at Manassas Junction as shall make it entirely certain that the enemy shall no repossess himself of that position and line of communication., 2., Leave Washington entirely secure., 3., Move the remainder of the force down the Potomac, choosing a new base at Fortress Monroe or anywhere between here and there, or, at all events, move such remainder of the army at once in pursuit of the enemy by some route., I thank you, Mr., Train, for your kindness in presenting me with this truly elegant and highly creditable specimen of the handiwork of the mechanics of your State of Massachusetts, and I beg of you to express my hearty thanks to the donors., It displays a perfection of workmanship which I really wish I had time to acknowledge in more fitting words, and I might then follow your idea that it is suggestive, for it is evidently expected that a good deal of whipping is to be done., But as we meet here socially let us not think only of whipping rebels, or of those who seem to think only of whipping negroes, but of those pleasant days, which it is to be hoped are in store for us, when seated behind a good pair of horses we can crack our whips and drive through a peaceful, happy, and prosperous land., With this idea, gentlemen, I must leave you for my business duties., In conformity with this law, Captain Samuel F. Du Pont, of the navy, was nominated to the Senate for continuance as the flag-officer in command of the squadron which recently rendered such important service to the Union in the expedition to the coasts of South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida., Believing that no occasion could arise which would more fully correspond with the intention of the law or be more pregnant with happy influence as an example, I cordially recommend that Captain Samuel F. Du Pont receive a vote of thanks of Congress for his service and gallantry displayed in the capture since the 21st December, 1861, of various ports on the coasts of Georgia and Florida, particularly Brunswick, Cumberland Island and Sound, Amelia Island, the towns of St. Mary's, St. Augustine, and Jacksonville and Fernandina., This morning I felt constrained to order Blenker's division to Fremont, and I write this to assure you I did so with great pain, understanding that you would wish it otherwise., If you could know the full pressure of the case, I am confident that you would justify it, even beyond a mere acknowledgment that the commander-in-chief may order what he pleases., Allow me to thank you in behalf of my little son for your present of white rabbits., He is very much pleased with them., The Secretary of War will order that one or the other of the corps of General McDowell and General Sumner remain in front of Washington until further orders from the department, to operate at or in the direction of Manassas Junction, or otherwise, as occasion may require; that the other Corps not so ordered to remain go forward to General McClellan as speedily as possible; that General McClellan commence his forward movements from his new base at once, and that such incidental modifications as the foregoing may render proper be also made., Yours of 11 A. M. today received., Secretary of War informs me that the forwarding of transportation, ammunition, and Woodbury's brigade, under your orders, is not, and will not be, interfered with., You now have over one hundred thousand troops with you, independent of General Wool's command., I think you better break the enemy's line from Yorktown to Warwick River at once., This will probably use time as advantageously as you can., Your despatches, complaining that you are not properly sustained, while they do not offend me, do pain me very much., Blenker's division was withdrawn from you before you left here, and you knew the pressure under which I did it, and, as I thought, acquiesced in it certainly not without reluctance., After you left I ascertained that less than 20,000 unorganized men, without a single field battery, were all you designed to be left for the defense of Washington and Manassas Junction, and part of this even to go to General Hooker's old position; General Banks's corps, once designed for Manassas Junction, was divided and tied up on the line of Winchester and Strasburg, and could not leave it without again exposing the upper Potomac and the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad., This presented (or would present when McDowell and Sumner should be gone) a great temptation to the enemy to turn back from the Rappahannock and sack Washington., My explicit order that Washington should, by the judgment of all the Commanders of corps, be left entirely secure, had been neglected., It was precisely this that drove me to detain McDowell., I do not forget that I was satisfied with your arrangement to leave Banks at Manassas Junction; but when that arrangement was broken up and nothing substituted for it, of course I was not satisfied., I was constrained to substitute something for it myself., And now allow me to ask, do you really think I should permit the line from Richmond via Manaasas Junction to this city to be entirely open, except what resistance could be presented by less than 20,000 unorganized troops?, This is a question which the country will not allow me to evade., There is a curious mystery about the number of the troops now with you., When I telegraphed you on the 6th, saying you had over 100,000 with you, I had just obtained from the Secretary of War a statement, taken as he said from your own returns, making 108,000 then with you and en route to you., You now say you will have but 85,000 when all enroute to you shall have reached you., How can this discrepancy of 23,000 be accounted for?, As to General Wool's command, I understand it is doing for you precisely what a like number of your own would have to do if that command was away., I suppose the whole force which has gone forward to you is with you by this time; and if so, I think it is the precise time for you to strike a blow., By delay the enemy will relatively gain upon you--that is, he will gain faster by fortifications and reinforcements than you can by reinforcements alone., And once more let me tell you it is indispensable to you that you strike a blow., I am powerless to help this., You will do me the justice to remember I always insisted that going down the bay in search of a field, instead of fighting at or near Manassas, was only shifting and not surmounting a difficulty; that we would find the same enemy and the same or equal entrenchments at either place., ...]",3
270,"[I hope that upon your return to your homes you will find your friends and loved ones well and happy., I bid you farewell., What is the strength of your force now actually with you?, May 17, 1862., You will retain the separate command of the forces taken with you; but while co-operating with General McClellan you will obey his orders, except that you are to judge, and are not to allow your force to be disposed otherwise than so as to give the greatest protection to this capital which may be possible from that distance., The President having shown this to me, I suggested that it is dangerous to direct a subordinate not to obey the orders of his superior in any case, and that to give instructions to General McClellan to this same end and furnish General McDowell with a copy thereof would effect the object desired by the President., He desired me to say that the sketch of instructions to General McClellan herewith he thought made this addition unnecessary., No commanding general shall do such a thing upon my responsibility without consulting me., Your despatch to the President, asking reinforcements, has been received and carefully considered., The President is not willing to uncover the capital entirely; and it is believed that, even if this were prudent, it would require more time to effect a junction between your army and that of the Rappahannock by the way of the Potomac and York rivers than by a land march., In order, therefore, to increase the strength of the attack upon Richmond at the earliest moment, General McDowell has been ordered to march upon that city by the shortest route., He is ordered, keeping himself always in position to save the capital from all possible attack, so to operate as to put his left wing in communication with your right wing, and you are instructed to co-operate so as to establish this communication as soon as possible by extending your right-wing to the north of Richmond., It is believed that this communication can be safely established either north or south of the Pamunkey River., In any event, you will be able to prevent the main body of the enemy's forces from leaving Richmond and falling in overwhelming force upon General McDowell., He will move with between thirty-five and forty thousand men., A copy of the instructions to General McDowell are with this., The specific task assigned to his command has been to provide against any danger to the capital of the nation., At your earnest call for reinforcements, he is sent forward to co-operate in the reduction of Richmond, but charged, in attempting this, not to uncover the city of Washington; and you will give no order, either before or after your junction, which can put him out of position to cover this city., You and he will communicate with each other by telegraph or otherwise as frequently as may be necessary for efficient cooperation., When General McDowell is in position on your right, his supplies must be drawn from West Point, and you will instruct your staff-officers to be prepared to supply him by that route., The President desires that General McDowell retain the command of the Department of the Rappahannock and of the forces with which he moves forward., Whereas there appears in the public prints what purports to be a proclamation of Major general Hunter, in the words and figures following, to wit:  ""The three States of Georgia, Florida, and South Carolina, comprising the military department of the South, having deliberately declared themselves no longer under the protection of the United States of America, and having taken up arms against the said United States, it became a military necessity to declare martial law., This was accordingly done on the 25th day of April, 1862., Slavery and martial law in a free country are altogether incompatible., The persons in these three States: Georgia Florida, and South Carolina--heretofore held as slaves are therefore declared forever free., ""By command of Major-General D. Hunter: ""(Official.)ED., W. SMITH, ""Acting Assistant Adjutant-General."", And whereas the same is producing some excitement and misunderstanding: therefore,  I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States, proclaim and declare that the Government of the United States, had no knowledge, information, or belief of an intention on the part of General Hunter to issue such a proclamation; nor has it yet any authentic information that the document is genuine., And further, that neither General Hunter nor any other commander or person has been authorized by the Government of the United States to make a proclamation declaring the slaves of any State free; and that the supposed proclamation now in question, whether genuine or false, is altogether void so far as respects such a declaration., I further make known that whether it be competent for me, as commander-in-chief of the army and navy, to declare the slaves of any State or States free, and whether, at any time, in any case, it shall have become a necessity indispensable to the maintenance of the government to exercise such supposed power, are questions which under my responsibility I reserve to myself, and which I cannot feel justified in leaving to the decision of commanders in the field., These are totally different questions from those of police regulations in armies and camps., On the sixth day of March last, by special message, I recommended to Congress the adoption of a joint resolution, to be substantially as follows:  Resolved, That the United States ought to co-operate with any State which may adopt gradual abolishment of slavery, giving to such State pecuniary aid, to be used by such State, in its discretion, to compensate for the inconvenience, public and private, produced by such change of system., The resolution in the language above quoted was adopted by large majorities in both branches of Congress, and now stands an authentic, definite, and solemn proposal of the nation to the States and people most immediately interested in the subject-matter., To the people of those States I now earnestly appeal., I do not argue--I beseech you to make arguments for yourselves., You cannot, if you would, be blind to the signs of the times., I beg of you a calm and enlarged consideration of them, ranging, if it may be, far above personal and partisan politics., This proposal makes common cause for a common object, casting no reproaches upon any., It acts not the Pharisee., The change it contemplates would come gently as the dews of heaven, not rending or wrecking anything., Will you not embrace it?, So much good has not been done, by one effort, in all past time, as in the providence of God it is now your high privilege to do., May the vast future not have to lament that you have neglected it., In witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed., Done at the city of Washington, this nineteenth day of May, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-two, and of the independence of the United States the eighty-sixth., I have just been waited on by a large committee who present a petition signed by twenty-three senators and eighty-four representatives asking me to restore General Hamilton to his division., I wish to do this, and yet I do not wish to be understood as rebuking you., Please answer at once., Your long despatch of yesterday just received., You will have just such control of General McDowell and his forces as you therein indicate., McDowell can reach you by land sooner than he could get aboard of boats, if the boats were ready at Fredericksburg, unless his march shall be resisted, in which case the force resisting him will certainly not be confronting you at Richmond., By land he can reach you in five days after starting, whereas by water he would not reach you in two weeks, judging by past experience., Franklin's single division did not reach you in ten days after I ordered it., In consequence of General Banks's critical position, I have been compelled to suspend General McDowell's movements to join you., The enemy are making a desperate push upon Harper's Ferry, and we are trying to throw General Fremont's force and part of General McDowell's in their rear., I left General McDowell's camp at dark last evening., Shields's command is there, but it is so worn that he cannot move before Monday morning, the 26th., We have so thinned our line to get troops for other places that it was broken yesterday at Front Royal, with a probable loss to us of one regiment infantry, two Companies cavalry, putting General Banks in some peril., The enemy's forces under General Anderson now opposing General McDowell's advance have as their line of supply and retreat the road to Richmond., If, in conjunction with McDowell's movement against Anderson, you could send a force from your right to cut off the enemy's supplies from Richmond, preserve the railroad bridges across the two forks of the Pamunkey, and intercept the enemy's retreat, you will prevent the army now opposed to you from receiving an accession of numbers of nearly 15,000 men; and if you succeed in saving the bridges you will secure a line of railroad for supplies in addition to the one you now have., Can you not do this almost as well as not while you are building the Chickahominy bridges?, McDowell and Shields both say they can, and positively will, move Monday morning., I wish you to move cautiously and safely., You will have command of McDowell, after he joins you, precisely as you indicated in your long despatch to us of the 21st., Geary reports Jackson with 20,000 moving from Ashby's Gap by the Little River turnpike, through Aldie, toward Centreville., This he says is reliable., He is also informed of large forces south of him., We know a force of some 15,000 broke up Saturday night from in front of Fredericksburg and went we know not where., Please inform us, if possible, what has become of the force which pursued Banks yesterday; also any other information you have., Could you not send scouts from Winchester who would tell whether enemy are north of Banks, moving on Winchester?, What is the latest you have?, You are authorized to purchase the 400 horses, or take them wherever or however you can get them., The exposed condition of General Banks makes his immediate relief a point of paramount importance., You are therefore directed by the President to move against Jackson at Harrisonburg and operate against the enemy in such way as to relieve Banks., This movement must be made immediately., You will acknowledge the receipt of this order, and specify the hour it is received by you., Many thanks for the promptness with which you have answered that you will execute the order., Much--perhaps all--depends upon the celerity with which you can execute it., Put the utmost speed into it., Do not lose a minute., Several despatches from Assistant Secretary Scott and one from Governor Morton asking reinforcements for you have been received., I beg you to be assured we do the best we can., I mean to cast no blame where I tell you each of our commanders along our line from Richmond to Corinth supposes himself to be confronted by numbers superior to his own., Under this pressure We thinned the line on the upper Potomac, until yesterday it was broken with heavy loss to us, and General Banks put in great peril, out of which he is not yet extricated, and may be actually captured., We need men to repair this breach, and have them not at hand., My dear General, I feel justified to rely very much on you., I believe you and the brave officers and men with you can and will get the victory at Corinth., General Fremont has been ordered by telegraph to move from Franklin on Harrisonburg to relieve General Banks, and capture or destroy Jackson's and Ewell's forces., You are instructed, laying aside for the present the movement on Richmond, to put 20,000 men in motion at once for the Shenandoah, moving on the line or in advance of the line of the Manassas Gap railroad., Your object will be to capture the forces of Jackson and Ewell, either in co-operation with General Fremont, or, in case want of supplies or of transportation, interferes with his movements, it is believed that the force which you move will be sufficient to accomplish this object alone., The information thus far received here makes it probable that if the enemy operate actively against General Banks, you will not be able to count upon much assistance from him, but may even have to release him., Reports received this moment are that Banks is fighting with Ewell eight miles from Winchester., I am highly gratified by your alacrity in obeying my order., The change was as painful to me as it can possibly be to you or to any one., Everything now depends upon the celerity and vigor of your movement., Please give us your best present impression as to the number of the enemy's forces north of Strasburg and Front Royal., Are the forces still moving north through the gap at Front Royal and between you and there?, The enemy is moving north in sufficient force to drive General Banks before him--precisely in what force we cannot tell., He is also threatening Leesburg and Geary, on the Manassas Gap railroad, from both north and south--in precisely what force we cannot tell., I think the movement is a general and concerted one, such as would not be if he was acting upon the purpose of a very desperate defense of Richmond., ...]",3
271,"[Concentrations of our force have been made, which it is hoped will capture the enemy., The President directs you to halt at Moorefield and await orders, unless you hear of the enemy being in the general direction of Rodney, in which case you will move upon him., Acknowledge the receipt of this order, and the hour it is received., General McClellan at 6.30 P.M. yesterday telegraphed that Fitz-John Porter's division had fought and driven 13,000 of the enemy, under General Branch, from Hanover Court-House, and was driving them from a stand they had made on the railroad at the time the messenger left., Two hours later he telegraphed that Stoneman had captured an engine and six cars on the Virginia Central, which he at once sent to communicate with Porter., Nothing further from McClellan., If Porter effects a lodgment on both railroads near Hanover Court-House, consider whether your forces in front of Fredericksburg should not push through and join him., What of F.J. Porter's expedition?, Please answer., You say General Geary's scouts report that they find no enemy this side of the Blue Ridge., Neither do I., Have they been to the Blue Ridge looking for them., I think the evidence now preponderates that Ewell and Jackson are still about Winchester., Assuming this, it is for you a question of legs., Put in all the speed you can., I have told Fremont as much, and directed him to drive at them as fast as possible., By the way, I suppose you know Fremont has got up to Moorefield, instead of going into Harrisonburg., I am very glad of General F. J. Porter's victory., Still, if it was a total rout of the enemy, I am puzzled to know why the Richmond and Fredericksburg railroad was not seized again, as you say you have all the railroads but the Richmond and Fredericksburg., I am puzzled to see how, lacking that, you can have any, except the scrap from Richmond to West Point., The scrap of the Virginia Central from Richmond to Hanover Junction, without more, is simply nothing., That the whole of the enemy is concentrating on Richmond, I think cannot be certainly known to you or me., Saxton, at Harper's Ferry informs us that large forces, supposed to be Jackson's and Ewells, forced his advance from Charlestown today., General King telegraphs us from Fredericksburg that contrabands give certain information that 15,000 left Hanover Junction Monday morning to reinforce Jackson., I am painfully impressed with the importance of the struggle before you, and shall aid you all I can consistently with my view of due regard to all points., The order to remain at Moorefield was based on the supposition that it would find you there., Upon subsequent information that the enemy were still operating in the vicinity of Winchester and Martinsburg, you were directed to move against the enemy., The President now again directs you to move against the enemy without delay., Please acknowledge the receipt of this, and the time received., Yours just received., I think it cannot be certainly known whether the force which fought General Porter is the same which recently confronted McDowell., Another item of evidence bearing on it is that General Branch commanded against Porter, while it was General Anderson who was in front of McDowell., He and McDowell were in correspondence about prisoners., I think we shall be able within three days to tell you certainly whether any considerable force of the enemy--Jackson or any one else--is moving on to Harper's Ferry or vicinity., Take this expected development into your calculations., General McDowell's advance should, and probably will, be at or near Front Royal at twelve (noon) tomorrow., General Fremont will be at or near Strasburg as soon., Please watch the enemy closely, and follow and harass and detain him if he attempts to retire., I mean this for General Saxton's force as well as that immediately with you., General McDowell's advance, if not checked by the enemy, should, and probably will, be at Front Royal by twelve (noon) to-morrow., His force, when up, will be about 20,000., Please have your force at Strasburg, or, if the route you are moving on does not lead to that point, as near Strasburg as the enemy may be by the same time., Your despatch No.30 received and satisfactory., General Fremont's force should, and probably will, be at or near Strasburg by twelve (noon) tomorrow., Try to have your force, or the advance of it, at Front Royal as soon., Your despatch as to the South Anna and Ashland being seized by our forces this morning is received., Understanding these points to be on the Richmond and Fredericksburg railroad, I heartily congratulate the country, and thank General McClellan and his army for their seizure., I somewhat apprehend that Fremont's force, in its present condition, may not be quite strong enough in case it comes in collision with the enemy., For this additional reason I wish you to push forward your column as rapidly as possible., Tell me what number your force reaching Front Royal will amount to., If the enemy in force is in or about Martinsburg, Charlestown, and Winchester, Or any or all of them, he may come in collision with Fremont, in which case I am anxious that your force, with you and at Harper's Ferry, should so operate as to assist Fremont if possible; the same if the enemy should engage McDowell., This was the meaning of my despatch yesterday., Your despatch of to-day received and is satisfactory., Fremont has nominally 22,000, really about 17,000., Blenker's division is part of it., I have a despatch from Fremont this morning, not telling me where he is; but he says:  ""Scouts and men from Winchester represent Jackson's force variously at 30,000 to 60,000., With him Generals Ewell and Longstreet."", The high figures erroneous, of course., Do you know where Longstreet is?, Corinth is evacuated and occupied by us., Yours, saying you will reach Strasburg or vicinity at 5 P.M. Saturday, has been received and sent to General McDowell, and he directed to act in view of it., You must be up to the time you promised, if possible., Corinth was evacuated last night, and is occupied by our troops to-day; the enemy gone south to Okolotia, on the railroad to Mobile., I send you a despatch just received from Saxton at Harper's Ferry: ""The rebels are in line of battle in front of our lines., They have nine pieces of artillery, and in position, and cavalry., I shelled the woods in which they were, and they in return threw a large number of shells into the lines and tents from which I moved last night to take up a stronger position., I expect a great deal from the battery on the mountain, having three 9 inch Dahlgren bearing directly on the enemy's approaches., The enemy appeared this morning and then retired, with the intention of drawing us on., I shall act on the defensive, as my position is a strong one., In a skirmish which took place this afternoon I lost one horse, The enemy lost two men killed and seven wounded., It seems the game is before you., Have sent a copy to General Fremont., A circle whose circumference shall pass through Harper's Ferry, Front Royal, and Strasburg, and whose center shall be a little northeast of Winchester, almost certainly has within it this morning the forces of Jackson, Ewell, and Edward Johnson., Quite certainly they were within it two days ago., Some part of their forces attacked Harper's Ferry at dark last evening, and are still in sight this morning., Shields, with McDowell's advance, retook Front Royal at 11 A.M. yesterday, with a dozen of our own prisoners taken there a week ago, 150 of the enemy, two locomotives, and eleven cars, some other property and stores, and saved the bridge., General Fremont, from the direction of Moorefield, promises to be at or near Strasburg at 5 P.M. to-day., General Banks at Williamsport, with his old force and his new force at Harper's Ferry, is directed to co-operate., Shields at Front Royal reports a rumor of still an additional force of the enemy, supposed to be Anderson's, having entered the valley of Virginia., This last may or may not be true., Corinth is certainly in the hands of General Halleck., You are probably engaged with the enemy., I suppose he made the attack., Stand well on your guard, hold all your ground, or yield any only inch by inch and in good order., This morning we merge General Wool's department into yours, giving you command of the whole, and sending General Dix to Port Monroe and General Wool to Fort McHenry., We also send General Sigel to report to you for duty., With these continuous rains I am very anxious about the Chickahominy so close in your rear and crossing your line of communication., Please look to it., Anxious to know whether Shields can head or flank Jackson., Please tell about where Shields and Jackson, respectively, are at the time this reaches you., Your despatch of to-day to Secretary of War received., Thanks for the good news it brings., Have you anything from Memphis or other parts of the Mississippi River?, Please answer., Do you really wish to have control of the question of releasing rebel prisoners so far as they may be Tennesseeans?, If you do, please tell us so., Your answer not to be made public., Your despatch about Chattanooga and Dalton was duly received and sent to General Halleck., I have just received the following answer from him:  We have Fort Pillow, Randolph, and Memphis., We are changing one of the departmental lines, so as to give you all of Kentucky and Tennessee., ...]",3
272,"[Yours of to-day, making it probable that Jackson has been reinforced by about 10,000 from Richmond, is corroborated by a despatch from General King at Fredericksburg, saying a Frenchman, just arrived from Richmond by way of Gordonsville, met 10,000 to 15,000 passing through the latter place to join Jackson., If this is true, it is as good as a reinforcement to you of an equal force., I could better dispose of things if I could know about what day you can attack Richmond, and would be glad to be informed, if you think you can inform me with safety., Yours of last night just received, and for which I thank you., If large reinforcements are going from Richmond to Jackson, it proves one of two things: either they are very strong at Richmond, or do not mean to defend the place desperately., On reflection, I do not see how reinforcements from Richmond to Jackson could be in Gordonsville, as reported by the Frenchman and your deserters., Have not all been sent to deceive?, In regard to the contemplated execution of Captains Spriggs and Triplett the government has no information whatever, but will inquire and advise you., We have this morning sent you a despatch of General Sigel corroborative of the proposition that Jackson is being reinforced from Richmond., This may be reality, and yet may only be contrivance for deception, and to determine which is perplexing., If we knew it was not true, we could send you some more force; but as the case stands we do not think we safely can., Still, we will watch the signs and do so if possible., In regard to a contemplated execution of Captains Spriggs and Triplett the government has no information whatever, but will inquire and advise you., Your despatch of yesterday (2 P. M.) was received this morning., If it would not divert too much of your time and attention from the army under your immediate command, I would be glad to have your views as to the present state of military affairs throughout the whole country, as you say you would be glad to give them., I would rather it should be by letter than by telegraph, because of the better chance of secrecy., As to the numbers and positions of the troops not under your command in Virginia and elsewhere, even if I could do it with accuracy, which I cannot, I would rather not transmit either by telegraph or by letter, because of the chances of its reaching the enemy., I would be very glad to talk with you, but you cannot leave your camp, and I cannot well leave here., I am very glad you are looking well to the west for a movement of the enemy in that direction., You know my anxiety on that point., All was quiet at General McClellan's headquarters at two o'clock to-day., On the 7th day of December, 1861, I submitted to the Senate the project of a treaty between the United States and Mexico which had been proposed to me by Mr. Corwin, our minister to Mexico, and respectfully requested the advice of the Senate thereupon., On the 25th day of February last a resolution was adopted by the Senate to the effect:  ""That it is not advisable to negotiate a treaty that will require the United States to assume any portion of the principal or interest of the debt of Mexico, or that will require the concurrence of European powers."", This resolution having been duly communicated to me, notice thereof was immediately given by the Secretary of State to Mr. Corwin, and he was informed that he was to consider his instructions upon the subject referred to modified by this resolution and would govern his course accordingly., That despatch failed to reach Mr. Corwin, by reason of the disturbed condition of Mexico, until a very recent date, Mr. Corwin being without instructions, or thus practically left without instructions, to negotiate further with Mexico., In view of the very important events Occurring there, he has thought that the interests of the United States would be promoted by the conclusion of two treaties which should provide for a loan to that republic., He has therefore signed such treaties, and they having been duly ratified by the Government of Mexico, he has transmitted them to me for my consideration., The action of the Senate is of course conclusive against an acceptance of the treaties On my part., I have, nevertheless, thought it just to our excellent minister in Mexico and respectful to the Government of that republic to lay the treaties before the Senate, together with the correspondence which has occurred in relation to them., In performing this duty I have only to add that the importance of the subject thus submitted to the Senate, can not be over estimated, and I shall cheerfully receive and consider with the highest respect any further advice the Senate may think proper to give upon the subject., The bill which has passed the House of Representatives and the Senate, entitled ""An act to repeal that part of an act of Congress which prohibits the circulation of bank-notes of a less denomination than five dollars in the District of Columbia,"" has received my attentive consideration, and I now return it to the Senate, in which it originated, with the following objections:  1., The bill proposes to repeal the existing legislation prohibiting the circulation of bank-notes of a less denomination than five dollars within the District of Columbia, without permitting the issuing of such bills by banks not now legally authorized to issue them., In my judgment, it will be found impracticable, in the present condition of the currency, to make such a discrimination., The banks have generally suspended specie payments, and a legal sanction given to the circulation of the irredeemable notes of one class of them will almost certainly be so extended, in practical operation, as to include those of all classes, whether authorized or unauthorized., If this view be correct, the currency of the District, should this act become a law, will certainly and greatly deteriorate, to the serious injury of honest trade and honest labor., 2., This bill seems to contemplate no end which cannot be otherwise more certainly and beneficially attained., During the existing war it is peculiarly the duty of the National Government to secure to the people a sound circulating medium., This duty has been, under existing circumstances, satisfactorily performed, in part at least, by authorizing the issue of United States notes, receivable for all government dues except customs, and made a legal tender for all debts, public and private, except interest on public debt., The object of the bill submitted to me--namely, that of providing a small note currency during the present suspension--can be fully accomplished by authorizing the issue, as part of any new emission of United States notes made necessary by the circumstances of the country, of notes of a similar character, but of less denomination than five dollars., Such an issue would answer all the beneficial purposes of the bill, would save a considerable amount to the treasury in interest, would greatly facilitate payments to soldiers and other creditors of small sums, and would furnish; to the people a currency as safe as their own government., Entertaining these objections to the bill, I feel myself constrained to withhold from it my approval and return it for the further consideration and action of Congress., When birds and animals are looked at through a fog, they are seen to disadvantage, and so it might be with you if I were to attempt to tell you why I went to see General Scott., I can only say that my visit to West Point did not have the importance which has been attached to it; but it concerned matters that you understand quite as well as if I were to tell you all about them., Now, I can only remark that it had nothing whatever to do with making or unmaking any general in the country., The Secretary of War, you know, holds a pretty tight rein on the press, so that they shall not tell more than they ought to; and I 'm afraid that if I blab too much, he might draw a tight rein on me., Your three despatches of yesterday in relation to the affair, ending with the statement that you completely succeeded in making your point, are very gratifying., The later one of 6.15 P.M., suggesting the probability of your being overwhelmed by two hundred thousand, and talking of where the responsibility will belong, pains me very much., I give you all I can, and act on the presumption that you will do the best you can with what you have, while you continue, ungenerously I think, to assume that I could give you more if I would., I have omitted, and shall omit, no opportunity to send you reinforcements whenever I possibly can., General Pope thinks if you fall back it would be much better towards York River than towards the James., As Pope now has charge of the capital, please confer with him through the telegraph., Ordered: 1st., The forces under Major-Generals Fremont, Banks, and McDowell, including the troops now under Brigadier-General Sturgis at Washington, shall be consolidated and form one army, to be called the Army of Virginia., 2d., The command of the Army of Virginia is specially assigned to Major-General John Pope, as commanding general., The troops of the Mountain Department, heretofore under command of General Fremont, shall constitute the First Army Corps, under the command of General Fremont; the troops of the Shenandoah Department, now under General Banks, shall constitute the Second Army Corps, and be commanded by him; the troops under the command of General McDowell, except those within the fortifications and city of Washington, shall form the Third Army Corps, and be under his command., 3d., The Army of Virginia shall operate in such manner as, while protecting western Virginia and the national capital from danger or insult, it shall in the speediest manner attack and overcome the rebel forces under Jackson and Ewell, threaten the enemy in the direction of Charlottesville, and render the most effective aid to relieve General McClellan and capture Richmond., 4th., When the Army of the Potomac and the Army of Virginia shall be in position to communicate and directly co-operate at or before Richmond, the chief command, while so operating together, shall be governed, as in like cases, by the Rules and Articles of War., The enemy have concentrated in such force at Richmond as to render it absolutely necessary, in the opinion of the President, for you immediately to detach 25,000 of your force and forward it by the nearest and quickest route by way of Baltimore and Washington to Richmond., It is believed that the quickest route would be by way of Columbus, Ky., and up the Ohio River., But in detaching your force the President directs that it be done in such a way as to enable you to hold your ground and not interfere with the movement against Chattanooga and East Tennessee., This condition being observed, the forces to be detached and the routes they are to be sent are left to your own judgment., The direction to send these forces immediately is rendered imperative by a serious reverse suffered by General McClellan before Richmond yesterday, the full extent of which is not yet known., You will acknowledge the receipt of this despatch, stating the day and hour it is received, and inform me what your action will be, so that we may take measures to aid in river and railroad transportation., I think you had better go, with any reinforcements you can spare, to General McClellan., Save your army, at all events., Will send reinforcements as fast as we can., Of course they cannot reach you to-day, to-morrow, or next day., I have not said you were ungenerous for saying you needed reinforcements., I thought you were ungenerous in assuming that I did not send them as fast as I could., I feel any misfortune to you and your army quite as keenly as you feel it yourself., If you have had a drawn battle, or a repulse, it is the price we pay for the enemy not being in Washington., We protected Washington, and the enemy concentrated on you., Had we stripped Washington, he would have been upon us before the troops could have gotten to you., Less than a week ago you notified us that reinforcements were leaving Richmond to come in front of us., It is the nature of the case, and neither you nor the government is to blame., Please tell at once the present condition and aspect of things., My view of the present condition of the war is about as follows:  The evacuation of Corinth and our delay by the flood in the Chickahominy have enabled the enemy to concentrate too much force in Richmond for McClellan to successfully attack., In fact there soon will be no substantial rebel force anywhere else., But if we send all the force from here to McClellan, the enemy will, before we can know of it, send a force from Richmond and take Washington., Or if a large part of the western army be brought here to McClellan, they will let us have Richmond, and retake Tennessee, Kentucky, Missouri, etc., What should be done is to hold what we have in the West, open the Mississippi, and take Chattanooga and East Tennessee without more., A reasonable force should in every event be kept about Washington for its protection., Then let the country give us a hundred thousand new troops in the shortest possible time, which, added to McClellan directly or indirectly, will take Richmond without endangering any other place which we now hold, and will substantially end the war., I expect to maintain this contest until successful, or till I die, or am conquered, or my term expires, or Congress or the country forsake me; and I would publicly appeal to the country for this new force were it not that I fear a general panic and stampede would follow, so hard it is to have a thing understood as it really is., I think the new force should be all, or nearly all, infantry, principally because such can be raised most cheaply and quickly., Communication with McClellan by White House is cut off., Strain every nerve to open communication with him by James River, or any other way you can., Report to me., Enemy has cut McClellan's communication with White House, and is driving Stoneman back on that point., Do what you can for him with gunboats at or near that place., McClellan's main force is between the Chickahominy and the James., Also do what you can to communicate with him and support him there., Your despatch of to-day is just received., I have no recollection of either John R. Cravens or Cyrus M. Allen having been named to me for appointment under the tax law., The latter particularly has been my friend, and I am sorry to learn that he is not yours., No appointment has been or will be made by me for the purpose of stabbing you., ...]",3
273,"[Ten thousand thanks for it., On the 28th we sent General Burnside an order to send all the force he could spare to you., We then learned that you had requested him to go to Goldsborough; upon which we said to him our order was intended for your benefit, and we did not wish to be in conflict with your views., We hope you will have help from him soon., Today we have ordered General Hunter to send you all he can spare., At last advices General Halleck thinks he cannot send reinforcements without endangering all he has gained., I understand your position as stated in your letter and by General Marcy., To reinforce you so as to enable you to resume the offensive within a month, or even six weeks, is impossible., In addition to that arrived and now arriving from the Potomac (about 10,000 men, I suppose), and about 10,000 I hope you will have from Burnside very soon, and about 5000 from Hunter a little later, I do not see how I can send you another man within a month., Under these circumstances the defensive for the present must be your only care., Save the army first, where you are, if you can; secondly, by removal, if you must., You, on the ground, must be the judge as to which you will attempt, and of the means for effecting it., I but give it as my opinion that with the aid of the gunboats and the reinforcements mentioned above you can hold your present position--provided, and so long as, you can keep the James River open below you., If you are not tolerably confident you can keep the James River open, you had better remove as soon as possible., I do not remember that you have expressed any apprehension as to the danger of having your communication cut on the river below you, yet I do not suppose it can have escaped your attention., If at any time you feel able to take the offensive, you are not restrained from doing so., A.L., You do not know how much you would oblige us if, without abandoning any of your positions or plans, you could promptly send us even 10,000 infantry., Can you not?, Some part of the Corinth army is certainly fighting McClellan in front of Richmond., Prisoners are in our hands from the late Corinth army., Send forward the despatch to Colonel Hawkins and this also., Our order and General McClellan's to General Burnside being the same, of course we wish it executed as promptly as possible., A thousand thanks for the relief your two despatches of 12 and 1 P.M. yesterday gave me., Be assured the heroism and skill of yourself and officers and men is, and forever will be, appreciated., If you can hold your present position, we shall have the enemy yet., This introduces Governor William Sprague, of Rhode Island., He is now Governor for the third time, and senator-elect of the United States., I know the object of his visit to you., He has my cheerful consent to go, but not my direction., He wishes to get you and part of your force, one or both, to come here., You already know I should be exceedingly glad of this if, in your judgment, it could be without endangering positions and operations in the southwest; and I now repeat what I have more than once said by telegraph: ""Do not come or send a man if, in your judgment, it will endanger any point you deem important to hold, or endangers or delays the Chattanooga expedition."", Still, please give my friend, Governor Sprague, a full and fair hearing., What amount of force have you now?, GWhat is the whole amount of your corps with you now., What is likely to be your condition as to health in this camp?, In your present encampment what is the present and prospective condition as to health?, Where is the enemy now?, Where and in what condition do you believe the enemy to be now?, What is the aggregate of your killed, wounded, and missing from the attack on the 26th ultimo till now?, If you desired could you remove the army safely?, If it were desired to get the army away, could it be safely effected?, Is the army secure in its present position?, Ordered, That Major-General Henry W. Halleck be assigned to command the whole land forces of the United States, as general-in-chief, and that he repair to this capital so soon as he can with safety to the positions and operations within the department now under his charge., Whereas, in the judgment of the President, the public safety does require that the railroad line called and known as the Southwest Branch of the Pacific Railroad in the State of Missouri be repaired, extended, and completed from Rolla to Lebanon, in the direction to Springfield, in the said State, the same being necessary to the successful and economical conduct of the war and to the maintenance of the authority of the government in the Southwest:  Therefore, under and in virtue of the act of Congress entitled ""An act to authorize the President of the United States in certain cases to take possession of railroad and telegraph lines, and for other purposes,"" approved January 31, 1862, it is ordered, That the portion of the said railroad line which reaches from Rolla to Lebanon be repaired, extended, and completed, so as to be made available for the military uses of the government, as speedily as may be., And, inasmuch as upon the part of the said line from Rolla to the stream called Little Piney a considerable portion of the necessary work has already been done by the railroad company, and the road to this extent may be completed at comparatively small cost, it is ordered that the said line from Rolla to and across Little Piney be first completed, and as soon as possible., The Secretary of War is charged with the execution of this order., And to facilitate the speedy execution of the work, he is directed, at his discretion, to take possession and control of the whole or such part of the said railroad line, and the whole or such part of the rolling stock, offices, shops, buildings, and all their appendages and appurtenances, as he may judge necessary or convenient for the early completion of the road from Rolla to Lebanon., I recommend that the thanks of Congress be given to the following officers of the United States Navy:  Captain James L. Lardner, for meritorious conduct at the battle of Port Royal and distinguished services on the coast of the United States against the enemy., Captain Charles Henry Davis, for distinguished services in conflict with the enemy at Fort Pillow, at Memphis, and for successful operations at other points in the waters of the Mississippi River., Commander John A. Dahlgren, for distinguished services in the line of his profession, improvements in ordnance, and zealous and efficient labors in the ordnance branch of the service., Commander Stephen C. Rowan, for distinguished services in the waters of North Carolina, and particularly in the capture of Newbern, being in chief command of the naval forces., Commander David D. Porter, for distinguished services in the conception and preparation of the means used for the capture of the forts below New Orleans, and for highly meritorious conduct in the management of the mortar flotilla during the bombardment of Forts Jackson and St. Philip., Captain Silas H. Stringharn, now on the retired list, for distinguished services in the capture of Forts Hatteras and Clark., Yours of yesterday is received., Do you not, my good friend, perceive that what you ask is simply to put you in command in the West?, I do not suppose you desire this., You only wish to control in your own localities; but this you must know may derange all other posts., Can you not, and will you not, have a full conference with General Halleck?, Telegraph him, and meet him at such place as he and you can agree upon., I telegraph him to meet you and confer fully with you., Governor Johnson, at Nashville, is in great trouble and anxiety about a raid into Kentucky., The governor is a true and valuable man--indispensable to us in Tennessee., Will you please get in communication with him, and have a full conference with him before you leave for here?, I have telegraphed him on the subject., After the adjournment of Congress now very near, I shall have no opportunity of seeing you for several months., Believing that you of the border States hold more power for good than any other equal number of members, I feel it a duty which I cannot justifiably waive to make this appeal to you., I intend no reproach or complaint when I assure you that, in my opinion, if you all had voted for the resolution in the gradual-emancipation message of last March, the war would now be substantially ended., And the plan therein proposed is yet one of the most potent and swift means of ending it., Let the States which are in rebellion see definitely and certainly that in no event will the States you represent ever join their proposed confederacy, and they cannot much longer maintain the contest., But you cannot divest them of their hope to ultimately have you with them so long as you show a determination to perpetuate the institution within your own States., Beat them at elections, as you have overwhelmingly done, and, nothing daunted, they still claim you as their own., You and I know what the lever of their power is., Break that lever before their faces, and they can shake you no more forever., Most of you have treated me with kindness and consideration and I trust you will not now think I improperly touch what is exclusively your own, when, for the sake of the whole country, I ask, Can you, for your States, do better than to take the course I urge?, Discarding punctilio and maxims adapted to more manageable times, and looking only to the unprecedentedly stern facts of our case, can you do better in any possible event?, You prefer that the constitutional relation of the States to the nation shall be practically restored without disturbance of the institution; and if this were done, my whole duty in this respect, under the Constitution and my oath of office, would be performed., But it is not done, and we are trying to accomplish it by war., The incidents of the war cannot be avoided., If the war continues long, as it must if the object be not sooner attained, the institution in your States will be extinguished by mere friction and abrasion--by the mere incidents of the war., It will be gone, and you will have nothing valuable in lieu of it., Much of its value is gone already., How much better for you and for your people to take the step which at once shortens the war and secures substantial compensation for that which is sure to be wholly lost in any other event!, How much better to thus save the money which else we sink forever in war!, How much better to do it while we can, lest the war ere long render us pecuniarily unable to do it!, How much better for you as seller, and the nation as buyer, to sell out and buy out that without which the war could never have been, than to sink both the thing to be sold and the price of it in cutting one another's throats!, I do not speak of emancipation at once, but of a decision at once to emancipate gradually., Room in South America for colonization can be obtained cheaply and in abundance, and when numbers shall be large enough to be company and encouragement for one another, the freed people will not be so reluctant to go., I am pressed with a difficulty not yet mentioned--one which threatens division among those who, united, are none too strong., An instance of it is known to you., General Hunter is an honest man., He was, and I hope still is, my friend., I valued him none the less for his agreeing with me in the general wish that all men everywhere could be free., He proclaimed all men free within certain States, and I repudiated the proclamation., He expected more good and less harm from the measure than I could believe would follow., Yet, in repudiating it, I gave dissatisfaction, if not offence, to many whose support the country cannot afford to lose., And this is not the end of it., The pressure in this direction is still upon me, and is increasing., By conceding what I now ask you can relieve me, and, much more, can relieve the country in this important point., Upon these considerations, I have again begged your attention to the message of March last., ...]",3
274,"[The twelfth and thirteenth sections are something better than unobjectionable; and the fourteenth is entirely proper, if all other parts of the act shall stand., That to which I chiefly object pervades most parts of the act, but more distinctly appears in the first, second, seventh, and eighth sections., It is the sum of those provisions which results in the divesting of title forever., For the causes of treason and ingredients of treason, not amounting to the full crime, it declares forfeiture extending beyond the lives of the guilty parties; whereas the Constitution of the United States declares that ""no attainder of treason shall work corruption of blood or forfeiture except during the life of the person attainted."", True, there is to be no formal attainder in this case; still, I think the greater punishment cannot be constitutionally inflicted, in a different form, for the same offence., With great respect I am constrained to say I think this feature of the act is unconstitutional., It would not be difficult to modify it., I may remark that the provision of the Constitution, put in language borrowed from Great Britain, applies only in this country, as I understand, to real or landed estate., Again, this act in rem forfeits property for the ingredients of treason without a conviction of the supposed criminal, or a personal hearing given him in any proceeding., That we may not touch property lying within our reach, because we cannot give personal notice to an owner who is absent endeavoring to destroy the government, is certainly not satisfactory., Still, the owner may not be thus engaged; and I think a reasonable time should be provided for such parties to appear and have personal hearings., Similar provisions are not uncommon in connection with proceedings in rem., For the reasons stated, I return the bill to the House in which it originated., This is Monday., I hope to be able to tell you on Thursday what is to be done with Burnside., Representations have been made to the President by the ministers of various foreign powers in amity with the United States that subjects of such powers have during the present insurrection been obliged or required by military authorities to take an oath of general or qualified allegiance to this government., It is the duty of all aliens residing in the United States to submit to and obey the laws and respect the authority of the government., For any proceeding or conduct inconsistent with this obligation and subversive of that authority they may rightfully be subjected to military restraints when this may be necessary., But they cannot be required to take an oath of allegiance to this government, because it conflicts with the duty they owe to their own sovereigns., All such obligations heretofore taken are therefore remitted and annulled., Military commanders will abstain from imposing similar obligations in future, and will in lieu thereof adopt such other restraints of the character indicated as they shall find necessary, convenient, and effectual for the public safety., It is further directed that whenever any order shall be made affecting the personal liberty of an alien reports of the same and of the causes thereof shall be made to the War Department for the consideration of the Department of State., 1., That military commanders within the States of Virginia, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas, and Arkansas in an orderly manner seize and use any property, real or personal, which may be necessary or convenient for their several commands as supplies or for other military purposes; and that while property may be destroyed for proper military objects, none shall be destroyed in wantonness or malice., 2., That military and naval commanders shall employ as laborers within and from said States so many persons of African descent as can be advantageously used for military or naval purposes, giving them reasonable wages for their labor., 3., That as to both property and persons of African descent accounts shall be kept sufficiently accurate and in detail to show quantities and amounts and from whom both property and such persons shall have come, as a basis upon which compensation can be made in proper cases; and the several departments of this government shall attend to and perform their appropriate parts toward the execution of these orders., In pursuance of the sixth section of the act of Congress entitled ""An act to suppress insurrection and to punish treason and rebellion, to seize and confiscate property of rebels, and for other purposes,"" approved July 17, 1862, and which act and the joint resolution explanatory thereof are herewith published, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States, do hereby proclaim to and warn all persons within the contemplation of said sixth section to cease participating in, aiding, countenancing, or abetting the existing rebellion or any rebellion against the Government of the United States and to return to their proper allegiance to the United States, on pain of the forfeitures and seizures as within and by said sixth section provided., In testimony whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed., Done at the city of Washington, this twenty-fifth day of July, A.D. 1862, and of the independence of the United States the eighty-seventh., Yours of the 16th is received  You are ready to say I apply to friends what is due only to enemies., I distrust the wisdom if not the sincerity of friends who would hold my hands while my enemies stab me., This appeal of professed friends has paralyzed me more in this struggle than any other one thing., You remember telling me, the day after the Baltimore mob in April, 1861, that it would crush all Union feeling in Maryland for me to attempt bringing troops over Maryland soil to Washington., I brought the troops notwithstanding, and yet there was Union feeling enough left to elect a Legislature the next autumn, which in turn elected a very excellent Union United States senator!, I am a patient man--always willing to forgive on the Christian terms of repentance, and also to give ample time for repentance., Still, I must save this government, if possible., What I cannot do, of course, I will not do; but it may as well be understood, once for all, that I shall not surrender this game leaving any available card unplayed., The copy of a letter addressed to yourself by Mr. Thomas J. Durant has been shown to me., The writer appears to be an able, a dispassionate, and an entirely sincere man., The first part of the letter is devoted to an effort to show that the secession ordinance of Louisiana was adopted against the will of a majority of the people., This is probably true, and in that fact may be found some instruction., Why did they allow the ordinance to go into effect?, Why did they not assert themselves?, Why stand passive and allow themselves to be trodden down by minority?, Why did they not hold popular meetings and have a convention of their own to express and enforce the true sentiment of the State?, If preorganization was against them then, why not do this now that the United States army is present to protect them?, The paralysis--the dead palsy--of the government in this whole struggle is that this class of men will do nothing for the government, nothing for themselves, except demanding that the government shall not strike its open enemies, lest they be struck by accident!, Mr. Durant complains that in various ways the relation of master and slave is disturbed by the presence of our army, and he considers it particularly vexatious that this, in part, is done under cover of an act of Congress, while constitutional guaranties are suspended on the plea of military necessity., The truth is, that what is done and omitted about slaves is done and omitted on the same military necessity., It is a military necessity to have men and money; and we can get neither in sufficient numbers or amounts if we keep from or drive from our lines slaves coming to them., Mr. Durant cannot be ignorant of the pressure in this direction, nor of my efforts to hold it within bounds till he and such as he shall have time to help themselves., I am not posted to speak understandingly on all the police regulations of which Mr. Durant complains., If experience shows any one of them to be wrong, let them be set right., I think I can perceive in the freedom of trade which Mr. Durant urges that he would relieve both friends and enemies from the pressure of the blockade., By this he would serve the enemy more effectively than the enemy is able to serve himself., I do not say or believe that to serve the enemy is the purpose, of Mr. Durant, or that he is conscious of any purpose other than national and patriotic ones., Still, if there were a class of men who, having no choice of sides in the contest, were anxious only to have quiet and comfort for themselves while it rages, and to fall in with the victorious side at the end of it without loss to themselves, their advice as to the mode of conducting the contest would be precisely such as his is., He speaks of no duty--apparently thinks of none--resting upon Union men., He even thinks it injurious to the Union cause that they should be restrained in trade and passage without taking sides., They are to touch neither a sail nor a pump, but to be merely passengers--deadheads at that--to be carried snug and dry throughout the storm, and safely landed right side up., Nay, more: even a mutineer is to go untouched, lest these sacred passengers receive an accidental wound., Of course the rebellion will never be suppressed in Louisiana if the professed Union men there will neither help to do it nor permit the government to do it without their help., Now, I think the true remedy is very different from what is suggested by Mr. Durant., It does not lie in rounding the rough angles of the war, but in removing the necessity for the war., The people of Louisiana who wish protection to person and property have but to reach forth their hands and take it., Let them in good faith reinaugurate the national authority, and set up a State government conforming thereto under the Constitution., They know how to do it and can have the protection of the army while doing it., The army will be withdrawn so soon as such State government can dispense with its presence; and the people of the State can then, upon the old constitutional terms, govern themselves to their own liking., This is very simple and easy., If they will not do this--if they prefer to hazard all for the sake of destroying the government--it is for them to consider whether it is probable I will surrender the government to save them from losing all., If they decline what I suggest, you scarcely need to ask what I will do., What would you do in my position?, Would you drop the war where it is?, Or would you prosecute it in future with elder-stalk squirts charged with rose water?, Would you deal lighter blows rather than heavier ones?, Would you give up the contest, leaving any available means unapplied?, I am in no boastful mood., I shall not do more than I can, and I shall do all I can, to save the government, which is my sworn duty as well as my personal inclination., I shall do nothing in malice., What I deal with is too vast for malicious dealing., It would be of great service here for us to know, as fully as you can tell, what progress is made and making in recruiting for old regiments in your State., Also about what day the first regiments can move with you, what the second, what the third, and so on., This information is important to us in making calculations., Please give it as promptly and accurately as you call., Broken eggs cannot be mended; but Louisiana has nothing to do now but to take her place in the Union as it was, barring the already broken eggs., The sooner she does so, the smaller will be the amount of that which will be past mending., This government cannot much longer play a game in which it stakes all, and its enemies stake nothing., Those enemies must understand that they cannot experiment for ten years trying to destroy the government, and if they fail, still come back into the Union unhurt., If they expect in any contingency to ever have the Union as it was, I join with the writer in saying, ""Now is the time."", How much better it would have been for the writer to have gone at this, under the protection of the army at New Orleans, than to have sat down in a closet writing complaining letters northward!, Your very acceptable letter, dated Orbe, Canton de Vaud, Switzerland, 18th of July, 1862, is received., The moral effect was the worst of the affair before Richmond, and that has run its course downward., We are now at a stand, and shall soon be rising again, as we hope., I believe it is true that, in men and material, the enemy suffered more than we in that series of conflicts, while it is certain that he is less able to bear it., With us every soldier is a man of character, and must be treated with more consideration than is customary in Europe., Hence our great army, for slighter causes than could have prevailed there, has dwindled rapidly, bringing the necessity for a new call earlier than was anticipated., We shall easily obtain the new levy, however., Be not alarmed if you shall learn that we shall have resorted to a draft for part of this., ...]",3
275,"[It is exceedingly important that we have men at the beginning capable of thinking as white men, and not those who have been systematically oppressed., There is much to encourage you., For the sake of your race you should sacrifice something of your present comfort for the purpose of being as grand in that respect as the white people., It is a cheering thought throughout life that something can be done to ameliorate the condition of those who have been subject to the hard usages of the world., It is difficult to make a man miserable while he feels he is worthy of himself and claims kindred to the great God who made him., In the American Revolutionary war sacrifices were made by men engaged in it, but they were cheered by the future., General WASHINGTON himself endured greater physical hardships than if he had remained a British subject, yet he was a happy man because he had engaged in benefiting his race, in doing something for the children of his neighbors, having none of his own., The colony of Liberia has been in existence a long time., In a certain sense it is a success., The old President of Liberia, Roberts, has just been with me--the first time I ever saw him., He says they have within the bounds of that colony between three and four hundred thousand people, or more than in some of our old States, such as Rhode Island or Delaware, or in some of our newer States, and less than in some of our larger ones., They are not all American colonists or their descendants., Something less than 12,000 have been sent thither from this country., Many of the original settlers have died; yet, like people else-where, their offspring outnumber those deceased., The question is, if the colored people are persuaded to go anywhere, why not there?, One reason for unwillingness to do so is that some of you would rather remain within reach of the country of your nativity., I do not know how much attachment you may have toward our race., It does not strike me that you have the greatest reason to love them., But still you are attached to them, at all events., The place I am thinking about for a colony is in Central America., It is nearer to us than Liberia not much more than one fourth as far as Liberia, and within seven days' run by steamers., Unlike Liberia, it is a great line of travel--it is a highway., The country is a very excellent one for any people, and with great natural resources and advantages, and especially because of the similarity of climate with your native soil, thus being suited to your physical condition., The particular place I have in view is to be a great highway from the Atlantic or Caribbean Sea to the Pacific Ocean, and this particular place has all the advantages for a colony., On both sides there are harbors--among the finest in the world., Again, there is evidence of very rich coal-mines., A certain amount of coal is valuable in any country., Why I attach so much importance to coal is, it will afford an opportunity to the inhabitants for immediate employment till they get ready to settle permanently in their homes., If you take colonists where there is no good landing, there is a bad show; and so where there is nothing to cultivate and of which to make a farm., But if something is started so that you can get your daily bread as soon as reach you there, it is a great advantage., Coal land is the best thing I know of with which to commence an enterprise., To return--you have been talked to upon this subject, and told that a speculation is intended by gentlemen who have an interest in the country, including the coal-mines., We have been mistaken all our lives if we do not know whites, as well as blacks, look to their self-interest., Unless among those deficient of intellect, everybody you trade with makes something., You meet with these things here and everywhere., If such persons have what will be an advantage to them, the question is whether it cannot be made of advantage to you., You are intelligent, and know that success does not so much depend on external help as on self-reliance., Much, therefore, depends upon yourselves., As to the coal-mines, I think I see the means available for your self-reliance., I shall, if I get a sufficient number of you engaged, have provision made that you shall not be wronged., If you will engage in the enterprise, I will spend some of the money intrusted to me., I am not sure you will succeed., The government may lose the money; but we cannot succeed unless we try, and we think with care we can succeed., The political affairs in Central America are not in quite as satisfactory a condition as I wish., There are contending factions in that quarter, but it is true all the factions are agreed alike on the subject of colonization, and want it, and are more generous than we are here., To your colored race they have no objection I would endeavor to have you made the equals, and have the best assurance that you should be the equals, of the best., The practical thing I want to ascertain is whether I can get a number of able-bodied men, with their wives and children, who are willing to go when I present evidence of encouragement and protection., Could I get a hundred tolerably intelligent men, with their wives and children, and able to ""cut their own fodder,"" so to speak?, Can I have fifty?, If I could find twenty-five able-bodied men, with a mixture of women and children--good things in the family relation, I think,--I could make a successful commencement., I want you to let me know whether this can be done or not., This is the practical part of my wish to see you., These are subjects of very great importance, worthy of a month's study, instead of a speech delivered in an hour., I ask you, then, to consider seriously, not pertaining to yourselves merely, nor for your race and ours for the present time, but as one of the things, if successfully managed, the good of mankind--not confined to the present generation, but as  It is believed that a Dr. J. J. Williams is a prisoner in your charge, and if so tell him his wife is here and allow him to telegraph to her., Mrs. L. has $1000 for the benefit of the hospitals and she will be obliged, and send the pay, if you will be so good as to select and send her $200 worth of good lemons and $100 worth of good oranges., The Secretary of the Treasury and the Commissioner of Internal Revenue will please see Mr. Talcott, one of the best men there is, and, if any difference, one they would like better than they do me., Which do you prefer--commissary or quartermaster?, If appointed it must be without conditions., Your despatch to Mrs. L. received yesterday., She is not well., Owing to her early and strong friendship for you, I would gladly oblige you, but I cannot absolutely do it., If General Boyle and Hon., James Guthrie, one or both, in their discretion see fit to give you the passes, this is my authority to them for doing so., Your telegram in regard to the lunatic asylum has been received., It is certainly a case of difficulty, but if you cannot remain, I cannot conceive who under my authority can., Remain as long as you safely can and provide as well as you can for the poor inmates of the institution., I have just read yours of the 19th, addressed to myself through the New York Tribune., If there be in it any statements or assumptions of fact which I may know to be erroneous, I do not now and here controvert them., If there be in it any inferences which I may believe to be falsely drawn, I do not now and here argue against them., If there be perceptible in it an impatient and dictatorial tone, I waive it in deference to an old friend, whose heart I have always supposed to be right., As to the policy I ""seem to be pursuing,"" as you say, I have not meant to leave any one in doubt., I would save the Union., I would save it the shortest way under the Constitution., The sooner the national authority can be restored, the nearer the Union will be, ""the Union as it was."", If there be those who would not save the Union unless they could at the same time save slavery, I do not agree with them., If there be those who would not save the Union unless they could at the same time destroy slavery, I do not agree with them., My paramount object in this struggle is to save the Union, and is not either to save or destroy slavery., If I could save the Union without freeing any slave, I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing all the slaves, I would do it; and if I could do it by freeing some and leaving others alone, I would also do that., What I do about slavery and the colored race, I do because I believe it helps to save this Union; and what I forbear, I forbear because I do not believe it would help to save the Union., I shall do less whenever I shall believe what I am doing hurts the cause, and I shall do more whenever I shall believe doing more will help the cause., I shall try to correct errors when shown to be errors; and I shall adopt new views so fast as they shall appear to be true views., I have here stated my purpose according to my view of official duty, and I intend no modification of my oft expressed personal wish that all men, everywhere, could be free., I am pained to hear that you reject the service of an officer we sent to assist in organizing and getting off troops., Pennsylvania and Indiana accepted such officers kindly, and they now have more than twice as many new troops in the field as all the other States together., If Illinois had got forward as many troops as Indiana, Cumberland Gap would soon be relieved from its present peril., Please do not ruin us on punctilio., Yours received., Attend to the Indians., If the draft cannot proceed, of course it will not proceed., Necessity knows no law., The government cannot extend the time., What news from the front?, Do you hear anything from Pope?, Any news from General Pope?, Yours received., How do you learn that the rebel forces at Manassas are large and commanded by several of their best generals?, Any further news?, Does Colonel Devon mean that sound of firing was heard in direction of Warrenton, as stated, or in direction of Warrenton Junction?, What news from direction of Manassas Junction?, What generally?, ...]",3
276,"[How can we feed and care for such a multitude?, General Butler wrote me a few days since that he was issuing more rations to the slaves who have rushed to him than to all the white troops under his command., They eat, and that is all; though it is true General Butler is feeding the whites also by the thousand; for it nearly amounts to a famine there., If, now, the pressure of the war should call off our forces from New Orleans to defend some other point, what is to prevent the masters from reducing the blacks to slavery again?, for I am told that whenever the rebels take any black prisoners, free or slave, they immediately auction them off., They did so with those they took from a boat that was aground in the Tennessee River a few days ago., And then I am very ungenerously attacked for it!, For instance, when, after the late battles at and near Bull Run, an expedition went out from Washington under a flag of truce to bury the dead and bring in the wounded, and the rebels seized the blacks who went along to help, and sent them into slavery, Horace Greeley said in his paper that the government would probably do nothing about it., What could I do?, Now, then, tell me, if you please, what possible result of good would follow the issuing of such a proclamation as you desire?, Understand, I raise no objections against it on legal or constitutional grounds; for, as commander-in-chief of the army and navy, in time of war I suppose I have a right to take any measure which may best subdue the enemy; nor do I urge objections of a moral nature, in view of possible consequences of insurrection and massacre at the South., I view this matter as a practical war measure, to be decided on according to the advantages or disadvantages it may offer to the suppression of the rebellion., I admit that slavery is the root of the rebellion, or at least its sine qua non., The ambition of politicians may have instigated them to act, but they would have been impotent without slavery as their instrument., I will also concede that emancipation would help us in Europe, and convince them that we are incited by something more than ambition., I grant, further, that it would help somewhat at the North, though not so much, I fear, as you and those you represent imagine., Still, some additional strength would be added in that way to the war, and then, unquestionably, it would weaken the rebels by drawing off their laborers, which is of great importance; but I am not so sure we could do much with the blacks., If we were to arm them, I fear that in a few weeks the arms would be in the hands of the rebels; and, indeed, thus far we have not had arms enough to equip our white troops., I will mention another thing, though it meet only your scorn and contempt., There are fifty thousand bayonets in the Union armies from the border slave States., It would be a serious matter if, in consequence of a proclamation such as you desire, they should go over to the rebels., I do not think they all would--not so many, indeed, as a year ago, or as six months ago--not so many to-day as yesterday., Every day increases their Union feeling., They are also getting their pride enlisted, and want to beat the rebels., Let me say one thing more: I think you should admit that we already have an important principle to rally and unite the people, in the fact that constitutional government is at stake., This is a fundamental idea going down about as deep as anything., Do not misunderstand me because I have mentioned these objections., They indicate the difficulties that have thus far prevented my action in some such way as you desire., I have not decided against a proclamation of liberty to the slaves, but hold the matter under advisement; and I can assure you that the subject is on my mind, by day and night, more than any other., Whatever shall appear to be God's will, I will do., I trust that in the freedom with which I have canvassed your views I have not in any respect injured your feelings., Thanks for your despatch., Can you not pursue the retreating enemy, and relieve Cumberland Gap?, Your despatch of to-day received., God bless you, and all with you., Destroy the rebel army if possible., I now consider it safe to say that General McClellan has gained a great victory over the great rebel army in Maryland, between Fredericktown and Hagerstown., He is now pursuing the flying foe., What do you hear from General McClellan's army?, We have nothing from him to-day., I have received your despatch in regard to recommendations of General Wright., I have received no such despatch from him, at least not that I can remember., I refer yours for General Halleck's consideration., How many regiments are there in Illinois, ready for service but for want of arms?, How many arms have you there ready for distribution?, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States of America and Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy thereof, do hereby proclaim and declare that hereafter, as heretofore, the war will be prosecuted for the object of practically restoring the constitutional relation between the United States and each of the States and the people thereof in which States that relation is or may be suspended or disturbed., That it is my purpose, upon the next meeting of Congress, to again recommend the adoption of a practical measure tendering pecuniary aid to the free acceptance or rejection of all slave States, so called, the people whereof may not then be in rebellion against the United States, and which States may then have voluntarily adopted, or thereafter may voluntarily adopt, immediate or gradual abolishment of slavery within their respective limits; and that the effort to colonize persons of African descent with their consent upon this continent or elsewhere, with the previously obtained consent of the governments existing there, will be continued., That on the 1st day of January, A.D. 1863, all persons held as slaves within any State or designated part of a State the people whereof shall then be in rebellion against the United States shall be then, thenceforward, and forever free; and the executive government of the United States, including the military and naval authority thereof, will recognize and maintain the freedom of such persons and will do no act or acts to repress such persons, or any of them, in any efforts they may make for their actual freedom., That the Executive will on the 1st day of January aforesaid, by proclamation, designate the States and parts of States, if any, in which the people thereof, respectively, shall then be in rebellion against the United States; and the fact that any State or the people thereof shall on that day be in good faith represented in the Congress of the United States by members chosen thereto at elections wherein a majority of the qualified voters of such State shall have participated shall, in the absence of strong countervailing testimony, be deemed conclusive evidence that such State and the people thereof are not then in rebellion against the United States., That attention is hereby called to an act of Congress entitled ""An act to make an additional article of war,"" approved March 13, 1862, and which act is in the words and figure following:  ""Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That hereafter the following shall be promulgated as an additional article of war for the government of the Army of the United States and shall be obeyed and observed as such., ""ART., All officers or persons in the military or naval service of the United States are prohibited from employing any of the forces under their respective commands for the purpose of returning fugitives from service or labor who may have escaped from any person, to whom such service or labor is claimed to be due, and any officer who shall be found guilty by a court-martial of violating this article shall be dismissed from the service., ""SEC., 2., And be it further enacted, That this act shall take effect from and after its passage."", Also to the ninth and tenth sections of an act entitled ""An act to suppress insurrection, to punish treason and rebellion, to seize and confiscate the property of rebels, and for other purposes,"" approved July 17, 1862, and which sections are in the words and figures following:   ""SEC., 9., And be it further enacted, That all slaves of persons who shall hereafter be engaged in rebellion against the Government of the United States, or who shall in any way give aid or comfort thereto, escaping from such persons and taking refuge within the lines of the army, and all slaves captured from such persons or deserted by them and coming under the control of the Government of the United States, and all slaves of such persons found on (or) being within any place occupied by rebel forces and afterwards occupied by the forces of the United States, shall be deemed captives of war and shall be forever free of their servitude and not again held as slaves., ""SEC., 9., And be it further enacted, That no slave escaping into any State, Territory, or the District of Columbia from any other State shall be delivered up or in any way impeded or hindered of his liberty, except for crime, or some offence against the laws, unless the person claiming said fugitive shall first make oath that the person to whom the labor or service of such fugitive is alleged to be due is his lawful owner, and has not borne arms against the United States in the present rebellion, nor in any way given aid and comfort thereto;

Turner, Judge Advocate, etc., you said: ""That is not the game., The object is, that neither army shall get much advantage of the other; that both shall be kept in the field till they are exhausted, when we will make a compromise and save slavery."", I shall be very happy if you will, within twenty-four hours from the receipt of this, prove to me by Major Turner that you did not, either literally or in substance, make the answer stated., On cross-examination, Major Turner says he has frequently heard Major Key converse in regard to the present troubles, and never heard him utter a sentiment unfavorable to the maintenance of the Union., He has never uttered anything which he, Major T., would call disloyalty., The particular conversation detailed was a private one., In my view, it is wholly inadmissible for any gentleman holding a military commission from the United States to utter such sentiments as Major Key is within proved to have done., Therefore, let Major John J., Key be forthwith dismissed from the military service of the United States., Your kind letter of the 25th is just received., It is known to some that, while I hope something from the proclamation, my expectations are not as sanguine as are those of some friends., The time for its effect southward has not come; but northward the effect should be instantaneous., It is six days old, and, while commendation in newspapers and by distinguished individuals is all that a vain man could wish, the stocks have declined, and troops come forward more slowly than ever., ...]",3

Crawford to be restored to his office?, I have just read your despatch about sore-tongued and fatigued horses., Will you pardon me for asking what the horses of your army have done since the battle of Antietam that fatigues anything?, Yours, in reply to mine about horses, received., Of course you know the facts better than I; still two considerations remain: Stuart's cavalry outmarched ours, having certainly done more marked service on the Peninsula and everywhere since., Secondly, will not a movement of our army be a relief to the cavalry, compelling the enemy to concentrate instead of foraging in squads everywhere?, But I am so rejoiced to learn from your despatch to General Halleck that you begin crossing the river this morning., Your despatch to Mr. Stanton, of which the enclosed is a copy, has been handed me by him., It would be dangerous for me now to begin construing and making specific applications of the proclamation., It is obvious to all that I therein intended to give time and opportunity., Also, it is seen I left myself at liberty to exempt parts of States., Without saying more, I shall be very glad if any Congressional district will, in good faith, do as your despatch contemplates., Could you give me the facts which prompted you to telegraph?, Yours of yesterday received., Most certainly I intend no injustice to any, and if I have done any I deeply regret it., To be told, after more than five weeks' total inaction of the army, and during which period we have sent to the army every fresh horse we possibly could, amounting in the whole to 7918, that the cavalry horses were too much fatigued to move, presents a very cheerless, almost hopeless, prospect for the future, and it may have forced something of impatience in my despatch., If not recruited and rested then, when could they ever be?, I suppose the river is rising, and I am glad to believe you are crossing., Your despatch of 3 P.M. to-day, in regard to filling up old regiments with drafted men, is received, and the request therein shall be complied with as far as practicable., And now I ask a distinct answer to the question, Is it your purpose not to go into action again until the men now being drafted in the States are incorporated into the old regiments?, Your despatches of night before last, yesterday, and last night all received., I am much pleased with the movement of the army., When you get entirely across the river let me know., What do you know of the enemy?, By some means I have not seen your despatch of the 27th about order No.154 until this moment., I now learn, what I knew nothing of before, that the history of the order is as follows:  When General McClellan telegraphed asking General Halleck to have the order made, General Halleck went to the Secretary of War with it, stating his approval of the plan., The Secretary assented and General Halleck wrote the order., It was a military question, which the Secretary supposed the General understood better than he., I wish I could see Governor Curtin., Yours of the 29th received., I shall take it to General Halleck, but I already know it will be inconvenient to take General Morgan's command from where it now is., I am glad to hear you speak hopefully of Tennessee., I sincerely hope Rosecrans may find it possible to do something for her., David Nelson, son of the M. C. of your State, regrets his father's final defection, and asks me for a situation., Do you know him?, Could he be of service to you or to Tennessee in any capacity in which I could send him?, Captain Derrickson, with his company, has been for some time keeping guard at my residence, now at the Soldiers' Retreat., He and his company are very agreeable to me, and while it is deemed proper for any guard to remain, none would be more satisfactory than Captain Derrickson and his company., By direction of the President, it is ordered that Major-General McClellan be relieved from the command of the Army of the Potomac, and that Major-General Burnside take the command of that army., Also that Major-General Hunter take command of the corps in said army which is now commanded by General Burnside., That Major-General Fitz., John Porter be relieved from command of the corps he now commands in said army, and that Major-General Hooker take command of said corps., The general-in-chief is authorized, in [his] discretion, to issue an order substantially as the above forthwith, or so soon as he may deem proper., You are re-elected., I wish to see you at once will you come?, Please answer., Yours of yesterday received., Governor Johnson, Mr. Ethridge, and others are looking after the very thing you telegraphed about., Your despatch giving the names of 300 Indians condemned to death is received., Please forward as soon as possible the full and complete record of their convictions; and if the record does not fully indicate the more guilty and influential of the culprits, please have a careful statement made on these points and forwarded to me., Send all by mail., This will introduce Major-General Banks., He is in command of a considerable land force for operating in the South, and I shall be glad for you to co-Operate with him and give him such assistance as you can consistently with your orders from the Navy Department., Ordered, First: that clearances issued by the Treasury Department for vessels or merchandise bound for the port of Norfolk, for the military necessities of the department, certified by the military commandant at Fort Monroe, shall be allowed to enter said port., Second: that vessels and domestic produce from Norfolk, permitted by the military commandant at Fort Monroe for the military purposes of his command, shall on his permit be allowed to pass from said port to their destination in any port not blockaded by the United States., Ordered, by the President of the United States, That the Attorney-General be charged with the superintendence and direction of all proceedings to be had under the act of Congress of the 17th of July, 1862, entitled ""An act to suppress insurrection, to punish treason and rebellion, to seize and confiscate the property of rebels, and for other purposes,"" in so far as may concern the seizure, prosecution, and condemnation of the estate, property, and effects of rebels and traitors, as mentioned and provided for in the fifth, sixth, and seventh sections of the said act of Congress., And the Attorney-General is authorized and required to give to the attorneys and marshals of the United States such instructions and directions as he may find needful and convenient touching all such seizures, prosecutions, and condemnations, and, moreover, to authorize all such attorneys and marshals, whenever there may be reasonable ground to fear any forcible resistance to them in the discharge of their respective duties in this behalf, to call upon any military officer in command of the forces of the United States to give to them such aid, protection, and support as may be necessary to enable them safely and efficiently to discharge their respective duties; and all such commanding officers are required promptly to obey such call, and to render the necessary service as far as may be in their power consistently with their other duties., Your despatch of the 4th, about returning troops from western Virginia to Tennessee, is just received, and I have been to General Halleck with it., He says an order has already been made by which those troops have already moved, or soon will move, to Tennessee., The President, Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy, desires and enjoins the orderly observance of the Sabbath by the officers and men in the military and naval service., The importance for man and beast of the prescribed weekly rest, the sacred rights of Christian soldiers and sailors, a becoming deference to the best sentiment of a Christian people, and a due regard for the divine will demand that Sunday labor in the army and navy be reduced to the measure of strict necessity., The discipline and character of the national forces should not suffer nor the cause they defend be imperilled by the profanation of the day or name of the Most High., ""At this time of public distress,"" adopting the words of Washington in 1776, ""men may find enough to do in the service of God and their country without abandoning themselves to vice and immorality."", The first general order issued by the Father of his Country after the Declaration of Independence indicates the spirit in which our institutions were founded and should ever be defended:  ""The General hopes and trusts that every officer and man will endeavor to live and act as becomes a Christian soldier defending the dearest rights and liberties of his country."", Your brother says you are solicitous to be ordered to join General McLernand., I suppose you are ordered to Helena; this means that you are to form part of McLernand's expedition as it moves down the river; and General McLernand is so informed., I will see General Halleck as to whether the additional force you mention can go with you., Please give me your best opinion as to the number of the enemy now at Richmond and also at Petersburg., Dr. Kennedy, bearer of this, has some apprehension that Federal officers not citizens of Louisiana may be set up as candidates for Congress in that State., In my view there could be no possible object in such an election., We do not particularly need members of Congress from there to enable us to get along with legislation here., What we do want is the conclusive evidence that respectable citizens of Louisiana are willing to be members of Congress and to swear support to the Constitution, and that other respectable citizens there are willing to vote for them and send them., To send a parcel of Northern men here as representatives, elected, as would be understood (and perhaps really so), at the point of the bayonet, would be disgusting and outrageous; and were I a member of Congress here, I would vote against admitting any such man to a seat., Ordered, That no arms, ammunition, or munitions of war be cleared or allowed to be exported from the United States until further orders., That any clearance for arms, ammunition, or munitions of war issued heretofore by the Treasury Department be vacated, if the articles have not passed without the United States, and the articles stopped., That the Secretary of War hold possession of the arms, etc., recently seized by his order at Rouse's Point, bound for Canada., Early last week you left me in high hope with your assurance that you would be off with your expedition at the end of that week, or early in this., It is now the end of this, and I have just been overwhelmed and confounded with the sight of a requisition made by you which, I am assured, cannot be filled and got off within an hour short of two months., I enclose you a copy of the requisition, in some hope that it is not genuine--that you have never seen it., My dear General, this expanding and piling up of impedimenta has been, so far, almost our ruin, and will be our final ruin if it is not abandoned., If you had the articles of this requisition upon the wharf, with the necessary animals to make them of any use, and forage for the animals, you could not get vessels together in two weeks to carry the whole, to say nothing of your twenty thousand men; and, having the vessels, you could not put the cargoes aboard in two weeks more., And, after all, where you are going you have no use for them., When you parted with me you had no such ideas in your mind., I know you had not, or you could not have expected to be off so soon as you said., You must get back to something like the plan you had then, or your expedition is a failure before you start., You must be off before Congress meets., You would be better off anywhere, and especially where you are going, for not having a thousand wagons doing nothing but hauling forage to feed the animals that draw them, and taking at least two thousand men to care for the wagons and animals, who otherwise might be two thousand good soldiers., Now, dear General, do not think this is an ill-natured letter; it is the very reverse., The simple publication of this requisition would ruin you., I have just received and read your letter of the 20th., The purport of it is that we lost the late elections and the administration is failing because the war is unsuccessful, and that I must not flatter myself that I am not justly to blame for it., I certainly know that if the war fails the administration fails, and that I will be blamed for it, whether I deserve it or not., ...]",3
278,"[The Territories of the United States, with unimportant exceptions, have remained undisturbed by the civil war; and they are exhibiting such evidence of prosperity as justifies an expectation that some of them will soon be in a condition to be organized as States and be constitutionally admitted into the Federal Union., The immense mineral resources of some of those Territories ought to be developed as rapidly as possible., Every step in that direction would have a tendency to improve the revenues of the government and diminish the burdens of the people., It is worthy of your serious consideration whether some extraordinary measures to promote that end cannot be adopted., The means which suggests itself as most likely to be effective is a scientific exploration of the mineral regions in those Territories with a view to the publication of its results at home and in foreign countries--results which cannot fail to be auspicious., The condition of the finances win claim your most diligent consideration., The vast expenditures incident to the military and naval operations required for the suppression of the rebellion have hitherto been met with a promptitude and certainty unusual in similar circumstances, and the public credit has been fully maintained., The continuance of the war, however, and the increased disbursements made necessary by the augmented forces now in the field demand your best reflections as to the best modes of providing the necessary revenue without injury to business and with the least possible burdens upon labor., The suspension of specie payments by the banks soon after the commencement of your last session made large issues of United States notes unavoidable., In no other way could the payment of troops and the satisfaction of other just demands be so economically or so well provided for., The judicious legislation of Congress, securing the receivability of these notes for loans and internal duties and making them a legal tender for other debts, has made them an universal currency, and has satisfied, partially at least, and for the time, the long-felt want of an uniform circulating medium, saving thereby to the people immense sums in discounts and exchanges., A return to specie payments, however, at the earliest period compatible with due regard to all interests concerned should ever be kept in view., Fluctuations in the value of currency are always injurious, and to reduce these fluctuations to the lowest possible point will always be a leading purpose in wise legislation., Convertibility, prompt and certain convertibility, into coin is generally acknowledged to be the best and surest safeguard against them; and it is extremely doubtful whether a circulation of United States notes payable in coin and sufficiently large for the wants of the people can be permanently, usefully, and safely maintained., Is there, then, any other mode in which the necessary provision for the public wants can be made and the great advantages of a safe and uniform currency secured?, I know of none which promises so certain results and is at the same time so unobjectionable as the organization of banking associations, under a general act of Congress, well guarded in its provisions., To such associations the government might furnish circulating notes, on the security of United States bonds deposited in the treasury., These notes, prepared under the supervision of proper officers, being uniform in appearance and security and convertible always into coin, would at once protect labor against the evils of a vicious currency and facilitate commerce by cheap and safe exchanges., A moderate reservation from the interest on the bonds would compensate the United States for the preparation and distribution of the notes and a general supervision of the system, and would lighten the burden of that part of the public debt employed as securities., The public credit, moreover, would be greatly improved and the negotiation of new loans greatly facilitated by the steady market demand for government bonds which the adoption of the proposed system would create., It is an additional recommendation of the measure, of considerable weight, in my judgment, that it would reconcile as far as possible all existing interests by the opportunity offered to existing institutions to reorganize under the act, substituting only the secured uniform national circulation for the local and various circulation, secured and unsecured, now issued by them., The receipts into the treasury from all sources, including loans and balance from the preceding year, for the fiscal year ending on the 30th June, 1862, were $583,885,247.06, of which sum $49,056,397.62 were derived from customs; $1,795,331.73 from the direct tax; from public lands, $152,203.77; from miscellaneous sources, $931,787.64; from loans in all forms, $529,692,460.50., The remainder, $2,257,065.80, was the balance from last year., The disbursements during the same period were: For congressional, executive, and judicial purposes, $5,939,009.29; for foreign intercourse, $1,339,710.35; for miscellaneous expenses, including the mints, loans, post-office deficiencies, collection of revenue, and other like charges, $14,129,771.50; for expenses under the Interior Department, $3,102,985.52; under the War Department, $394,368,407.36; under the Navy Department, $42,674,569.69; for interest on public debt, $13,190,324.45; and for payment of public debt, including reimbursement of temporary loan and redemptions, $96,096,922.09; making an aggregate of $570,841,700.25, and leaving a balance in the treasury on the 1st day of July, 1862, of $13,043,546.81., It should be observed that the sum of $96,096,922.09, expended for reimbursements and redemption of public debt, being included also in the loans made, may be properly deducted both from receipts and expenditures, leaving the actual receipts for the year $487,788,324.97, and the expenditures $474,744,778.16., Other information on the subject of the finances will be found in the report of the Secretary of the Treasury, to whose statements and views I invite your most candid and considerate attention., The reports of the Secretaries of War and of the Navy are herewith transmitted., These reports, though lengthy, are scarcely more than brief abstracts of the very numerous and extensive transactions and operations conducted through those departments., Nor could I give a summary of them here upon any principle which would admit of its being much shorter than the reports themselves., I therefore content myself with laying the reports before you and asking your attention to them., It gives me pleasure to report a decided improvement in the financial condition of the Post-Office Department as compared with several preceding years., The receipts for the fiscal year 1861 amounted to $8,349,296.40, which embraced the revenue from all the States of the Union for three quarters of that year., Notwithstanding the cessation of revenue from the so-called seceded States during the last fiscal year, the increase of the correspondence of the loyal States has been sufficient to produce a revenue during the same year of $8,299,820.90, being only $50,000 less than was derived from all the States of the Union during the previous year., The expenditures show a still more favorable result., The amount expended in 1861 was $13,606,759.11., For the last year the amount has been reduced to $11,125,364.13, showing a decrease of about $2,481,000 in the expenditures as compared with the preceding year, and about $3,750,000 as compared with the fiscal year 1860., The deficiency in the department for the previous year was $4,551,966.98., For the last fiscal year it was reduced to $2,112,814.57., These favorable results are in part owing to the cessation of mail service in the insurrectionary States and in part to a careful review of all expenditures in that department in the interest of economy., The efficiency of the postal service, it is believed, has also been much improved., The Postmaster-General has also opened a correspondence through the Department of State with foreign governments proposing a convention of postal representatives for the purpose of simplifying the rates of foreign postage and to expedite the foreign mails., This proposition, equally important to our adopted citizens and to the commercial interests of this country, has been favorably entertained and agreed to by all the governments from whom replies have been received., I ask the attention of Congress to the suggestions of the Postmaster-General in his report respecting the further legislation required, in his opinion, for the benefit of the postal service., The discrepancy between the sum here stated as arising from the sales of the public lands and the sum derived from the same source as reported from the Treasury Department arises, as I understand, from the fact that the periods of time, though apparently were not really coincident at the beginning point, the Treasury report including a considerable sum now which had previously been reported from the Interior, sufficiently large to greatly overreach the sum derived from the three months now reported upon by the Interior and not by the Treasury., The Indian tribes upon our frontiers have during the past year manifested a spirit of insubordination, and at several points have engaged in open hostilities against the white settlements in their vicinity., The tribes occupying the Indian country south of Kansas renounced their allegiance to the United States and entered into treaties with the insurgents., Those who remained loyal to the United States were driven from the country., The chief of the Cherokees has visited this city for the purpose of restoring the former relations of the tribe with the United States., He alleges that they were constrained by superior force to enter into treaties with the insurgents, and that the United States neglected to furnish the protection which their treaty stipulations required., In the month of August last the Sioux Indians in Minnesota attacked the settlements in their vicinity with extreme ferocity, killing indiscriminately men, women, and children., This attack was wholly unexpected, and therefore no means of defense had been provided., It is estimated that not less than 800 persons were killed by the Indians, and a large amount of property was destroyed., How this outbreak was induced is not definitely known, and suspicions, which may be unjust, need not to be stated., Information was received by the Indian Bureau from different sources about the time hostilities were commenced that a simultaneous attack was to be made upon white settlements by all the tribes between the Mississippi River and the Rocky Mountains., The State of Minnesota has suffered great injury from this Indian war., A large portion of her territory has been depopulated, and a severe loss has been sustained by the destruction of property., The people of that State manifest much anxiety for the removal of the tribes beyond the limits of the State as a guaranty against future hostilities., The Commissioner of Indian Affairs will furnish full details., I submit for your especial consideration whether our Indian system shall not be remodeled., Many wise and good men have impressed me with the belief that this can be profitably done., I submit a statement of the proceedings of commissioners, which shows the progress that has been made in the enterprise of constructing the Pacific Railroad., And this suggests the earliest completion of this road, and also the favorable action of Congress upon the projects now pending before them for enlarging the capacities of the great canals in New York and Illinois, as being of vital and rapidly increasing importance to the whole nation, and especially to the vast interior region hereinafter to be noticed at some greater length., I purpose having prepared and laid before you at an early day some interesting and valuable statistical information upon this subject., The military and commercial importance of enlarging the Illinois and Michigan Canal and improving the Illinois River is presented in the report of Colonel Webster to the Secretary of War, and now transmitted to Congress., I respectfully ask attention to it., To carry out the provisions of the act of Congress of the 15th of May last, I have caused the Department of Agriculture of the United States to be organized., The Commissioner informs me that within the period of a few months this department has established an extensive system of correspondence and exchanges, both at home and abroad, which promises to effect highly beneficial results in the development of a correct knowledge of recent improvements in agriculture, in the introduction of new products, and in the collection of the agricultural statistics of the different States., Also, that it will soon be prepared to distribute largely seeds, cereals, plants, and cuttings, and has already published and liberally diffused much valuable information in anticipation of a more elaborate report, which will in due time be furnished, embracing some valuable tests in chemical science now in progress in the laboratory., The creation of this department was for the more immediate benefit of a large class of our most valuable citizens, and I trust that the liberal basis upon which it has been organized will not only meet your approbation, but that it will realize at no distant day all the fondest anticipations of its most sanguine friends and become the fruitful source of advantage to all our people., On the 22d day of September last a proclamation was issued by the Executive, a copy of which is herewith submitted., In accordance with the purpose expressed in the second paragraph of that paper, I now respectfully recall your attention to what may be called ""compensated emancipation."", A nation may be said to consist of its territory, its people, and its laws., The territory is the only part which is of certain durability., It is of the first importance to duly consider and estimate this ever enduring part., That portion of the earth's surface which is owned and inhabited by the people of the United States is well adapted to be the home of one national family, and it is not well adapted for two or more., Its vast extent and its variety of climate and productions are of advantage in this age for one people, whatever they might have been in former ages., Steam, telegraphs, and intelligence have brought these to be an advantageous combination for one united people., In the inaugural address I briefly pointed out the total inadequacy of disunion as a remedy for the differences between the people of the two sections., I did so in language which I cannot improve, and which, therefore, I beg to repeat:  ""One section of our country believes slavery is right and ought to be extended, while the other believes it is wrong and ought not to be extended., This is the only substantial dispute., The fugitive-slave clause of the Constitution and the laws for the suppression of the foreign slave trade are each as well enforced, perhaps, as any law can ever be in a community where the moral Sense of the people imperfectly supports the law itself., The great body of the people abide by the dry legal obligation in both cases, and a few break over in each., This, I think, cannot be perfectly cured, and it would be worse in both cases after the separation of the sections than before., The foreign slave trade, now imperfectly suppressed, would be ultimately revived without restriction in one section, while fugitive slaves, now only partially surrendered, would not be surrendered at all by the other., ""Physically speaking, we can not separate., We can not remove our respective sections from each other nor build an impassable wall between them., A husband and wife may be divorced and go out of the presence and beyond the reach of each other, but the different parts of our country cannot do this., They cannot but remain face to face, and intercourse, either amicable or hostile, must continue between them., Is it possible, then, to make that intercourse more advantageous or more satisfactory after separation than before?, Can aliens make treaties easier than friends can make laws?, Can treaties be more faithfully enforced between aliens than laws can among friends?, Suppose you go to war, you cannot fight always; and when, after much loss on both sides and no gain on either, you cease fighting, the identical old questions, as to terms of intercourse, are again upon you."", There is no line, straight or crooked, suitable for a national boundary upon which to divide., Trace through, from east to west, upon the line between the free and slave country, and we shall find a little more than one third of its length are rivers, easy to be crossed, and populated, or soon to be populated, thickly upon both sides; while nearly all its remaining length are merely surveyors' lines, over which people may walk back and forth without any consciousness of their presence., No part of this line can be made any more difficult to pass by writing it down on paper or parchment as a national boundary., The fact of separation, if it comes, gives up on the part of the seceding section the fugitive-slave clause along with all other constitutional obligations upon the section seceded from, while I should expect no treaty stipulation would ever be made to take its place., But there is another difficulty., The great interior region bounded east by the Alleghenies, north by the British dominions, west by the Rocky Mountains, and south by the line along which the culture of corn and cotton meets, and which includes part of Virginia, part of Tennessee, all of Kentucky, Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, Wisconsin, Illinois, Missouri, Kansas, Iowa, Minnesota, and the Territories of Dakota, Nebraska, and part of Colorado, already has above 10,000,000 people, and will have 50,000,000 within fifty years if not prevented by any political folly or mistake., It contains more than one third of the country owned by the United States--certainly more than 1,000,000 square miles., Once half as populous as Massachusetts already is, it would have more than 75,000,000 people., ...]",3
279,"[As to when this may be, we can judge by the past and the present; as to when it will be, if ever, depends much on whether we maintain the Union These figures show that our country may be as populous as Europe now is at some point between 1920 and 1930, say about 1925--our territory, at 73 persons to the square mile, being of capacity to contain 217,186,000., And we will reach this, too, if we do not ourselves relinquish the chance by the folly and evils of disunion or by long and exhausting war springing from the only great element of national discord among us., While it cannot be foreseen exactly how much one huge example of secession, breeding lesser ones indefinitely, would retard population, civilization, and prosperity, no one can doubt that the extent of it would be very great and injurious., The proposed emancipation would shorten the war, perpetuate peace, insure this increase of population, and proportionately the wealth of the country., With these we should pay all the emancipation would cost, together with our other debt, easier than we should pay our other debt without it., If we had allowed our old national debt to run at six per cent., per annum, simple interest, from the end of our revolutionary struggle until to-day, without paying anything on either principal or interest, each man of us would owe less upon that debt now than each man owed upon it then; and this because our increase of men through the whole period has been greater than six per cent.--has run faster than the interest upon the debt., Thus time alone relieves a debtor nation, so long as its population increases faster than unpaid interest accumulates on its debt., This fact would be no excuse for delaying payment of what is justly due, but it shows the great importance of time in this connection--the great advantage of a policy by which we shall not have to pay until we number 100,000,000 what by a different policy we would have to pay now, when we number but 31,000,000., In a word, it shows that a dollar will be much harder to pay for the war than will be a dollar for emancipation on the proposed plan., And then the latter will cost no blood, no precious life., It will be a saving of both., As to the second article, I think it would be impracticable to return to bondage the class of persons therein contemplated., Some of them, doubtless, in the property sense belong to loyal owners, and hence Provision is made in this article for compensating such., The third article relates to the future of the freed people., It does not oblige, but merely authorizes Congress to aid in colonizing such as may consent., This ought nut to be regarded as objectionable on the one hand or on the other, insomuch as it comes to nothing unless by the mutual consent of the people to be deported and the American voters through their representatives in Congress., I cannot make it better known than it already is that I strongly favor colonization; and yet I wish to say there is an objection urged against free colored persons remaining in the country which is largely imaginary, if not sometimes malicious., It is insisted that their presence would injure and displace white labor and white laborers., If there ever could be a proper time for mere catch arguments that time surely is not now., In times like the present men should utter nothing for which they would not willingly be responsible through time and in eternity., Is it true, then, that colored people can displace any more white labor by being free than by remaining slaves?, If they stay in their old places, they jostle no white laborers; if they leave their old places, they leave them open to white laborers., Logically, there is neither more nor less of it., Emancipation, even without deportation, would probably enhance the wages of white labor, and very surely would not reduce them., Thus the customary amount of labor would still have to be performed., The freed people would surely not do more than their old proportion of it, and very probably for a time would do less, leaving an increased part to white laborers, bringing their labor into greater demand, and consequently enhancing the wages of it., With deportation, even to a limited extent, enhanced wages to white labor is mathematically certain., Labor is like any other commodity in the market-increase the demand for it and you increase the price of it., Reduce the supply of black labor by colonizing the black laborer out of the country, and by precisely so much you increase the demand for and wages of white labor., But it is dreaded that the freed people will swarm forth and cover the whole land., Are they not already in the land?, Will liberation make them any more numerous?, Equally distributed among the whites of the whole country, and there would be but one colored to seven whites., Could the one in any way greatly disturb the seven?, There are many communities now having more than one free colored person to seven whites, and this without any apparent consciousness of evil from it., The District of Columbia and the States of Maryland and Delaware are all in this condition., The District has more than one free colored to six whites, and yet in its frequent petitions to Congress I believe it has never presented the presence of free colored persons as one of its grievances., But why should emancipation South send the free people North?, People of any color seldom run unless there be something to run from., Heretofore colored people to some extent have fled North from bondage, and now, perhaps, from both bondage and destitution., But if gradual emancipation and deportation be adopted, they will have neither to flee from., Their old masters will give them wages at least until new laborers can be procured, and the freedmen in turn will gladly give their labor for the wages till new homes can be found for them in congenial climes and with people of their own blood and race., This proposition can be trusted on the mutual interests involved., And in any event, cannot the North decide for itself whether to receive them?, Again, as practice proves more than theory in any case, has there been any irruption of colored people northward because of the abolishment of slavery in this District last spring?, What I have said of the proportion of free colored persons to the whites in the District is from the census of 1860, having no reference to persons called contrabands nor to those made free by the act of Congress abolishing slavery here., The plan consisting of these articles is recommended, not but that a restoration of the national authority would be accepted without its adoption., Nor will the war nor proceedings under the proclamation of September 22, 1862, be stayed because of the recommendation of this plan., Its timely adoption, I doubt not, would bring restoration, and thereby stay both., And notwithstanding this plan, the recommendation that Congress provide by law for compensating any State which may adopt emancipation before this plan shall have been acted upon is hereby earnestly renewed., Such would be only an advance part of the plan, and the same arguments apply to both., This plan is recommended as a means, not in exclusion of, but additional to, all others for restoring and preserving the national authority throughout the Union., The subject is presented exclusively in its economical aspect., The plan would, I am confident, secure peace more speedily and maintain it more permanently than can be done by force alone, while all it would cost, considering amounts and manner of payment and times of payment, would be easier paid than will be the additional cost of the war if we rely solely upon force., It is much, very much, that it would cost no blood at all., The plan is proposed as permanent constitutional law., It cannot become such without the concurrence of, first, two thirds of Congress, and afterwards three fourths of the States., The requisite three fourths of the States will necessarily include seven of the slave States., Their concurrence, if obtained, will give assurance of their severally adopting emancipation at no very distant day upon the new constitutional terms., This assurance would end the struggle now and save the Union forever., I do not forget the gravity which should characterize a paper addressed to the Congress of the nation by the chief magistrate of the nation, nor do I forget that some of you are my seniors, nor that many of you have more experience than I in the conduct of public affairs., Yet I trust that in view of the great responsibility resting upon me you will perceive no want of respect to yourselves in any undue earnestness I may seem to display., Is it doubted, then, that the plan I propose, if adopted, would shorten the war, and thus lessen its expenditure of money and of blood?, Is it doubted that it would restore the national authority and national prosperity and perpetuate both indefinitely?, Is it doubted that we here--Congress and executive--can secure its adoption?, Will not the good people respond to a united and earnest appeal from us?, Can we, can they, by any other means so certainly or so speedily assure these vital objects?, We can succeed only by concert., It is not ""Can any of us imagine better?"", but ""Can we all do better?"", Object whatsoever is possible, still the question recurs, ""Can we do better?"", The dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present., The occasion is piled high with difficulty, and we must rise with the occasion., As our case is new, so we must think anew and act anew., We must disenthrall ourselves, and then we shall save our country., Fellow-citizens, we can not escape history., We of this Congress and this administration will be remembered in spite of ourselves., No personal significance or insignificance can spare one or another of us., The fiery trial through which we pass will light us down in honor or dishonor to the latest generation., We say we are for the Union., The world will not forget that we say this., We know how to save the Union., The world knows we do know how to save it., We, even we here, hold the power and bear the responsibility., In giving freedom to the slave we assure freedom to the free--honorable alike in what we give and what we preserve., We shall nobly save or meanly lose the last, best hope of earth., Other means may succeed; this could not fail., The way is plain, peaceful, generous, just--a way which if followed the world will forever applaud and God must forever bless., On the 3d of November, 1861, a collision took place off the coast of Cuba between the United States war steamer San Jacinto and the French brig Jules et Marie, resulting in serious damage to the latter., The obligation of this Government to make amends therefor could not be questioned if the injury resulted from any fault On the part of the San Jacinto., With a view to ascertain this, the subject was referred to a commission of the United States and French naval officers at New York, with a naval officer of Italy as an arbiter., The conclusion arrived at was that the collision was occasioned by the failure of the San Jacinto seasonably to reverse her engine., It then became necessary to ascertain the amount of indemnification due to the injured party., The United States consul-general at Havana was consequently instructed to confer with the consul of France on this point, and they have determined that the sum of $9,500 is an equitable allowance under the circumstances., I recommend an appropriation of this sum for the benefit of the owners of the Jules et Marie., A copy of the letter of Mr. Shufeldt, the consul-general of the United States at Havana, to the Secretary of State on the subject is herewith transmitted., Yours of November 25 reached me only yesterday., Thank you for it., I shall consider and remember your suggestions., ...]",3
280,"[Is not this so?, And yet it is a mistake., You are sure to be happy again., To know this, which is certainly true, will make you some less miserable now., I have had experience enough to know what I say, and you need only to believe it to feel better at once., The memory of your dear father, instead of an agony, will yet be a sad, sweet feeling in your heart, of a purer and holier sort than you have known before., Please present my kind regards to your afflicted mother., Two Ohio regiments and one Illinois regiment which were captured at Hartsville have been paroled and are now at Columbus, Ohio., This brings the Ohio regiments substantially to their homes., I am strongly impressed with the belief that the Illinois regiment better be sent to Illinois, where it will be recruited and put in good condition by the time they are exchanged so as to re-enter the service., They did not misbehave, as I am satisfied, so that they should receive no treatment nor have anything withheld from them by way of punishment., Let the order in regard to Dr. McPheeters and family be suspended until you hear from me., I do not wish to leave the country north of the Missouri to the care of the enrolled militia except upon the concurrent judgment of yourself and General Curtis., His I have not yet obtained., Confer with him, and I shall be glad to act when you and he agree., I have good reason for saying you must not make a general movement of the army without letting me know., I hear not a word about the Congressional election of which you and I corresponded., Time clearly up., The proclamation cannot be telegraphed to you until during the day to-morrow., Whereas on the 22d day of September, A.D. 1862, a proclamation was issued by the President of the United States, containing, among other things, the following, to wit:  ""That on the 1st day of January, A.D., 1863, all persons held as slaves within any State or designated part of a State the people whereof shall then be in rebellion against the United States shall be then, thenceforward, and forever free; and the executive government of the United States, including the military and naval authority thereof, will recognize and maintain the freedom of such persons and will do no act or acts to repress such persons, or any of them, in any efforts they may make for their actual freedom., ""That the executive will on the 1st day of January aforesaid, by proclamation, designate the States and parts of States, if any, in which the people thereof, respectively, shall then be in rebellion against the United States; and the fact that any State or the people thereof shall on that day be in good faith represented in the Congress of the United States by members chosen thereto at elections wherein a majority of the qualified voters of such States shall have participated shall, in the absence of strong countervailing testimony, be deemed conclusive evidence that such State and the people thereof are not then in rebellion against the United States."", Now, therefore, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States, by virtue of the power in me vested as Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States in time of actual armed rebellion against the authority and government of the United States, and as a fit and necessary war measure for suppressing said rebellion, do, on this 1st day of January, A. D. 1863, and in accordance with my purpose so to do, publicly proclaimed for the full period of one hundred days from the first day above mentioned, order and designate as the States and parts of States wherein the people thereof, respectively, are this day in rebellion against the United States the following, to wit:  Arkansas, Texas, Louisiana (except the parishes of St. Bernard, Plaquemines, Jefferson, St. John, St. Charles, St. James, Ascension, Assumption, Terre Bonne, Lafourche, St. Mary, St. Martin, and Orleans, including the city of New Orleans), Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, and Virginia (except the forty-eight counties designated as West Virginia, and also the counties of Berkeley, Accomac, Northampton, Elizabeth City, York, Princess Anne, and Norfolk, including the cities of Norfolk and Portsmouth), and which excepted parts are for the present left precisely as if this proclamation were not issued., And by virtue of the power and for the purpose aforesaid, I do order and declare that all persons held as slaves within said designated States and parts of States are, and henceforward shall be, free; and that the Executive Government of the United States, including the military and naval authorities thereof, will recognize and maintain the freedom of said persons., And I hereby enjoin upon the people so declared to be free to abstain from all violence, unless in necessary self-defense; and I recommend to them that, in all cases when allowed, they labor faithfully for reasonable wages., And I further declare and make known that such persons of suitable condition will be received into the armed service of the United States to garrison forts, positions, stations, and other places, and to man vessels of all sorts in said service., And upon this act, sincerely believed to be an act of justice, warranted by the Constitution upon military necessity, I invoke the considerate judgment of mankind and the gracious favor of Almighty God., In witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed., Done at the city of Washington, this first day of January, A.D. 1863, and of the independence of the United States of America the eighty-seventh., General Burnside wishes to cross the Rappahannock with his army, but his grand division commanders all oppose the movement., If in such a difficulty as this you do not help, you fail me precisely in the point for which I sought your assistance You know what General Burnside's plan is, and it is my wish that you go with him to the ground, examine it as far as practicable, confer with the officers, getting their judgment, and ascertaining their temper--in a word, gather all the elements for forming a judgment of your own, and then tell General Burnside that you do approve or that you do not approve his plan., Your military skill is useless to me if you will not do this., I submit to Congress the expediency of extending to other departments of the government the authority conferred on the President by the eighth section of the act of the 8th of May, 1792, to appoint a person to temporarily discharge the duties of Secretary of State, Secretary of the Treasury, and Secretary of War, in case of the death, absence from the seat of government, or sickness of either of those officers., Yours of December 29 by the hand of Mr. Strong is just received., The day I telegraphed you suspending the order in relation to Dr. McPheeters, he, with Mr. Bates, the Attorney-General, appeared before me and left with me a copy of the order mentioned., The doctor also showed me the Copy of an oath which he said he had taken, which is indeed very strong and specific., He also verbally assured me that he had constantly prayed in church for the President and government, as he had always done before the present war., In looking over the recitals in your order, I do not see that this matter of the prayer, as he states it, is negatived, nor that any violation of his oath is charged nor, in fact, that anything specific is alleged against him., The charges are all general: that he has a rebel wife and rebel relations, that he sympathies with rebels, and that he exercises rebel influence., Now, after talking with him, I tell you frankly I believe he does sympathize with the rebels, but the question remains whether such a man, of unquestioned good moral character, who has taken such an oath as he has, and cannot even be charged with violating it, and who can be charged with no other specific act or omission, can, with safety to the government, be exiled upon the suspicion of his secret sympathies., But I agree that this must be left to you, who are on the spot; and if, after all, you think the public good requires his removal, my suspension of the order is withdrawn, only with this qualification, that the time during the suspension is not to be counted against him., I have promised him this., But I must add that the United States Government must not, as by this order, undertake to run the churches., When an individual in a church or out of it becomes dangerous to the public interest, he must be checked; but let the churches, as such, take care of themselves., It will not do for the United States to appoint trustees, supervisors, or other agents for the churches., The committee composed of Messrs. Yeatman and Filley (Mr. Broadhead not attending) has presented your letter and the memorial of sundry citizens., On the whole subject embraced exercise your best judgment, with a sole view to the public interest, and I will not interfere without hearing you., As many persons who come well recommended for loyalty and service to the Union cause, and who are refugees from rebel oppression in the State of Virginia, make application to me for authority and permission to remove their families and property to protection within the Union lines, by means of our armed gunboats on the Potomac River and Chesapeake Bay, you are hereby requested to hear and consider all such applications, and to grant such assistance to this class of persons as in your judgment their merits may render proper, and as may in each case be consistent with the perfect and complete efficiency of the naval service and with military expediency., I am having a good deal of trouble with Missouri matters, and I now sit down to write you particularly about it., One class of friends believe in greater severity and another in greater leniency in regard to arrests, banishments, and assessments., As usual in such cases, each questions the other's motives., On the one hand, it is insisted that Governor Gamble's unionism, at most, is not better than a secondary spring of action; that hunkerism and a wish for political influence stand before Unionism with him., On the other hand, it is urged that arrests, banishments, and assessments are made more for private malice, revenge, and pecuniary interest than for the public good., This morning I was told, by a gentleman who I have no doubt believes what he says, that in one case of assessments for $10,000 the different persons who paid compared receipts, and found they had paid $30,000., If this be true, the inference is that the collecting agents pocketed the odd $20,000., And true or not in the instance, nothing but the sternest necessity can justify the making and maintaining of a system so liable to such abuses., Doubtless the necessity for the making of the system in Missouri did exist, and whether it continues for the maintenance of it is now a practical and very important question., Some days ago Governor Gamble telegraphed me, asking that the assessments outside of St. Louis County might be suspended, as they already have been within it, and this morning all the members of Congress here from Missouri but one laid a paper before me asking the same thing., Now, my belief is that Governor Gamble is an honest and true man, not less so than yourself; that you and he could confer together on this and other Missouri questions with great advantage to the public; that each knows something which the other does not; and that acting together you could about double your stock of pertinent information., May I not hope that you and he will attempt this?, I could at once safely do (or you could safely do without me) whatever you and he agree upon., There is absolutely no reason why you should not agree., I forgot to say that Hon., James S. Rollins, member of Congress from one of the Missouri districts, wishes that, upon his personal responsibility, Rev., John M. Robinson, of Columbia, Missouri; James L. Matthews, of Boone County, Missouri; and James L. Stephens, also of Boone County, Missouri, may be allowed to return to their respective homes., Major Rollins leaves with me very strong papers from the neighbors of these men, whom he says he knows to be true men., He also says he has many constituents who he thinks are rightly exiled, but that he thinks these three should be allowed to return., Please look into the case, and oblige Major Rollins if you consistently can., The Honorable Senator Harlan has just placed in my hands your letter of the 27th of December, which I have read with pleasure and gratitude., It is most cheering and encouraging for me to know that in the efforts which I have made and am making for the restoration of a righteous peace to our country, I am upheld and sustained by the good wishes and prayers of God's people., No one is more deeply than myself aware that without His favor our highest wisdom is but as foolishness and that our most strenuous efforts would avail nothing in the shadow of His displeasure., I am conscious of no desire for my country's welfare that is not in consonance with His will, and of no plan upon which we may not ask His blessing., It seems to me that if there be one subject upon which all good men may unitedly agree, it is imploring the gracious favor of the God of Nations upon the struggles our people are making for the preservation of their precious birthright of civil and religious liberty., Your despatch announcing retreat of enemy has just reached here., God bless you and all with you!, Please tender to all, and accept for yourself, the nation's gratitude for your and their skill, endurance, and dauntless courage., Do Richmond papers of 6th say nothing about Vicksburg, or if anything, what?, What think you of forming a reserve cavalry corps of, say, 6000 for the Army of the Potomac?, Might not such a corps be constituted from the cavalry of Sigel's and Slocum's corps, with scraps we could pick up here and there?, Yours of to-day just received., The administration takes no part between its friends in Missouri, of whom I, at least, consider you one; and I have never before had an intimation that appointees there were interfering, or were inclined to interfere., Since my return to the army I have become more than ever convinced that the general officers of this command are almost unanimously opposed to another crossing of the river; but I am still of the opinion that the crossing should be attempted, and I have accordingly issued orders to the engineers and artillery to prepare for it., There is much hazard in it, as there always is in the majority of military movements, and I cannot begin the movement without giving you notice of it, particularly as I know so little of the effect that it may have upon other movements of distant armies., The influence of your telegram the other day is still upon me, and has impressed me with the idea that there are many parts of the problem which influence you that are not known to me., In order to relieve you from all embarrassment in my case, I inclose with this my resignation of my commission as major-general of volunteers, which you can have accepted if my movement is not in accordance with the views of yourself and your military advisers., I have taken the liberty to write to you personally upon this subject, because it was necessary, as I learned from General Halleck, for you to approve of my general plan, written at Warrenton, before I could commence the movement; and I think it quite as necessary that you should know of the important movement I am about to make, particularly as it will have to be made in opposition to the views of nearly all my general officers, and after the receipt of a despatch from you informing me of the opinion of some of them who had visited you., In conversation with you on New Year's morning I was led to express some opinions which I afterward felt it my duty to place on paper, and to express them verbally to the gentleman of whom we were speaking, which I did in your presence, after handing you the letter., You were not disposed then, as I saw, to retain the letter, and I took it back, but I now return it to you for record if you wish it., I beg leave to say that my resignation is not sent in in any spirit of insubordination, but, as I before said, simply to relieve you from any embarrassment in changing commanders where lack of confidence may have rendered it necessary., The bearer of this will bring me any answer, or I should be glad to hear from you by telegraph in cipher., Your communication of the 5th was delivered to me by your aide-de-camp at 12 M. to-day., In all my communications and interviews with you since you took command of the Army of the Potomac I have advised a forward movement across the Rappahannock., At our interview at Warrenton I urged that you should cross by the fords above Fredericksburg rather than to fall down to that place; and when I left you at Warrenton it was understood that at least a considerable part of your army would cross by the fords, and I so represented to the President., It was this modification of the plan proposed by you that I telegraphed you had received his approval., When the attempt at Fredericksburg was abandoned, I advised you to renew the attempt at some other point, either in whole or in part, to turn the enemy's works, or to threaten their wings or communications; in other words, to keep the enemy occupied till a favorable opportunity offered to strike a decisive blow., I particularly advised you to use your cavalry and light artillery upon his communications, and attempt to cut off his supplies and engage him at an advantage., In all our interviews I have urged that our first object was, not Richmond, but the defeat or scattering of Lee's army, which threatened Washington and the line of the upper Potomac., I now recur to these things simply to remind you of the general views which I have expressed, and which I still hold., The circumstances of the case, however, have somewhat changed since the early part of November., The chances of an extended line of operations are now, on account of the advanced season, much less than then., But the chances are still in our favor to meet and defeat the enemy on the Rappahannock, if we can effect a crossing in a position where we can meet the enemy on favorable or even equal terms., ...]",3
281,"[I submit herewith for your consideration the joint resolutions of the corporate authorities of the city of Washington, adopted September a 7, 1862, and a memorial of the same under date of October 28, 1862, both relating to and urging the construction of certain railroads concentrating upon the city of Washington., In presenting this memorial and the joint resolutions to you, I am not prepared to say more than that the subject is one of great practical importance, and that I hope it will receive the attention of Congress., In compliance with the Sixty-fifth Article of War, these whole proceedings are transmitted to the Secretary of War, to be laid before the President of the United States., The foregoing proceedings, findings, and sentence in the foregoing case of Major-General Fitz-John Porter are approved and confirmed, and it is ordered that the said Fitz-John Porter be, and he hereby is, cashiered and dismissed from the service of the United States as a major-general of volunteers, and as colonel and brevet brigadier-general in the regular service of the United States, and forever disqualified from holding any office of trust or profit under the Government of the United States., The President has directed that so much of Arkansas as you may desire to control be temporarily attached to your department., This will give you control of both banks of the river., In your operations down the Mississippi you must not rely too confidently upon any direct co-operation of General Banks and the lower flotilla, as it is possible that they may not be able to pass or reduce Port Hudson., They, however, will do everything in their power to form a junction with you at Vicksburg., If they should not be able to effect this, they will at least occupy a portion of the enemy's forces, and prevent them from reinforcing Vicksburg., I hope, however, that they will do still better and be able to join you., It may be proper to give you some explanation of the revocation of your order expelling all Jews from your department., The President has no objection to your expelling traitors and Jew peddlers, which, I suppose, was the object of your order; but as it in terms proscribed an entire religious class, some of whom are fighting in our ranks, the President deemed it necessary to revoke it., Will see you any moment when you come., I., The President of the United States has directed:  1st., That Major-General A. E. Burnside, at his own request, be relieved from the command of the Army of the Potomac., 2d., That Major-General E. V. Sumner, at his own request, be relieved from duty in the Army of the Potomac., 3d., That Major-General W. B. Franklin be relieved from duty in the Army of the Potomac., 4th., That Major-General J. Hooker be assigned to the command of the Army of the Potomac., II., The officers relieved as above will report in person to the adjutant-general of the army., By order of the Secretary of War: D. TOWNSEND, Assistant Adjutant-General  I have placed you at the head of the Army of the Potomac., Of course I have done this upon what appear to me to be sufficient reasons, and yet I think it best for you to know that there are some things in regard to which I am not quite satisfied with you., I believe you to be a brave and skillful soldier, which of course I like., I also believe you do not mix politics with your profession, in which you are right., You have confidence in yourself, which is a valuable if not an indispensable quality., You are ambitious, which within reasonable bounds does good rather than harm; but I think that during General Burnside's command of the army you have taken counsel of your ambition and thwarted him as much as you could, in which you did a great wrong to the country and to a most meritorious and honorable brother officer., I have heard, in such a way as to believe it, of your recently saying that both the army and the government needed a dictator., Of course it was not for this, but in spite of it, that I have given you the command., Only those generals who gain successes can set up dictators., What I now ask of you is military success, and I will risk the dictatorship., The government will support you to the utmost of its ability, which is neither more nor less than it has done and will do for all commanders., I much fear that the spirit that you have aided to infuse into the army, of criticizing their commander and withholding confidence from him, will now turn upon you., I shall assist you as far as I can to put it down., Neither you nor Napoleon, if he were alive again, could get any good out of an army while such a spirit prevails in it., And now beware of rashness., Beware of rashness, but with energy and sleepless vigilance go forward and give us victories., In conformity to the law of July 16, 1862, I most cordially recommend that Commander David D. Porter, United States Navy, acting rear-admiral, commanding the Mississippi Squadron, receive a vote of thanks of Congress for the bravery and skill displayed in the attack on the post of Arkansas, which surrendered to the combined military and naval forces on the 10th instant., Please come here immediately., Telegraph me about what time you will arrive., Do Richmond papers have anything from Vicksburg?, your valedictory to the patrons of the Albany Evening journal brings me a good deal of uneasiness., What does it mean?, What iron-clads, if any, have gone out of Hampton Roads within the last two days?, Corcoran's and Pryor's battle terminated., Have you any news through Richmond papers or otherwise?, I do not take jurisdiction of the pass question., Exercise your own discretion as to whether Judge Pettis shall have a pass., I have received the New Year's address which you have sent me, with a sincere appreciation of the exalted and humane sentiments by which it was inspired., As these sentiments are manifestly the enduring support of the free institutions of England, so I am sure also that they constitute the only reliable basis for free institutions throughout the world., The resources, advantages, and powers of the American people are very great, and they have consequently succeeded to equally great responsibilities., It seems to have devolved upon them to test whether a government established on the principles of human freedom can be maintained against an effort to build one upon the exclusive foundation of human bondage., They will rejoice with me in the new evidences which your proceedings furnish that the magnanimity they are exhibiting is justly estimated by the true friends of freedom and humanity in foreign countries., Accept my best wishes for your individual welfare, and for the welfare and happiness of the whole British people., I hear of some difficulty in the streets of Baltimore yesterday., What is the amount of it?, On the 4th of September, 1862, Commander George Henry Preble, United States Navy, then senior officer in command of the naval force off the harbor of Mobile, was guilty of inexcusable neglect in permitting the armed steamer Oreto in open daylight to run the blockade., For his omission to perform his whole duty on that occasion, and the injury thereby inflicted on the service and the country, his name was stricken from the list of naval officers and he was dismissed [from] the service., Since his dismissal earnest application has been made for his restoration to his former position by senators and naval officers, on the ground that his fault was an error of judgment, and that the example in his case has already had its effect in preventing a repetition of similar neglect., I therefore on this application and representation, and in consideration of his previous fair record, do hereby nominate George Henry Preble to be a commander in the navy from the 16th July, 1862, to take rank on the active list next after Commander Edward Donaldson, and to fill a vacancy occasioned by the death of Commander J. M. Wainwright., On the 24th August, 1861, Commander Roger Perry, United., States Navy, was dismissed from the service under a misapprehension in regard to his loyalty to the Government, from the circumstance that several oaths were transmitted to him and the Navy Department failed to receive any recognition of them., After his dismissal, and upon his assurance that the oath failed to reach him and his readiness to execute it, he was recommissioned to his original position on the 4th September following., On the same day, 4th September, he was ordered to command the sloop of war Vandalia; on the 22d this order was revoked and he was ordered to duty in the Mississippi Squadron, and on the 23d January, 1862, was detached sick, and has since remained unemployed., The advisory board under the act of 16th July, 1862, did not recommend him for further promotion., This last commission, having been issued during the recess of the Senate, expired at the end of the succeeding session, 17th July, 1862, from which date, not having been nominated to the Senate, he ceased to be a commander in the navy., To correct the omission to nominate this officer to the Senate at its last session, I now nominate Commander Roger Perry to be a commander in the navy from the 14th September, 1855, to take his relative position on the list of commanders not recommended for further promotion., Your despatch about ""river patrolling"" received., I have called the Secretary of the Navy, Secretary of War, and General-in-Chief together, and submitted it to them, who promise to do their very best in the case., I cannot take it into my own hands without producing inextricable confusion., General Clay is here and I suppose the matter we spoke of will have to be definitely settled now., Please answer., Your note, by which you, as General Superintendent of the United States Christian Commission, invite me to preside at a meeting to be held this day at the hall of the House of Representatives in this city, is received., While, for reasons which I deem sufficient, I must decline to preside, I cannot withhold my approval of the meeting and its worthy objects., Whatever shall be, sincerely and in God's name, devised for the good of the soldiers and seamen in their hard spheres of duty, can scarcely fail to be blessed; and whatever shall tend to turn our thoughts from the unreasoning and uncharitable passions, prejudices, and jealousies incident to a great national trouble such as ours, and to fix them on the vast and long enduring consequences, for weal or for woe, which are to result from the struggle, and especially to strengthen our reliance on the Supreme Being for the final triumph of the right, cannot but be well for us all., The birthday of Washington and the Christian Sabbath coinciding this year, and suggesting together the highest interests of this life and of that to come, is most propitious for the meeting proposed., General Rosecrans respectfully urges the appointment of William P. Caslin as a brigadier-general, What say you?, If it will be no detriment to the service I will be obliged for Capt., Henry A. Marchant, of Company I, Twenty-third Pennsylvania Volunteers, to come here and remain four or five days., Whereas objects of interest to the United States require that the Senate should be convened at 12 o'clock on the 4th of March next to receive and act upon such communications as may be made to it on the part of the Executive:  Now, therefore, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States, have considered it to be my duty to issue this my proclamation, declaring that an extraordinary occasion requires the Senate of the United States to convene for the transaction of business at the Capitol, in the city of Washington, on the 4th day of March next, at 12 o'clock at noon on that day, of which all who shall at that time be entitled to act as members of that body are hereby required to take notice., Given under my hand and the seal of the United States, at Washington, the twenty eighth day of February A.D. 1863, and of the independence of the United States of America, the eighty-seventh., Mr. M. is now with me on the question of the Honolulu Commissioner., It pains me some that this tilt for the place of Colonel Baker's friend grows so fierce, now that the Colonel is no longer alive to defend him., I presume, however, we shall have no rest from it., In self-defense I am disposed to say, ""Make a selection and send it to me."", I think your advice with that of others would be valuable in the selection of provost-marshals for Ohio., In pursuance of the twenty-sixth section of the act of Congress entitled ""An act for enrolling and calling out the national forces, and for other purposes,"" approved on the 3d day of March, 1863, I, Abraham Lincoln, President and Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States, do hereby order and command that all soldiers enlisted or drafted in the service of the United States now absent from their regiments without leave shall forthwith return to their respective regiments., And I do hereby declare and proclaim that all soldiers now absent from their respective regiments without leave who shall, on or before the first day of April, 1863, report themselves at any rendezvous designated by the general orders of the War Department No., 58, hereto annexed, may be restored to their respective regiments without punishment, except the forfeiture of pay and allowances during their absence; and all who do not return within the time above specified shall be arrested as deserters and punished as the law provides; and  Whereas evil-disposed and disloyal persons at sundry places have enticed and procured soldiers to desert and absent themselves from their regiments, thereby weakening the strength of the armies and prolonging the war, giving aid and comfort to the enemy, and cruelly exposing the gallant and faithful soldiers remaining in the ranks to increased hardships and danger:  I do therefore call upon all patriotic and faithful citizens to oppose and resist the aforementioned dangerous and treasonable crimes, and to aid in restoring to their regiments all soldiers absent without leave, and to assist in the execution of the act of Congress ""for enrolling and calling out the national forces, and for other purposes,"" and to support the proper authorities in the prosecution and punishment of offenders against said act and in suppressing the insurrection and rebellion., In testimony whereof I have hereunto set my hand., Done at the city of Washington, this tenth day of March, A.D. 1863, and of the independence of the United States the eighty-seventh., General Stahel wishes to be assigned to General Heintzelman and General Heintzelman also desires it., I would like to oblige both if it would not injure the service in your army, or incommode you., What say you?, I am very glad of your note saying ""recent despatches from him are able, judicious, and loyal,"" and that if I agree; we will leave him there., I am glad to agree, so long as the public interest does not seem to require his removal., William Chumasero is proposed for provost-marshal of your district., ...]",3
282,"[General S. is not moving rapidly enough to make the expedition come to anything., He has now been out three days, two of which were unusually fair weather, and all three without hindrance from the enemy, and yet he is not twenty-five miles from where he started., To reach his point he still has sixty to go, another river (the Rapidan) to cross, and will be hindered by the enemy., By arithmetic, how many days will it take him to do it?, I do not know that any better can be done, but I greatly fear it is another failure already., Write me often., I am very anxious., Know ye that, whereas a paper bearing date the 3rd day of December last, purporting to be an agreement between the United States and one Bernard Kock for immigration of persons of African extraction to a dependency of the Republic of Haiti, was signed by me on behalf of the party of the first part; but whereas the said instrument was and has since remained incomplete in consequence of the seal of the United States not having been thereunto affixed; and whereas I have been moved by considerations by me deemed sufficient to withhold my authority for affixing the said seal:  Now, therefore, be it known that I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States, do hereby authorize the Secretary of State to cancel my signature to the instrument aforesaid., Whereas by the act of Congress approved the 31st day of December last the State of West Virginia was declared to be one of the United States of America, and was admitted into the Union on an equal footing with the original States in all respects whatever, upon the condition that certain changes should be duly made in the proposed constitution for that State; and  Whereas proof of a compliance with that condition, as required by the second section of the act aforesaid, has been submitted to me:  Now, therefore, be it known that I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States, do hereby, in pursuance of the act of Congress aforesaid, declare and proclaim that the said act shall take effect and be in force from and after sixty days from the date hereof., In witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed., Done at the city of Washington, this twentieth day of April, A.D. 1863, and of the independence of the United States the eighty-seventh., Your despatch of the 21st received., I really cannot say that I have heard any complaint of you., I have heard complaint of a police corps at Nashville, but your name was not mentioned in connection with it, so far as I remember., It may be that by inference you are connected with it, but my attention has never been drawn to it in that light., How does it look now?, I do not think the people of Pennsylvania should be uneasy about an invasion., Doubtless a small force of the enemy is flourishing about in the northern part of Virginia, on the ""skewhorn"" principle, on purpose to divert us in another quarter., I believe it is nothing more., We think we have adequate force close after them., I have some trouble about provost-marshal in your first district., Please procure HON., Mr. Starr to come with you and see me, or come to an agreement with him and telegraph me the result., The whole disposable force at Baltimore and else where in reach have already been sent after the enemy which alarms you., The worst thing the enemy could do for himself would be to weaken himself before Hooker, and therefore it is safe to believe he is not doing it; and the best thing he could do for himself would be to get us so scared as to bring part of Hooker's force away, and that is just what he is trying to do., I will telegraph you in the morning about calling out the militia., General Halleck tells me he has a despatch from General Schenck this morning, informing him that our forces have joined, and that the enemy menacing Pennsylvania will have to fight or run today., I hope I am not less anxious to do my duty to Pennsylvania than yourself, but I really do not yet see the justification for incurring the trouble and expense of calling out the militia., I shall keep watch, and try to do my duty., Our forces are exactly between the enemy and Pennsylvania., The President thanks you for your telegrams, and hopes you will keep him advised as rapidly as any information reaches you., Where is General Hooker?, Where is Sedgwick Where is Stoneman?, We have news here that the enemy has reoccupied heights above Fredericksburg., Is that so?, Our friend General Sigel claims that you owe him a letter., If you so remember please write him at once., He is here., We have through General Dix the contents of Richmond papers of the 5th., General Dix's despatch in full is going to you by Captain Fox of the navy., The substance is General Lee's despatch of the 3d (Sunday), claiming that he had beaten you and that you were then retreating across the Rappahannock, distinctly stating that two of Longstreet's divisions fought you on Saturday, and that General [E. F.] Paxton was killed, Stonewall Jackson severely wounded, and Generals Heth and A. P. Hill slightly wounded., The Richmond papers also stated, upon what authority not mentioned, that our cavalry have been at Ashland, Hanover Court-House, and other points, destroying several locomotives and a good deal of other property, and all the railroad bridges to within five miles of Richmond., Just as I telegraphed you contents of Richmond papers showing that our cavalry has not failed, I received General Butterfield's of 11 A.M. yesterday., This, with the great rain of yesterday and last night securing your right flank, I think puts a new face upon your case; but you must be the judge., News has gone to General Hooker which may change his plans., Act in view of such contingency., The recent movement of your army is ended without effecting its object, except, perhaps, some important breakings of the enemy's communications., What next?, If possible, I would be very glad of another movement early enough to give us some benefit from the fact of the enemy's communication being broken; but neither for this reason nor any other do I wish anything done in desperation or rashness., An early movement would also help to supersede the bad moral effect of there certain, which is said to be considerably injurious., Have you already in your mind a plan wholly or partially formed?, If you have, prosecute it without interference from me., If you have not, please inform me, so that I, incompetent as I may be, can try and assist in the formation of some plan for the army., Whereas the Congress of the United States, at its last session, enacted a law entitled ""An act for enrolling and calling out the national forces and for other purposes,"" which was approved on the 3d day of March last; and  Whereas it is recited in the said act that there now exists in the United States an insurrection and rebellion against the authority thereof, and it is, under the Constitution of the United States, the duty of the government to suppress insurrection and rebellion, to guarantee to each State a republican form of government, and to preserve the public tranquillity; and  Whereas for these high purposes a military force is indispensable, to raise and support which all persons Ought willingly to contribute; and  Whereas no service can be more praiseworthy and honorable than that which is rendered for the maintenance of the Constitution and the Union, and the consequent preservation of free government; and  Whereas, for the reasons thus recited, it was enacted by the said statute that all able-bodied male citizens of the United States, and persons of foreign birth who shall have declared on oath their intention to become citizens under and in pursuance of the laws thereof, between the ages of twenty and forty-five years (with certain exceptions not necessary to be here mentioned), are declared to constitute the national forces, and shall be liable to perform military duty in the service of the United States when called out by the President for that purpose; and  Whereas it is claimed by and in behalf of persons of foreign birth within the ages specified in said act, who have heretofore declared on oath their intentions to become citizens under and in pursuance of the laws of the United States, and who have not exercised the right of suffrage or any other political franchise under the laws of the United States, or of any of the States thereof, that they are not absolutely concluded by their aforesaid declaration of intention from renouncing their purpose to become citizens, and that, on the contrary, such persons under treaties or the law of nations retain a right to renounce that purpose and to forego the privileges of citizenship and residence within the United States under the obligations imposed by the aforesaid act of Congress:  Now, therefore, to avoid all misapprehensions concerning the liability of persons concerned to perform the service required by such enactment, and to give it full effect, I do hereby order and proclaim that no plea of alienage will be received or allowed to exempt from the obligations imposed by the aforesaid act of Congress any person of foreign birth who shall have declared on oath his intention to become a citizen of the United States under the laws thereof, and who shall be found within the United States at any time during the continuance of the present insurrection and rebellion, at or after the expiration of the period of sixty-five days from the date of this proclamation; nor shall any such plea of alienage be allowed in favor of any such person who has so, as aforesaid, declared his intention to become a citizen of the United States, and shall have exercised at any time the right of suffrage, or any other political franchise, within the United States, under the laws thereof, or under the laws of any of the several States., In witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand, and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed., Done at the city of Washington, this eighth day of May, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-three, and of the independence of the United States the eighty-seventh., The news is here of the capture by our forces of Grand Gulf--a large and very important thing., General Willich, an exchanged prisoner just from Richmond, has talked with me this morning., He was there when our cavalry cut the roads in that vicinity., He says there was not a sound pair of legs in Richmond, and that our men, had they known it, could have safely gone in and burned everything and brought in Jeff Davis., We captured and paroled 300 or 400 men., He says as he came to City Point there was an army three miles long (Longstreet's, he thought) moving toward Richmond., Muroy has captured a despatch of General Lee, in which he says his loss was fearful in his last battle with you., It is very important for Hooker to know exactly what damage is done to the railroads at all points between Fredericksburg and Richmond., As yet we have no word as to whether the crossings of the North and South Anna, or any of them, have been touched., There are four of these Crossings; that is, one on each road on each stream., You readily perceive why this information is desired., I suppose Kilpatrick or Davis can tell., Please ascertain fully what was done, and what is the present condition, as near as you can, and advise me at once., I believe Mr. L. is a good man, but two things need to be remembered., 1st., Mr. R.'s rival was a relative of Mr. L.  2d., I hear of nobody calling Mr. R. a ""Copperhead,"" but Mr. L. However, let us watch., I have again concluded to relieve General Curtis., I see no other way to avoid the worst consequences there., I think of General Schofield as his successor, but I do not wish to take the matter of a successor out of the hands of yourself and General Halleck., Do the Richmond papers have anything about Grand Gulf or Vicksburg?, About what distance is it from the observatory we stopped at last Thursday to the line of enemies' works you ranged the glass upon for me?, Dr. Swinburne and Mr. Gillett are here, having been refused, as they say, by the War Department, permission to go to the Army of the Potomac., They now appeal to me, saying you wish them to go., I suppose they have been excluded by a rule which experience has induced the department to deem proper; still they shall have leave to go, if you say you desire it., Please answer., Governor Chase's feelings were hurt by my action in his absence., Smith is removed, but Governor Chase wishes to name his successor, and asks a day or two to make the designation., When I wrote on the 7th, I had an impression that possibly by an early movement you could get some advantage from the supposed facts that the enemy's communications were disturbed and that he was somewhat deranged in position., That idea has now passed away, the enemy having re-established his communications, regained his positions, and actually received reinforcements., It does not now appear probable to me that you can gain anything by an early renewal of the attempt to cross the Rappahannock., I therefore shall not complain if you do no more for a time than to keep the enemy at bay and out of other mischief by menaces and occasional cavalry raids, if practicable, and to put your own army in good condition again., Still, if in your own clear judgment you can renew the attack successfully, I do not mean to restrain you., Bearing upon this last point, I must tell you that I have some painful intimations that some of your corps and division commanders are not giving you their entire confidence., This would be ruinous, if true, and you should therefore, first of all, ascertain the real facts beyond all possibility of doubt., Your despatch of to-day is just received., It is very painful to me that you in Missouri cannot or will not settle your factional quarrel among yourselves., I have been tormented with it beyond endurance for months by both sides., Neither side pays the least respect to my appeals to your reason., I am now compelled to take hold of the case., Your despatch of to-day is received., I personally know nothing of Colonel Churchill, but months ago and more than once he has been represented to me as exerting a mischievous influence at Saint Louis, for which reason I am unwilling to force his continuance there against the judgment of our friends on the ground; but if it will oblige you, he may come to and remain at Louisville upon taking the oath of allegiance, and your pledge for his good behavior., The commander of the Department at St. Louis has ordered several persons south of our military lines, which order is not disapproved by me., Yet at the special request of the HON., ...]",3
283,"[We have despatches from Vicksburg of the 3d., Siege progressing., No general fighting recently., All well., Nothing new from Port Hudson., The substance of news sent of the fighting at Port Hudson on the 27th we have had here three or four days, and I supposed you had it also, when I said this morning, ""No news from Port Hudson."", We knew that General Sherman was wounded, but we hoped not so dangerously as your despatch represents., We still have nothing of that Richmond newspaper story of Kirby Smith crossing and of Banks losing an arm., I believe that it was upon your recommendation that B., B. Bunker was appointed attorney for Nevada Territory., I am pressed to remove him on the ground that he does not attend to the office, nor in fact pass much time in the Territory., Do you wish to say anything on the subject?, Think you had better put ""Tad's"" pistol away., I had an ugly dream about him., I am told there are 50 incendiary shells here at the arsenal made to fit the 100 pounder Parrott gun now with you., If this be true would you like to have the shells sent to you?, Your long despatch of to-day is just received., If left to me, I would not go south of the Rappahannock upon Lee's moving north of it., If you had Richmond invested to-day you would not be able to take it in twenty days; meanwhile your communications, and with them your army, would be ruined., I think Lee's army, and not Richmond, is your true objective point., If he comes towards the upper Potomac, follow on his flank, and on the inside track, shortening your lines while he lengthens his., Fight him, too, when opportunity offers., If he stay where he is, fret him and fret him., Your three despatches received., I am very well and am glad to know that you and ""Tad"" are so., If you can show me a trial of the incendiary shells on Saturday night, I will try to join you at 5 P.M. that day Answer., Your letter of May 19, inclosing the resolutions of a public meeting held at Albany, New York, on the 16th of the same month, was received several days ago., The resolutions, as I understand them, are resolvable into two propositions--first, the expression of a purpose to sustain the cause of the Union, to secure peace through victory, and to support the administration in every constitutional and lawful measure to suppress the rebellion; and, secondly, a declaration of censure upon the administration for supposed unconstitutional action, such as the making of military arrests., And from the two propositions a third is deduced, which is that the gentlemen composing the meeting are resolved on doing their part to maintain our common government and country, despite the folly or wickedness, as they may conceive, of any administration., This position is eminently patriotic, and as such I thank the meeting, and congratulate the nation for it., My own purpose is the same; so that the meeting and myself have a common object, and can have no difference, except in the choice of means or measures for effecting that object., And here I ought to close this paper, and would close it, if there were no apprehension that more injurious consequences than any merely personal to myself might follow the censures systematically cast upon me for doing what, in my view of duty, I could not forbear., The resolutions promise to support me in every constitutional and lawful measure to suppress the rebellion; and I have not knowingly employed, nor shall knowingly employ, any other., But the meeting, by their resolutions, assert and argue that certain military arrests, and proceedings following them, for which I am ultimately responsible, are unconstitutional., I think they are not., The resolutions quote from the Constitution the definition of treason, and also the limiting safeguards and guarantees therein provided for the citizen on trial for treason, and on his being held to answer for capital or otherwise infamous crimes, and in criminal prosecutions his right to a speedy and public trial by an impartial jury., They proceed to resolve ""that these safeguards of the rights of the citizen against the pretensions of arbitrary power were intended more especially for his protection in times of civil commotion."", And, apparently to demonstrate the proposition, the resolutions proceed: ""They were secured substantially to the English people after years of protracted civil war, and were adopted into our Constitution at the close of the Revolution."", Would not the demonstration have been better if it could have been truly said that these safeguards had been adopted and applied during the civil wars and during our Revolution, instead of after the one and at the close of the other?, I too am devotedly for them after civil war, and before Civil war, and at all times, ""except when, in cases of rebellion or invasion, the public safety may require"" their suspension., The resolutions proceed to tell us that these safeguards ""have stood the test of seventy-six years of trial under our republican system, under circumstances which show that, while they constitute the foundation of all free government, they are the elements of the enduring stability of the republic."", No one denies that they have so stood the test up to the beginning of the present rebellion, if we except a certain occurrence at New Orleans hereafter to be mentioned; nor does any one question that they will stand the same test much longer after the rebellion closes., But these provisions of the Constitution have no application to the case we have in hand, because the arrests complained of were not made for treason--that is, not for the treason defined in the Constitution, and upon the conviction of which the punishment is death--nor yet were they made to hold persons to answer for any capital or otherwise infamous crimes; nor were the proceedings following, in any constitutional or legal sense, ""criminal prosecutions."", The arrests were made on totally different grounds, and the proceedings following accorded with the grounds of the arrests., Let us consider the real case with which we are dealing, and apply to it the parts of the Constitution plainly made for such cases., Prior to my installation here it had been inculcated that any State had a lawful right to secede from the national Union, and that it would be expedient to exercise the right whenever the devotees of the doctrine should fail to elect a president to their own liking., I was elected contrary to their liking; and accordingly, so far as it was legally possible, they had taken seven States out of the Union, had seized many of the United States forts, and had fired upon the United States flag, all before I was inaugurated, and, of course, before I had done any official act whatever., The rebellion thus begun soon ran into the present civil war; and, in certain respects, it began on very unequal terms between the parties., The insurgents had been preparing for it more than thirty years, while the government had taken no steps to resist them., The former had carefully considered all the means which could be turned to their account., It undoubtedly was a well-pondered reliance with them that in their own unrestricted effort to destroy Union, Constitution and law, all together, the government would, in great degree, be restrained by the same Constitution and law from arresting their progress., Their sympathizers invaded all departments of the government and nearly all communities of the people., From this material, under cover of ""liberty of speech,"" ""liberty of the press,"" and ""habeas corpus,"" they hoped to keep on foot amongst us a most efficient corps of spies, informers, suppliers, and aiders and abettors of their cause in a thousand ways., They knew that in times such as they were inaugurating, by the Constitution itself the ""habeas corpus"" might be suspended; but they also knew they had friends who would make a question as to who was to suspend it; meanwhile their spies and others might remain at large to help on their cause., Or if, as has happened, the Executive should suspend the writ without ruinous waste of time, instances of arresting innocent persons might occur, as are always likely to occur in such cases; and then a clamor could be raised in regard to this, which might be at least of some service to the insurgent cause., It needed no very keen perception to discover this part of the enemies program, so soon as by open hostilities their machinery was fairly put in motion., Yet, thoroughly imbued with a reverence for the guaranteed rights of individuals, I was slow to adopt the strong measures which by degrees I have been forced to regard as being within the exceptions of the Constitution, and as indispensable to the public safety., Nothing is better known to history than that courts of justice are utterly incompetent to such cases., Civil courts are organized chiefly for trials of individuals--or, at most, a few individuals acting in concert, and this in quiet times, and on charges of crimes well defined in the law., Even in times of peace bands of horse-thieves and robbers frequently grow too numerous and powerful for the ordinary courts of justice., But what comparison, in numbers have such bands ever borne to the insurgent sympathizers even in many of the loyal States?, Again, a jury too frequently has at least one member more ready to hang the panel than to hang the traitor., And yet again, he who dissuades one man from volunteering, or induces one soldier to desert, weakens the Union cause as much as he who kills a Union soldier in battle., Yet this dissuasion or inducement may be so conducted as to be no defined crime of which any civil court would take cognizance., Ours is a case of rebellion--so called by the resolutions before me--in fact, a clear, flagrant, and gigantic case of rebellion; and the provision of the Constitution that ""the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended unless when, in cases of rebellion or invasion, the public safety may require it,"" is the provision which specially applies to our present case., This provision plainly attests the understanding of those who made the Constitution that ordinary courts of justice are inadequate to ""cases of rebellion""--attests their purpose that, in such cases, men may be held in custody whom the courts, acting on ordinary rules, would discharge., Habeas corpus does not discharge men who are proved to be guilty of defined crime, and its suspension is allowed by the Constitution on purpose that men may be arrested and held who can not be proved to be guilty of defined crime, ""when, in cases of rebellion or invasion, the public safety may require it."", This is precisely our present case--a case of rebellion wherein the public safety does require the suspension--Indeed, arrests by process of courts and arrests in cases of rebellion do not proceed altogether upon the same basis., The former is directed at the small percentage of ordinary and continuous perpetration of crime, while the latter is directed at sudden and extensive uprisings against the government, which, at most, will succeed or fail in no great length of time., In the latter case arrests are made not so much for what has been done as for what probably would be done., The latter is more for the preventive and less for the vindictive than the former., In such cases the purposes of men are much more easily understood than in cases of ordinary crime., The man who stands by and says nothing when the peril of his government is discussed, cannot be misunderstood., If not hindered, he is sure to help the enemy; much more if he talks ambiguously--talks for his country with ""buts,"" and ""ifs,"" and ""ands."", Of how little value the constitutional provision I have quoted will be rendered if arrests shall never be made until defined crimes shall have been committed, may be illustrated by a few notable examples: General John C. Breckinridge, General Robert E. Lee, General Joseph E. Johnston, General John B. Magruder, General William B. Preston, General Simon B. Buckner, and Commodore Franklin Buchanan, now occupying the very highest places in the rebel war service, were all within the power of the government since the rebellion began, and were nearly as well known to be traitors then as now., Unquestionably if we had seized and had them the insurgent cause would be much weaker., But no one of them had then committed any crime defined in the law., Every one of them, if arrested, would have been discharged on habeas corpus were the writ allowed to operate., In view of these and similar cases, I think the time not unlikely to come when I shall be blamed for having made too few arrests rather than too many., By the third resolution the meeting indicate their opinion that military arrests may be constitutional in localities where rebellion actually exists, but that such arrests are unconstitutional in localities where rebellion or insurrection does not actually exist., They insist that such arrests shall not be made ""outside of the lines of necessary military occupation and the scenes of insurrection."", Inasmuch, however, as the Constitution itself makes no such distinction, I am unable to believe that there is any such constitutional distinction., I concede that the class of arrests complained of can be constitutional only when, in cases of rebellion or invasion, the public safety may require them; and I insist that in such cases--they are constitutional wherever the public safety does require them, as well in places to which they may prevent the rebellion extending, as in those where it may be already prevailing; as well where they may restrain mischievous interference with the raising and supplying of armies to suppress the rebellion as where the rebellion may actually be; as well where they may restrain the enticing men out of the army as where they would prevent mutiny in the army; equally constitutional at all places where they will conduce to the public safety as against the dangers of rebellion or invasion., Take the particular case mentioned by the meeting., It is asserted in substance that Mr. Vallandigham was, by a military commander, seized and tried ""for no other reason than words addressed to a public meeting in criticism of the course of the administration, and in condemnation of the military orders of the general."", Now, if there be no mistake about this, if this assertion is the truth, and the whole truth, if there were no other reason for the arrest, then I concede that the arrest was wrong., But the arrest, as I understand, was made for a very different reason., Mr. Vallandigham avows his hostility to the war on the part of the Union; and his arrest was made because he was laboring, with some effect, to prevent the raising of troops, to encourage desertions from the army, and to leave the rebellion without an adequate military force to suppress it., He was not arrested because he was damaging the political prospects of the administration or the personal interests of the commanding general, but because he was damaging the army, upon the existence and vigor of which the life of the nation depends., He was warring upon the military, and thus gave the military constitutional jurisdiction to lay hands upon him., If Mr. Vallandigham was not damaging the military power of the country, then his arrest was made on mistake of fact, which I would be glad to correct on reasonably satisfactory evidence., I understand the meeting whose resolutions I am considering to be in favor of suppressing the rebellion by military force--by armies., Long experience has shown that armies cannot be maintained unless desertion shall be punished by the severe penalty of death., The case requires, and the law and the Constitution sanction, this punishment., Must I shoot a simple-minded boy and not touch a hair of a wily agitator who induced him to desert., This is none the less injurious when effected by getting a father, or brother, or friend into a public meeting, and there working upon his feelings till he is persuaded to write the soldier boy that he is fighting in a bad cause, for a wicked administration of a contemptible government, too weak to arrest and punish him if he shall desert., I think that, in such a case, to silence the agitator and save the boy is not only constitutional, but withal a great mercy., If I be wrong on this question of constitutional power, my error lies in believing that certain proceedings are constitutional when, in cases of rebellion or invasion, the public safety requires them, which would not be constitutional when, in absence of rebellion or invasion, the public safety does not require them: in other words, that the Constitution is not in its application in all respects the same in cases of rebellion or invasion involving the public safety as it is in times of profound peace and public security., The Constitution itself makes the distinction, and I can no more be persuaded that the government can constitutionally take no strong measures in time of rebellion, because it can be shown that the same could not be lawfully taken in times of peace, than I can be persuaded that a particular drug is not good medicine for a sick man because it can be shown to not be good food for a well one., Nor am I able to appreciate the danger apprehended by the meeting, that the American people will by means of military arrests during the rebellion lose the right of public discussion, the liberty of speech and the press, the law of evidence, trial by jury, and habeas corpus throughout the indefinite peaceful future which I trust lies before them, any more than I am able to believe that a man could contract so strong an appetite for emetics during temporary illness as to persist in feeding upon them during the remainder of his healthful life., ...]",3
284,"[The people of Louisiana shall not lack an opportunity for a fair election for both Federal and State officers by want of anything within my power to give them., Your despatch, asking in substance whether, in case Missouri shall adopt gradual emancipation, the General Government will protect slave owners in that species of property during the short time it shall be permitted by the State to exist within it, has been received., Desirous as I am that emancipation shall be adopted by Missouri, and believing as I do that gradual can be made better than immediate for both black and white, except when military necessity changes the case, my impulse is to say that such protection would be given., I cannot know exactly what shape an act of emancipation may take., If the period from the initiation to the final end should be comparatively short, and the act should prevent persons being sold during that period into more lasting slavery, the whole would be easier., I do not wish to pledge the General Government to the affirmative support of even temporary slavery beyond what can be fairly claimed under the Constitution., I suppose, however, this is not desired, but that it is desired for the military force of the United States, while in Missouri, to not be used in subverting the temporarily reserved legal rights in slaves during the progress of emancipation., This I would desire also., I have very earnestly urged the slave States to adopt emancipation; and it ought to be, and is, an object with me not to overthrow or thwart what any of them may in good faith do to that end., You are therefore authorized to act in the spirit of this letter in conjunction with what may appear to be the military necessities of your department., Although this letter will become public at some time, it is not intended to be made so now., Operator at Leesburg just now says: ""I heard very little firing this A.M. about daylight, but it seems to have stopped now., It was in about the same direction as yesterday, but farther off."", You remember that Hon., W. D. Kelly and others are engaged in raising or trying to raise some colored regiments in Philadelphia., The bearer of this, Wilton M. Huput, is a friend of Judge Kelly, as appears by the letter of the latter., He is a private in the 112th Penn., and has been disappointed in a reasonable expectation of one of the smaller offices., He now wants to be a lieutenant in one of the colored regiments., If Judge Kelly will say in writing he wishes to so have him, I am willing for him to be discharged from his present position, and be so appointed., If you approve, so indorse and let him carry the letter to Kelly., Have you any idea what the news is in the despatch of General Banks to General Halleck?, Have you any reports of the enemy moving into Pennsylvania?, And if any, what?, We have a despatch from General Grant of the 19th., Don't think Kirby Smith took Milliken's Bend since, allowing time to get the news to Joe Johnston and from him to Richmond., But it is not absolutely impossible., Also have news from Banks to the 16th, I think., He had not run away then, nor thought of it., Colonel Derrom, of the Twenty-fifth New Jersey Volunteers, now mustered out, says there is a man in your hands under conviction for desertion, who formerly belonged to the above named regiment, and whose name is Templeton--Isaac F. Templeton, I believe., The Colonel and others appeal to me for him., Please telegraph to me what is the condition of the case, and if he has not been executed send me the record of the trial and conviction., Was William Gruvier, Company A, Forty-sixth, Pennsylvania, one of the men executed as a deserter last Friday?, It did not come from the newspapers, nor did I believe it, but I wished to be entirely sure it was a falsehood., There is nothing going on in Kentucky on the subject of which you telegraph, except an enrolment., Before anything is done beyond this, I will take care to understand the case better than I now do., There is nothing going on in Kentucky on the subject of which you telegraph, except an enrolment., Before anything is done beyond this, I will take care to understand the case better than I now do., Every place in the Naval school subject to my appointment is full, and I have one unredeemed promise of more than half a year's standing., The resolutions of the Ohio Democratic State convention, which you present me, together with your introductory and closing remarks, being in position and argument mainly the same as the resolutions of the Democratic meeting at Albany, New York, I refer you to my response to the latter as meeting most of the points in the former., This response you evidently used in preparing your remarks, and I desire no more than that it be used with accuracy., In a single reading of your remarks, I only discovered one inaccuracy in matter, which I suppose you took from that paper., It is where you say: ""The undersigned are unable to agree with you in the opinion you have expressed that the Constitution is different in time of insurrection or invasion from what it is in time of peace and public security."", A recurrence to the paper will show you that I have not expressed the opinion you suppose., I expressed the opinion that the Constitution is different in its application in cases of rebellion or invasion, involving the public safety, from what it is in times of profound peace and public security; and this opinion I adhere to, simply because, by the Constitution itself, things may be done in the one case which may not be done in the other., I dislike to waste a word on a merely personal point, but I must respectfully assure you that you will find yourselves at fault should you ever seek for evidence to prove your assumption that I ""opposed in discussions before the people the policy of the Mexican war."", You say: ""Expunge from the Constitution this limitation upon the power of Congress to suspend the writ of habeas corpus, and yet the other guarantees of personal liberty would remain unchanged."", Doubtless, if this clause of the Constitution, improperly called, as I think, a limitation upon the power of Congress, were expunged, the other guarantees would remain the same; but the question is not how those guarantees would stand with that clause out of the Constitution, but how they stand with that clause remaining in it, in case of rebellion or invasion involving the public safety., If the liberty could be indulged of expunging that clause, letter and spirit, I really think the constitutional argument would be with you., My general view on this question was stated in the Albany response, and hence I do not state it now., I only add that, as seems to me, the benefit of the writ of habeas corpus is the great means through which the guarantees of personal liberty are conserved and made available in the last resort; and corroborative of this view is the fact that Mr. Vallandigham, in the very case in question, under the advice of able lawyers, saw not where else to go but to the habeas corpus., But by the Constitution the benefit of the writ of habeas corpus itself may be suspended when, in case of rebellion or invasion, the public safety may require it., You ask, in substance, whether I really claim that I may override all the guaranteed rights of individuals, on the plea of conserving the public safety when I may choose to say the public safety requires it., This question, divested of the phraseology calculated to represent me as struggling for an arbitrary personal prerogative, is either simply a question who shall decide, or an affirmation that nobody shall decide, what the public safety does require in cases of rebellion or invasion., The Constitution contemplates the question as likely to occur for decision, but it does not expressly declare who is to decide it., By necessary implication, when rebellion or invasion comes, the decision is to be made from time to time; and I think the man whom, for the time, the people have, under the Constitution, made the commander-in-chief of their army and navy, is the man who holds the power and bears the responsibility of making it., If he uses the power justly, the same people will probably justify him; if he abuses it, he is in their hands to be dealt with by all the modes they have reserved to themselves in the Constitution., The earnestness with which you insist that persons can only, in times of rebellion, be lawfully dealt with in accordance with the rules for criminal trials and punishments in times of peace, induces me to add a word to what I said on that point in the Albany response., You claim that men may, if they choose, embarrass those whose duty it is to combat a giant rebellion, and then be dealt with in turn only as if there were no rebellion., The Constitution itself rejects this view., The military arrests and detentions which have been made, including those of Mr. Vallandigham, which are not different in principle from the others, have been for prevention, and not for punishment--as injunctions to stay injury, as proceedings to keep the peace; and hence, like proceedings in such cases and for like reasons, they have not been accompanied with indictments, or trials by juries, nor in a single case by any punishment whatever, beyond what is purely incidental to the prevention., The original sentence of imprisonment in Mr. Vallandigham's case was to prevent injury to the military service only, and the modification of it was made as a less disagreeable mode to him of securing the same prevention., I am unable to perceive an insult to Ohio in the case of Mr. Vallandigham., Quite surely nothing of the sort was or is intended., I was wholly unaware that Mr. Vallandigham was, at the time of his arrest, a candidate for the Democratic nomination for governor until so informed by your reading to me the resolutions of the convention., I am grateful to the State of Ohio for many things, especially for the brave soldiers and officers she has given in the present national trial to the armies of the Union., You claim, as I understand, that according to my own position in the Albany response, Mr. Vallandigham should be released; and this because, as you claim, he has not damaged the military service by discouraging enlistments, encouraging desertions, or otherwise; and that if he had, he should have been turned over to the civil authorities under the recent acts of Congress., I certainly do not know that Mr. Vallandigham has specifically and by direct language advised against enlistments and in favor of desertion and resistance to drafting., We all know that combinations, armed in some instances, to resist the arrest of deserters began several months ago; that more recently the like has appeared in resistance to the enrolment preparatory to a draft; and that quite a number of assassinations have occurred from the same animus., These had to be met by military force, and this again has led to bloodshed and death., And now, under a sense of responsibility more weighty and enduring than any which is merely official, I solemnly declare my belief that this hindrance of the military, including maiming and murder, is due to the course in which Mr. Vallandigham has been engaged in a greater degree than to any other cause; and it is due to him personally in a greater degree than to any other one man., These things have been notorious, known to all, and of course known to Mr. Vallandigham., Perhaps I would not be wrong to say they originated with his special friends and adherents., With perfect knowledge of them, he has frequently if not constantly made speeches in Congress and before popular assemblies; and if it can be shown that, with these things staring him in the face he has ever uttered a word of rebuke or counsel against them, it will be a fact greatly in his favor with me, and one of which as yet I am totally ignorant., When it is known that the whole burden of his speeches has been to stir up men against the prosecution of the war, and that in the midst of resistance to it he has not been known in any instance to counsel against such resistance, it is next to impossible to repel the inference that he has counseled directly in favor of it., With all this before their eyes, the convention you represent have nominated Mr. Vallandigham for governor of Ohio, and both they and you have declared the purpose to sustain the national Union by all constitutional means., But of course they and you in common reserve to yourselves to decide what are constitutional means; and, unlike the Albany meeting, you omit to state or intimate that in your opinion an army is a constitutional means of saving the Union against a rebellion, or even to intimate that you are conscious of an existing rebellion being in progress with the avowed object of destroying that very Union., At the same time your nominee for governor, in whose behalf you appeal, is known to you and to the world to declare against the use of an army to suppress the rebellion., Your own attitude, therefore, encourages desertion, resistance to the draft, and the like, because it teaches those who incline to desert and to escape the draft to believe it is your purpose to protect them, and to hope that you will become strong enough to do so., After a short personal intercourse with you, gentlemen of the committee, I cannot say I think you desire this effect to follow your attitude; but I assure your that both friends and enemies of the Union look upon it in this light., It is a substantial hope, and by consequence a real strength to the enemy., If it is a false hope, and one which you would willingly dispel, I will make the way exceedingly easy., I send you duplicates of this letter in order that you, or a majority of you, may, if you choose, indorse your names upon one of them and return it thus indorsed to me with the understanding that those signing are thereby committed to the following propositions and to nothing else:  1., That there is now a rebellion in the United States, the object and tendency of which is to destroy the National Union; and that, in your opinion, an army and navy are constitutional means for suppressing that rebellion;  2., That no one of you will do anything which, in his own judgment, will tend to hinder the increase, or favor the decrease, or lessen the efficiency of the army or navy while engaged in the effort to suppress that rebellion; and  3., That each of you will, in his sphere, do all he can to have the officers, soldiers, and seamen of the army and navy, while engaged in the effort to suppress the rebellion, paid, fed, clad, and otherwise well provided for and supported., And with the further understanding that upon receiving the letter and names thus indorsed, I will cause them to be published, which publication shall be, within itself, a revocation of the order in relation to Mr. Vallandigham., It will not escape observation that I consent to the release of Mr. Vallandigham upon terms not embracing any pledge from him or from others as to what he will or will not do., I do this because he is not present to speak for himself, or to authorize others to speak for him; and because I should expect that on his returning he would not put himself practically in antagonism with the position of his friends., But I do it chiefly because I thereby prevail on other influential gentlemen of Ohio to so define their position as to be of immense value to the army--thus more than compensating for the consequences of any mistake in allowing Mr. Vallandigham to return; so that, on the whole, the public safety will not have suffered by it., Still, in regard to Mr. Vallandigham and all others, I must hereafter, as heretofore, do so much as the public safety may seem to require., Your despatch of yesterday received., I really think the attitude of the enemy's army in Pennsylvania presents us the best opportunity we have had since the war began., I think you will not see the foe in New Jersey., I beg you to be assured that no one out of my position can know so well as if he were in it the difficulties and involvements of replacing General McClellan in command, and this aside from any imputations upon him., Please accept my sincere thanks for what you have done and are doing to get troops forward., Do we gain anything by opening one leak to stop another?, Do we gain anything by quieting one merely to open another, and probably a larger one?, I judge by absence of news that the enemy is not crossing or pressing up to the Susquehanna., Please tell me what you know of his movements., ...]",3
285,"[The effect on political position of McKee's arrest will not be relieved any by its not having been made with that purpose., Governor Carney has not asked to [have] General Blunt removed, or interfered with, in his military operations., He has asked that he, the Governor, be allowed to commission officers for troops raised in Kansas, as other governors of loyal States do; and I think he is right in this., He has asked that General Blunt shall not take persons charged with civil crimes out of the hands of the courts and turn them over to mobs to be hung; and I think he is right in this also., He has asked that General Ewing's department be extended to include all Kansas; and I have not determined whether this is right or not., What do you remember about the case of John O., Brown, convicted of mutinous conduct and sentenced to death?, What do you desire about it?, Yours of the 15th has been received, and considered by the Secretary of War and myself., I was pained to be informed this morning by the Provost-Marshal-General that New Jersey is now behind twelve thousand, irrespective of the draft., I did not have time to ascertain by what rules this was made out; and I shall be very glad if it shall, by any means, prove to be incorrect., He also tells me that eight thousand will be about the quota of New Jersey on the first draft; and the Secretary of War says the first draft in that State would not be made for some time in any event., As every man obtained otherwise lessens the draft so much, and this may supersede it altogether, I hope you will push forward your volunteer regiments as fast as possible., It is a very delicate matter to postpone the draft in one State, because of the argument it furnishes others to have postponement also., If we could have a reason in one case which would be good if presented in all cases, we could act upon it., I will thank you, therefore, to inform me, if you can, by what day, at the earliest, you can promise to have ready to be mustered into the United States service the eight thousand men., If you can make a reliable promise (I mean one which you can rely on yourself) of this sort, it will be of great value, if the day is not too remote., I beg you to be assured I wish to avoid the difficulties you dread as much as yourself., I have received and read your letter of the 14th of July., I think the suggestion you make, of discontinuing proceedings against Mr. McKee, a very proper one., While I admit that there is an apparent impropriety in the publication of the letter mentioned, without my consent or yours, it is still a case where no evil could result, and which I am entirely willing to overlook., The following despatch has been placed in my hands., Please look to the subject of it., Yesterday little indorsements of mine went to you in two cases of postmasterships sought for widows whose husbands have fallen in the battles of this war., These cases occurring on the same day brought me to reflect more attentively than I had before done, as to what is fairly due from us herein the dispensing of patronage toward the men who, by fighting our battles, bear the chief burden of serving our country., My conclusion is that, other claims and qualifications being equal, they have the better right and this is especially applicable to the disabled and the soldier, deceased soldier's family., Certain matters have come to my notice, and considered by me, which induce me to believe that it will conduce to the public interest for you to add to the general instructions given to our naval commanders in relation to contraband trade propositions substantially as follows, to wit:  First., You will avoid the reality, and as far as possible the appearance, of using any neutral port to watch neutral vessels and then to dart out and seize them on their departure., Complaint is made that this has been practiced at the port of St Thomas, which practice, if it exists, is disapproved and must cease., Second., You will not in any case detain the crew of a captured neutral vessel or any other subject of a neutral power on board such vessel, as prisoners of war or otherwise, except the small number necessary as witnesses in the prize court., The practice here forbidden is also charged to exist, which, if true, is disapproved and must cease., My dear sir, it is not intended to be insinuated that you have been remiss in the performance of the arduous and responsible duties of your department, which, I take pleasure in affirming, has in your hands been conducted with admirable success., Yet, while your subordinates are almost of necessity brought into angry collision with the subjects of foreign states, the representatives of those states and yourself do not come into immediate contact for the purpose of keeping the peace, in spite of such collisions., At that point there is an ultimate and heavy responsibility upon me., What I propose is in strict accordance with international law, and is therefore unobjectionable; whilst, if it does no other good, it will contribute to sustain a considerable portion of the present British ministry in their places, who, if displaced, are sure to be replaced by others more unfavorable to us., Yours of the 21st is received, and I have taken time and considered and discussed the subject with the Secretary of War and Provost-Marshal General, in order, if possible, to make you a more favorable answer than I finally find myself able to do., It is a vital point with us to not have a special stipulation with the governor of any one State, because it would breed trouble in many, if not all, other States; and my idea was when I wrote you, as it still is, to get a point of time to which we could wait, on the reason that we were not ready ourselves to proceed, and which might enable you to raise the quota of your State, in whole, or in large part, without the draft., The points of time you fix are much farther off than I had hoped., We might have got along in the way I have indicated for twenty, or possibly thirty, days., As it stands, the best I can say is that every volunteer you will present us within thirty days from this date, fit and ready to be mustered into the United States service, on the usual terms, shall be pro tanto an abatement of your quota of the draft., That quota I can now state at eight thousand seven hundred and eighty-three (8783)., No draft from New Jersey, other than for the above quota, will be made before an additional draft, common to [all] the States, shall be required; and I may add that if we get well through with this draft, I entertain a strong hope that any further one may never be needed., This expression of hope, however, must not be construed into a promise., As to conducting the draft by townships, I find it would require such a waste of labor already done, and such an additional amount of it, and such a loss of time, as to make it, I fear, inadmissible., Since writing the above, getting additional information, I am enabled to say that the draft may be made in subdistricts, as the enrolment has been made, or is in process of making., This will amount practically to drafting by townships, as the enrollment subdistricts are generally about the extent of townships., I have not thrown General Hooker away; and therefore I would like to know whether it would be agreeable to you, all things considered, for him to take a corps under you, if he himself is willing to do so., Write me in perfect freedom, with the assurance that I will not subject you to any embarrassment by making your letter or its contents known to any one., I wish to know your wishes before I decide whether to break the subject to him., Do not lean a hair's breadth against your own feelings, or your judgment of the public service, on the idea of gratifying me., Let me explain., In General Grant's first despatch after the fall of Vicksburg, he said, among other things, he would send the Ninth Corps to you., Thinking it would be pleasant to you, I asked the Secretary of War to telegraph you the news., For some reasons never mentioned to us by General Grant, they have not been sent, though we have seen outside intimations that they took part in the expedition against Jackson., General Grant is a copious worker and fighter, but a very meager writer or telegrapher., No doubt he changed his purpose in regard to the Ninth Corps for some sufficient reason, but has forgotten to notify us of it., Seeing General Meade's despatch of yesterday to yourself causes me to fear that he supposes the Government here is demanding of him to bring on a general engagement with Lee as soon as possible., I am claiming no such thing of him., In fact, my judgment is against it; which judgment, of course, I will yield if yours and his are the contrary., If he could not safely engage Lee at Williamsport, it seems absurd to suppose he can safely engage him now, when he has scarcely more than two thirds of the force he had at Williamsport, while it must be that Lee has been reinforced., True, I desired General Meade to pursue Lee across the Potomac, hoping, as has proved true, that he would thereby clear the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, and get some advantages by harassing him on his retreat., These being past, I am unwilling he should now get into a general engagement on the impression that we here are pressing him, and I shall be glad for you to so inform him, unless your own judgment is against it., Can we not renew the effort to organize a force to go to western Texas?, Please consult with the general-in-chief on the subject., If the Governor of New Jersey shall furnish any new regiments, might not they be put into such an expedition?, Please think of it., I believe no local object is now more desirable., It is the duty of every government to give protection to its citizens, of whatever class, color, or condition, and especially to those who are duly organized as soldiers in the public service., The law of nations and the usages and customs of war, as carried on by civilized powers, permit no distinction as to color in the treatment of prisoners of war as public enemies., To sell or enslave any captured person, on account of his color and for no offense against the laws of war, is a relapse into barbarism, and a crime against the civilization of the age., The Government of the United States will give the same protection to all its soldiers; and if the enemy shall sell or enslave any one because of his color, the offense shall be punished by retaliation upon the enemy's prisoners in our possession., It is therefore ordered that for every soldier of the United States killed in violation of the laws of war, a rebel soldier shall be executed; and for every one enslaved by the enemy or sold into slavery, a rebel soldier shall be placed at hard labor on the public works, and continued at such labor until the other shall be released and receive the treatment due to a prisoner of war., Your letter by Mr. Dana was duly received., I now learn that your resignation has reached the War Department., I also learn that an active command has been assigned you by General Grant., The Secretary of War and General Halleck are very partial to you, as you know I also am., We all wish you to reconsider the question of resigning; not that we would wish to retain you greatly against your wish and interest, but that your decision may be at least a very well-considered one., I understand that Senator [William K.] Sebastian, of Arkansas, thinks of offering to resume his place in the Senate., Of course the Senate, and not I, would decide whether to admit or reject him., Still I should feel great interest in the question., It may be so presented as to be one of the very greatest national importance; and it may be otherwise so presented as to be of no more than temporary personal consequence to him., The Emancipation Proclamation applies to Arkansas., I think it is valid in law, and will be so held by the courts., I think I shall not retract or repudiate it., Those who shall have tasted actual freedom I believe can never be slaves or quasi-slaves again., For the rest, I believe some plan substantially being gradual emancipation would be better for both white and black., The Missouri plan recently adopted, I do not object to on account of the time for ending the institution; but I am sorry the beginning should have been postponed for seven years, leaving all that time to agitate for the repeal of the whole thing., It should begin at once, giving at least the new-born a vested interest in freedom which could not be taken away., If Senator Sebastian could come with something of this sort from Arkansas, I, at least, should take great interest in his case; and I believe a single individual will have scarcely done the world so great a service., See him if you can, and read this to him; but charge him not to make it public for the present., Write me again., I ask that the draft be suspended in this State until I can send you a communication I am preparing., By what day may I expect your communication to reach me?, Are you anxious about any part except the city and vicinity?, If Dr. Wright, on trial at Norfolk, has been or shall be convicted, send me a transcript of his trial and conviction, and do not let execution be done upon him until my further order., While I very well know what I would be glad for Louisiana to do, it is quite a different thing for me to assume direction of the matter., I would be glad for her to make a new constitution, recognizing the emancipation proclamation, and adopting emancipation in those parts of the State to which the proclamation does not apply., And while she is at it, I think it would not be objectionable for her to adopt some practical system by which the two races could gradually live themselves out of their old relation to each other, and both come out better prepared for the new., Education for young blacks should be included in the plan., ...]",3
286,"[Our friend William G. Greene has just presented a kind letter in regard to yourself, addressed to me by our other friends Yates, Hatch, and Dubois., I doubt whether your present position is more painful to you than to myself., Grateful for the patriotic stand so early taken by you in this life-and-death struggle of the nation, I have done whatever has appeared practicable to advance you and the public interest together., No charges, with a view to a trial, have been preferred against you by any one; nor do I suppose any will be., All there is, so far as I have heard, is General Grant's statement of his reasons for relieving you., And even this I have not seen or sought to see; because it is a case, as appears to me, in which I could do nothing without doing harm., General Grant and yourself have been conspicuous in our most important successes; and for me to interfere and thus magnify a breach between you could not but be of evil effect., Better leave it where the law of the case has placed it., For me to force you back upon General Grant would be forcing him to resign., I cannot give you a new command, because we have no forces except such as already have commanders., I am constantly pressed by those who scold before they think, or without thinking at all, to give commands respectively to Fremont, McClellan, Butler, Sigel, Curtis, Hunter, Hooker, and perhaps others, when, all else out of the way, I have no commands to give them., This is now your case; which, as I have said, pains me not less than it does you., My belief is that the permanent estimate of what a general does in the field is fixed by the ""cloud of witnesses"" who have been with him in the field, and that, relying on these, he who has the right needs not to fear., Your despatch of this morning is just received, and I fear I do not perfectly understand it., My view of the principle is that every soldier obtained voluntarily leaves one less to be obtained by draft., The only difficulty is in applying the principle properly., Looking to time, as heretofore, I am unwilling to give up a drafted man now, even for the certainty, much less for the mere chance, of getting a volunteer hereafter., Again, after the draft in any district, would it not make trouble to take any drafted man out and put a volunteer in--for how shall it be determined which drafted man is to have the privilege of thus going out, to the exclusion of all the others?, And even before the draft in any district the quota must be fixed; and the draft must be postponed indefinitely if every time a volunteer is offered the officers must stop and reconstruct the quota., At least I fear there might be this difficulty; but, at all events, let credits for volunteers be given up to the last moment which will not produce confusion or delay., That the principle of giving credits for volunteers shall be applied by districts seems fair and proper, though I do not know how far by present statistics it is practicable., When for any cause a fair credit is not given at one time, it should be given as soon thereafter as practicable., My purpose is to be just and fair, and yet to not lose time., Months ago I should have acknowledged the receipt of your book and accompanying kind note; and I now have to beg your pardon for not having done so., For one of my age I have seen very little of the drama., The first presentation of Falstaff I ever saw was yours here, last winter or spring., Perhaps the best compliment I can pay is to say, as I truly can, I am very anxious to see it again., Some of Shakespeare's plays I have never read, while others I have gone over perhaps as frequently as any un-professional reader., Among the latter are Lear, Richard III., Henry VIII., Hamlet, and especially Macbeth., I think nothing equals Macbeth., It is wonderful., Unlike you gentlemen of the profession, I think the soliloquy in Hamlet commencing ""Oh, my offense is rank,"" surpasses that commencing ""To be or not to be."", But pardon this small attempt at criticism., I should like to hear you pronounce the opening speech of Richard III., Will you not soon visit Washington again?, If you do, please call and let me make your personal acquaintance., There seems to be considerable misunderstanding about the recent movement to take possession of the ""New Almaden"" mine., It has no reference to any other mine or mines., In regard to mines and miners generally, no change of policy by the Government has been decided on, or even thought of, so far as I know., The ""New Almaden"" mine was peculiar in this: that its occupants claimed to be the legal owners of it on a Mexican grant, and went into court on that claim., The case found its way into the Supreme Court of the United States, and last term, in and by that court, the claim of the occupants was decided to be utterly fraudulent., Thereupon it was considered the duty of the Government by the Secretary of the Interior, the Attorney-General, and myself to take possession of the premises; and the Attorney-General carefully made out the writ and I signed it., It was not obtained surreptitiously, although I suppose General Halleck thought it had been, when he telegraphed, simply because he thought possession was about being taken by a military order, while he knew no such order had passed through his hands as general-in-chief., The writ was suspended, upon urgent representations from California, simply to keep the peace., It never had any direct or indirect reference to any mine, place, or person, except the ""New Almaden"" mine and the persons connected with it., At this late moment I am appealed to in behalf of William Thompson of Company K, Third Maryland Volunteers, in Twelfth Army Corps, said to be at Kelly's Ford, under sentence to be shot to-day as a deserter., He is represented to me to be very young, with symptoms of insanity., Please postpone the execution till further order., Please send me if you can a transcript of the record in the case of McQuin and Bell, convicted of murder by a military commission., I telegraphed General Strong for it, but he does not answer., I mail the papers to you to-day appointing Johnny to the Naval school., Your letter inviting me to attend a mass meeting of unconditional Union men, to be held at the capital of Illinois, on the 3d day of September, has been received., It would be very agreeable for me thus to meet my old friends at my own home, but I cannot just now be absent from here so long as a visit there would require., The meeting is to be of all those who maintain unconditional devotion to the Union, and I am sure that my old political friends will thank me for tendering, as I do, the nation's gratitude to those other noble men whom no partisan malice or partisan hope can make false to the nation's life., There are those who are dissatisfied with me., To such I would say: You desire peace, and you blame me that we do not have it., But how can we obtain it?, There are but three conceivable ways:  First--to suppress the rebellion by force of arms., This I am trying to do., Are you for it?, If you are, so far we are agreed., If you are not for it, a second way is to give up the Union., I am against this., Are you for it?, If you are you should say so plainly., If you are not for force nor yet for dissolution, there only remains some imaginable compromise., I do not believe that any compromise embracing the maintenance of the Union is now possible., All that I learn leads to a directly opposite belief., The strength of the rebellion is its military, its army., That army dominates all the country and all the people within its range., Any offer of terms made by any man or men within that range, in opposition to that army, is simply nothing for the present; because such man or men have no power whatever to enforce their side of a compromise, if one were made with them., To illustrate: Suppose refugees from the South and peace men of the North get together in convention, and frame and proclaim a compromise embracing a restoration of the Union., In what way can that compromise be used to keep Lee's army out of Pennsylvania?, Meade's army can keep Lee's army out of Pennsylvania, and, I think, can ultimately drive it out of existence., But no paper compromise to which the controllers of Lee's army are not agreed can at all affect that army., In an effort at such compromise we would waste time, which the enemy would improve to our disadvantage; and that would be all., A compromise, to be effective, must be made either with those who control the rebel army, or with the people, first liberated from the domination of that army by the success of our own army., Now allow me to assure you that no word or intimation from that rebel army, or from any of the men controlling it, in relation to any peace compromise, has ever come to my knowledge or belief., All charges and insinuations to the contrary are deceptive and groundless., And I promise you that if any such proposition shall hereafter come, it shall not be rejected and kept a secret from you., I freely acknowledge myself to be the servant of the people, according to the bond of service, the United States Constitution, and that, as such, I am responsible to them., But, to be plain: You are dissatisfied with me about the negro., Quite likely there is a difference of opinion between you and myself upon that subject., I certainly wish that all men could be free, while you, I suppose, do not., Yet, I have neither adopted nor proposed any measure which is not consistent with even your view, provided you are for the Union., I suggested compensated emancipation; to which you replied you wished not to be taxed to buy negroes., But I had not asked you to be taxed to buy negroes, except in such way as to save you from greater taxation to save the Union exclusively by other means., You dislike the Emancipation Proclamation, and perhaps would have it retracted., You say it is unconstitutional., I think differently., I think the Constitution invests its commander-in-chief with the law of war in time of war., The most that can be said, if so much, is, that slaves are property., Is there, has there ever been, any question that by the law of war, property, both of enemies and friends, may be taken when needed?, And is it not needed whenever it helps us and hurts the enemy?, Armies, the world over, destroy enemies' property when they cannot use it, and even destroy their own to keep it from the enemy., Civilized belligerents do all in their power to help themselves or hurt the enemy, except a few things regarded as barbarous or cruel., Among the exceptions are the massacre of vanquished foes and non-combatants, male and female., But the proclamation, as law, either is valid or is not valid., If it is not valid it needs no retraction., If it is valid it cannot be retracted, any more than the dead can be brought to life., ...]",3
287,"[""I know as fully as one can know the opinions of others that some of the commanders of our armies in the field, who have given us our most important successes, believe the emancipation policy and the use of colored troops constitute the heaviest blow yet dealt to the rebellion, and that at least one of those important successes could not have been achieved when it was, but for the aid of black soldiers., Among the commanders holding these views are some who have never had any affinity with what is called abolitionism, or with Republican party politics, but who hold them purely as military opinions., I submit these opinions as being entitled to some weight against the objections, often urged, that emancipation and arming the blacks are unwise as military measures and were not adopted as such in good faith."", Yours of the 22d was received yesterday., When I wrote you before, I did not intend, nor do I now, to engage in an argument with you on military questions., You had informed me you were impressed through General Halleck that I was dissatisfied with you, and I could not bluntly deny that I was without unjustly implicating him., I therefore concluded to tell you the plain truth, being satisfied the matter would thus appear much smaller than it would if seen by mere glimpses., I repeat that my appreciation of you has not abated., I can never forget whilst I remember anything, that about the end of last year and the beginning of this, you gave us a hard-earned victory, which, had there been a defeat instead, the nation could hardly have lived over., Neither can I forget the check you so opportunely gave to a dangerous sentiment which was spreading in the North., It is not improbable that retaliation for the recent great outrage at Lawrence, in Kansas, may extend to indiscriminate slaughter on the Missouri border, unless averted by very judicious action., I shall be obliged if the general-in-chief can make any suggestions to General Schofield upon the subject., I am mortified this morning to find the letter to you botched up in the Eastern papers, telegraphed from Chicago., How did this happen?, Ordered, That the executive order dated November 21, 1862, prohibiting the exportation from the United States of arms, ammunition, or munitions of war, under which the commandants of departments were, by order of the Secretary of War dated May 13, 1863, directed to prohibit the purchase and sale, for exportation from the United States, of all horses and mules within their respective commands, and to take and appropriate for the use of the United States any horses, mules, and live stock designed for exportation, be so far modified that any arms heretofore imported into the United States may be re-exported to the place of original shipment, and that any live stock raised in any State or Territory bounded by the Pacific Ocean may be exported from, any port of such State or Territory., I have just seen your despatch to the Secretary of War, who is absent., I also send a despatch from Major Hayner of the 3d showing that he had notice of my order, and stating that the people were jubilant over it, as a victory over the Government extorted by fear, and that he had already collected about $4000 of the money., If he has proceeded since, I shall hold him accountable for his contumacy., On the contrary, no dollar shall be refunded by my order until it shall appear that my act in the case has been accepted in the right spirit., All well and no news except that General Burnside has Knoxville, Ten., Burnside has Kingston and Knoxville, and drove the enemy across the river at Loudon, the enemy destroying the bridge there; captured some stores and one or two trains; very little fighting; few wounded and none killed., No other news of consequence., Yours of August 29 just received., I suppose it was intended by Congress that this government should execute the act in question without dependence upon any other government, State, city, or county., It is, however, within the range of practical convenience to confer with the governments of States, while it is quite beyond that range to have correspondence on the subject with counties and cities., They are too numerous., As instances, I have corresponded with Governor Seymour, but Not with Mayor Opdyke; with Governor Curtin, but not with Mayor Henry., Despatch of yesterday just received., I shall try to find the paper you mention and carefully consider it., In the meantime let me urge that you do your utmost to get every man you can, black and white, under arms at the very earliest moment, to guard roads, bridges, and trains, allowing all the better trained soldiers to go forward to Rosecrans., Of course I mean for you to act in co-operation with and not independently of, the military authorities., It would be a generous thing to give General Wheaton a leave of absence for ten or fifteen days, and if you can do so without injury to the service, please do it., Yesterday at the instance of Mr. Blair, senator, I telegraphed General Meade asking him to grant you a leave of absence, to which he replied that you had not applied for such leave, and that you can have it when you do apply., I suppose it is proper for you to know this., All Tennessee is now clear of armed insurrectionists., You need not to be reminded that it is the nick of time for reinaugurating a loyal State government., Not a moment should be lost., You and the co-operating friends there can better judge of the ways and means than can be judged by any here., I only offer a few suggestions., The reinauguration must not be such as to give control of the State and its representation in Congress to the enemies of the Union, driving its friends there into political exile., The whole struggle for Tennessee will have been profitless to both State and nation if it so ends that Governor Johnson is put down and Governor Harris put up., It must not be so., You must have it otherwise., Let the reconstruction be the work of such men only as can be trusted for the Union., Exclude all others, and trust that your government so organized will be recognized here as being the one of republican form to be guaranteed to the State, and to be protected against invasion and domestic violence., It is something on the question of time to remember that it cannot be known who is next to occupy the position I now hold, nor what he will do., I see that you have declared in favor of emancipation in Tennessee, for which may God bless you., Get emancipation into your new State government constitution and there will be no such word as fail for your cause., The raising of colored troops, I think, will greatly help every way., Yours received., A thousand thanks for the late successes you have given us., We cannot allow you to resign until things shall be a little more settled in East Tennessee., If then, purely on your own account, you wish to resign, we will not further refuse you., It is represented to me that Thomas Edds, in your army, is under sentence of death for desertion, to be executed next Monday., It is also said his supposed desertion is comprised in an absence commencing with his falling behind last winter, being captured and paroled by the enemy, and then going home., If this be near the truth, please suspend the execution till further order and send in the record of the trial., The name is ""Thomas Edds"" not ""Eddies"" as in your despatch., The papers left with me do not designate the regiment to which he belongs., The man who gave me the papers, I do not know how to find again., He only told me that Edds is in the Army of the Potomac, and that he fell out of the ranks during Burnside's mud march last winter., If I get further information I will telegraph again., Your niece, Mrs. Kate Sharp, can now have no difficulty in going to Knoxville, Tenn., as that place is within our military lines., Thanks both for the good news you send and for the sending of it., Whereas the Constitution of the United States has ordained that the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended unless when, in cases of rebellion or invasion, the public safety may require it; and:  Whereas a rebellion was existing on the third day of March, 1863, which rebellion is still existing; and:  Whereas by a statute which was approved on that day it was enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States in Congress assembled that during the present insurrection the President of the United States, whenever in his judgment the public safety may require, is authorized to suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus in any case throughout the United States or any part thereof; and:  Whereas, in the judgment of the President, the public safety does require that the privilege of the said writ shall new be suspended throughout the United States in the cases where, by the authority of the President of the United States, military, naval, and civil officers of the United States, or any of them, hold persons under their command or in their custody, either as prisoners of war, spies, or aiders or abettors of the enemy, or officers, soldiers, or seamen enrolled or drafted or mustered or enlisted in or belonging to the land or naval forces of the United States, or as deserters therefrom, or otherwise amenable to military law or the rules and articles of war or the rules or regulations prescribed for the military or naval services by authority of the President of the United States, or for resisting a draft, or for any other offense against the military or naval service., Now, therefore, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States, do hereby proclaim and make known to all whom it may concern that the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus is suspended throughout the United States in the several cases before mentioned, and that this suspension will continue throughout the duration of the said rebellion or until this proclamation shall, by a subsequent one to be issued by the President of the United States, be modified or revoked., And I do hereby require all magistrates, attorneys, and other civil officers within the United States and all officers and others in the military and naval services of the United States to take distinct notice of this suspension and to give it full effect, and all citizens of the United States to conduct and govern themselves accordingly and in conformity with the Constitution of the United States and the laws of Congress in such case made and provided., In testimony whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed, this fifteenth day of September, A.D. 1863, and of the independence of the United States of America the eighty-eighth., If I did not misunderstand General Meade's last despatch, he posts you on facts as well as he can, and desires your views and those of the Government as to what he shall do., My opinion is that he should move upon Lee at once in manner of general attack, leaving to developments whether he will make it a real attack., I think this would develop Lee's real condition and purposes better than the cavalry alone can do., Of course my opinion is not to control you and General Meade., Mr. Holman will not be jostled from his place with my knowledge and consent., Is Albert Jones of Company K, Third Maryland Volunteers, to be shot on Friday next?, If so please state to me the general features of the case., Major Haynor left here several days ago under a promise to put down in writing, in detail, the facts in relation to the misconduct of the people on the eastern shore of Virginia., He has not returned., Please send him over., Yours in relation to Albert Jones is received., I am appealed to in behalf of Richard M. Abrams of Company A, Sixth New Jersey Volunteers, by Governor Parker, Attorney-General Frelinghuysen, Governor Newell, Hon., Mr. Middleton, M. C., of the district, and the marshal who arrested him., I am also appealed to in behalf of Joseph S. Smith, of Company A, Eleventh New Jersey Volunteers, by Governor Parker, Attorney-General Frelinghuysen, and Hon., Marcus C. Ward., Please state the circumstances of their cases to me., Why not name him for the general you fancy most?, This is my suggestion., I have just ordered the discharge of your boy William, as you say, now at Louisville, Ky.  Herewith I send you a paper, substantially the same as the one drawn up by yourself and mentioned in your despatch, but slightly changed in two particulars: First, yours was so drawn as that I authorized you to carry into effect the fourth section, etc., whereas I so modify it as to authorize you to so act as to require the United States to carry into effect that section., Secondly, you had a clause committing me in some sort to the State constitution of Tennessee, which I feared might embarrass you in making a new constitution, if you desire; so I dropped that clause., In addition to the matters contained in the orders and instructions given you by the Secretary of War, you are hereby authorized to exercise such powers as may be necessary and proper to enable the loyal people of Tennessee to present such a republican form of State government as will entitle the State to the guaranty of the United States therefor, and to be protected under such State government by the United States against invasion and domestic violence, all according to the fourth Section of the fourth article of the Constitution of the United States., By General Meade's despatch to you of yesterday it appears that he desires your views and those of the government as to whether he shall advance upon the enemy., I am not prepared to order, or even advise, an advance in this case, wherein I know so little of particulars, and wherein he, in the field, thinks the risk is so great and the promise of advantage so small., And yet the case presents matter for very serious consideration in another aspect., These two armies confront each other across a small river, substantially midway between the two capitals, each defending its own capital, and menacing the other., General Meade estimates the enemy's infantry in front of him at not less than 40,000., Suppose we add fifty per cent., to this for cavalry, artillery, and extra-duty men stretching as far as Richmond, making the whole force of the enemy 60,000., General Meade, as shown by the returns, has with him, and between him and Washington, of the same classes, of well men, over 90,000., Neither can bring the whole of his men into a battle; but each can bring as large a percentage in as the other., For a battle, then, General Meade has three men to General Lee's two., Yet, it having been determined that choosing ground and standing on the defensive gives so great advantage that the three cannot safely attack the two, the three are left simply standing on the defensive also., If the enemy's 60,000 are sufficient to keep our 90,000 away from Richmond, why, by the same rule, may not 40,000 of ours keep their 60,000 away from Washington, leaving us 50,000 to put to some other use?, ...]",3
288,"[Your immediate duty in regard to Missouri now is to advance the efficiency of that establishment, and to so use it, as far as practicable, to compel the excited people there to let one another alone., Under your recent order, which I have approved, you will only arrest individuals, and suppress assemblies or newspapers, when they may be working palpable injury to the military in your charge; and in no other case will you interfere with the expression of opinion in any form, or allow it to be interfered with violently by others., In this you have a discretion to exercise with great caution, calmness, and forbearance., With the matter of removing the inhabitants of certain counties en masse, and of removing certain individuals from time to time, who are supposed to be mischievous, I am not now interfering, but am leaving to your own discretion., Nor am I interfering with what may still seem to you to be necessary restrictions upon trade and intercourse., I think proper, however, to enjoin upon you the following: Allow no part of the military under your command to be engaged in either returning fugitive slaves or in forcing or enticing slaves from their homes; and, so far as practicable, enforce the same forbearance upon the people., Report to me your opinion upon the availability for good of the enrolled militia of the State., Allow no one to enlist colored troops, except upon orders from you, or from here through you., Allow no one to assume the functions of confiscating property, under the law of Congress, or otherwise, except upon orders from here., At elections see that those, and only those, are allowed to vote who are entitled to do so by the laws of Missouri, including as of those laws the restrictions laid by the Missouri convention upon those who may have participated in the rebellion., So far as practicable, you will, by means of your military force, expel guerrillas, marauders, and murderers, and all who are known to harbor, aid, or abet them., But in like manner you will repress assumptions of unauthorized individuals to perform the same service, because under pretense of doing this they become marauders and murderers themselves., To now restore peace, let the military obey orders, and those not of the military leave each other alone, thus not breaking the peace themselves., In giving the above directions, it is not intended to restrain you in other expedient and necessary matters not falling within their range., I have just seen your despatch to Halleck about Major-General Blunt., If possible, you better allow me to get through with a certain matter here, before adding to the difficulties of it., Meantime supply me the particulars of Major-General Blunt's case., Please give me, as near as you can, the number of slaves you have recruited in Maryland., Of course the number is not to include the free colored., The year that is drawing towards its close has been filled with the blessings of fruitful fields and healthful skies., To these bounties, which are so constantly enjoyed that we are prone to forget the source from which they come, others have been added which are of so extraordinary a nature that they cannot fail to penetrate and soften even the heart which is habitually insensible to the ever-watchful providence of Almighty God., In the midst of a civil war of unequalled magnitude and severity which has sometimes seemed to invite and provoke the aggressions of foreign states; peace has been preserved with all nations, order has been maintained, the laws have been respected and obeyed, and harmony has prevailed everywhere except in the theatre of military conflict; while that theatre has been greatly contracted by the advancing armies and navies of the Union., The needful diversion of wealth and strength from the fields of peaceful industry, to the national defense has not arrested the plough, the shuttle, or the ship: The axe has enlarged the borders of our settlements, and the mines, as well of, iron and coal as of the precious metals, have yielded even more abundantly than heretofore., Population has steadily increased, notwithstanding the waste that has been made in the camp, the siege, and the battle-field; and the country, rejoicing in the consciousness of augmented strength and vigor, is permitted to expect a continuance of years, with large increase of freedom., No human counsel hath devised, nor hath any mortal hand worked out these great things., They are the gracious gifts of the Most High God, who, while dealing with us in anger for our sins, hath nevertheless remembered mercy., It has seemed to me fit and proper that they should be reverently, solemnly, and gratefully acknowledged, as with one heart and voice, by the whole American people., I do, therefore, invite my fellow-citizens in every part of the United States, and also those who are at sea, and those who are sojourning in foreign lands, to set apart and observe the last Thursday of November next as a day of thanksgiving and prayer to our beneficent Father who dwelleth in the heavens., And I recommend to them that, while offering up the ascriptions justly due to Him for such singular deliverances and blessings, they do also, with humble penitence for our national perverseness and disobedience, commend to His tender care all those who have become widows, orphans, mourners, or sufferers in the lamentable civil strife in which we are unavoidably engaged, and fervently implore the interposition of the Almighty hand to heal the wounds of the nation, and to restore it, as soon as may be consistent with divine purposes, to the full enjoyment of peace, harmony, tranquillity, and union., I think you will not have just cause to complain of my action., Yours of yesterday received., If we can hold Chattanooga and East Tennessee, I think the rebellion must dwindle and die., I think you and Burnside can do this, and hence doing so is your main object., Of course to greatly damage or destroy the enemy in your front would be a greater object, because it would include the former and more, but it is not so certainly within your power., I understand the main body of the enemy is very near you, so near that you could ""board at home,"" so to speak, and menace or attack him any day., Would not the doing of this be your best mode of counteracting his raid on your communications?, But this is not an order., I intend doing something like what you suggest whenever the case shall appear ripe enough to have it accepted in the true understanding rather than as a confession of weakness and fear., Your original address, presented on the 30th ult., and the four supplementary ones presented on the 3d inst., have been carefully considered., I hope you will regard the other duties claiming my attention, together with the great length and importance of these documents, as constituting a sufficient apology for not having responded sooner., These papers, framed for a common object, consist of the things demanded and the reasons for demanding them., The things demanded are  First., That General Schofield shall be relieved, and General Butler be appointed as Commander of the Military Department of Missouri., Second., That the system of enrolled militia in Missouri may be broken up, and national forces he substituted for it; and  Third., That at elections persons may not be allowed to vote who are not entitled by law to do so., Among the reasons given, enough of suffering and wrong to Union men is certainly, and I suppose truly, stated., Yet the whole case, as presented, fails to convince me that General Schofield, or the enrolled militia, is responsible for that suffering and wrong., The whole can be explained on a more charitable, and, as I think, a more rational hypothesis., We are in a civil war., In such cases there always is a main question, but in this case that question is a perplexing compound--Union and slavery., It thus becomes a question not of two sides merely, but of at least four sides, even among those who are for the Union, saying nothing of those who are against it., Thus, those who are for the Union with, but not without slavery; those for it without, but not with; those for it with or without, but prefer it with; and those for it with or without, but prefer it without., Among these, again, is a subdivision of those who are for gradual, but not for immediate, and those who are for immediate, but not for gradual extinction of slavery., It is easy to conceive that all these shades of opinion, and even more, may be sincerely entertained by honest and truthful men., Yet, all being for the Union, by reason of these differences each will prefer a different way of sustaining the Union., At once, sincerity is questioned, and motives are assailed., Actual war comming, blood grows hot and blood is spilled., Thought is forced from old channels into confusion., Deception breeds and thrives., Confidence dies, and universal suspicion reigns., Each man feels an impulse to kill his neighbor, lest he be killed by him., Revenge and retaliation follow., And all this, as before said, may be among honest men only., But this is not all., Every foul bird comes abroad, and every dirty reptile rises up., These add crime to confusion., Strong measures deemed indispensable, but harsh at best, such men make worse by maladministration., Murders for old grudges, and murders for self, proceed under any cloak that will best serve for the occasion., These causes amply account for what has occurred in Missouri, without ascribing it to the weakness or wickedness of any general., The newspaper files, those chroniclers of current events, will show that the evils now complained of were quite as prevalent under Fremont, Hunter, Halleck, and Curtis, as under Schofield., If the former had greater force opposed to them, they also had greater force with which to meet it., When the organized rebel army left the State, the main Federal force had to go also, leaving the department commander at home relatively no stronger than before., Without disparaging any, I affirm with confidence that no commander of that department has, in proportion to his means, done better than General Schofield., The first specific charge against General Schofield is, that the enrolled militia was placed under his command, whereas it had not been placed under the command of General Curtis., The fact is, I believe, true; but you do not point out, nor can I conceive, how that did, or could, injure loyal men or the Union cause., You charge that, General Curtis being superseded by General Schofield, Franklin A. Dick was superseded by James O. Broadhead as Provost-Marshal General., No very specific showing is made as to how this did or could injure the Union cause., It recalls, however, the condition of things, as presented to me, which led to a change of commander of that department., To restrain contraband intelligence and trade, a system of searches, seizures, permits, and passes, had been introduced, I think, by General Fremont., When General Halleck came, he found and continued the system, and added an order, applicable to some parts of the State, to levy and collect contributions from noted rebels, to compensate losses and relieve destitution caused by the rebellion., The action of General Fremont and General Halleck, as stated, constituted a sort of system which General Curtis found in full operation when he took command of the department., That there was a necessity for something of the sort was clear; but that it could only be justified by stern necessity, and that it was liable to great abuse in administration, was equally clear., Agents to execute it, contrary to the great prayer, were led into temptation., Some might, while others would not, resist that temptation., It was not possible to hold any to a very strict accountability; and those yielding to the temptation would sell permits and passes to those who would pay most and most readily for them, and would seize property and collect levies in the aptest way to fill their own pockets., Money being the object, the man having money, whether loyal or disloyal, would be a victim., This practice doubtless existed to some extent, and it was, a real additional evil that it could be, and was, plausibly charged to exist in greater extent than it did., When General Curtis took command of the department, Mr. Dick, against whom I never knew anything to allege, had general charge of this system., A controversy in regard to it rapidly grew into almost unmanageable proportions., One side ignored the necessity and magnified the evils of the system, while the other ignored the evils and magnified the necessity; and each bitterly assailed the other., I could not fail to see that the controversy enlarged in the same proportion as the professed Union men there distinctly took sides in two opposing political parties., I exhausted my wits, and very nearly my patience also, in efforts to convince both that the evils they charged on each other were inherent in the case, and could not be cured by giving either party a victory over the other., Plainly, the irritating system was not to be perpetual; and it was plausibly urged that it could be modified at once with advantage., The case could scarcely be worse, and whether it could be made better could only be determined by a trial., In this view, and not to ban or brand General Curtis, or to give a victory to any party, I made the change of commander for the department., I now learn that soon after this change Mr. Dick was removed, and that Mr. Broadhead, a gentleman of no less good character, was put in the place., The mere fact of this change is more distinctly complained of than is any conduct of the new officer, or other consequence of the change., I gave the new commander no instructions as to the administration of the system mentioned, beyond what is contained in the private letter afterwards surreptitiously published, in which I directed him to act solely for the public good, and independently of both parties., Neither any thing you have presented me, nor anything I have otherwise learned, has convinced me that he has been unfaithful to this charge., ...]",3
289,"[Tad is teasing me to have you forward his pistol to him., I remember receiving nothing from you of the 10th, and I do not comprehend your despatch of to-day., In fact I do not remember, if I ever knew, who you are, and I have very little conception as to what you are telegraphing about., On the point of leaving I am told, by a gentleman to whose statements I attach credit, that the opposition policy for the Presidential campaign will be to ""abstain from voting."", J., More likely to abstain from stopping, once they get at it, until they shall have voted several times each., I do not believe Lee can have over 60,000 effective men., Longstreet's corps would not be sent away to bring an equal force back upon the same road; and there is no other direction for them to have come from., Doubtless, in making the present movement, Lee gathered in all available scraps, and added them to Hill's and Ewell's corps; but that is all, and he made the movement in the belief that four corps had left General Meade; and General Meade's apparently avoiding a collision with him has confirmed him in that belief., If General Meade can now attack him on a field no worse than equal for us, and will do so now with all the skill and courage which he, his officers, and men possess, the honor will be his if he succeeds, and the blame may be mine if he fails., Whereas the term of service of a part of the Volunteer forces of the United States will expire during the coming year; and whereas, in addition to the men raised by the present draft, it is deemed expedient to call out three hundred thousand volunteers to serve for three years or during the war, not, however, exceeding three years:  Now, therefore, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States, and Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy thereof, and of the militia of the several States when called into actual service, do issue this my proclamation, calling upon the governors of the different States to raise, and have enlisted into the United States service, for the various companies and regiments in the field from their respective States, the quotas of three hundred thousand men., I further proclaim that all the volunteers thus called out and duly enlisted shall receive advance pay, premium, and bounty, as heretofore communicated to the governors of States by the War Department through the Provost-Marshal-General's office, by special letters., I further proclaim that all volunteers received under this call, as well as all others not heretofore credited, shall be duly credited and deducted from the quotas established for the next draft., I further proclaim that if any State shall fail to raise the quota assigned to it by the War Department under this call, then a draft for the deficiency in said quota shall be made in said State, or in the districts of said State, for their due proportion of said quota, and the said draft shall commence on the 5th day of January, 1864., And I further proclaim that nothing in this proclamation shall interfere with existing orders, or with those which may be issued for the present draft in the States where it is now in progress, or where it has not yet been commenced., The quotas of the States and districts will be assigned by the War Department through the Provost-Marshal-General's office, due regard being had for the men heretofore furnished, whether by volunteering or drafting; and the recruiting will be conducted in accordance with such instructions as have been or may be issued by that department., In issuing this proclamation, I address myself not only to the governors of the several States, but also to the good and loyal people thereof, invoking them to lend their cheerful, willing, and effective aid to the measures thus adopted, with a view to reinforce our victorious army now in the field, and bring our needful military operations to a prosperous end, thus closing forever the fountains of sedition and civil war., It would be useless for Mrs. Dr. Wright to come here., The subject is a very painful one, but the case is settled., I am grateful for your offer of 100,000 men, but as at present advised I do not consider that Washington is in danger, or that there is any emergency requiring 60 or 90 days men., You do not estimate the holding of East Tennessee more highly than I do., There is no absolute purpose of withdrawing our forces from it, and only a contingent one to withdraw them temporarily for the purpose of not losing the position permanently., I am in great hope of not finding it necessary to withdraw them at all, particularly if you raise new troops rapidly for us there., As I do with others, so I will try to see you when you come., There has been no battle recently at Bull Run., I suppose what you have heard a rumor of was not a general battle, but an ""affair"" at Bristow Station on the railroad, a few miles beyond Manassas Junction toward the Rappahannock, on Wednesday, the 14th., It began by an attack of the enemy upon General Warren, and ended in the enemy being repulsed with a loss of four cannon and from four to seven hundred prisoners., A delegation is here saying that our armed colored troops are at many, if not all, the landings on the Patuxent River, and by their presence with arms in their hands are frightening quiet people and producing great confusion., Have they been sent there by any order, and if so, for what reason?, Please come over here., The fact of one of our officers being killed on the Patuxent is a specimen of what I would avoid., It seems to me we could send white men to recruit better than to send negroes and thus inaugurate homicides on punctilio., Taking all our information together, I think it probable that Ewell's corps has started for East Tennessee by way of Abingdon, marching last Monday, say from Meade's front directly to the railroad at Charlottesville., First, the object of Lee's recent movement against Meade; his destruction of the Alexandria and Orange Railroad, and subsequent withdrawal without more motive, not otherwise apparent, would be explained by this hypothesis., Secondly, the direct statement of Sharpe's men that Ewell has gone to Tennessee., Thirdly, the Irishman's [Northern Spy in Richmond] statement that he has not gone through Richmond, and his further statement of an appeal made to the people at Richmond to go and protect their salt, which could only refer to the works near Abingdon., Fourthly, Graham's statement from Martinsburg that Imboden is in retreat for Harrisonburg., This last matches with the idea that Lee has retained his cavalry, sending Imboden and perhaps other scraps to join Ewell., Upon this probability what is to be done?, If you have a plan matured, I have nothing to say., If you have not, then I suggest that, with all possible expedition, the Army of the Potomac get ready to attack Lee, and that in the meantime a raid shall, at all hazards, break the railroad at or near Lynchburg., Yours of the 12th has been in my hands several days., Inclosed I send the leave of absence for your brother, in as good form as I think I can safely put it., Without knowing whether he would accept it., I have tendered the collectorship at Portland, Maine, to your other brother, the governor., Thanks to both you and our friend Campbell for your kind words and intentions., A second term would be a great honor and a great labor, which, together, perhaps I would not decline if tendered., The writer of the accompanying letter is one of Mrs. Lincoln's numerous cousins., He is a grandson of ""Milliken's Bend,"" near Vicksburg--that is, a grandson of the man who gave name to Milliken's Bend., His father was a brother to MRS. Lincoln's mother., I know not a thing about his loyalty beyond what he says., Supposing he is loyal, can any of his requests be granted, and if any, which of them?, In June last a division was substantially lost at or near Winchester, Va. At the time, it was under General Milroy as immediate commander in the field, General Schenck as department commander at Baltimore, and General Halleck as general-in-chief at Washington., General Milroy, as immediate commander, was put in arrest, and subsequently a court of inquiry examined chiefly with reference to disobedience of orders, and reported the evidence., The foregoing is a synoptical statement of the evidence, together with the judge-advocate-general's conclusions., The disaster, when it came, was a surprise to all., It was very well known to Generals Shenck and Milroy for some time before, that General Halleck thought the division was in great danger of a surprise at Winchester; that it was of no service commensurate with the risk it incurred, and that it ought to be withdrawn; but, although he more than once advised its withdrawal, he never positively ordered it., General Schenck, on the contrary, believed the service of the force at Winchester was worth the hazard, and so did not positively order its withdrawal until it was so late that the enemy cut the wire and prevented the order reaching General Milroy., General Milroy seems to have concurred with General Schenck in the opinion that the force should be kept at Winchester at least until the approach of danger, but he disobeyed no order upon the subject., Some question can be made whether some of General Halleck's dispatches to General Schenk should not have been construed to be orders to withdraw the force, and obeyed accordingly; but no such question can be made against General Milroy., In fact, the last order he received was to be prepared to withdraw, but not to actually withdraw until further order, which further order never reached him., Serious blame is not necessarily due to any serious disaster, and I cannot say that in this case any of the officers are deserving of serious blame., No court-martial is deemed necessary or proper in the case., There have recently reached the War Department, and thence been laid before me, from Missouri, three communications, all similar in import and identical in object., One of them, addressed to nobody, and without place or date, but having the signature of (apparently) the writer, is a letter of eight closely written foolscap pages., The other two are written by a different person, at St. Joseph, Mo., and of the dates, respectively, October 12 and 13, 1863, and each inclosing a large number of affidavits., The general statements of the whole are that the Federal and State authorities are arming the disloyal and disarming the loyal, and that the latter will all be killed or driven out of the State unless there shall be a change., In particular, no loyal man who has been disarmed is named, but the affidavits show by name forty-two persons as disloyal who have been armed., They are as follows: [The names are omitted.], A majority of these are shown to have been in the rebel service., I believe it could be shown that the government here has deliberately armed more than ten times as many captured at Gettysburg, to say nothing of similar operations in East Tennessee., These papers contain altogether thirty--one manuscript pages, and one newspaper in extenso, and yet I do not find it anywhere charged in them that any loyal man has been harmed by reason of being disarmed, or that any disloyal one has harmed anybody by reason of being armed by the Federal or State Government., Of course, I have not had time to carefully examine all; but I have had most of them examined and briefed by others, and the result is as stated., The remarkable fact that the actual evil is yet only anticipated--inferred--induces me to suppose I understand the case; but I do not state my impression, because I might be mistaken, and because your duty and mine is plain in any event., The locality of nearly all this seems to be St. Joseph and Buchanan County., I wish you to give special attention to this region, particularly on election day., Prevent violence from whatever quarter, and see that the soldiers themselves do no wrong., If not too inconvenient, please come at once and have a personal conversation with me., Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, that, before the first meeting of the next Congress, and of every subsequent Congress, the clerk of the next preceding House of Representatives shall make a roll of the Representatives elect, and place thereon the names of all persons, and of such persons only, whose credentials show that they were regularly elected in accordance with the laws of their States respectively, or the laws of the United States., The above act of Congress was passed, as I suppose, for the purpose of shutting out improper applicants for seats in the House of Representatives; and I fear there is some danger that it will be used to shut out proper ones., Iowa, having an entire Union delegation, will be one of the States the attempt will be made, if upon any., The Governor doubtless has made out the certificates, and they are already in the hands of the members., I suggest that they come on with them; but that, for greater caution, you, and perhaps Mr. Harlan with you, consult with the Governor, and have an additional set made out according to the form on the other half of this sheet; and still another set, if you can, by studying the law, think of a form that in your judgment, promises additional security, and quietly bring the whole on with you, to be used in case of necessity., Let what you do be kept still., Below is an act of Congress, passed last session, intended to exclude applicants not entitled to seats, but which, there is reason to fear, will be used to exclude some who are entitled., Please get with the Governor and one or two other discreet friends, study the act carefully, and make certificates in two or three forms, according to your best judgement, and have them sent to me, so as to multiply the chances of the delegation getting their seats., Let it be done without publicity., Below is a form which may answer for one., If you could procure the same to be done for the Oregon member it might be well., Much obliged for the information about deserters contained in your dispatch of yesterday, while I have to beg your pardon for troubling you in regard to some of them, when, as it appears by yours, I had the means of answering my own questions., The Provost-Marshal-General has issued no proclamation at all., He has in no form announced anything recently in regard to troops in New York, except in his letter to Governor Seymour of October 21, which has been published in the newspapers of that State., It has not been announced or decided in any form by the Provost-Marshal-General, or any one else in authority of the Government, that every citizen who has paid his three hundred dollars commutation is liable to be immediately drafted again, or that towns that have just raised the money to pay their quotas will have again to be subject to similar taxation or suffer the operations of the new conscription, nor it is probable that the like of them ever will be announced or decided., No important news., Details of Hooker's night fight do great credit to his command, and particularly to the Eleventh Corps and Geary's part of the Twelfth., No discredit on any., Some days ago I understood you to say that your brother, General Frank Blair, desires to be guided by my wishes as to whether he will occupy his seat in Congress or remain in the field., My wish, then, is compounded of what I believe will be best for the country; and it is that he will come here, put his military commission in my hands, take his seat, go into caucus with our friends, abide the nominations, help elect the nominees, and thus aid to organize a House of Representatives which will really support the Government in the war., If the result shall be the election of himself as Speaker, let him serve in that position., If not, let him retake his commission and return to the army for the benefit of the country., ...]",3
290,"[What is the news?, I expected to see you here at Cabinet meeting, and to say something about going to Gettysburg., There will be a train to take and return us., The time for starting is not yet fixed, but when it shall be I will notify you., Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal., Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure., We are met on a great battle-field of that war., We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live., It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this., But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate--we can not consecrate--we can not hallow--this ground., The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract., The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here., It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced., It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us--that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain--that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom--and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth., If there is a man by the name of King under sentence to be shot, please suspend execution till further order, and send record., An intelligent woman in deep distress, called this morning, saying her husband, a lieutenant in the Army of Potomac, was to be shot next Monday for desertion, and putting a letter in my hand, upon which I relied for particulars, she left without mentioning a name or other particular by which to identify the case., On opening the letter I found it equally vague, having nothing to identify by, except her own signature, which seems to be ""Mrs. Anna S., King."", I could not again find her., If you have a case which you shall think is probably the one intended, please apply my dispatch of this morning to it., Yours to Governor Chase in behalf of John A Welch is before me., Can there be a worse case than to desert and with letters persuading others to desert?, I cannot interpose without a better showing than you make., When did he desert?, when did he write the letters?, Two despatches since I saw you; one not quite so late on firing as we had before, but giving the points that Burnside thinks he can hold the place, that he is not closely invested, and that he forages across the river., The other brings the firing up to 11 A.M. yesterday, being twenty-three hours later than we had before., Your despatches as to fighting on Monday and Tuesday are here., Well done!, Many thanks to all., Remember Burnside., I have just received and have read your published letter to the HON., Benjamin R. Curtis., Under the circumstances I may not be the most competent judge, but it appears to me to be a paper of great ability, and for the country's sake more than for my own I thank you for it., Reliable information being received that the insurgent force is retreating from East Tennessee, under circumstances rendering it probable that the Union forces cannot hereafter be dislodged from that important position; and esteeming this to be of high national consequence, I recommend that all loyal people do, on receipt of this information, assemble at their places of worship, and render special homage and gratitude to Almighty God for this great advancement of the national cause., Whereas in and by the Constitution of the United States it is provided that the President ""shall have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States, except in cases of impeachment;"" and,  Whereas a rebellion now exists whereby the loyal State governments of several States have for a long time been subverted, and many persons have committed and are now guilty of treason against the United States; and  Whereas, with reference to said rebellion and treason, laws have been enacted by Congress declaring forfeitures and confiscation of property and liberation of slaves, all upon terms and conditions therein stated, and also declaring that the President was thereby authorized at any time thereafter, by proclamation, to extend to persons who may have participated in the existing rebellion in any State or part thereof pardon and amnesty, with such exceptions and at such times and on such conditions as he may deem expedient for the public welfare; and  Whereas the Congressional declaration for limited and conditional pardon accords with well-established judicial exposition of the pardoning power; and  Whereas, with reference to said rebellion, the President of the United States has issued several proclamations with provisions in regard to the liberation of slaves; and  Whereas it is now desired by some persons heretofore engaged in said rebellion to resume their allegiance to the United States and to reinaugurate loyal State governments within and for their respective States:  Therefore, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States, do proclaim, declare, and make known to all persons who have, directly or by implication, participated in the existing rebellion, except as hereinafter excepted, that a full pardon is hereby granted to them and each of them, with restoration of all rights of property, except as to slaves and in property cases where rights of third parties shall have intervened, and upon the condition that every such person shall take and subscribe an oath and thenceforward keep and maintain said oath inviolate, and which oath shall be registered for permanent preservation and shall be of the tenor and effect following, to wit:  ""I, ------, do solemnly swear, in presence of Almighty God, that I will henceforth faithfully support, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States and the Union of the States thereunder; and that I will in like manner abide by and faithfully support all acts of Congress passed during the existing rebellion with reference to slaves, so long and so far as not repealed, modified, or held void by Congress or by decision of the Supreme Court; and that I will in like manner abide by and faithfully support all proclamations of the President made during the existing rebellion having reference to slaves, so long and so far as not modified or declared void by decision of the Supreme Court., So help me God."", The persons excepted from the benefits of the foregoing provisions are all who are or shall have been civil or diplomatic officers or agents of the so-called Confederate Government; all who have left judicial stations under the United States to aid the rebellion; all who are or shall have been military or naval officers of said so-called Confederate Government above the rank of colonel in the army or of lieutenant in the navy; all who left seats in the United States Congress to aid the rebellion; all who resigned commissions in the Army or Navy of the United States and afterwards aided the rebellion; and all who have engaged in any way in treating colored persons, or white persons in charge of such, otherwise than lawfully as prisoners of war, and which persons may have been found in the United States service as soldiers, seamen, or in any other capacity., And I do further proclaim, declare, and make known that whenever, in any of the States of Arkansas, Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee, Alabama, Georgia, Florida, South Carolina, and North Carolina, a number of persons, not less than one-tenth in number of the votes cast in such State at the Presidential election of the year A.D. 1860, each having taken oath aforesaid, and not having since violated it, and being a qualified voter by the election law of the State existing immediately before the so-called act of secession, and excluding all others, shall reestablish a State government which shall be republican and in nowise contravening said oath, such shall be recognized as the true government of the State, and the State shall receive thereunder the benefits of the constitutional provision which declares that ""the United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a republican form of government and shall protect each of them against invasion, and, on application of the legislature, or the EXECUTIVE (when the legislature can not be convened), against domestic violence."", And I do further proclaim, declare, and make known that any provision which may be adopted by such State government in relation to the freed people of such State which shall recognize and declare their permanent freedom, provide for their education, and which may yet be consistent as a temporary arrangement with their present condition as a laboring, landless, and homeless class, will not be objected to by the National EXECUTIVE., And it is suggested as not improper that in constructing a loyal State government in any State the name of the State, the boundary, the subdivisions, the constitution, and the general code of laws as before the rebellion be maintained, subject only to the modifications made necessary by the conditions hereinbefore stated, and such others, if any, not contravening said co and which may be deemed expedient by those framing the new State government., To avoid misunderstanding, it may be proper to say that this proclamation, so far as it relates to State governments, has no reference to States wherein loyal State governments have all the while been maintained., And for the same reason it may be proper to further say that whether members sent to Congress from any State shall be admitted to seats constitutionally rests exclusively with the respective Houses, and not to any extent with the EXECUTIVE., And, still further, that this proclamation is intended to present the people of the States wherein the national authority has been suspended and loyal State governments have been subverted a mode in and by which the national authority and loyal State governments may be re-established within said States or in any of them; and while the mode presented is the best the EXECUTIVE can suggest, with his present impressions, it must not be understood that no other possible mode would be acceptable., Another year of health, and of sufficiently abundant harvests, has passed., For these, and especially for the improved condition cf our national affairs, our renewed and profoundest gratitude to God is due., We remain in peace and friendship with foreign powers., The efforts of disloyal citizens of the United States to involve us in foreign wars, to aid an inexcusable insurrection, have been unavailing., Her Britannic Majesty's government, as was justly expected, have exercised their authority to prevent the departure of new hostile expeditions from British ports., The Emperor of France has, by a like proceeding, promptly vindicated the neutrality which he proclaimed at the beginning of the contest., Questions of great intricacy and importance have arisen out of the blockade, and other belligerent operations, between the Government and several of the maritime powers, but they have been discussed, and, as far as was possible, accommodated, in a spirit of frankness, justice, and mutual good-will., It is especially gratifying that our prize courts, by the impartiality of their adjudications, have commanded the respect and confidence of maritime powers., The supplemental treaty between the United States and Great Britain for the suppression of the African slave-trade, made on the 17th day of February last, has been duly ratified and carried into execution., It is believed that, so far as American ports and American citizens are concerned, that inhuman and odious traffic has been brought to an end., I shall submit, for the consideration of the Senate, a convention for the adjustment of possessory claims in Washington Territory, arising out of the treaty of the 15th of June, 1846, between the United States and Great Britain, and which have been the source of some disquiet among the citizens of that now rapidly improving part of the country., A novel and important question, involving the extent of the maritime jurisdiction of Spain in the waters which surround the island of Cuba, has been debated without reaching an agreement, and it is proposed, in an amicable spirit, to refer it to the arbitrament of a friendly power., A convention for that purpose will be submitted to the Senate., I have thought it proper, subject to the approval of the Senate, to concur with the interested commercial powers in an arrangement for the liquidation of the Scheldt dues upon the principles which have been heretofore adopted in regard to the imposts upon navigation in the waters of Denmark., The long-pending controversy between this government and that of Chile touching the seizure at Sitana, in Peru, by Chilean officers, of a large amount in treasure belonging to citizens of the United States has been brought to a close by the award of His Majesty the King of the Belgians, to whose arbitration the question was referred by the parties., The subject was thoroughly and patiently examined by that justly respected magistrate, and although the sum awarded to the claimants may not have been as large as they expected there is no reason to distrust the wisdom of His Majesty's decision., That decision was promptly complied with by Chile when intelligence in regard to it reached that country., The joint commission under the act of the last session of carrying into effect the convention with Peru on the subject of claims has been organized at Lima, and is engaged in the business intrusted to it., Difficulties concerning interoceanic transit through Nicaragua are in course of amicable adjustment., In conformity with principles set forth in my last annual message, I have received a representative from the United States of Colombia, and have accredited a minister to that Republic., Incidents occurring in the progress of our civil war have forced upon my attention the uncertain state of international questions touching the rights of foreigners in this country and of United States citizens abroad., In regard to some governments these rights are at least partially defined by treaties., In no instance, however, is it expressly stipulated that in the event of civil war a foreigner residing in this country within the lines of the insurgents is to be exempted from the rule which classes him as a belligerent, in whose behalf the government of his country can not expect any privileges or immunities distinct from that character., I regret to say, however, that such claims have been put forward, and in some instances in behalf of foreigners who have lived in the United States the greater part of their lives., There is reason to believe that many persons born in foreign countries who have declared their intention to become citizens, or who have been fully naturalized have evaded the military duty required of them by denying the fact and thereby throwing upon the Government the burden of proof., It has been found difficult or impracticable to obtain this proof from the want of guides to the proper sources of information., These might be supplied by requiring clerks of courts where declarations of intention may be made or naturalizations effected to send periodically lists of the names of the persons naturalized or declaring their intention to become citizens to the Secretary of the Interior, in whose Department those names might be arranged and printed for general information., There is also reason to believe that foreigners frequently become citizens of the United States for the sole purpose of evading duties imposed by the laws of their native countries, to which on becoming naturalized here they at once repair, and though never returning to the United States they still claim the interposition of this government as citizens., Many altercations and great prejudices have heretofore arisen out of this abuse., It is therefore submitted to your serious consideration., It might be advisable to fix a limit beyond which no citizen of the United States residing abroad may claim the interposition of his government., The right of suffrage has often been assumed and exercised by aliens under pretenses of naturalization, which they have disavowed when drafted into the military service., I submit the expediency of such an amendment of the law as will make the fact of voting an estoppe against any plea of exemption from military service or other civil obligation on the ground of alienage., In common with other Western powers, our relations with Japan have been brought into serious jeopardy through the perverse opposition of the hereditary aristocracy of the Empire to the enlightened and liberal policy of the Tycoon, designed to bring the country into the society of nations., It is hoped, although not with entire confidence, that these difficulties may be peacefully overcome., I ask your attention to the claim of the minister residing there for the damages he sustained in the destruction by fire of the residence of the legation at Yedo., Satisfactory arrangements have been made with the Emperor of Russia, which, it is believed, will result in effecting a continuous line of telegraph through that Empire from our Pacific coast., I recommend to your favorable consideration the subject of an international telegraph across the Atlantic Ocean, and also of a telegraph between this capital and the national forts along the Atlantic seaboard and the Gulf of Mexico., Such communications, established with any reasonable outlay, would be economical as well as effective aids to the diplomatic, military, and naval service., The consular system of the United States, under the enactments of the last Congress, begins to be self-sustaining, and there is reason to hope that it may become entirely so with the increase of trade which will ensue whenever peace is restored., Our ministers abroad have been faithful in defending American rights., In protecting commercial interests our consuls have necessarily had to encounter increased labors and responsibilities growing out of the war., These they have for the most part met and discharged with zeal and efficiency., This acknowledgment justly includes those consuls who, residing in Morocco, Egypt, Turkey, Japan, China, and other Oriental countries, are charged with complex functions and extraordinary powers., The condition of the several organized Territories is generally satisfactory, although Indian disturbances in New Mexico have not been entirely suppressed., The mineral resources of Colorado, Nevada, Idaho, New Mexico, and Arizona are proving far richer than has been heretofore understood., I lay before you a communication on this subject from the Governor of New Mexico., I again submit to your consideration the expediency of establishing a system for the encouragement of immigration., Although this source of national wealth and strength is again flowing with greater freedom than for several years before the insurrection occurred, there is still a great deficiency of laborers in every field of industry, especially in agriculture and in our mines, as well of iron and coal as of the precious metals., While the demand for labor is much increased here, tens of thousands of persons, destitute of remunerative occupation, are thronging our foreign consulates and offering to emigrate to the United States if essential, but very cheap, assistance can be afforded them., It is easy to see that under the sharp discipline of civil war the nation is beginning a new life., This noble effort demands the aid and ought to receive the attention and support of the Government., Injuries unforeseen by the Government and unintended may in some cases have been inflicted on the subjects or citizens of foreign countries, both at sea and on land, by persons in the service of the United States., As this government expects redress from other powers when similar injuries are inflicted by persons in their service upon citizens of the United States, we must be prepared to do justice to foreigners., If the existing judicial tribunals are inadequate to this purpose, a special court may be authorized, with power to hear and decide such claims of the character referred to as may have arisen under treaties and the public law., Conventions for adjusting the claims by joint commission have been proposed to some governments, but no definitive answer to the proposition has yet been received from any., ...]",3
291,"[Subsequent events have satisfied me of its necessity., The details set forth in the report of the Secretary evince the urgent need for immediate legislative action., I commend the benevolent institutions established or patronized by the Government in this District to your generous and fostering care., The attention of Congress during the last session was engaged to some extent with a proposition for enlarging the water communication between the Mississippi River and the northeastern seaboard, which proposition, however, failed for the time., Since then, upon a call of the greatest respectability, a convention has been held at Chicago upon the same subject, a summary of whose views is contained in a memorial addressed to the President and Congress, and which I now have the honor to lay before you., That this interest is one which ere long will force its own way I do not entertain a doubt, while it is submitted entirely to your wisdom as to what can be done now., Augmented interest is given to this subject by the actual commencement of work upon the Pacific Railroad, under auspices so favorable to rapid progress and completion., The enlarged navigation becomes a palpable need to the great road., I transmit the second annual report of the Commissioner of the Department of Agriculture, asking your attention to the developments in that vital interest of the nation., When Congress assembled a year ago, the war had already lasted nearly twenty months, and there had been many conflicts on both land and sea, with varying results; the rebellion had been pressed back into reduced limits; yet the tone of public feeling and opinion, at home and abroad, was not satisfactory., With other signs, the popular elections then just past indicated uneasiness among ourselves, while, amid much that was cold and menacing, the kindest words coming from Europe were uttered in accents of pity that we are too blind to surrender a hopeless cause., Our commerce was suffering greatly by a few armed vessels built upon and furnished from foreign shores, and we were threatened with such additions from the same quarter as would sweep our trade from the sea and raise our blockade., We had failed to elicit from European governments anything hopeful upon this subject., The preliminary emancipation proclamation, issued in September, was running its assigned period to the beginning of the new year., A month later the final proclamation came, including the announcement that colored men of suitable condition would be received into the war service., The policy of emancipation and of employing black soldiers gave to the future a new aspect, about which hope and fear and doubt contended in uncertain conflict., According to our political system, as a matter of civil administration, the General Government had no lawful power to effect emancipation in any State, and for a long time it had been hoped that the rebellion could be suppressed without resorting to it as a military measure., It was all the while deemed possible that the necessity for it might come, and that if it should the crisis of the contest would then be presented., It came, and, as was anticipated, it was followed by dark and doubtful days., Eleven months having now passed, we are permitted to take another review., The rebel borders are pressed still farther back, and by the complete opening of the Mississippi the country dominated by the rebellion is divided into distinct parts, with no practical communication between them., Tennessee and Arkansas have been substantially cleared of insurgent control, and influential citizens in each, owners of slaves and advocates of slavery at the beginning of the rebellion, now declare openly for emancipation in their respective States., Of those States not included in the emancipation proclamation, Maryland and Missouri, neither of which three years ago would tolerate any restraint upon the extension of slavery into new Territories, dispute now only as to the best mode of removing it within their own limits., Of those who were slaves at the beginning of the rebellion full 100,000 are now in the United States military service, about one-half of which number actually bear arms in the ranks, thus giving the double advantage of taking so much labor from the insurgent cause and supplying the places which otherwise must be filled with so many white men., So far as tested, it is difficult to say they are not as good soldiers as any., No servile insurrection or tendency to violence or cruelty has marked the measures of emancipation and arming the blacks., These measures have been much discussed in foreign countries, and, contemporary with such discussion, the tone of public sentiment there is much improved., At home the same measures have been fully discussed, supported, criticized, and denounced, and the annual elections following are highly encouraging to those whose official duty it is to bear the country through this great trial., Thus we have the new reckoning., The crisis which threatened to divide the friends of the Union is past., Looking now to the present and future, and with reference to a resumption of the national authority within the States wherein that authority has been suspended, I have thought fit to issue a proclamation, a copy of which is herewith transmitted., On examination of this proclamation it will appear, as is believed, that nothing will be attempted beyond what is amply justified by the Constitution., True, the form of an oath is given, but no man is coerced to take it., The man is promised a pardon only in case he voluntarily takes the oath., The Constitution authorizes the Executive to grant or withhold the pardon at his own absolute discretion, and this includes the power to grant on terms, as is fully established by judicial and other authorities., It is also proffered that if in any of the States named a State government shall be in the mode prescribed set up, such government shall be recognized and guaranteed by the United States, and that under it the State shall, on the constitutional conditions, be protected against invasion and domestic violence., The constitutional obligation of the United States to guarantee to every State in the Union a republican form of government and to protect the State in the cases stated is explicit and full., But why tender the benefits of this provision only to a State government set up in this particular way?, This section of the Constitution contemplates a case wherein the element within a State favorable to republican government in the Union may be too feeble for an opposite and hostile element external to or even within the State, and such are precisely the cases with which we are now dealing., An attempt to guarantee and protect a revived State government, constructed in whole or in preponderating part from the very element against whose hostility and violence it is to be protected, is simply absurd., There must be a test by which to separate the opposing elements, so as to build only from the sound; and that test is a sufficiently liberal one which accepts as sound whoever will make a sworn recantation of his former unsoundness., But if it be proper to require as a test of admission to the political body an oath of allegiance to the Constitution of the United States and to the Union under it, why also to the laws and proclamations in regard to slavery?, Those laws and proclamations were enacted and put forth for the purpose of aiding in the suppression of the rebellion., To give them their fullest effect there had to be a pledge for their maintenance., In my judgment, they have aided and will further aid the cause for which they were intended., To now abandon them would be not only to relinquish a lever of power, but would also be a cruel and an astounding breach of faith., I may add at this point that while I remain in my present position I shall not attempt to retract or modify the emancipation proclamation, nor shall I return to slavery any person who is free by the terms of that proclamation or by any of the acts of Congress., For these and other reasons it is thought best that support of these measures shall be included in the oath, and it is believed the Executive may lawfully claim it in return for pardon and restoration of forfeited rights, which he has clear constitutional power to withhold altogether or grant upon the terms which he shall deem wisest for the public interest., It should be observed also that this part of the oath is subject to the modifying and abrogating power of legislation and supreme judicial decision., The proposed acquiescence of the National Executive in any reasonable temporary State arrangement for the freed people is made with the view of possibly modifying the confusion and destitution which must at best attend all classes by a total revolution of labor throughout whole States., It is hoped that the already deeply afflicted people in those States may be somewhat more ready to give up the cause of their affliction if to this extent this vital matter be left to themselves, while no power of the National Executive to prevent an abuse is abridged by the proposition., The suggestion in the proclamation as to maintaining the political framework of the States on what is called reconstruction is made in the hope that it may do good without danger of harm., It will save labor and avoid great confusion., But why any proclamation now upon this subject?, This question is beset with the conflicting views that the step might be delayed too long or be taken too soon., In some States the elements for resumption seem ready for action, but remain inactive apparently for want of a rallying point--a plan of action., Why shall A adopt the plan of B rather than B that of A?, And if A and B should agree, how can they know but that the General Government here will reject their plan?, By the proclamation a plan is presented which may be accepted by them as a rallying point, and which they are assured in advance will not be rejected here., This may bring them to act sooner than they otherwise would., The objections to a premature presentation of a plan by the National Executive consist in the danger of committals on points which could be more safely left to further developments., Care has been taken to so shape the document as to avoid embarrassments from this source., Saying that on certain terms certain classes will be pardoned with rights restored, it is not said that other classes or other terms will never be included., Saying that reconstruction will be accepted if presented in a specified way, it is not said it will never be accepted in any other way., The movements by State action for emancipation in several of the States not included in the emancipation proclamation are matters of profound gratulation., And while I do not repeat in detail what I have heretofore so earnestly urged upon this subject my general views and feelings remain unchanged and I trust that Congress will omit no fair opportunity of aiding these important steps to a great consummation., In the midst of other cares, however important we must not lose sight of the fact that the war power is still our main reliance., To that power alone we look yet for a time to give confidence to the people in the contested regions that the insurgent power will not again overrun them., Until that confidence shall be established little can be done anywhere what is called reconstruction., Hence our chiefest care must still be directed to the Army and Navy who have thus far borne their harder part so nobly and well; and it may be esteemed fortunate that giving the greatest efficiency to these indispensable arms we do also honorably recognize the gallant men, from commander to sentinel, who compose them, and to whom more than to others the world must stand indebted for the home of freedom disenthralled, regenerated, enlarged, and perpetuated., In conformity to the law of July 16, 1862, I most cordially recommend that Captain John Rogers United States Navy, receive a vote of thanks from Congress for the eminent skill and gallantry exhibited by him in the engagement with the rebel armed ironclad steamer Fingal, alias Atlanta, whilst in command of the United States ironclad steamer Weehawken, which led to her capture on the 17th June, 1863, and also for the zeal, bravery, and general good conduct shown by this officer on many occasions., This recommendation is specially made in order to comply with the requirements of the ninth section of the aforesaid act, which is in the following words, viz:  That any line officer of the Navy or Marine Corps may be advanced one grade if upon recommendation of the President by name he receives the thanks of Congress for highly distinguished conduct in conflict with the enemy or for extraordinary heroism in the line of his profession., Congress, on my recommendation, passed a resolution, approved 7th February, 1863, tendering its thanks to Commander D. D. Porter ""for the bravery and skill displayed in the attack on the post of Arkansas on the 10th January, 1863,"" and in consideration of those services, together with his efficient labors and vigilance subsequently displayed in thwarting the efforts of the rebels to obstruct the Mississippi and its tributaries and the important part rendered by the squadron under his command, which led to the surrender of Vicksburg., I do therefore, in conformity to the seventh section of the act approved 16th July, 1862, nominate Commander D. D. Porter to be a rear-admiral in the Navy on the active list from the 4th July, 1863, to fill an existing vacancy., Understanding that your lodgment at Chattanooga and Knoxville is now secure, I wish to tender you, and all under your command, my more than thanks, my profoundest gratitude, for the skill, courage, and perseverance with which you and they, over so great difficulties, have effected that important object., God bless you all!, I have to urge my illness, and the preparation of the message, in excuse for not having sooner transmitted you the inclosed from the Secretary of War and Provost Marshal General in response to yours in relation to recruiting in Pennsylvania., Though not quite as you desire, I hope the grounds taken will be reasonably satisfactory to you., Allow me to exchange congratulations with you on the organization of the House of Representatives, and especially on recent military events in Georgia and Tennessee., Please suspend execution in any and all sentences of death in your department until further order., Lieut., Col. James B. Knox, Tenth Regiment Pennsylvania Reserves, offers his resignation under circumstances inducing me to wish to accept it., But I prefer to know your pleasure upon the subject., Please answer., The oath in the proclamation of December 8 is intended for those who may voluntarily take it, and not for those who may be constrained to take it in order to escape actual imprisonment or punishment., It is intended that the latter class shall abide the granting or withholding of the pardoning power in the ordinary way., The President has no authority as to whether you may raffle for the benevolent object you mention., If there is no objection in the Iowa laws, there is none here., Whereas by an act of the Congress of the United States of the 24th of May, 1828, entitled ""An act in addition to an act entitled 'An act concerning discriminating duties of tonnage and impost' and to equalize the duties on Prussian vessels and their cargoes,"" it is provided that upon satisfactory evidence being given to the President of the United States by the government of any foreign nation that no discriminating duties of tonnage or impost are imposed or levied in the ports of the said nation upon vessels wholly belonging to citizens of the United States or upon the produce, manufactures, or merchandise imported in the same from the United States or from any foreign country, the President is thereby authorized to issue his proclamation declaring that the foreign discriminating duties of tonnage and impost within the United States are and shall be suspended and discontinued so far as respects the vessels of the said foreign nation and the produce, manufactures, or merchandise imported into the United States in the same from the said foreign nation or from any other foreign country, the said suspension to take effect from the time of such notification being given to the President of the United States and to continue so long as the reciprocal exemption of vessels belonging to citizens of the United States and their cargoes, as aforesaid, shall be continued, and no longer; and  Whereas satisfactory evidence has lately been received by me through an official communication of Senor Don Luis Molina, Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary of the Republic of Nicaragua, under date of the 28th of November, 1863, that no other or higher duties of tonnage and impost have been imposed or levied since the second day of August, 1838, in the ports of Nicaragua, upon vessels wholly belonging to citizens of the United States, and upon the produce, manufactures, or merchandise imported in the same from the United States, and from any foreign country whatever, than are levied on Nicaraguan ships and their cargoes in the same ports under like circumstances:  Now, therefore, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States of America, do hereby declare and proclaim that so much of the several acts imposing discriminating duties of tonnage and impost within the United States are, and shall be, suspended and discontinued so far as respects the vessels of Nicaragua, and the produce, manufactures, and the merchandise imported into the United States in the same from the dominions of Nicaragua, and from any other foreign country whatever; the said suspension to take effect from the day above mentioned, and to continue thenceforward so long as the reciprocal exemption of the vessels of the United States, and the produce, manufactures, and merchandise imported into the dominions of Nicaragua in the same, as aforesaid, shall be continued on the part of the government of Nicaragua., Herewith I lay before you a letter addressed to myself by a committee of gentlemen representing the freedmen's aid societies in Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and Cincinnati., The subject of the letter, as indicated above, is one of great magnitude and importance, and one which these gentlemen, of known ability and high character, seem to have considered with great attention and care., Not having the time to form a mature judgment of my own as to whether the plan they suggest is the best, I submit the whole subject to Congress, deeming that their attention thereto is almost imperatively demanded., I understand you have under sentence of death, a tall old man, by the name of Henry F. Luckett., I personally knew him, and did not think him a bad man., Please do not let him be executed unless upon further order from me, and in the meantime send me a transcript of the record., The Indiana delegation in Congress, or at least a large part of them, are very anxious that General Milroy shall enter active service again, and I share in this feeling., He is not a difficult man to satisfy, sincerity and courage being his strong traits., Believing in our cause, and wanting to fight for it, is the whole matter with him., Could you, without embarrassment, assign him a place, if directed to report to you?, Sending a note to the Secretary of the Navy, as I promised, he called over and said that the strikes in the ship-yards had thrown the completion of vessels back so much that he thought General Gilimore's proposition entirely proper., ...]",3
292,"[I am not impressed that the danger is very great or imminent, but I will thank you to give Generals Rosecrans and Curtis, respectively, such orders as may turn their attention thereto and prevent as far as possible the apprehended disturbance., Could you, without it being inconvenient or disagreeable to yourself, immediately take a trip to Arkansas for me?, General Boyle's resignation is accepted, so that your Excellency can give him the appointment proposed., You are directed to have a transport (either a steam or sailing vessel, as may be deemed proper by the Quartermaster-General) sent to the colored colony established by the United States at the island of Vache, on the coast of San Domingo, to bring back to this country such of the colonists there as desire to return., You will have the transport furnished with suitable supplies for that purpose, and detail an officer of the Quartermaster's Department, who, under special instructions to be given, shall have charge of the business., The colonists will be brought to Washington, unless otherwise hereafter directed, and be employed and provided for at the camps for colored persons around that city., Those only will be brought from the island who desire to return, and their effects will be brought with them., Ordered, That a draft of five hundred thousand (500,000) men, to serve for three years or during the war, be made on the tenth (10th) day of March next, for the military service of the United States, crediting and deducting therefrom so many as may have been enlisted or drafted into the service prior to the first (1st) day of March, and not before credited., The United States Government lot in Springfield can be used for a soldiers' home, with the understanding that the Government does not incur any expense in the case., My order to General Steele about an election was made in ignorance of the action your convention had taken or would take., A subsequent letter directs General Steele to aid you on your own plan, and not to thwart or hinder you., Show this to him., ""It had got to be,"" said Mr. Lincoln, ""midsummer, 1862., Things had gone on from bad to worse, until I felt that we had reached the end of our rope on the plan of operations we had been pursuing; that we had about played our last card, and must change our tactics, or lose the game., I now determined upon the adoption of the emancipation policy; and without consultation with, or the knowledge of, the Cabinet, I prepared the original draft of the proclamation, and, after much anxious thought, called a Cabinet meeting upon the subject., This was the last of July or the first part of the month of August, 1862., [The exact date was July 22, 1862.]..., All were present excepting Mr. Blair, the Postmaster-General, who was absent at the opening of the discussion, but came in subsequently., I said to the Cabinet that I had resolved upon this step, and had not called them together to ask their advice, but to lay the subject-matter of a proclamation before them, suggestions as to which would be in order after they had heard it read., Mr. Lovejoy was in error when he informed you that it excited no comment excepting on the part of Secretary Seward., Various suggestions were offered., Secretary Chase wished the language stronger in reference to the arming of the blacks., ""Mr. Blair, after he came in, deprecated the policy on the ground that it would cost the administration the fall elections., Nothing, however, was offered that I had not already fully anticipated and settled in my mind, until Secretary Seward spoke., He said in substance, 'Mr., President, I approve of the proclamation, but I question the expediency of its issue at this juncture., The depression of the public mind, consequent upon our repeated reverses, is so great that I fear the effect of so important a step., It may be viewed as the last measure of an exhausted government, a cry for help; the government stretching forth its hands to Ethiopia, instead of Ethiopia stretching forth her hands to the government.', His idea,"" said the President, ""was that it would be considered our last shriek on the retreat."", [This was his precise expression.], 'Now,' continued Mr. Seward, 'while I approve the measure, I suggest, sir, that you postpone its issue until you can give it to the country supported by military success, instead of issuing it, as would be the case now, upon the greatest disasters of the war.', Mr. Lincoln continued ""The wisdom of the view of the Secretary of State struck me with very great force., It was an aspect of the case that, in all my thought upon the subject, I had entirely overlooked., The result was that I put the draft of the proclamation aside, as you do your sketch for a picture, waiting for a victory., ""From time to time I added or changed a line, touching it up here and there, anxiously watching the process of events., Well, the next news we had was of Pope's disaster at Bull Run., Things looked darker than ever., Finally came the week of the battle of Antietam., I determined to wait no longer., The news came, I think, on Wednesday, that the advantage was on our side., I was then staying at the Soldiers' Home [three miles out of Washington]., Here I finished writing the second draft of the preliminary proclamation; came up on Saturday; called the Cabinet together to hear it, and it was published on the following Monday."", Unless there be some strong reason to the contrary, please send General Kilpatrick to us here, for two or three days., Your letter of [the] second received., Of course Governor Johnson will proceed with reorganization as the exigencies of the case appear to him to require., I do not apprehend he will think it necessary to deviate from my views to any ruinous extent., On one hasty reading I see no such deviation in his program, which you send., When I fixed a plan for an election in Arkansas I did it in ignorance that your convention was doing the same work., Since I learned the latter fact I have been constantly trying to yield my plan to them., I have sent two letters to General Steele, and three or four despatches to you and others, saying that he, General Steele, must be master, but that it will probably be best for him to merely help the convention on its own plan., Some single mind must be master, else there will be no agreement in anything, and General Steele, commanding the military and being on the ground, is the best man to be that master., Even now citizens are telegraphing me to postpone the election to a later day than either that fixed by the convention or by me., This discord must be silenced., The day fixed by the convention for the election is probably the best, but you on the ground, and in consultation with gentlemen there, are to decide., I should have fixed no day for an election, presented no plan for reconstruction, had I known the convention was doing the same things., It is probably best that you merely assist the convention on their own plan, as to election day and all other matters I have already written and telegraphed this half a dozen times., The law only obliges us to keep accounts with States, or at most Congressional Districts, and it would overwhelm us to attempt in counties, cities and towns., Nevertheless we do what we can to oblige in particular cases., In this view I send your dispatch to the Provost-Marshal General, asking him to do the best he can for you., Whereas, by my proclamation of the nineteenth of April, one thousand eight hundred and sixty-one, the ports of the States of South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas were, for reasons therein set forth, placed under blockade; and whereas, the port of Brownsville, in the district of Brazos Santiago, in the State of Texas, has since been blockaded, but as the blockade of said port may now be safely relaxed with advantage to the interests of commerce:  Now, therefore, be it known that I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States, pursuant to the authority in me vested by the fifth section of the act of Congress approved on the 13th of July, 1861, entitled ""An act further to provide for the collection of duties on imports, and for other purposes,"" do hereby declare that the blockade of the said port of Brownsville shall so far cease and determine from and after this date, that commercial intercourse with said port, except as to persons, things, and information hereinafter specified, may, from this date, be carried on, subject to the laws of the United States, to the regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury, and, until the rebellion shall have been suppressed, to such orders as may be promulgated by the general commanding the department, or by an officer duly authorized by him and commanding at said port., This proclamation does not authorize or allow the shipment or conveyance of persons in, or intending to enter, the service of the insurgents, or of things or information intended for their use, or for their aid or comfort, nor, except upon the permission of the Secretary of War, or of some officer duly authorized by him, of the following prohibited articles, namely: cannon, mortars, firearms, pistols, bombs, grenades, powder, saltpeter, sulphur, balls, bullets, pikes, swords, boarding-caps (always excepting the quantity of the said articles which may be necessary for the defense of the ship and those who compose the crew), saddles, bridles, cartridge-bag material, percussion and other caps, clothing adapted for uniforms; sail-cloth of all kinds, hemp and cordage, intoxicating drinks other than beer and light native wines., To vessels clearing from foreign ports and destined to the port of Brownsville, opened by this proclamation, licenses will be granted by consuls of the United States upon satisfactory evidence that the vessel so licensed will convey no persons, property, or information excepted or prohibited above, either to or from the said port; which licenses shall be exhibited to the collector of said port immediately on arrival, and, if required, to any officer in charge of the blockade, and on leaving said port every vessel will be required to have a clearance from the collector of the customs, according to law, showing no violation of the conditions of the license., Any violations of said conditions will involve the forfeiture and condemnation of the vessel and cargo, and the exclusion of all parties concerned from any further privilege of entering the United States during the war for any purpose whatever., In all respects, except as herein specified, the existing blockade remains in full force and effect as hitherto established and maintained, nor is it relaxed by this proclamation except in regard to the port to which relaxation is or has been expressly applied., In witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand, and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed., Done at the city of Washington, this eighteenth day of February, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-four, and of the independence of the United States the eighty-eighth., I desire the case of Midshipman C. Lyon re-examined and if not clearly inconsistent I shall be much obliged to have the recommendation changed., In county and State elections, must citizens of Tennessee take the oath prescribed by Governor Johnson, or will the President's oath of amnesty entitle them to vote?, I have been appointed to hold the March election in Cheatham County, and wish to act understandingly., In county elections you had better stand by Governor Johnson's plan; otherwise you will have conflict and confusion., I have seen his plan., Colonel Sanderson will be ordered to you to-day, a mere omission that it was not done before., The other questions in your despatch I am not yet prepared to answer., Yours of yesterday received., Your conference with citizens approved., Let the election be on the 14th of March as they agreed., General Sickles is not going to Arkansas., He probably will make a tour down the Mississippi and home by the gulf and ocean, but he will not meddle in your affairs., At one time I did intend to have him call on you and explain more fully than I could do by letter or telegraph, so as to avoid a difficulty coming of my having made a plan here, while the convention made one there, for reorganizing Arkansas; but even his doing that has been given up for more than two weeks., Please show this to Governor Murphy to save me telegraphing him., The President directs that the sentences of all deserters who have been condemned by court-martial to death, and that have not been otherwise acted upon by him, be mitigated to imprisonment during the war at the Dry Tortugas, Florida, where they will be sent under suitable guards by orders from army commanders., The commanding generals, who have power to act on proceedings of courts-martial in such cases, are authorized in special cases to restore to duty deserters under sentence, when in their judgment the service will be thereby benefited., Copies of all orders issued under the foregoing instructions will be immediately forwarded to the Adjutant-General and to the Judge-Advocate General., By order of the Secretary of War: B. D. TOWNSEND, Assistant Adjutant-General  I cannot remember at whose request it was that I gave the pass to Mrs., Bulky., Of course detain her, if the evidence of her being a spy is strong against her., I dislike to make changes in office so long as they can be avoided., It multiplies my embarrassments immensely., I dislike two appointments when one will do., Send me the name of some man not the present marshal, and I will nominate him to be Provost-Marshal for Dakota., Your telegram of the twenty-sixth instant asking for a copy of my despatch to Warren Jordan, Esq., at Nashville Press office, has just been referred to me by Governor Johnson., In my reply to Mr. Jordan, which was brief and hurried, I intended to say that in the county and State elections of Tennessee, the oath prescribed in the proclamation of Governor Johnson on the twenty-sixth of January, 1864, ordering an election in Tennessee on the first Saturday in March next, is entirely satisfactory to me as a test of loyalty of all persons proposing or offering to vote in said elections; and coming from him would better be observed and followed., There is no conflict between the oath of amnesty in my proclamation of eighth December, 1863, and that prescribed by Governor Johnson in his proclamation of the twenty-sixth ultimo., No person who has taken the oath of amnesty of eighth December, 1863, and obtained a pardon thereby, and who intends to observe the same in good faith, should have any objection to taking that prescribed by Governor Johnson as a test of loyalty., I have seen and examined Governor Johnson's proclamation, and am entirely satisfied with his plan, which is to restore the State government and place it under the control of citizens truly loyal to the Government of the United States., You ask some instructions from me in relation to the Report of Special Commission constituted by an order of the War Department, dated December 5, 1863, ""to revise the enrolment and quotas of the City and State of New York, and report whether there be any, and what, errors or irregularities therein, and what corrections, if any, should be made."", In the correspondence between the Governor of New York and myself last summer, I understood him to complain that the enrolments in several of the districts of that State had been neither accurately nor honestly made; and in view of this, I, for the draft then immediately ensuing, ordered an arbitrary reduction of the quotas in several of the districts wherein they seemed too large, and said: ""After this drawing, these four districts, and also the seventeenth and twenty-ninth, shall be carefully re-enrolled, and, if you please, agents of yours may witness every step of the process."", In a subsequent letter I believe some additional districts were put into the list of those to be re-enrolled., My idea was to do the work over according to the law, in presence of the complaining party, and thereby to correct anything which might be found amiss., The commission, whose work I am considering, seem to have proceeded upon a totally different idea., ...]",3
293,"[I will close by saying, God bless the women of America., The honorary membership in your association, as generously tendered, is gratefully accepted., You comprehend, as your address shows, that the existing rebellion means more and tends to do more than the perpetuation of African slavery--that it is, in fact, a war upon the rights of all working people., Partly to show that this view has not escaped my attention, and partly that I cannot better express myself, I read a passage from the message to Congress in December, 1861:  ""It continues to develop that the insurrection is largely, if not exclusively, a war upon the first principle of popular government, the rights of the people., Conclusive evidence of this is found in the most grave and maturely considered public documents, as well as in the General tone of the insurgents., In those documents we find the abridgment of the existing right of suffrage, and the denial to the people of all right to participate in the selection of public officers, except the legislature, boldly advocated, with labored argument to prove that large control of the people in government is the source of all political evil., Monarchy itself is sometimes hinted at as a possible refuge from the power of the people., In my present position I could scarcely be justified were I to omit raising a warning voice against this approach of returning despotism., ""It is not needed, nor fitting here, that a General argument should be made in favor of popular institutions; but there is one point, with its connections, not so hackneyed as most others, to which I ask a brief attention., It is the effort to place capital on an equal footing, if not above labor, in the structure of government., It is assumed that labor is available only in connection with capital; that nobody labors unless somebody else, owning capital, somehow by the use of it induces him to labor., This assumed, it is next considered whether it is best that capital shall hire laborers, and thus induce them to work by their own consent or buy them, and drive them to it without their consent., Having proceeded so it is naturally concluded that all laborers are either hired laborers, or what we call slaves., And, further, it is assumed that whoever is once a hired laborer, is fixed in that condition for life., Now there is no such relation between capital and labor as assumed, nor is there any such thing as a free man being fixed for life in the condition of a hired laborer., Both these assumptions are false, and all inferences from them are groundless., ""Labor is prior to, and independent of, capital., Capital is only the fruit of labor, and could never have existed if labor had not first existed., Labor is the superior of capital, and deserves much the higher consideration., Capital has its rights, which are as worthy of protection as any other rights., Nor is it denied that there is, and probably always will be, a relation between capital and labor, producing mutual benefits., The error is in assuming that the whole labor of a community exists within that relation., A few men own capital, and that few avoid labor themselves, and, with their capital, hire or buy another few to labor for them., A large majority belong to neither class--neither work for others, nor have others working for them., In most of the Southern States, a majority of the whole people, of all colors, are neither slaves nor masters; while in the Northern, a large majority are neither hirers nor hired., Men with their families, wives, sons, and daughters--work for themselves, on their farms, in their houses, and in their shops, taking the whole product to themselves, and asking no favors of capital on the one hand, nor of hired laborers or slaves on the other., It is not forgotten that a considerable number of persons mingle their own labor with capital; that is, they labor with their own hands, and also buy or hire others to labor for them, but this is only a mixed and not a distinct class., No principle stated is disturbed by the existence of this mixed class., ""Again, as has already been said, there is not, of necessity, any such thing as the free hired laborer being fixed to that condition for life., Many independent men everywhere in these States, a few years back in their lives, were hired laborers., The prudent penniless beginner in the world labors for wages a while, saves a surplus with which to buy tools or land for himself, then labors on his own account another while, and at length hires another new beginner to help him., This is the just and generous and prosperous system which opens the way to all--gives hope to all, and consequent energy and progress, and improvement of condition to all., No men living are more worthy to be trusted than those who toil up from poverty--none less inclined to touch or take aught which they have not honestly earned., Let them beware of surrendering a political power they already possess, and which, if surrendered, will surely be used to close the door of advancement against such as they, and to fix new disabilities and burdens upon them, till all of liberty shall be lost."", The views then expressed remain unchanged, nor have I much to add., None are so deeply interested to resist the present rebellion as the working people., Let them beware of prejudices, working division and hostility among themselves., The most notable feature of a disturbance in your city last summer was the hanging of some working people by other working people., It should never be so., The strongest bond of human sympathy, outside of the family relation, should be one uniting all working people, of all nations, and tongues, and kindreds., Nor should this lead to a war upon property, or the owners of property., Property is the fruit of labor; property is desirable; is a positive good in the world., That some should be rich shows that others may become rich, and, hence, is just encouragement to industry and enterprise., Let not him who is houseless pull down the house of another, but let him labor diligently and build one for himself, thus by example assuring that his own shall be safe from violence when built., Hon., W. R. Morrison says he has requested you by letter to effect a special exchange of Lieut., Col. A. F. Rogers, of Eightieth Illinois Volunteers, now in Libby Prison, and I shall be glad if you can effect it., Yours of February 29 reached me only four days ago; but the delay was of little consequence, because I found, on feeling around, I could not invite you here without a difficulty which at least would be unpleasant, and perhaps would be detrimental to the public service., Allow me to suggest that if you wish to remain in the military service, it is very dangerous for you to get temporarily out of it; because, with a major-general once out, it is next to impossible for even the President to get him in again., With my appreciation of your ability and correct principle, of course I would be very glad to have your service for the country in the approaching political canvass; but I fear we cannot properly have it without separating you from the military., Whereas, it has become necessary to define the cases in which insurgent enemies are entitled to the benefits of the Proclamation of the President of the United States, which was made on the 8th day of December, 1863, and the manner in which they shall proceed to avail themselves of these benefits; and whereas the objects of that Proclamation were to suppress the insurrection and to restore the authority of the United States; and whereas the amnesty therein proposed by the President was offered with reference to these objects alone:  Now, therefore, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States, do hereby proclaim and declare that the said Proclamation does not apply to the cases of persons who, at the time when they seek to obtain the benefits thereof by taking the oath thereby prescribed, are in military, naval, or civil confinement or custody, or under bonds, or on parole of the civil, military, or naval authorities, or agents of the United States, as prisoners of war, or persons detained for offences of any kind, either before or after conviction; and that on the contrary it does apply only to those persons who, being yet at large, and free from any arrest, confinement, or duress, shall voluntarily come forward and take the said oath, with the purpose of restoring peace, and establishing the national authority., Persons excluded from the amnesty offered in the said Proclamation may apply to the President for clemency, like all other offenders, and their application will receive due consideration., I do further declare and proclaim that the oath presented in the aforesaid proclamation of the 8th of December, 1863, may be taken and subscribed before any commissioned officer, civil, military, or naval, in the service of the United States, or any civil or military officer of a State or Territory not in insurrection, who, by the laws thereof, may be qualified for administering oaths., All officers who receive such oaths are hereby authorized to give certificates thereof to the persons respectively by whom they are made, and such officers are hereby required to transmit the original records of such oaths, at as early a day as may be convenient, to the Department of State, where they will be deposited, and remain in the archives of the Government., The Secretary of State will keep a registry thereof, and will, on application, in proper cases, issue certificates of such records in the customary form of official certificates., The Governor of Kentucky is here, and desires to have the following points definitely fixed:  First., That the quotas of troops furnished, and to be furnished, by Kentucky may be adjusted upon the basis as actually reduced by able-bodied men of hers having gone into the rebel service; and that she be required to furnish no more than her just quotas upon fair adjustment upon such basis., Second., To whatever extent the enlistment and drafting, one or both, of colored troops may be found necessary within the State, it may be conducted within the law of Congress; and, so far as practicable, free from collateral embarrassments, disorders, and provocations., I think these requests of the Governor are reasonable; and I shall be obliged if you will give him a full hearing, and do the best you can to effect these objects., Your letter to Colonel Townsend, inclosing a slip from the ""Herald,"" and asking a court of inquiry, has been laid before me by the Secretary of War, with the request that I would consider it., It is quite natural that you should feel some sensibility on the subject; yet I am not impressed, nor do I think the country is impressed, with the belief that your honor demands, or the public interest demands, such an inquiry., The country knows that at all events you have done good service; and I believe it agrees with me that it is much better for you to be engaged in trying to do more, than to be diverted, as you necessarily would be, by a court of inquiry., Captain Kinney, of whom I spoke to you as desiring to go on your staff, is now in your camp, in company with Mrs., Senator Dixon., Mrs. Grant and I, and some others, agreed last night that I should, by this despatch, kindly call your attention to Captain Kinney., You ask me to put in writing the substance of what I verbally said the other day, in your presence, to Governor Bramlette and Senator Dixon., It was about as follows:  ""I am naturally anti-slavery., If slavery is not wrong, nothing is wrong., I cannot remember when I did not so think and feel, and yet I have never understood that the Presidency conferred upon me an unrestricted right to act officially upon this judgment and feeling., It was in the oath I took that I would to the best of my ability preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States., I could not take the office without taking the oath., Nor was it my view that I might take an oath to get power, and break the oath in using the power., I understood, too, that in ordinary civil administration this oath even forbade me to practically indulge my primary abstract judgment on the moral question of slavery., I had publicly declared this many times, and in many ways., And I aver that, to this day, I have done no official act in mere deference to my abstract judgment and feeling on slavery., I did understand, however, that my oath to preserve the Constitution to the best of my ability, imposed upon me the duty of preserving, by every indispensable means, that government, that nation, of which that Constitution was the organic law., Was it possible to lose the nation and yet preserve the Constitution?, By General law, life and limb must be protected; yet often a limb must be amputated to save a life; but a life is never wisely given to save a limb., I felt that measures, otherwise unconstitutional, might become lawful, by becoming indispensable to the preservation of the Constitution, through the preservation of the nation., Right or wrong, I assumed this ground, and now avow it., I could not feel that to the best of my ability I had even tried to preserve the Constitution, if, to save slavery, or any minor matter, I should permit the wreck of government, country, and Constitution, altogether., When, early in the war, General Fremont attempted military emancipation, I forbade it, because I did not then think it an indispensable necessity., When, a little later, General Cameron, then Secretary of War, suggested the arming of the blacks, I objected, because I did not yet think it an indispensable necessity., When, still later, General Hunter attempted military emancipation, I again forbade it, because I did not yet think the indispensable necessity had come., When, in March, and May, and July, 1862, I made earnest and successive appeals to the Border States to favor compensated emancipation, I believed the indispensable necessity for military emancipation and arming the blacks would come, unless averted by that measure., They declined the proposition, and I was, in my best judgment, driven to the alternative of either surrendering the Union, and with it the Constitution, or of laying strong hand upon the colored element., I chose the latter., In choosing it, I hoped for greater gain than loss, but of this I was not entirely confident., More than a year of trial now shows no loss by it in our foreign relations, none in our home popular sentiment, none in our white military force, no loss by it any how, or anywhere., On the contrary, it shows a gain of quite one hundred and thirty thousand soldiers, seamen, and laborers., These are palpable facts, about which, as facts, there can be no caviling., We have the men; and we could not have had them without the measure., ""And now let any Union man who complains of the measure test himself by writing down in one line that he is for subduing the rebellion by force of arms; and in the next, that he is for taking these hundred and thirty thousand men from the Union side, and placing them where they would be but for the measure he condemns., If he cannot face his case so stated, it is only because he cannot face the truth."", I add a word which was not in the verbal conversation., In telling this tale I attempt no compliment to my own sagacity., I claim not to have controlled events, but confess plainly that events have controlled me., Now, at the end of three years' struggle, the nation's condition is not what either party, or any man, devised or expected., God alone can claim it., ...]",3
294,"[I am much gratified to learn that you got out so large a vote, so nearly all the right way, at the late election; and not less so that your State government including the legislature, is organized and in good working order., Whatever I can I will do to protect you; meanwhile you must do your utmost to protect yourselves., Present my greeting to all., I have the honor to transmit herewith an address to the President of the United States, and through him to both Houses of Congress, on the condition and wants of the people of east Tennessee, and asking their attention to the necessity of some action on the part of the Government for their relief, and which address is presented by a committee of an organization called ""The East Tennessee Relief Association."", Deeply commiserating the condition of these most loyal and suffering people, I am unprepared to make any specific recommendation for their relief., The military is doing and will continue to do the best for them within its power., Their address represents that the construction of direct railroad communication between Knoxville and Cincinnati by way of central Kentucky would be of great consequence in the present emergency., It may be remembered that in the annual message of December, 1861, such railroad construction was recommended., I now add that, with the hearty concurrence of Congress, I would yet be pleased to construct a road, both for the relief of these people and for its continuing military importance., In obedience to the resolution of your honorable body, a copy of which is herewith returned, I have the honor to make the following brief statement, which is believed to contain the information sought:  Prior to and at the meeting of the present Congress, Robert C. Schenck, of Ohio, and Frank P. Blair, Jr., of Missouri, members elect thereto, by and with the consent of the Senate held commissions from the Executive as major-generals in the volunteer army., General Schenck tendered the resignation of his said commission, and took his seat in the House of Representatives, at the assembling thereof, upon the distinct verbal understanding with the Secretary of War and the Executive that he might, at any time during the session, at his own pleasure, withdraw said resignation and return to the field., General Blair was, by temporary assignment of General Sherman, in command of a corps through the battles in front of Chattanooga, and in the march to the relief of Knoxville, which occurred in the latter days of November and early days of December last, and of course was not present at the assembling of Congress., When he subsequently arrived here, he sought, and was allowed by the Secretary of War and the Executive, the same conditions and promise as allowed and made to General Schenck., General Schenck has not applied to withdraw his resignation; but when General Grant was made Lieutenant-General, producing some change of commanders, General Blair sought to be assigned to the command of a corps., This was made known to Generals Grant and Sherman, and assented to by them, and the particular corps for him designated., This was all arranged and understood, as now remembered, so much as a month ago; but the formal withdrawal of General Blair's resignation, and making the order assigning him to the command of the corps, were not consummated at the War Department until last week, perhaps on the 23d of April instant., As a summary of the whole, it may be stated that General Blair holds no military commission or appointment other than as herein stated, and that it is believed he is now acting as major-General upon the assumed validity of the commission herein stated, in connection with the facts herein stated, and not otherwise., There are some letters, notes, telegrams, orders, entries, and perhaps other documents in connection with this subject, which it is believed would throw no additional light upon it, but which will be cheerfully furnished if desired., Not expecting to see you before the spring campaign opens, I wish to express in this way my entire satisfaction with what you have done up to this time, so far as I understand it., The particulars of your plans I neither know nor seek to know., You are vigilant and self-reliant; and, pleased with this, I wish not to obtrude any restraints or constraints upon you., While I am very anxious that any great disaster or capture of our men in great number shall be avoided, I know that these points are less likely to escape your attention than they would be mine., If there be anything wanting which is within my power to give, do not fail to let me know it., And now, with a brave army and a just cause, may God sustain you., In compliance with the request contained in your resolution of the 29th ultimo, a copy of which resolution is herewith returned, I have the honor to transmit the following:  The foregoing constitutes all sought by the resolution so far as is remembered or has been found upon diligent search., I have an imploring appeal in behalf of the citizens who say your Order No.8 will compel them to go north of Nashville., This is in no sense an order, nor is it even a request that you will do anything which in the least shall be a drawback upon your military operations, but anything you can do consistently with those operations for those suffering people I shall be glad of., Our mutual friend, Judge Lewis, tells me you do me the honor to inquire for my personal welfare., I have been very anxious for some days in regard to our armies in the field, but am considerably cheered, just now, by favorable news from them., I am sure you will join me in the hope for their further success; while yourself, and other good mothers, wives, sisters, and daughters, do all you and they can, to relieve and comfort the gallant soldiers who compose them., Enough is known of army operations, within the last five days, to claim our special gratitude to God., While what remains undone demands our most sincere prayers to and reliance upon Him (without whom all effort is vain), I recommend that all patriots at their homes, in their places of public worship, and wherever they may be, unite in common thanksgiving and prayer to Almighty God., I am very much obliged to you for the compliment of this call, though I apprehend it is owing more to the good news received to-day from the Army, than to a desire to see me., I am indeed very grateful to the brave men who have been struggling with the enemy in the field, to their noble commanders who have directed them, and especially to our Maker., Our commanders are following up their victories resolutely and successfully., I think, without knowing the particulars of the plans of General Grant, that what has been accomplished is of more importance than at first appears., I believe, I know (and am especially grateful to know) that General Grant has not been jostled in his purposes, that he has made all his points, and to-day he is on his line as he purposed before he moved his armies., I will volunteer to say that I am very glad at what has happened, but there is a great deal still to be done., While we are grateful to all the brave men and officers for the events of the past few days, we should, above all, be very grateful to Almighty God, who gives us victory., There is enough yet before us requiring all loyal men and patriots to perform their share of the labor and follow the example of the modest General at the head of our armies, and sink all personal consideration for the sake of the country., I commend you to keep yourselves in the same tranquil mood that is characteristic of that brave and loyal man., I have said more than I expected when I came before you., Repeating my thanks for this call, I bid you good-bye., Please tell me what is the trouble with Dr. Hawks., Also please ask Bishop Whittington to give me his view of the case., Complaints are coming to me of disturbances in Canoll, Platte, and Buchanan counties., Please ascertain the truth, correct what is found wrong, and telegraph me., I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of the 28th April, in which you offer to replace the present garrison at Port Trumbull with volunteers, which you propose to raise at your own expense., While it seems inexpedient at this time to accept this proposition on account of the special duties now devolving upon the garrison mentioned, I cannot pass unnoticed such a meritorious instance of individual patriotism., Permit me, for the Government, to express my cordial thanks to you for this generous and public-spirited offer, which is worthy of note among the many called forth in these times of national trial., I am very truly, your obedient servant,  In response to your address, allow me to attest the accuracy of its historical statements, indorse the sentiments it expresses, and thank you in the nation's name for the sure promise it gives., Nobly sustained, as the Government has been, by all the churches, I would utter nothing which might in the least appear invidious against any., Yet without this, it may fairly be said, that the Methodist Episcopal Church, not less devoted than the best, is by its greatest numbers the most important of all., It is no fault in others that the Methodist Church sends more soldiers to the field, more nurses to the hospitals, and more prayers to Heaven than--any other., God bless the Methodist Church Bless all the churches; and blessed be God, who in this our great trial giveth us the churches., If any such proclamation has appeared, it is a forgery., Whereas there has been wickedly and traitorously printed and published this morning in the New York World and New York Journal of Commerce, newspapers printed and published in the city of New York, a false and spurious proclamation purporting to be signed by the President and to be countersigned by the Secretary of State, which publication is of a treasonable nature, designed to give aid and comfort to the enemies of the United States and to the rebels now at war against the Government and their aiders and abettors, you are therefore hereby commanded forthwith to arrest and imprison in any fort or military prison in your command, the editors, proprietors, and publishers of the aforesaid newspapers, and all such persons as, after public notice has been given of the falsehood of said publication, print and publish the same with intent to give aid and comfort to the enemy; and you will hold the persons so arrested in close custody until they can be brought to trial before a military commission for their offense., You will also take possession by military force of the printing establishments of the New York World and Journal of Commerce, and hold the same until further orders, and prohibit any further publication therefrom., Until receiving your dispatch of yesterday, the idea of commissions in the volunteers expiring at the end of three years had not occurred to me., I think no trouble will come of it; and, at all events, I shall take care of it so far as in me lies., As to the major-generalships in the regular army, I think I shall not dispose of another, at least until the combined operations now in progress, under direction of General Grant, and within which yourself and command are included, shall be terminated., Meanwhile, on behalf of yourself, officers, and men, please accept my hearty thanks for what you and they have so far done., It is officially announced by the State Department that citizens of the United States holding commissions and recognized as Consuls of foreign powers, are not by law exempt from military service if drafted:  Therefore the mere enrolment of a citizen holding a foreign consulate will not be held to vacate his commission, but if he shall be drafted his exequatur will be revoked unless he shall have previously resigned in order that another Consul may be received., An exequatur bearing date the 3d day of May, 1858, having been issued to Charles Hunt, a citizen of the United States, recognizing him as a Consul of Belgium for St. Louis, Missouri, and declaring him free to exercise and enjoy such functions, powers, and privileges as are allowed to the Consuls of the most favored nations in the United States, and the said Hunt having sought to screen himself from his military duty to his country, in consequence of thus being invested with the consular functions of a foreign power in the United States, it is deemed advisable that the said Charles Hunt should no longer be permitted to continue in the exercise of said functions, powers, and privileges., These are therefore to declare that I no longer recognize the said Hunt as Consul of Belgium, for St. Louis, Missouri, and will not permit him to exercise or enjoy any of the functions, powers or privileges allowed to consuls of that nation, and that I do hereby wholly revoke and annul the said exequatur heretofore given, and do declare the same to be absolutely null and void from this day forward., The getting forward of hundred-day troops to sustain General Sherman's lengthening lines promises much good., Please put your best efforts into the work., I cannot postpone the execution of a convicted spy on a mere telegraphic despatch signed with a name I never heard before., General Wallace may give you a pass to see him if he chooses., Yours to Secretary of War [received] asking for something cheering., We have nothing bad from anywhere., I have just seen a despatch of Grant, of 11 P.M., May 23, on the North Anna and partly across it, which ends as follows: ""Everything looks exceedingly favorable for us."", We have nothing later from him., Mr. J. C. Swift wishes a pass from me to follow your army to pick up rags and cast-off clothing., I will give it to him if you say so, otherwise not., I am again pressed with the claim of Mr. Marshall O. Roberts, for transportation of what was called the Naval Brigade from New York to Fortress Monroe., This force was a special organization got up by one Bartlett, in pretended pursuance of written authority from me, but in fact, pursuing the authority in scarcely anything whatever., The credit given him by Mr. Roberts, was given in the teeth of the express declaration that the Government would not be responsible for the class of expenses to which it belonged., After all some part of the transportation became useful to the Government, and equitably should be paid for; but I have neither time nor means to ascertain this equitable amount, or any appropriation to pay it with if ascertained., If the Quartermaster at New York can ascertain what would compensate for so much of the transportation as did result usefully to the Government, it might be a step towards reaching justice., I write this from memory, but I believe it is substantially correct., Your letter, inviting me to be present at a mass meeting of loyal citizens, to be held at New York on the 4th instant, for the purpose of expressing gratitude to Lieutenant-General Grant for his signal services, was received yesterday., It is impossible for me to attend., I approve, nevertheless, of whatever may tend to strengthen and sustain General Grant and the noble armies now under his direction., My previous high estimate of General Grant has been maintained and heightened by what has occurred in the remarkable campaign he is now conducting, while the magnitude and difficulty of the task before him does not prove less than I expected., He and his brave soldiers are now in the midst of their great trial, and I trust that at your meeting you will so shape your good words that they may turn to men and guns, moving to his and their support., Swett is unquestionably all right., Mr. Holt is a good man, but I had not heard or thought of him for Vice-President., Wish not to interfere about Vice-President., Cannot interfere about platform., Convention must judge for itself., Private James McCarthy, of the One-hundred and fortieth New York Volunteers, is here under sentence to the Dry Tortugas for an attempt to desert., His friends appeal to me and if his colonel and you consent, I will send him to his regiment., Please answer., Yours of to-day received., I am unable to conceive how a message can be less safe by the express than by a staff-officer., If you send a verbal message, the messenger is one additional person let into the secret., I will neither conceal my gratification nor restrain the expression of my gratitude that the Union people, through their convention, in their continued effort to save and advance the nation, have deemed me not unworthy to remain in my present position., I know no reason to doubt that I shall accept the nomination tendered; and yet perhaps I should not declare definitely before reading and considering what is called the platform., I will say now, however, I approve the declaration in favor of so amending the Constitution as to prohibit slavery throughout the nation., ...]",3
295,"[We accepted this war, and did not begin it., We accepted it for an object, and when that object is accomplished the war will end, and I hope to God that it will never end until that object is accomplished., We are going through with our task, so far as I am concerned, if it takes us three years longer., I have not been in the habit of making predictions, but I am almost tempted now to hazard one., I will., It is, that Grant is this evening in a position, with Meade and Hancock, of Pennsylvania, whence he can never be dislodged by the enemy until Richmond is taken., If I shall discover that General Grant may be greatly facilitated in the capture of Richmond by rapidly pouring to him a large number of armed men at the briefest notice, will you go?, Will you march on with him?, [Cries of ""Yes, yes.""], Then I shall call upon you when it is necessary., By authority of the Constitution, and moved thereto by the fourth section of the act of Congress, entitled ""An act making appropriations for the support of the army for the year ending the thirtieth of June, eighteen hundred and sixty-five, and for other purposes, approved June is, 1864,"" I require your opinion in writing as to what pay, bounty, and clothing are allowed by law to persons of color who were free on the nineteenth day of April, 1861, and who have been enlisted and mustered into the military service of the United States between the month of December, 1862, and the sixteenth of June, 1864., Please answer as you would do, on my requirement, if the act of June 15, 1864, had not been passed, and I will so use your opinion as to satisfy that act., All well and very warm., Tad and I have been to General Grant's army., Returned yesterday safe and sound., Complaint is made to me that General Brown does not do his best to suppress bushwhackers., Please ascertain and report to me., Your letter of the 14th inst.., formally notifying me that I have been nominated by the convention you represent for the Presidency of the United States for four years from the 4th of March next, has been received., The nomination is gratefully accepted, as the resolutions of the convention, called the platform, are heartily approved., While the resolution in regard to the supplanting of republican government upon the Western Continent is fully concurred in, there might be misunderstanding were I not to say that the position of the Government in relation to the action of France in Mexico, as assumed through the State Department and indorsed by the convention among the measures and acts of the Executive, will be faithfully maintained so long as the state of facts shall leave that position pertinent and applicable., I am especially gratified that the soldier and seaman were not forgotten by the convention, as they forever must and will be remembered by the grateful country for whose salvation they devote their lives., Thanking you for the kind and complimentary terms in which you have communicated the nomination and other proceedings of the convention, I subscribe myself,  I understand that Congress declines to admit to seats the persons sent as Senators and Representatives from Arkansas., These persons apprehend that, in consequence, you may not support the new State government there as you otherwise would., My wish is that you give that government and the people there the same support and protection that you would if the members had been admitted, because in no event, nor in any view of the case, can this do any harm, while it will be the best you can do toward suppressing the rebellion., Dr. Worster wishes to visit you with a view of getting your permission to introduce into the army ""Harmon's Sandal Sock."", Shall I give him a pass for that object?, I have nominated you to be Secretary of the Treasury, in place of Governor Chase, who has resigned., Please come without a moment's delay., Complaint is made to me that you are using your official power to defeat Mr. Arnold's nomination to Congress., I am well satisfied with Mr. Arnold as a member of Congress, and I do not know that the man who might supplant him would be as satisfactory; but the correct principle, I think, is that all our friends should have absolute freedom of choice among our friends., My wish, therefore, is that you will do just as you think fit with your own suffrage in the case, and not constrain any of your subordinates to [do] other than [as] he thinks fit with his., This is precisely the rule I inculcated and adhered to on my part, when a certain other nomination, now recently made, was being canvassed for., You say telegraphic communication is re-established with Sandy Hook., Well, what does Sandy Hook say about operations of enemy and of Sigel during to-day?, The President directs me to inform you that a rebel force, variously estimated at from fifteen to twenty thousand men, have invaded the State of Maryland, and have taken Martinsburg and Harper's Ferry, and are threatening other points; that the public safety requires him to call upon the State executives for a militia force to repel this invasion., He therefore directs me to call on you for a militia force of twelve thousand men from your State to serve not more than one hundred days, and to request that you will with the utmost despatch forward the troops to Washington by rail or steamboat as may be most expeditious., Whereas, by a proclamation which was issued on the 15th day of April, 1861, the President of the United States announced and declared that the laws of the United States had been for some time past, and then were, opposed and the execution thereof obstructed in certain States therein mentioned, by combinations too powerful to be suppressed by the ordinary course of judicial proceedings or by the power vested in the marshals by law; and  Whereas, immediately after the issuing of the said proclamation the land and naval forces of the United States were put into activity to suppress the said insurrections and rebellion; and  Whereas, the Congress of the United States, by an act approved on the third day of March, 1863, did enact that during the said rebellion the President of the United States, whenever in his judgment the public safety may require it, is authorized to suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus in any case throughout the United States, or any part thereof; and  Whereas, the said insurrection and rebellion still continue, endangering the existence of the Constitution and Government of the United States; and  Whereas, the military forces of the United States are now actively engaged in suppressing the said insurrection and rebellion in various parts of the States where the said rebellion has been successful in obstructing the laws and public authorities, especially in the States of Virginia and Georgia; and  Whereas, on the fifteenth day of September last, the President of the United States duly issued his proclamation, wherein he declared that the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus should be suspended throughout the United States, in Cases whereby the authority of the President of the United States, the military, naval, and civil officers of the United States, or any of them, hold persons under their command or in their custody, either as prisoners of war, spies, or aiders or abettors of the enemy, or officers, soldiers, or seamen enrolled or drafted, or mustered, or enlisted in, or belonging to the land or naval forces of the United States, or as deserters therefrom, or otherwise amenable to military law, or the rules and articles of war, or the rules and regulations prescribed for the military and naval service by authority of the President of the United States, or for resisting a draft, or for any other offence against the military or naval service; and  Whereas, many citizens of the State of Kentucky have joined the forces of the insurgents, who have on several occasions entered the said State of Kentucky in large force and not without aid and comfort furnished by disaffected and disloyal citizens of the United States residing therein, have not only greatly disturbed the public peace but have overborne the civil authorities and made flagrant civil war, destroying property and life in various parts of the State; and  Whereas, it has been made known to the President of the United States, by the officers commanding the National armies, that combinations have been formed in the said State of Kentucky, with a purpose of inciting the rebel forces to renew the said operations of civil war within the said State, and thereby to embarrass the United States armies now operating in the said States of Virginia and Georgia, and even to endanger their safety., Now, therefore, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws, do hereby declare that in my judgment the public safety especially requires that the suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus so proclaimed in the said proclamation of the 15th of September, 1863, be made effectual and be duly enforced in and throughout the said State of Kentucky, and that martial law be for the present declared therein., I do therefore hereby require of the military officers of the said State that the privilege of the habeas corpus be effectually suspended within the said State, according to the aforesaid proclamation, and that martial law be established therein to take effect from the date of this proclamation, the said suspension and establishment of martial law to continue until this proclamation shall be revoked or modified, but not beyond the period when the said rebellion shall have been suppressed or come to an end., And I do hereby require and command, as well as military officers, all civil officers and authorities existing or found within the said State of Kentucky, to take notice of this proclamation and to give full effect to the same., The martial laws herein proclaimed and the things in that respect herein ordered will not be deemed or taken to interfere with the holding of lawful elections, or with the proceedings of the constitutional Legislature of Kentucky, or with the administration of justice in the courts of law existing therein between citizens of the United States in suits or proceedings which do not affect the military operations or the constituted authorities of the government of the United States., In testimony whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed., Done at the City of Washington this 5th day of July, in the year of our Lord 1864, and of the independence of the United States the eighty-eighth., Whereas, the Senate and House of Representatives at their last session adopted a concurrent resolution, which was approved on the second day of July instant, and which `was in the words following, namely:  That the President of the United States be requested to appoint a day of humiliation and prayer by the people of the United States, that he request his constitutional advisers at the head of the Executive Departments to unite with him, as Chief Magistrate of the nation, at the City of Washington, and the members of Congress, and all magistrates, all civil, military, and naval officers, all soldiers, sailors, and marines, with all loyal and law-abiding people, to convene at their usual places of worship, or wherever they may be, to confess and to repent of their manifold sins, to implore the compassion and forgiveness of the Almighty, that, if consistent with His will, the existing rebellion may be speedily suppressed, and the supremacy of the Constitution and laws of the United States may be established throughout all the States; to implore Him, as the Supreme Ruler of the world, not to destroy us as a people, nor suffer us to be destroyed by the hostility or connivance of other nations, or by obstinate adhesion to our own counsels which may be in conflict with His eternal, purposes, and to implore Him to enlighten the mind of the nation to know and do His will, humbly believing that it is in accordance with His will that our place should be maintained as a united people among the family of nations; to implore Him to grant to our armed defenders, and the masses of the people, that courage, power of resistance, and endurance necessary to secure that result; to implore Him in His infinite goodness to soften the hearts, enlighten the minds, and quicken the conscience of those in rebellion, that they may lay down their arms, and speedily return to their allegiance to the United States, that they may not be utterly destroyed, that the effusion of blood may be stayed, and that unity and fraternity may be restored, and peace established throughout all our borders., Now, therefore, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the `United States, cordially concurring with the Congress of the United States, in the penitential and pious sentiments expressed in the aforesaid resolutions, and heartily approving of the devotional design and purpose thereof, do hereby appoint the first Thursday of August next to be observed by the people of the United States as a day of national humiliation and prayer., I do hereby further invite and request the heads of the Executive Departments of this Government, together with all legislators, all judges and magistrates, and all other persons exercising authority in the land, whether civil, military, or naval, and all soldiers, seamen, and marines in the national service, and all other loyal and law-abiding people of the United States, to assemble in their preferred places of public worship on that day, and there to render to the Almighty and merciful Ruler of the Universe, such homage and such confessions, and to offer to Him such supplications as the Congress of the United States have, in their aforesaid resolution, so solemnly, so earnestly, and so reverently recommended., In testimony whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed., Done at the city of Washington this seventh day of July, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-four, and of the independence of the United States the eighty-ninth., Whereas at the late session Congress passed a bill ""to guarantee to certain states whose governments have been usurped or overthrown a republican form of government,"" a copy of which is hereunto annexed; and  Whereas, the said bill was presented to the President of the United States for his approval less than one hour before the sine die adjournment of said session, and was not signed by him; and  Whereas the said bill contains, among other things, a plan for restoring the States in rebellion to their proper practical relation in the Union, which plan expresses the sense of Congress upon that subject, and which plan it is now thought fit to lay before the people for their consideration:  Now, therefore, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States, do proclaim, declare, and make known that while I am (as I was in December last, when, by proclamation, I propounded a plan for restoration) unprepared by a formal approval of this bill to be inflexibly committed to any single plan of restoration, and while I am also unprepared to declare that the free State constitutions and governments already adopted and installed in Arkansas and Louisiana shall be set aside and held for naught, thereby repelling and discouraging the loyal citizens who have set up the same as to further effort, or to declare a constitutional competency in Congress to abolish slavery in States, but am at the same time sincerely hoping and expecting that a constitutional amendment abolishing slavery throughout the nation may be adopted, nevertheless I am fully satisfied with the system for restoration contained in the bill as one very proper plan for the loyal people of any State choosing to adopt it, and that I am and at all times shall be prepared to give the Executive aid and assistance to any such people so soon as the military resistance to the United States shall have been suppressed in any such States and the people thereof shall have sufficiently returned to their obedience to the Constitution and the laws of the United States, in which cases militia-governors will be appointed with directions to proceed according to the bill., Your letter of the 7th, with inclosures, received., If you can find any person, anywhere, professing to have any proposition of Jefferson Davis in writing, for peace, embracing the restoration of the Union and abandonment of slavery, whatever else it embraces, say to him he may come to me with you; and that if he really brings such proposition, he shall at the least have safe conduct with the paper (and without publicity, if he chooses) to the point where you shall have to meet him., The same if there be two or more persons., What have you heard about a battle at Monocacy to-day?, We have nothing about it here except what you say., I am directed by the President to say that you will rally your forces and make every possible effort to retard the enemy's march on Baltimore., Yours of last night received., I have not a single soldier but whom is being disposed by the military for the best protection of all., By latest accounts the enemy is moving on Washington., They cannot fly to either place., Let us be vigilant, but keep cool., I hope neither Baltimore nor Washington will be sacked., Your dispatch to General Halleck, referring to what I may think in the present emergency, is shown me., General Halleck says we have absolutely no force here fit to go to the field., He thinks that with the hundred-day men and invalids we have here we can defend Washington, and, scarcely, Baltimore., Besides these there are about eight thousand, not very reliable, under Howe, at Harper's Ferry with Hunter approaching that point very slowly, with what number I suppose you know better than I. Wallace, with some odds and ends, and part of what came up with Ricketts, was so badly beaten yesterday at Monocacy, that what is left can attempt no more than to defend Baltimore., What we shall get in from Pennsylvania and New York will scarcely be worth counting, I fear., Now, what I think is, that you should provide to retain your hold where you are, certainly, and bring the rest with you personally, and make a vigorous effort to destroy the enemy's forces in this vicinity., I think there is really a fair chance to do this, if the movement is prompt., This is what I think upon your suggestion, and is not an order., Yours of 10.30 P.M. yesterday received, and very satisfactory., The enemy will learn of Wright's arrival, and then the difficulty will be to unite Wright and Hunter south of the enemy before he will recross the Potomac., Some firing between Rockville and here now., Vague rumors have been reaching us for two or three days that Longstreet's corps is also on its way [to] this vicinity., Look out for its absence from your front., I suppose you received my letter of the 9th., I have just received yours of the 13th, and am disappointed by it., I was not expecting you to send me a letter, but to bring me a man, or men., Mr. Hay goes to you with my answer to yours of the 13th., Yours of the 13th is just received, and I am disappointed that you have not already reached here with those commissioners, if they would consent to come on being shown my letter to you of the 9th instant., Show that and this to them, and if they will come on the terms stated in the former, bring them., I not only intend a sincere effort for peace, but I intend that you shall be a personal witness that it is made., The President of the United States directs that the four persons whose names follow, to wit, HON., Clement C. Clay, HON., Jacob Thompson, Professor James P. Holcombe, George N. Sanders, shall have safe conduct to the city of Washington in company with the HON., HORACE GREELEY, and shall be exempt from arrest or annoyance of any kind from any officer of the United States during their journey to the said city of Washington., In your dispatch of yesterday to General Sherman, I find the following, to wit:  ""I shall make a desperate effort to get a position here, which will hold the enemy without the necessity of so many men."", Pressed as we are by lapse of time I am glad to hear you say this; and yet I do hope you may find a way that the effort shall not be desperate in the sense of great loss of life., Yours of this morning received., You misconceive., The order you complain of was only nominally mine, and was framed by those who really made it with no thought of making you a scapegoat., It seemed to be General Grant's wish that the forces under General Wright and those under you should join and drive at the enemy under General Wright., Wright had the larger part of the force, but you had the rank., It was thought that you would prefer Crook's commanding your part to your serving in person under Wright., That is all of it., General Grant wishes you to remain in command of the department, and I do not wish to order otherwise., I have seen your despatches objecting to agents of Northern States opening recruiting stations near your camps., An act of Congress authorizes this, giving the appointment of agents to the States, and not to the Executive Government., It is not for the War Department, or myself, to restrain or modify the law, in its execution, further than actual necessity may require., To be candid, I was for the passage of the law, not apprehending at the time that it would produce such inconvenience to the armies in the field as you now cause me to fear., Many of the States were very anxious for it, and I hoped that, with their State bounties, and active exertions, they would get out substantial additions to our colored forces, which, unlike white recruits, help us where they come from, as well as where they go to., ...]",3
296,"[Will you give our enemies such military advantages as insure success, and then depend on coaxing, flattery, and concession to get them back into the Union?, Abandon all the posts now garrisoned by black men, take one hundred and fifty thousand men from our side and put them in the battle-field or corn-field against us, and we would be compelled to abandon the war in three weeks., ""We have to hold territory in inclement and sickly places; where are the Democrats to do this?, It was a free fight, and the field was open to the war Democrats to put down this rebellion by fighting against both master and slave, long before the present policy was inaugurated., ""There have been men base enough to propose to me to return to slavery the black warriors of Port Hudson and Olustee, and thus win the respect of the masters they fought., Should I do so, I should deserve to be damned in time and eternity., Come what will, I will keep my faith with friend and foe., My enemies pretend I am now carrying on this war for the sole purpose of abolition., So long as I am President, it shall be carried on for the sole purpose of restoring the Union., But no human power can subdue this rebellion without the use of the emancipation policy, and every other policy calculated to weaken the moral and physical forces of the rebellion., ""Freedom has given us one hundred and fifty thousand men, raised on Southern soil., It will give us more yet., Just so much it has subtracted from the enemy, and, instead of alienating the South, there are now evidences of a fraternal feeling growing up between our men and the rank and file of the rebel soldiers., Let my enemies prove to the country that the destruction of slavery is not necessary to a restoration of the Union., I will abide the issue."", I have proposed to Mr. Greeley that the Niagara correspondence be published, suppressing only the parts of his letters over which the red pencil is drawn in the copy which I herewith send., He declines giving his consent to the publication of his letters unless these parts be published with the rest., I have concluded that it is better for me to submit, for the time, to the consequences of the false position in which I consider he has placed me, than to subject the country to the consequences of publishing these discouraging and injurious parts., I send you this, and the accompanying copy, not for publication, but merely to explain to you, and that you may preserve them until their proper time shall come., I have seen your despatch expressing your unwillingness to break your hold where you are., Neither am I willing., Hold on with a bulldog grip, and chew and choke as much as possible., Whereas the act of Congress of the 28th of September, 1850, entitled ""An act to create additional collection districts in the State of California, and to change the existing districts therein, and to modify the existing collection districts in the United States,"" extends to merchandise warehoused under bond the privilege of being exported to the British North American provinces adjoining the United States, in the manner prescribed in the act of Congress of the 3d of March, 1845, which designates certain frontier ports through which merchandise may be exported, and further provides ""that such other ports, situated on the frontiers of the United States adjoining the British North American provinces, as may hereafter be found expedient, may have extended to them the like privileges, on the recommendation of the Secretary of the Treasury, and proclamation duly made by the President of the United States, specially designating the ports to which the aforesaid privileges are to be extended."", Now, therefore, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States of America, in accordance with the recommendation of the Secretary of the Treasury, do hereby declare and proclaim that the port of Newport, in the State of Vermont, is and shall be entitled to all the privileges in regard to the exportation of merchandise in bond to the British North American provinces adjoining the United States, which are extended to the ports enumerated in the seventh section of the act of Congress of the 3d of March, 1845, aforesaid, from and after the date of this proclamation., In witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed., Done at the city of Washington, this eighteenth day of August, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-four, and of the independence of the United States of America, the eighty-ninth., If General Hitchcock can effect a special exchange of Thomas D. Armesy, now under conviction as a spy, or something of the sort, and in prison at for Major Nathan Goff, made a prisoner of war, and now in prison at Richmond, let it be done., You are about to return to your homes and your friends, after having, as I learn, performed in camp a comparatively short term of duty in this great contest., I am greatly obliged to you, and to all who have come forward at the call of their country., I wish it might be more generally and universally understood what the country is now engaged in., We have, as all will agree, a free government, where every man has a right to be equal with every other man., In this great struggle, this form of government and every form of human right is endangered if our enemies succeed., There is more involved in this contest than is realized by every one., There is involved in this struggle, the question whether your children and my children shall enjoy the privileges we have enjoyed., I say this, in order to impress upon you, if you are not already so impressed, that no small matter should divert us from our great purpose., There may be some inequalities in the practical application of our system., It is fair that each man shall pay taxes in exact proportion to the value of his property; but if we should wait, before collecting a tax, to adjust the taxes upon each man in exact proportion with every other man, we should never collect any tax at all., There may be mistakes made sometimes; and things may be done wrong, while the officers of the Government do all they can to prevent mistakes., But I beg of you, as citizens of this great Republic, not to let your minds be carried off from the great work we have before us., This struggle is too large for you to be diverted from it by any small matter., When you return to your homes, rise up to the height of a generation of men worthy of a free government, and we will carry out the great work we have commenced., I return to you my sincere thanks, soldiers, for the honor you have done me this afternoon., Please allow Judge Snead to go to his family on Eastern Shore, or give me some good reason why not., I suppose you are going home to see your families and friends., For the services you have done in this great struggle in which we are engaged, I present you sincere thanks for myself and the country., I almost always feel inclined, when I say anything to soldiers, to impress upon them, in a few brief remarks, the importance of success in this contest., It is not merely for the day, but for all time to come, that we should perpetuate for our children's children that great and free government which we have enjoyed all our lives., I beg you to remember this, not merely for my sake, but for yours., I happen, temporarily, to occupy this big White House., I am a living witness that any one of your children may look to come here as my father's child has., It is in order that each one of you may have, through this free government which we have enjoyed, an open field, and a fair chance for your industry, enterprise, and intelligence; that you may all have equal privileges in the race of life with all its desirable human aspirations--it is for this that the struggle should be maintained, that we may not lose our birthrights--not only for one, but for two or three years, if necessary., The nation is worth fighting for, to secure such an inestimable jewel., This morning, as for some days past, it seems exceedingly probable that this administration will not be re-elected., Then it will be my duty to so co-operate with the President-elect as to save the Union between the election and the inauguration; as he will have secured his election on such ground that he cannot possibly save it afterward., Thanks to General Gillam for making the news and also to you for sending it., Does Joe Heiskell's ""walking to meet us"" mean any more than that ""Joe"" was scared and wanted to save his skin?, Your letter of yesterday received., Thank you for it., Please have no fears., Any person or persons engaged in bringing out cotton, in strict conformity with authority given by W. P. Fessenden, Secretary of the United States Treasury, must not be hindered by the War, Navy, or any other Department of the Government, or any person engaged under any of said Departments., It is represented to me that there are at Rock Island, Illinois, as rebel prisoners of war, many persons of Northern and foreign birth who are unwilling to be exchanged and sent South, but who wish to take the oath of allegiance and enter the military service of the Union., Colonel Huidekoper, on behalf of the people of some parts of Pennsylvania, wishes to pay the bounties the Government would have to pay to proper persons of this class, have them enter the service of the United States, and be credited to the localities furnishing the bounty money., He will therefore proceed to Rock Island, ascertain the names of such persons (not including any who have attractions Southward), and telegraph them to the Provost-Marshal-General here, whereupon direction will be given to discharge the persons named upon their taking the oath of allegiance; and then upon the official evidence being furnished that they shall have been duly received and mustered into the service of the United States, their number will be credited as may be directed by Colonel Huidekoper., The signal success that Divine Providence has recently vouchsafed to the operations of the United States fleet and army in the harbor of Mobile, and the reduction of Fort Powell, Fort Gaines, and Fort Morgan, and the glorious achievements of the army under Major-General Sherman, in the State of Georgia, resulting in the capture of the city of Atlanta, call for devout acknowledgment to the Supreme Being in whose hands are the destinies of nations., It is therefore requested that on next Sunday, in all places of worship in the United States, thanksgivings be offered to Him for His mercy in preserve our national existence against the insurgent rebels who have been waging a cruel war against the Government of the United States for its overthrow, and also that prayer be made for Divine protection to our brave soldiers and their leaders in the field who have so often and so gallantly periled their lives in battling with the enemy, and for blessings and comfort from the Father of mercies to the sick, wounded, and prisoners, and to the orphans and widows of those who have fallen in the service of their country, and that He will continue to uphold the Government of the United States against all the efforts of public enemies and secret foes., The national thanks are tendered by the President to Admiral Farragut and Major-General Canby, for the skill and harmony with which the recent operations in Mobile Harbor and against Fort Powell, Fort Gaines, and Fort Morgan were planned and carried into execution., Also to Admiral Farragut and Major-General Granger, under whose immediate command they were conducted, and to the gallant commanders on sea and land, and to the sailors and soldiers engaged in the operations, for their energy and courage, which, under the blessing of Providence, have been crowned with brilliant success, and have won for them the applause and thanks of the nation., The national thanks are tendered by the President to Major-General William T. Sherman and the gallant officers and soldiers of his command before Atlanta, for the distinguished ability, courage, and perseverance displayed in the campaign in Georgia, which under Divine power resulted in the capture of the city of Atlanta., The marches, battles, sieges, and other military operations that have signalized this campaign must render it famous in the annals of war, and have entitled those who have participated therein to the applause and thanks of the nation., Ordered: First, That on Monday, the fifth day of September, commencing at the hour of twelve o'clock noon, there shall be given a salute of one hundred guns at the arsenal and navy-yard, at Washington, and on Tuesday, the 6th of September, or on the day after the receipt of this order, at each arsenal and navy-yard in the United States, for the recent brilliant achievements of the fleet and land forces of the United States in the harbor of Mobile, and in the reduction of Fort Powell, Fort Gaines, and Fort Morgan., The Secretary of War and the Secretary of the Navy will issue the necessary directions in their respective departments for the execution of this order., Second, That on Wednesday, the 7th of September, commencing at the hour of twelve o'clock noon, there shall be fired a salute of one hundred guns at the arsenal at Washington, and at New York, Boston, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Pittsburg, Newport (Ky.), and St. Louis, and New Orleans, Mobile, and Pensacola, Hilton Head, and Newbern, the day after the receipt of this order, for the brilliant achievements of the army under command of Major-General Sherman, in the State of Georgia, and for the capture of Atlanta., The Secretary of War will issue directions for the execution of this order., I have not forgotten probably never shall forget the very impressive occasion when yourself and friends visited me on a Sabbath forenoon two years ago--nor has your kind letter, written nearly a year later, even been for gotten., In all, it has been your purpose to strengthen my reliance on God., I am much indebted to the good Christian people of the country for their constant prayer and consolations; and to no one of them, more than to yourself., The purposes of the Almighty are perfect, and must prevail, though we erring mortals may fail to accurately perceive them in advance., We hoped for a happy termination of this terrible war long before this; but God knows best, and has ruled otherwise., We shall yet acknowledge His wisdom, and our own error therein., Mean while we must work earnestly in the best light He gives us, trusting that so working still conduces to the great ends He ordains., Surely He intends some great good to follow this mighty convulsion, which no mortal could make, and no mortal could stay., Your people--the Friends--have had, and are having, a very great trial., On principle, and faith, opposed to both war and oppression, they can only practically oppose oppression by war., For those appealing to me on conscientious grounds, I have done, and shall do, the best I could and can, in my own conscience, under my oath to the law., That you believe this I doubt not, and believing it, I shall still receive, for our country and myself your earnest prayers to our Father in Heaven., I can only say now, as I have often said before, it has always been a sentiment with me, that all mankind should be free., So far as I have been able, so far as came within my sphere, I have always acted as I believed was just and right, and done all I could for the good of mankind., I have, in letters sent forth from this office, expressed myself better than I can now., In regard to the great Book, I have only to say it is the best gift which God has ever given to man., All the good from the Saviour of the world is communicated to us through this book., But for that Book, we could not know right from wrong., All those things desirable to man are contained in it., I return you sincere thanks for this very elegant copy of this great Book of God which you present., The term of one hundred days for which the National Guard of Ohio volunteered having expired, the President directs an official acknowledgment to be made of their patriotic and valuable services during the recent campaigns., The term of service of their enlistment was short, but distinguished by memorable events., In the Valley of the Shenandoah, on the Peninsula, in the operations on the James River, around Petersburg and Richmond, in the battle of Monocacy, and in the intrenchments of Washington, and in other important service, the National Guard of Ohio performed with alacrity the duty of patriotic volunteers, for which they are entitled to and are hereby tendered, through the Governor of their State, the national thanks., Sheridan and Early are facing each other at a dead-lock., Could we not pick up a regiment here and there, to the number of say ten thousand men, and quietly but suddenly concentrate them at Sheridan's camp and enable him to make a strike?, This is but a suggestion., On behalf of the Union, thanks to Maine., ...]",3
297,"[I am notified that this is a compliment paid me by the loyal Marylanders resident in this District., I infer that the adoption of the new constitution for the State furnishes the occasion, and that in your view the extirpation of slavery constitutes the chief merit of the new constitution., Most heartily do I congratulate you, and Maryland, and the nation, and the world, upon this event., I regret that it did not occur two years sooner, which, I am sure, would have saved the nation more money than would have met all the private loss incident to the measure; but it has come at last, and I sincerely hope its friends may fully realize all their anticipations of good from it, and that its opponents may by its effects be agreeably and profitably disappointed., A word upon another subject., Something said by the Secretary of State in his recent speech at Auburn, has been construed by some into a threat, that if I shall be beaten at the election, I will, between then and the end of my constitutional term, do what I may be able to ruin the Government., Others regard the fact that the Chicago Convention adjourned, not sine die, but to meet again, if called to do so by a particular individual, as the intimation of a purpose that if their nominee shall be elected he will at once seize control of the Government., I hope the good people will permit themselves to suffer no uneasiness on either point., I am struggling to maintain the Government, not to overthrow it., I am struggling especially to prevent others from overthrowing it., I therefore say, that if I live, I shall remain President until the 4th of next March, and that whoever shall be constitutionally elected, in November, shall be duly installed as President on the 4th of March, and in the interval I shall do my utmost that whoever is to hold the helm for the next voyage shall start with the best possible chance of saving the ship., This is due to the people, both on principle and under the Constitution., Their will, constitutionally expressed, is the ultimate law for all., If they should deliberately resolve to have immediate peace, even at the loss of their country and their liberties, I know not the power or the right to resist them., It is their own business, and they must do as they please with their own., I believe, however, they are still resolved to preserve their country and their liberties; and in this, in office or out of it, I am resolved to stand by them., I may add, that in this purpose to save the country and its liberties, no classes of people seem so nearly unanimous as the soldiers in the field and the sailors afloat., Do they not have the hardest of it?, Who should quail while they do not?, God bless the soldiers and seamen, with all their brave commanders., It has pleased Almighty God to prolong our national life another year, defending us with his guardian care against unfriendly designs from abroad, and vouchsafing to us in His mercy many and signal victories over the enemy, who is of our own household., It has also pleased our Heavenly Father to favor as well our citizens in their homes as our soldiers in their camps, and our sailors on the rivers and seas, with unusual health., He has largely augmented our free population by emancipation and by immigration, while he has opened to us new: sources of wealth, and has crowned the labor of our working-men in every department of industry with abundant rewards., Moreover, he has been pleased to animate and inspire our minds and hearts with fortitude, courage, and resolution sufficient for the great trial of civil war into which we have been brought by our adherence as a nation to the cause of freedom and humanity, and to afford to us reasonable hopes of an ultimate and happy deliverance from all our dangers and afflictions., Now, therefore, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States, do hereby appoint and set apart the last Thursday in November next as a day which I desire to be observed by all my fellow-citizens, wherever they may be then, as a day of thanksgiving and praise to Almighty God, the beneficent Creator and Ruler of the Universe., And I do further recommend to my fellow-citizens aforesaid, that on that occasion they do reverently humble themselves in the dust, and from thence offer up penitent and fervent prayers and supplications to the great Disposer of events for a return of the inestimable blessings of peace, union, and harmony throughout the, land which it has pleased him to assign as a dwelling-place for ourselves and for our posterity throughout all generations., In testimony whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed., Done at the city of Washington, this twentieth day of October, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-four, and of the independence of the United States the eighty-ninth., While Curtis is fighting Price, have you any idea where the force under Rosecrans is, or what it is doing?, On the 15th day of this month, as I remember, a printed paper manuscript, with a few manuscript interlineations, called a protest, with your names appended thereto, and accompanied by another printed paper, purporting to be a proclamation by Andrew Johnson, Military Governor of Tennessee, and also a manuscript paper, purporting to be extracts from the Code of Tennessee, were laid before me., The protest, proclamation, and extracts are respectively as follows:  At the time these papers were presented, as before stated, I had never seen either of them, nor heard of the subject to which they related, except in a general way one day previously., Up to the present moment, nothing whatever upon the subject has passed between Governor Johnson, or any one else, connected with the proclamation, and myself., Since receiving the papers, as stated, I have given the subject such brief consideration as I have been able to do, in the midst of so many pressing public duties., My conclusion is, that I can have nothing to do with the matter, either to sustain the plan as the convention and Governor Johnson have initiated it, or to revoke or modify it as you demand., By the Constitution and laws, the President is charged with no duty in the presidential election in any State, nor do I in this case perceive any military reason for his interference in the matter., The movement set on foot by the convention and Governor Johnson does not, as seems to be assumed by you, emanate from the National Executive., In no proper sense can it be considered other than an independent movement of, at least, a portion of the loyal people of Tennessee., I do not perceive in the plan any menace, or violence, or coercion towards any one., Governor Johnson, like any other loyal citizen of Tennessee, has the right to favor any political plan he chooses, and, as military governor, it is his duty to keep peace among and for the loyal people of the State., I cannot discern that by this plan he purposes any more., But you object to the plan., Leaving it alone will be your perfect security against it., It is not proposed to force you into it., Do as you please, on your own account, peaceably and loyally, and Governor Johnson will not molest you, but will protect you against violence as far as in his power., I presume that the conducting of a presidential election in Tennessee in strict accordance with the old Code of the State, is not now a possibility., It is scarcely necessary to add, that if any election shall be held and any votes shall be cast in the State of Tennessee for President and Vice-President of the United States, it will belong, not to the military agents, nor yet to the Executive Department, but exclusively to another department of the Government, to determine whether they are entitled to be counted in conformity with the Constitution and laws of the United States., Except it be to give protection against violence, I decline to interfere in any way with any presidential election., With great pleasure I tender to you and your brave army the thanks of the nation, and my own personal admiration and gratitude, for the month's operations in the Shenandoah Valley; and especially for the splendid work of October 19, 1864., I have received information to-day, having great appearance of authenticity, that there is to be a rebel raid into Western Kentucky; that it is to consist of four thousand infantry and three thousand cavalry, and is to start from Corinth, Mississippi, On the fourth day of November., I have ordered that Milton D. Norton be discharged on taking the oath., Please notify his mother., Whereas the Congress of the United States passed an act, which was approved on the 21st day of March last, entitled ""An act to enable the people of Nevada to form a constitution and State government, and for the admission of such State into the Union on an equal footing with the original States;"" and,  Whereas the said constitution and State government have been formed, pursuant to the conditions prescribed by the fifth section of the act of Congress aforesaid, and the certificate required by the said act and also a copy of the constitution and ordinances have been submitted to the President of the United States:  Now, therefore, be it known that I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States, in accordance with the duty imposed upon me by the act of Congress aforesaid, do hereby declare and proclaim that the said State of Nevada is admitted into the Union on an equal footing with the original States., In witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed  Suspend execution of all the deserters ordered to be executed on Sunday at Louisville, until further order, and send me the records in the cases., Acknowledge receipt., Please forward with all possible despatch to the naval officer commanding at Mobile Bay the following order., Do not on any account, or on any showing of authority whatever, from whomsoever purporting to come, allow the blockade to be violated., Allow me to wish you a great success., With the old fame of the Navy made brighter in the present war you cannot fail., I name none lest I wrong others by omission., To all, from rear-admiral to honest Jack, I tender the nation's admiration and gratitude., Yours received., I have no other notice that the ox is mine., If it be really so, I present it to the Sailors' Fair as a contribution., News from Grant, Sherman, Thomas and Rosecrans satisfactory, but not important., Pirate Florida captured by the Wachusett October 7, on the coast of Brazil., The information is certain., Even before I had been informed by you that this compliment was paid me by loyal citizens of Pennsylvania, friendly to me, I had inferred that you were of that portion of my countrymen who think that the best interests of the nation are to be subserved by the support of the present administration., I do not pretend to say that you, who think so, embrace all the patriotism and loyalty of the country, but I do believe, and I trust without personal interest, that the welfare of the country does require that such support and indorsement should be given., I earnestly believe that the consequences of this day's work, if it be as you assume, and as now seems probable, will be to the lasting advantage, if not to the very salvation, of the country., I cannot at this hour say what has been the result of the election., But, whatever it may be, I have no desire to modify this opinion: that all who have labored to-day in behalf of the Union have wrought for the best interests of the country and the world; not only for the present, but for all future ages., I am thankful to God for this approval of the people; but, while deeply grateful for this mark of their confidence in me, if I know my heart, my gratitude is free from any taint of personal triumph., I do not impugn the motives of any one opposed to me., It is no pleasure to me to triumph over any one, but I give thanks to the Almighty for this evidence of the people's resolution to stand by free government and the rights of humanity., The Maryland soldiers in the Army of the Potomac cast a total vote of fourteen hundred and twenty-eight, out of which we get eleven hundred and sixty majority., This is directly from General Meade and General Grant., It has long been a grave question whether any government, not too strong for the liberties of its people, can be strong enough to maintain its existence in great emergencies., On this point the present rebellion brought our government to a severe test, and a presidential election occurring in regular course during the rebellion, added not a little to the strain., If the loyal people united were put to the utmost of their strength by the rebellion, must they not fail when divided and partially paralyzed by a political war among themselves?, But the election was a necessity., We cannot have free government without elections; and if the election could force us to forego or postpone a national election, it might fairly claim to have already conquered and ruined us., The strife of the election is but human nature practically applied to the facts of the case., What has occurred in this case must ever recur in similar cases., Human nature will not change., In any future great national trial, compared with the men of this, we will have as weak and as strong, as silly and as wise, as bad and as good., Let us, therefore, study the incidents of this as philosophy to learn wisdom from, and none of them as wrongs to be revenged., But the election, along with its incidental and undesirable strife, has done good, too., It has demonstrated that a people's government can sustain a national election in the midst of a great civil war., Until now, it has not been known to the world that this was a possibility., It shows, also, how sound and strong we still are., It shows that even among the candidates of the same party, he who is most devoted to the Union and most opposed to treason can receive most of the people's votes., It shows, also, to the extent yet known, that we have more men now than we had when the war began., Gold is good in its place; but living, brave, and patriotic men are better than gold., But the rebellion continues, and, now that the election is over, may not all have a common interest to reunite in a common effort to save our common country?, For my own part, I have striven and shall strive to avoid placing any obstacle in the way., So long as I have been here, I have not willingly planted a thorn in any man's bosom., While I am duly sensible to the high compliment of a re-election, and duly grateful, as I trust, to Almighty God, for having directed my countrymen to a right conclusion, as I think, for their good, it adds nothing to my satisfaction that any other man may be disappointed by the result., May I ask those who have not differed with me to join with me in this same spirit towards those who have?, And now, let me close by asking three hearty cheers for our brave soldiers and seamen, and their gallant and skillful commanders., I have just received a telegram from Governor Bramlette saying: ""General John B. Houston, a loyal man and prominent citizen, was arrested, and yesterday, started off by General Burbridge, to be sent beyond our lines by way of Catlettsburg, for no other offense than opposition to your re-election,"" and I have answered him as follows below, of which please take notice and report to me., ...]",3
298,"[I solicit your authority to furnish to the republic a gunboat, at moderate cost, to be reimbursed to the United States by instalments., Such a vessel is needed for the safety of that state against the native African races, and in Liberian hands it would be more effective in arresting the African slave-trade than a squadron in our own hands., The possession of the least organized naval force would stimulate a generous ambition in the republic, and the confidence which we should manifest by furnishing it would win forbearance and favor toward the colony from all civilized nations., The proposed overland telegraph between America and Europe, by the way of Bering Straits and Asiatic Russia, which was sanctioned by Congress at the last session, has been undertaken, under very favorable circumstances, by an association of American citizens, with the cordial good-will and support as well of this Government as of those of Great Britain and Russia., Assurances have been received from most of the South American States of their high appreciation of the enterprise and their readiness to co-operate in constructing lines tributary to that world-encircling communication., I learn with much satisfaction that the noble design of a telegraphic communication between the eastern coast of America and Great Britain has been renewed, with full expectation of its early accomplishment., Thus it is hoped that with the return of domestic peace the country will be able to resume with energy and advantage its former high career of commerce and civilization., Our very popular and estimable representative in Egypt died in April last., An unpleasant altercation which arose between the temporary incumbent of the office and the Government of the Pasha resulted in a suspension of intercourse., The evil was promptly corrected on the arrival of the successor in the consulate, and our relations with Egypt, as well as our relations with the Barbary Powers, are entirely satisfactory., The rebellion which has so long been flagrant in China has at last been suppressed, with the co-operating good offices of this Government and of the other Western commercial States., The judicial consular establishment there has become very difficult and onerous, and it will need legislative revision to adapt it to the extension of our commerce and to the more intimate intercourse which has been instituted with the Government and people of that vast Empire., China seems to be accepting with hearty good-will the conventional laws which regulate commercial and social intercourse among the Western nations., Owing to the peculiar situation of Japan and the anomalous form of its Government, the action of that empire in performing treaty stipulations is inconstant and capricious., Nevertheless, good progress has been effected by the Western powers, moving with enlightened concert., Our own pecuniary claims have been allowed or put in course of settlement, and the inland sea has been reopened to commerce., There is reason also to believe that these proceedings have increased rather than diminished the friendship of Japan toward the United States., The ports of Norfolk, Fernandina, and Pensacola have been opened by proclamation., It is hoped that foreign merchants will now consider whether it is not safer and more profitable to themselves, as well as just to the United States, to resort to these and other open ports than it is to pursue, through many hazards and at vast cost, a contraband trade with other ports which are closed, if not by actual military occupation, at least by a lawful and effective blockade., For myself, I have no doubt of the power and duty of the Executive, under the law of nations, to exclude enemies of the human race from an asylum in the United States., If Congress should think that proceedings in such cases lack the authority of law, or ought to be further regulated by it, I recommend that provision be made for effectually preventing foreign slave traders from acquiring domicile and facilities for their criminal occupation in our country., It is possible that if it were a new and open question the maritime powers, with the lights they now enjoy, would not concede the privileges of a naval belligerent to the insurgents of the United States, destitute, as they are, and always have been, equally of ships of war and of ports and harbors., Disloyal emissaries have been neither assiduous nor more successful during the last year than they were before that time in their efforts, under favor of that privilege, to embroil our country in foreign wars., The desire and determination of the governments of the maritime states to defeat that design are believed to be as sincere as and can not be more earnest than our own., Nevertheless, unforeseen political difficulties have arisen, especially in Brazilian and British ports and on the northern boundary of the United States, which have required, and are likely to continue to require, the practice of constant vigilance and a just and conciliatory spirit on the part of the United States, as well as of the nations concerned and their governments., Commissioners have been appointed under the treaty with Great Britain on the adjustment of the claims of the Hudson Bay and Puget Sound Agricultural Companies, in Oregon, and are now proceeding to the execution of the trust assigned to them., In view of the insecurity of life and property in the region adjacent to the Canadian border, by reason of recent assaults and depredations committed by inimical and desperate persons who are harbored there, it has been thought proper to give notice that after the expiration of six months, the period conditionally stipulated in the existing arrangement with Great Britain, the United States must hold themselves at liberty to increase their naval armament upon the Lakes if they shall find that proceeding necessary., The condition of the border will necessarily come into consideration in connection with the question of continuing or modifying the rights of transit from Canada through the United States, as well as the regulation of imposts, which were temporarily established by the reciprocity treaty of the 5th June, 1854., I desire, however, to be understood while making this statement that the colonial authorities of Canada are not deemed to be intentionally unjust or unfriendly toward the United States, but, on the contrary, there is every reason to expect that, with the approval of the Imperial Government, they will take the necessary measures to prevent new incursions across the border., The act passed at the last session for the encouragement of immigration has so far as was possible been put into operation., It seems to need amendment which will enable the officers of the Government to prevent the practice of frauds against the immigrants while on their way and on their arrival in the ports, so as to secure them here a free choice of avocations and places of settlement., A liberal disposition toward this great national policy is manifested by most of the European States, and ought to be reciprocated on our part by giving the immigrants effective national protection., I regard our immigrants as one of the principal replenishing streams which are appointed by Providence to repair the ravages of internal war and its wastes of national strength and health., All that is necessary is to secure the flow of that stream in its present fullness, and to that end the Government must in every way make it manifest that it neither needs nor designs to impose involuntary military service upon those who come from other lands to cast their lot in our country., The financial affairs of the Government have been successfully administered during the last year., The legislation of the last session of Congress has beneficially affected the revenues, although sufficient time has not yet elapsed to experience the full effect of several of the provisions of the acts of Congress imposing increased taxation., The receipts during the year from all sources, upon the basis of warrants signed by the Secretary of the Treasury, including loans and the balance in the Treasury on the 1st day of July, 1863, were $1,394,196,007.62, and the aggregate disbursements, upon the same basis, were $1,298,056,101.89, leaving a balance in the Treasury, as shown by warrants, of $96,739,905.73., Deduct from these amounts the amount of the principal of the public debt redeemed and the amount of issues in substitution therefor, and the actual cash operations of the Treasury were: receipts, $884,076,646.57; disbursements, $865,234,087.86; which leaves a cash balance in the Treasury of $18,842,558.71., Of the receipts there were derived from customs $102,316,152.99, from lands $588,333.29, from direct taxes $475,648.96, from internal revenue $109,741,134.10, from miscellaneous sources $47,511,448.10, and from loans applied to actual expenditures, including former balance, $623,443,929.13., There were disbursed for the civil service $27,505,599.46, for pensions and Indians $7,517,930.97, for the War Department $690,791,842.97, for the Navy Department $85,733,292.77, for interest on the public debt $53,685,421.69, making an aggregate of $865,234,087.86, and leaving a balance in the Treasury of $18,842,558.71, as before stated., For the actual receipts and disbursements for the first quarter and the estimated receipts and disbursements for the three remaining quarters of the current fiscal year, and the general operations of the Treasury in detail, I refer you to the report of the Secretary of the Treasury., I concur with him in the opinion that the proportion of moneys required to meet the expenses consequent upon the war derived from taxation should be still further increased; and I earnestly invite your attention to this subject to the end that there be such additional legislation as shall be required to meet the just expectations of the Secretary., The public debt on the first day of July last, as appears by the books of the Treasury, amounted to $1,740,690,489.49., Probably, should the war continue for another year, that amount may be increased by not far from $500,000,000., Held, as it is, for the most part by our own people, it has become a substantial branch of national, though private, property., For obvious reasons the more nearly this property can be distributed among all the people the better., To favor such general distribution, greater inducements to become owners might, perhaps, with good effect and without injury be presented to persons of limited means., With this view I suggest whether it might not be both competent and expedient for Congress to provide that a limited amount of some future issue of public securities might be held by any bona fide purchaser exempt from taxation and from seizure for debt, under such restrictions and limitations as might be necessary to guard against abuse of so important a privilege., This would enable every prudent person to set aside a small annuity against a possible day of want., Privileges like these would render the possession of such securities to the amount limited most desirable to every person of small means who might be able to save enough for the purpose., The great advantage of citizens being creditors as well as debtors with relation to the public debt is obvious., Men readily perceive that they can not be much oppressed by a debt which they owe to themselves., The public debt on the first day of July last, although somewhat exceeding the estimate of the Secretary of the Treasury made to Congress at the commencement of the last session, falls short of the estimate of that officer made in the preceding December as to its probable amount at the beginning of this year by the sum of $3,995,097.31., This fact exhibits a satisfactory condition and conduct of the operations of the Treasury., The national banking system is proving to be acceptable to capitalists and to the people., On the twenty-fifth day of November five hundred and eighty-four national banks had been organized, a considerable number of which were conversions from State banks., Changes from State systems to the national system are rapidly taking place, and it is hoped that very soon there will be in the United States no banks of issue not authorized by Congress and no bank-note circulation not secured by the Government., That the Government and the people will derive great benefit from this change in the banking systems of the country can hardly be questioned., The national system will create a reliable and permanent influence in support of the national credit and protect the people against losses in the use of paper money., Whether or not any further legislation is advisable for the suppression of State-bank issues, it will be for Congress to determine., It seems quite clear that the Treasury can not be satisfactorily conducted unless the Government can exercise a restraining power over the bank-note circulation of the country., The report of the Secretary of War and the accompanying documents will detail the campaigns of the armies in the field since the date of the last annual message, and also the operations of the several administrative bureaus of the War Department during the last year., It will also specify the measures deemed essential for the national defense and to keep up and supply the requisite military force., The report of the Secretary of the Navy presents a comprehensive and satisfactory exhibit of the affairs of that Department and of the naval service., It is a subject of congratulation and laudable pride to our countrymen that a Navy of such vast proportions has been organized in so brief a period and conducted with so much efficiency and success., The general exhibit of the Navy, including vessels under construction on the first of December, 1864, shows a total of 671 vessels, carrying 4610 guns, and of 510,396 tons, being an actual increase during the year, over and above all losses by shipwreck or in battle, of 83 vessels, 167 guns, and 42,427 tons., The total number of men at this time in the naval service, including officers, is about 51,000., There have been captured by the Navy during the year 324 vessels, and the whole number of naval captures since hostilities commenced is 1379, of which 267 are steamers., The gross proceeds arising from the sale of condemned prize property thus far reported amount to $14,369,250.51., A large amount of such proceeds is still under adjudication and yet to be reported., The total expenditure of the Navy Department of every description, including the cost of the immense squadrons that have been called into existence from the fourth of March, 1861, to the first of November, 1864, is $238,647,262.35., Your favorable consideration is invited to the various recommendations of the Secretary of the Navy, especially in regard to a navy-yard and suitable establishment for the construction and repair of iron vessels and the machinery and armature for our ships, to which reference was made in my last annual message., Your attention is also invited to the views expressed in the report in relation to the legislation of Congress at its last session in respect to prize on our inland waters., I cordially concur in the recommendation of the Secretary as to the propriety of creating the new rank of vice-admiral in our naval service., Your attention is invited to the report of the Postmaster-General for a detailed account of the operations and financial condition of the Post-Office Department., The postal revenues for the year ending June 30, 1864, amounted to $12,438,253.78, and the expenditures to $12,644,786.20, the excess of expenditures over receipts being $206,532.42., The views presented by the Postmaster-General on the subject of special grants by the Government in aid of the establishment of new lines of ocean mail steamships and the policy he recommends for the development of increased commercial intercourse with adjacent and neighboring countries should receive the careful consideration of Congress., It is of noteworthy interest that the steady expansion of population, improvement, and governmental institutions over the new and unoccupied portions of our country have scarcely been checked, much less impeded or destroyed, by our great civil war, which at first glance would seem to have absorbed almost the entire energies of the nation., The organization and admission of the State of Nevada has been completed in conformity with law, and thus our excellent system is firmly established in the mountains, which once seemed a barren and uninhabitable waste between the Atlantic States and those which have grown up on the coast of the Pacific Ocean., The Territories of the Union are generally in a condition of prosperity and rapid growth., Idaho and Montana, by reason of their great distance and the interruption of communication with them by Indian hostilities, have been only partially organized; but it is understood that these difficulties are about to disappear, which will permit their governments, like those of the others, to go into speedy and full operation., As intimately connected with and promotive of this material growth of the nation, I ask the attention of Congress to the valuable information and important recommendations relating to the public lands, Indian affairs, the Pacific Railroad, and mineral discoveries contained in the report of the Secretary of the Interior which is herewith transmitted, and which report also embraces the subjects of patents, pensions, and other topics of public interest pertaining to his Department., The quantity of public land disposed of during the five quarters ending on the thirtieth of September last was 4,221,342 acres, of which 1,538,614 acres were entered under the homestead law., The remainder was located with military land warrants, agricultural scrip certified to States for railroads, and sold for cash., The cash received from sales and location fees was $1,019,446., The income from sales during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1864, was $678,007.21, against $136,077.95 received during the preceding year., The aggregate number of acres surveyed during the year has been equal to the quantity disposed of, and there is open to settlement about 133,000,000 acres of surveyed land., The great enterprise of connecting the Atlantic with the Pacific States by railways and telegraph lines has been entered upon with a vigor that gives assurance of success, notwithstanding the embarrassments arising from the prevailing high prices of materials and labor., The route of the main line of the road has been definitely located for one hundred miles westward from the initial point at Omaha City, Nebraska, and a preliminary location of the Pacific Railroad of California has been made from Sacramento eastward to the great bend of the Truckee River in Nevada., Numerous discoveries of gold, silver, and cinnabar mines have been added to the many heretofore known, and the country occupied by the Sierra Nevada and Rocky mountains and the subordinate ranges now teems with enterprising labor, which is richly remunerative., It is believed that the produce of the mines of precious metals in that region has during the year reached, if not exceeded, $100,000,000 in value., It was recommended in my last annual message that our Indian system be remodeled., Congress at its last session, acting upon the recommendation, did provide for reorganizing the system in California, and it is believed that under the present organization the management of the Indians there will be attended with reasonable success., Much yet remains to be done to provide for the proper government of the Indians in other parts of the country, to render it secure for the advancing settler, and to provide for the welfare of the Indian., The Secretary reiterates his recommendations, and to them the attention of Congress is invited., The liberal provisions made by Congress for paying pensions to invalid soldiers and sailors of the Republic and to the widows, orphans, and dependent mothers of those who have fallen in battle or died of disease contracted or of wounds received in the service of their country have been diligently administered., There have been added to the pension rolls during the year ending the 30th day of June last the names of 16,770 invalid soldiers and of 271 disabled seamen, making the present number of army invalid pensioners 22,767 and of navy invalid pensioners 712., Of widows, orphans, and mothers 22,198 have been placed on the army pension rolls and 248 on the navy rolls., The present number of army pensioners of this class is 25,433 and of navy pensioners 793., At the beginning of the year the number of Revolutionary pensioners was 1430., ...]",3
299,"[The Executive power itself would be greatly diminished by the cessation of actual war., Pardons and remissions of forfeitures, however, would still be within Executive control., In what spirit and temper this control would be exercised can be fairly judged of by the past., A year ago general pardon and amnesty, upon specified terms, were offered to all except certain designated classes, and it was at the same time made known that the excepted classes were still within contemplation of special clemency., During the year many availed themselves of the general provision, and many more would, only that the signs of bad faith in some led to such precautionary measures as rendered the practical process less easy and certain., During the same time also special pardons have been granted to individuals of the excepted classes, and no voluntary application has been denied., Thus practically the door has been for a full year open to all except such as were not in condition to make free choice; that is, such as were in custody or under constraint., It is still so open to all., But the time may come, probably will come, when public duty shall demand that it be closed and that in lieu more rigorous measures than heretofore shall be adopted., In presenting the abandonment of armed resistance to the national authority on the part of the insurgents as the only indispensable condition to ending the war on the part of the Government, I retract nothing heretofore said as to slavery., I repeat the declaration made a year ago, that ""while I remain in my present position I shall not attempt to retract or modify the emancipation proclamation, nor shall I return to slavery any person who is free by the terms of that proclamation or by any of the acts of Congress."", If the people should, by whatever mode or means, make it an Executive duty to re-enslave such persons, another, and not I, must be their instrument to perform it., In stating a single condition of peace I mean simply to say that the war will cease on the part of the Government whenever it shall have ceased on the part of those who began it., I believe I shall never be old enough to speak without embarrassment when I have nothing to talk about., I have no good news to tell you, and yet I have no bad news to tell., We have talked of elections until there is nothing more to say about them., The most interesting news now we have is from Sherman., We all know where he went in at, but I can't tell where he will come out at., I will now close by proposing three cheers for General Sherman and his army., Complaint is made to me of the doings of a man at Hannibal, Mo., by the name of Haywood, who, as I am told, has charge of some militia force, and is not in the United States service., Please inquire into the matter and correct anything you may find amiss if in your power., I am appealed to in behalf of a man by the name of Frank Fairbairns, said to have been for a long time and still in prison, without any definite ground stated., How is it?, ORDERED, First, that Major-General William P. Smith and the Hon., Henry Stanbery be, and they are hereby, appointed special commissioners to investigate and report, for the information of the President; upon the civil and military administration in the military division bordering upon and west of the Mississippi, under such instructions as shall be issued by authority of the President and the War Department., Second, said commissioners shall have power to examine witnesses upon oath, and to take such proofs orally or in writing, upon the subject-matters of investigation as they may deem expedient, and return the same together with their report., Third, all officers and persons in the military, naval and revenue services, or in any branch of the public service under the authority of the United States Government, are required, upon subpoena issued by direction of the said commissioners, to appear before them at such time and place as may be designated in said subpoena and to give testimony on oath touching such matters as may be inquired of by the commissioners, and to produce such books, papers, writings, and documents as they may be notified or required to produce by the commissioners, and as may be in their possession., Fourth, said special commissioners shall also investigate and report upon any other matters that may hereafter be directed by the Secretary of War, and shall with all convenient dispatch make report to him in writing of their investigation, and shall also from time to time make special reports to the Secretary of War upon such matters as they may deem of importance to the public interests., Fifth, the Secretary of War shall assign to the said commissioners such aid and assistance as may be required for the performance of their duties, and make such just and reasonable allowances and compensation for the said commissioners and for the persons employed by them as he may deem proper., Please accept for yourself, officers, and men, the nation's thanks for your good work of yesterday., You made a magnificent beginning; a grand consummation is within your easy reach., Do not let it slip., I have long determined to make public the origin of the greenback and tell the world that it is Dick Taylor's creation., You had always been friendly to me, and when troublous times fell on us, and my shoulders, though broad and willing, were weak, and myself surrounded by such circumstances and such people that I knew not whom to trust, then I said in my extremity: ""I will send for Colonel Taylor; he will know what to do."", I think it was in January, 1862, on or about the 16th, that I did so., You came, and I said to you:  ""What can we do?"", Said you, ""Why, issue Treasury notes bearing no interest, printed on the best banking paper., Issue enough to pay off the Army expenses and declare it legal tender."", Chase thought it a hazardous thing, but we finally accomplished it, and gave the people of this Republic the greatest blessing they ever had--their own paper to pay their own debts., It is due to you, the father of the present greenback, that the people should know it, and I take great pleasure in making it known., How many times have I laughed at you telling me plainly that I was too lazy to be anything but a lawyer., It is said that Harry Walters, a private in the Anderson cavalry, is now and for a long time has been in prison at Chattanooga., Please report to me what is his condition, and for what he is imprisoned., Whereas, by the act approved July 4, 1864, entitled ""An act further to regulate and provide for the enrolling and calling out the national forces, and for other purposes,"" it is provided that the President of the United States may, ""at his discretion, at any time hereafter, call for any number of men, as volunteers for the respective terms of one, two, and three years for military service,"" and ""that in case the quota or any part thereof of any town, township, ward of a city, precinct, or election district, or of any country not so subdivided, shall not be filled within the space of fifty days after such call, then the President shall immediately order a draft for one year to fill such quota or any part thereof which may be unfilled;"" and  Whereas, by the credits allowed in accordance with the act of Congress on the call for 500,000 men, made July 18, 1864, the number of men to be obtained under that call was reduced to 280,000; and  Whereas, the operations of the enemy in certain States have rendered it impracticable to procure from them their full quotas of troops under said call; and  Whereas, from the foregoing causes but 240,000 men have been put into the Army, Navy, and Marine Corps under the said call of July 18, 1864, leaving a deficiency on that call of two hundred and sixty thousand (260,000):  Now, therefore, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States of America, in order to supply the aforesaid deficiency and to provide for casualties in the military and naval service of the United States, do issue this my call for three hundred thousand (300,000) volunteers to serve for one, two, or three years., The quotas of the States, districts, and subdistricts under this call will be assigned by the War Department through the bureau of the Provost-Marshal General of the United States, and ""in case the quota or any part thereof of any town, township, ward of a city, precinct, or election district, or of any county not so subdivided, shall not be filled"" before the fifteenth of February, 1865, then a draft shall be made to fill such quota or any part thereof under this call which may be unfilled on said fifteenth day of February, 1865., In testimony whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixedMany, many thanks for your Christmas gift, the capture of Savannah., When you were about leaving Atlanta for the Atlantic coast, I was anxious, if not fearful; but feeling that you were the better judge, and remembering that ""nothing risked, nothing gained,"" I did not interfere., Now, the undertaking being a success, the honor is all yours; for I believe none of us went further than to acquiesce., And taking the work of General Thomas into the count, as it should be taken, it is indeed a great success., Not only does it afford the obvious and immediate military advantages; but in showing to the world that your army could be divided, putting the stronger part to an important new service, and yet leaving enough to vanquish the old opposing force of the whole,--Hood's army,--it brings those who sat in darkness to see a great light., But what next?, I suppose it will be safe if I leave General Grant and yourself to decide., Please make my grateful acknowledgments to your whole army of officers and men., If within your power send me the particulars of the causes for which Lieutenant-Governor Jacob was arrested and sent away., I have the honor to acknowledge the reception of your note of the twentieth of December, conveying the announcement that the Trustees of the College of New Jersey had conferred upon me the degree of Doctor of Laws., The assurance conveyed by this high compliment, that the course of the Government which I represent, has received the approval of a body of gentlemen of such character and intelligence, in this time of public trial, is most grateful to me., Thoughtful men must feel that the fate of civilization upon this continent is involved in the issue of our contest., Among the most gratifying proofs of this conviction is the hearty devotion everywhere exhibited by our schools and colleges to the national cause., I am most thankful if my labors have seemed to conduct to the preservation of those institutions, under which alone we can expect good government and in its train sound learning, and the progress of the liberal arts., I am, sir, very truly, your obedient servant,  Suspend execution of James R. Mallory, for six weeks from Friday the thirtieth of this month, which time I have given his friends to make proof, if they can, upon certain points., If there be no objection, please tell me what you now understand of the Wilmington expedition, present and prospective., There is a man in Company I, Eleventh Connecticut Volunteers, First Brigade, Third Division, Twenty-fourth Army Corps, at Chapin's Farm, Va.; under the assumed name of William Stanley, but whose real name is Frank R. Judd, and who is under arrest, and probably about to be tried for desertion., He is the son of our present minister to Prussia, who is a close personal friend of Senator Trumbull and myself., We are not willing for the boy to be shot, but we think it as well that his trial go regularly on, suspending execution until further order from me and reporting to me., It is said that you were on the court-martial that tried John Lennon, and that you are disposed to advise his being pardoned and sent to his regiment., If this be true, telegraph me to that effect at once., Let Trumbo's substitute be regularly mustered in, send me the evidence that it is done and I will then discharge Trumbo., I herewith return to your honorable body, in which it originated, a ""joint resolution to correct certain clerical errors in the internal revenue act,"" without my approval., My reason for so doing is that I am informed that this joint resolution was prepared during the last moments of the last session of Congress for the purpose of correcting certain errors of reference in the internal revenue act, which were discovered on an examination of an official copy procured from the State Department a few hours only before the adjournment., It passed the House and went to the Senate, where a vote was taken upon it, but by some accident it was not presented to the President of the Senate for his signature., Since the adjournment of the last session of Congress, other errors of a kind similar to those which this resolution was designed to correct, have been discovered in the law, and it is now thought most expedient to include all the necessary corrections in one act or resolution., The attention of the proper committee of the House has, I am informed, been already directed to the preparation of a bill for this purpose., Richard T. Jacob, Lieutenant-Governor of Kentucky, is at the Spotswood House, in Richmond, under an order of General Burbridge not to return to Kentucky., Please communicate leave to him to pass our lines, and come to me here at Washington., If there is a man at City Point by the name of Waterman Thornton who is in trouble about desertion, please have his case briefly stated to me and do not let him be executed meantime., I transmit to Congress a copy of two treaties between the United States and Belgium, for the extinguishment of the Scheldt dues, etc., concluded on the twentieth of May, 1863, and twentieth of July, 1863, respectively, the ratifications of which were exchanged at Brussels on the twenty-fourth of June last; and I recommend an appropriation to carry into effect the provisions thereof relative to the payment of the proportion of the United States toward the capitalization of the said dues., I transmit herewith the letter of the Secretary of War, with accompanying report of the Adjutant-General, in reply to the resolution of the House of Representatives, dated December 7, 1864, requesting me ""to communicate to the House the report made by Col. Thomas M. Key of an interview between himself and General Howell Cobb on the fourteenth [15th] day of June, 1862, on the banks of the Chickahominy, on the subject of the exchange of prisoners of war."", Whereas the act of Congress of the twenty-eighth of September, 1850, entitled ""An act to create additional collection districts in the State of California, and to change the existing districts therein, and to modify the existing collection districts in the United States,"" extends to merchandise warehoused under bond the privilege of being exported to the British North American provinces adjoining the United States, in the manner prescribed in the act of Congress of the third of March, 1845, which designates certain frontier ports through which merchandise may be exported, and further provides ""that such other ports situated on the frontiers of the United States, adjoining the British North American provinces, as may hereafter be found expedient, may have extended to them the like privileges on the recommendation of the Secretary of the Treasury, and proclamation duly made by the President of the United States, specially designating the ports to which the aforesaid privileges are to be extended;""  Now, therefore, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States of America, in accordance with the recommendation of the Secretary of the Treasury, do hereby declare and proclaim that the port of St. Albans, in the State of Vermont, is, and shall be, entitled to all the privileges in regard to the exportation of merchandise in bond to the British North American provinces adjoining the United States, which are extended to the ports enumerated in the seventh section of the act of Congress of the third of March, 1845, aforesaid, from and after the date of this proclamation., In witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand, and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed., Done at the city of Washington, this tenth day of January, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred-and sixty-five, and of the independence of the United States of America the eighty-ninth., No principal report of yours on the Wilmington expedition has ever reached the War Department, as I am informed there., A preliminary report did reach here, but was returned to General Grant at his request., Of course, leave to publish cannot be given without inspection of the paper, and not then if it should be deemed to be detrimental to the public service., Yours asking leave to come to Washington is received., You have been summoned by the Committee on the Conduct of the War to attend here, which, of course, you will do., Yours announcing ordinance of emancipation received., Thanks to the convention and to you., When do you expect to be here?, Would be glad to have your suggestion as to supplying your place of military governor., It is represented to me that there is so much irregular violence in northern Missouri as to be driving away the people and almost depopulating it., Please gather information, and consider whether an appeal to the people there to go to their homes and let one another alone recognizing as a full right of protection for each that he lets others alone, and banning only him who refuses to let others alone may not enable you to withdraw the troops, their presence itself [being] a cause of irritation and constant apprehension, and thus restore peace and quiet, and returning prosperity., Please consider this and telegraph or write me., You having shown me Mr. Davis's letter to you of the twelfth instant, you may say to him that I have constantly been, am now, and shall continue, ready to receive any agent whom he or any other influential person now resisting the national authority may informally send to me with the view of securing peace to the people of our one common country., Please read and answer this letter as though I was not President, but only a friend., My son, now in his twenty-second year, having graduated at Harvard, wishes to see something of the war before it ends., I do not wish to put him in the ranks, nor yet to give him a commission, to which those who have already served long are better entitled and better qualified to hold., Could he, without embarrassment to you, or detriment to the service, go into your military family with some nominal rank, I, and not the public, furnishing his necessary means?, If no, say so without the least hesitation, because I am as anxious and as deeply interested that you shall not be encumbered as you can be yourself., If Mrs. Beattie, alias Mrs. Wolff, shall be sentenced to death, notify me, and postpone the execution till further order., You have a man in arrest for desertion passing by the name of Stanley., ...]",3
300,"[Answer me on this., Complaint is made to me, by Vermont, that the assignment of her quota for the draft on the pending call is intrinsically unjust, and also in bad faith of the Government's promise to fairly allow credits for men previously furnished., To illustrate, a supposed case is stated as follows:  Vermont and New Hampshire must between them furnish six thousand men on the pending call; and being equal, each must furnish as many as the other in the long run., But the Government finds that on former calls Vermont furnished a surplus of five hundred, and New Hampshire a surplus, of fifteen hundred., These two surpluses making two thousand and added to the six thousand, making eight thousand to be furnished by the two States, or four thousand each less, by fair credits., Then subtract Vermont's surplus of five hundred from her four thousand, leaves three thousand five hundred as her quota on the pending call; and likewise subtract New Hampshire's surplus of fifteen hundred from her four thousand, leaves two thousand five hundred as her quota on the pending call., These three thousand five hundred and two thousand five hundred make precisely six thousand, which the supposed case requires from the two States, and it is just equal for Vermont to furnish one thousand more now than New Hampshire, because New Hampshire has heretofore furnished one thousand more than Vermont, which equalizes the burdens of the two in the long run., And this result, so far from being bad faith to Vermont, is indispensable to keeping good faith with New Hampshire., By no other result can the six thousand men be obtained from the two States, and, at the same time deal justly and keep faith with both, and we do but confuse ourselves in questioning the process by which the right result is reached., The supposed case is perfect as an illustration., The pending call is not for three hundred thousand men subject to fair credits, but is for three hundred thousand remaining after all fair credits have been deducted, and it is impossible to concede what Vermont asks without coming out short of three hundred thousand men, or making other localities pay for the partiality shown her., This upon the case stated., If there be different reasons for making an allowance to Vermont, let them be presented and considered., The joint resolution entitled ""Joint resolution declaring certain States not entitled to representation in the electoral college"" has been signed by the Executive in deference to the view of Congress implied in its passage and presentation to him., In his own view, however, the two Houses of Congress, convened under the twelfth article of the Constitution, have complete power to exclude from counting all electoral votes deemed by them to be illegal, and it is not competent for the Executive to defeat or obstruct that power by a veto, as would be the case if his action were at all essential in the matter., He disclaims all right of the Executive to interfere in any way in the matter of canvassing or counting electoral votes, and he also disclaims that by signing said resolution he has expressed any opinion on the recitals of the preamble or any judgment of his own upon the subject of the resolution., I am called on by the House of Representatives to give an account of my interview with Messrs. Stephens, Hunter, and Campbell, and it is very desirable to me to put your despatch of February 1, to the Secretary of War, in which, among other things, you say: ""I fear now their going back without any expression from any one in authority will have a bad influence."", I think the despatch does you credit, while I do not see that it can embarrass you., May I use it?, With deep gratitude to my countrymen for this mark of their confidence; with a distrust of my own ability to perform the duty required under the most favorable circumstances, and now rendered doubly difficult by existing national perils; yet with a firm reliance on the strength of our free government, and the eventual loyalty of the people to the just principles upon which it is founded, and above all with an unshaken faith in the Supreme Ruler of nations, I accept this trust., Be pleased to signify this to the respective Houses of Congress., In response to your resolution of the eighth instant, requesting information in relation to a conference recently held in Hampton Roads, I have the honor to state that on the day of the date I gave Francis P. Blair, Sr., a card, written on as follows, to wit:  Allow the bearer, F. P. Blair, Sr., to pass our lines, go South, and return., Your having shown me Mr. Davis's letter to you of the twelfth instant, you may say to him that I have constantly been, am now, and shall continue ready to receive any agent whom he or any other influential person now resisting the national authority may informally send to me with the view of securing peace to the people of our one common country., Afterwards Mr. Blair dictated for and authorized me to make an entry on the back of my retained copy of the letter last above recited, which entry is as follows:  To-day Mr. Blair tells me that on the twenty-first instant he delivered to Mr. Davis the original of which the within is a copy, and left it with him; that at the time of delivering it Mr. Davis read it over twice in Mr. Blair's presence, at the close of which he (Mr. Blair) remarked that the part about ""our one common country"" related to the part of Mr. Davis' letter about ""the two countries,"" to which Mr. Davis replied that he so understood it., Afterwards the Secretary of War placed in my hands the following telegram, indorsed by him, as appears:  You will proceed with the documents placed in your hands, and on reaching General Ord will deliver him the letter addressed to him by the Secretary of War; then, by General Ord's assistance, procure an interview with Messrs. Stephens, Hunter, and Campbell, or any of them., Deliver to him or them the paper on which your own letter is written., Note on the copy which you retain the time of delivery and to whom delivered., Receive their answer in writing, waiting a reasonable time for it, and which, if it contain their decision to come through without further condition, will be your warrant to ask General Ord to pass them through, as directed in the letter of the Secretary of War to him., If by their answer they decline to come, or propose other terms, do not have them pass through., And this being your whole duty, return and report to me., I am instructed by the President of the United States to place this paper in your hands, with the information that if you pass through the United States military lines it will be understood that you do so for the purpose of an informal conference on the basis of the letter a copy of which is on the reverse side of this sheet, and that if you choose to pass on such understanding, and so notify me in writing, I will procure the commanding general to pass you through the lines and to Fortress Monroe under such military precautions as he may deem prudent, and at which place you will be met in due time by some person or persons for the purpose of such informal conference; and, further, that you shall have protection, safe conduct, and safe return in all events., Your having shown me Mr. Davis's letter to you of the twelfth instant, you may say to him that I have constantly been, am now, and shall continue ready to receive any agent whom he or any other influential person now resisting the national authority may informally send to me with the view of securing peace to the people of our one common country., Afterwards, but before Major Eckert had departed, the following dispatch was received from General Grant:  This, it will be perceived, transferred General Ord's agency in the matter to General Grant., I resolved, however, to send Major Eckert forward with his message, and accordingly telegraphed General Grant as follows, to wit:  A messenger is coming to you on the business contained in your despatch., Detain the gentlemen in comfortable quarters until he arrives, and then act upon the message he brings as far as applicable, it having been made up to pass through General Ord's hands, and when the gentlemen were supposed to be beyond our lines., The President desires that you will please procure for the bearer, Major Thomas T. Eckert, an interview with Messrs. Stephens, Hunter, and Campbell, and if on his return to you he requests it pass them through our lines to Fortress Monroe by such route and under such military precautions as you may deem prudent, giving them protection and comfortable quarters while there, and that you let none of this have any effect upon your movements or plans., You will proceed to Fortress Monroe, Va., there to meet and informally confer with Messrs. Stephens, Hunter, and Campbell on the basis of my letter to F. P. Blair, Esq., of January 18, 1865, a copy of which you have., You will make known to them that three things are indispensable, to Wit:  1., The restoration of the national authority throughout all the States., 2., No receding by the Executive of the United States on the slavery question from the position assumed thereon in the late annual message to Congress and in preceding documents., 3., No cessation of hostilities short of an end of the war and the disbanding of all forces hostile to the Government., You will inform them that all propositions of theirs not inconsistent with the above will be considered and passed upon in a spirit of sincere liberality., You will hear all they may choose to say and report it to me., You will not assume to definitely consummate anything., On the day of its date the following telegram was sent to General Grant:  Let nothing which is transpiring change, hinder, or delay your military movements or plans., Call at Fortress Monroe and put yourself under direction of Mr. S., whom you will find there., Say to the gentlemen I will meet them personally at Fortress Monroe as soon as I can get there., Induced by a despatch from General Grant, I join you at Fort Monroe as soon as I can come., Before starting, the following despatch was shown me., I proceeded, nevertheless:  On the night of the 2nd I reached Hampton Roads, found the Secretary of State and Major Eckert on a steamer anchored offshore, and learned of them that the Richmond gentlemen were on another steamer also anchored offshore, in the Roads, and that the Secretary of State had not yet seen or communicated with them., I ascertained that Major Eckert had literally complied with his instructions, and I saw for the first time the answer of the Richmond gentlemen to him, which in his despatch to me of the 1st he characterizes as ""not satisfactory."", That answer is as follows, to wit:  On the morning of the third the three gentlemen, Messrs. Stephens, Hunter, and Campbell, came aboard of our steamer and had an interview with the Secretary of State and myself of several hours' duration., No question of preliminaries to the meeting was then and there made or mentioned; no other person was present; no papers were exchanged or produced; and it was in advance agreed that the conversation was to be informal and verbal merely., On our part the whole substance of the instructions to the Secretary of State hereinbefore recited was stated and insisted upon, and nothing was said inconsistent therewith; while by the other party it was not said that in any event or on any condition they ever would consent to reunion, and yet they equally omitted to declare that they never would consent., They seemed to desire a postponement of that question and the adoption of some other course first, which, as some of them seemed to argue, might or might not lead to reunion, but which course we thought would amount to an indefinite postponement., The conference ended without result., The foregoing, containing, as is believed, all the information sought is respectfully submitted., In answer to the resolution of the Senate of the eighth instant, requesting information concerning recent conversations or communications with insurgents, under executive sanction, I transmit a report from the Secretary of State, to whom the resolution was referred., The Secretary of State, to whom was referred a resolution of the Senate of the 8th instant, requesting ""the President of the United States, if, in his opinion, not incompatible with the public interests, to furnish to the Senate any information in his possession concerning recent conversations or communications with certain rebels, said to have taken place under executive sanction, including communications with the rebel Jefferson Davis, and any correspondence relating thereto,"" has the honor to report that the Senate may properly be referred to a special message of the President bearing upon the subject of the resolution, and transmitted to the House this day., Appended to this report is a copy of an instruction which has been addressed to Charles Francis Adams, Esq., envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary of the United States at London, and which is the only correspondence found in this department touching the subject referred to in the resolution., It is made my agreeable duty to enclose herewith the joint resolution approved 24th January, 1865, tendering the thanks of Congress to yourself, the officers and men under your command for their gallantry and good conduct in the capture of Fort Fisher, and through you to all who participated in that brilliant and decisive victory under your command., I understand that provost-marshals in different parts of Missouri are assuming to decide that the conditions of bonds are forfeited, and therefore are seizing and selling property to pay damages., This, if true, is both outrageous and ridiculous., Do not allow it., The courts, and not provost-marshals, are to decide such questions unless when military necessity makes an exception., Also excuse John Eaton, of Clay County, and Wesley Martin, of Platte, from being sent South, and let them go East if anywhere., While I cannot order as within requested, allow me to say that it is my wish for you to relieve the people from all burdens, harassments, and oppressions, so far as is possible consistently with your military necessities; that the object of the war being to restore and maintain the blessings of peace and good government, I desire you to help, and not hinder, every advance in that direction., Of your military necessities you must judge and execute, but please do so in the spirit and with the purpose above indicated., Yours of yesterday about provost-marshal system received., As part of the same subject, let me say I am now pressed in regard to a pending assessment in St. Louis County., Please examine and satisfy yourself whether this assessment should proceed or be abandoned; and if you decide that it is to proceed, please examine as to the propriety of its application to a gentleman by the name of Charles McLaran., Please ascertain whether General Fisk's administration is as good as it might be, and answer me., Whereas objects of interest to the United States require that the Senate should be convened at twelve o'clock on the fourth of March next to receive and act upon such communications as may be made to it on the part of the Executive;  Now, therefore, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States, have considered it to be my duty to issue this, my proclamation, declaring that an extraordinary occasion requires the Senate of the United States to convene for the transaction of business at the Capitol, in the city of Washington, on the fourth day of March next, at twelve o'clock at noon on that day, of which all who shall at that time be entitled to act as members of that body are hereby required to take notice., Chaplain Fitzgibbon yesterday sent me a despatch invoking Clemency for Jackson, Stewart, and Randall, who are to be shot to-day., The despatch is so vague that there is no means here of ascertaining whether or not the execution of sentence of one or more of them may not already have been ordered., If not suspend execution of sentence m their cases until further orders and forward records of trials for examination., I am in a little perplexity., I was induced to authorize a gentleman to bring Roger A. Pryor here with a view of effecting an exchange of him; but since then I have seen a despatch of yours showing that you specially object to his exchange., Meantime he has reached here and reported to me., It is an ungracious thing for me to send him back to prison, and yet inadmissible for him to remain here long., Cannot you help me out with it?, I can conceive that there may be difference to you in days, and I can keep him a few days to accommodate on that point., I have not heard of my son's reaching you., Please inquire and report to me whether there is any propriety of longer keeping in Gratiott Street Prison a man said to be there by the name of Riley Whiting., General Sheridan's despatch to you, of to-day, in which he says he ""will be off on Monday,"" and that he ""will leave behind about two thousand men,"" causes the Secretary of War and myself considerable anxiety., Have you well considered whether you do not again leave open the Shenandoah Valley entrance to Maryland and Pennsylvania, or, at least, to the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad?, Subsequent reflection, conference with General Halleck, your despatch, and one from General Sheridan, have relieved my anxiety; and so I beg that you will dismiss any concern you may have on my account, in the matter of my last despatch., Your statement to Major-General Hurlbut of the condition of the freedmen of your department, and of your success in the work of their moral and physical elevation, has reached me and given me much pleasure., That we shall be entirely successful in our efforts I firmly believe., The blessing of God and the efforts of good and faithful men will bring us an earlier and happier consummation than the most sanguine friends of the freedmen could reasonably expect., You have not sent contents of Richmond papers for Tuesday or Wednesday., Did you not receive them?, If not, does it indicate anything?, The President directs me to say to you that he wishes you to have no conference with General Lee unless it be for the capitulation of General Lee's army, or on some minor and purely military matter., He instructs me to say that you are not to decide, discuss, or confer upon any political question., Such questions the President holds in his own hands, and will submit them to no military conferences or conventions., Meantime you are to press to the utmost your military advantages., At this second appearing to take the oath of the presidential office there is less occasion for an extended address than there was at the first., ...]",3
301,"[I have said now more than I intended, and will therefore bid you good-by., Whereas reliable information has been received that hostile Indians, within the limits of the United States, have been furnished with arms and munitions of war by persons dwelling in conterminous foreign territory, and are thereby enabled to prosecute their savage warfare upon the exposed and sparse settlements of the frontier;  Now, therefore, be it known that I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim and direct that all persons detected in that nefarious traffic shall be arrested and tried by court-martial at the nearest military post, and if convicted, shall receive the punishment due to their deserts., In witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand, and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed  I am unwilling for the sentence to stand, and be executed, to any extent in this case., In the absence of a more adequate motive than the evidence discloses, I am wholly unable to believe in the existence of criminal or fraudulent intent on the part of men of such well established good character., If the evidence went as far to establish a guilty profit of one or two hundred thousand dollars, as it does of one or two hundred dollars, the case would, on the question of guilt, bear a far different aspect., That on this contract, involving some twelve hundred thousand dollars, the contractors would plan, and attempt to execute a fraud which, at the most, could profit them only one or two hundred, or even one thousand dollars, is to my mind beyond the power of rational belief., That they did not, in such a case, make far greater gains, proves that they did not, with guilty or fraudulent intent, make at all., The judgment and sentence are disapproved, and declared null, and the defendants are fully discharged., Understanding that the plan of action for Missouri contained in your letter to the Governor of that State, and your other letter to me, is concurred in by the Governor, it is approved by me, and you will be sustained in proceeding upon it., Is it true that George W. Lane is detained at Norfolk without any charge against him?, And if so why is it done?, If you choose to go to New Mexico and reside, I will appoint you chief justice there., What say you?, Please answer., Seeing your despatch about General Crook, and fearing that through misapprehension something unpleasant may occur, I send you below two despatches of General Grant, which I suppose will fully explain General Crook's movements., Allow Mrs. R. S. Ewell the benefit of my amnesty proclamation on her taking the oath., Arrived here all safe about 9 P.M. yesterday., No war news., General Grant does not seem to know very much about Yeatman, but thinks very well of him so far as he does know., I like Mr. Whiting very much, and hence would wish him to remain or resign as best suits himself., Hearing this much from me, do as you think best in the matter., General Lee has sent the Russell letter back, concluding, as I understand from Grant, that their dignity does not admit of their receiving the document from us., Robert just now tells me there was a little rumpus up the line this morning, ending about where it began., I am here within five miles of the scene of this morning's action., I have nothing to add to what General Meade reports except that I have seen the prisoners myself and they look like there might be the number he states--1600., I approve your Fort Sumter programme., Grant don't seem to know Yeatman very well, but thinks very well of him so far as he knows., Thinks it probable that Y. is here now, for the place., I told you this yesterday as well as that you should do as you think best about Mr. Whiting's resignation, but I suppose you did not receive the dispatch., I am on the boat and have no later war news than went to you last night., Yours inclosing Fort Sumter order received., I think of but one suggestion., I feel quite confident that Sumter fell on the 13th, and not on the 14th of April, as you have it., It fell on Saturday, the 13th; the first call for troops on our part was got up on Sunday, the 14th, and given date and issued on Monday, the 15th., Look up the old almanac and other data, and see if I am not right., After your explanation, I think it is little or no difference whether the Fort Sumter ceremony takes place on the 13th or 14th., General Sherman tells me he is well acquainted with James Yeatman, and that he thinks him almost the best man in the country for anything he will undertake., I begin to feel that I ought to be at home and yet I dislike to leave without seeing nearer to the end of General Grant's present movement., He has now been out since yesterday morning and although he has not been diverted from his programme no considerable effort has yet been produced so far as we know here., Last night at 10.15 P. M. when it was dark as a rainy night without a moon could be, a furious cannonade soon joined in by a heavy musketry fire opened near Petersburg and lasted about two hours., The sound was very distinct here as also were the flashes of the guns up the clouds., It seemed to me a great battle, but the older hands here scarcely noticed it and sure enough this morning it was found that very little had been done., At 12.30 P.M. to-day General Grant telegraphed me as follows: ""There has been much hard fighting this morning., The enemy drove our left from near Dabney's house back well toward the Boydton plank road., We are now about to take the offensive at that point, and I hope will more than recover the lost ground."", Later he telegraphed again as follows:  ""Our troops, after being driven back to the Boydton plank road, turned and drove the enemy in turn, and took the White Oak road, which we now have., This gives us the ground occupied by the enemy this morning., I will send you a rebel flag captured by our troops in driving the enemy back., There have been four flags captured to-day."", Judging by the two points from which General Grant telegraphs, I infer that he moved his headquarters about one mile since he sent the first of the two despatches., Yours to Colonel Bowers about the Secretary of War is shown to me., He is not here, nor have I any notice that he is coming., I presume the mistake comes of the fact that the Secretary of State was here., He started back to Washington this morning., I have your two despatches of this morning, and am anxious to hear from Sheridan., I have had two despatches from General Grant since my last to you, but they contain little additional, except that Sheridan also had pretty hot work yesterday, that infantry was sent to his support during the night, and that he (Grant) has not since heard from Sheridan., Mrs. Lincoln has started home, and I will thank you to see that our coachman is at the Arsenal wharf at eight o'clock to-morrow morning, there to wait until she arrives., Despatch just received, showing that Sheridan, aided by Warren, had, at 2 P.M., pushed the enemy back, so as to retake the Five Forks and bring his own headquarters up to J. Boisseau's., The Five Forks were barricaded by the enemy and carried by Devin's division of cavalry., This part of the enemy seem to now be trying to work along the White Oak road, to join the main force in front of Grant, while Sheridan and Warren are pressing them as closely as possible., Yours showing Sheridan's success of to-day is just received and highly appreciated., Having no great deal to do here, I am still sending the substance of your despatches to the Secretary of War., Last night General Grant telegraphed that General Sheridan with his cavalry and the Fifth Corps had captured three brigades of infantry, a train of wagons, and several batteries, prisoners amounting to several thousand., This morning General Grant having ordered an attack along the whole line telegraphs as follows., Robert yesterday wrote a little cheerful note to Captain Penrose, which is all he has heard of him since you left., Last night General Grant telegraphed that General Sheridan, with his cavalry and the Fifth Corps, had captured three brigades of infantry, a train of wagons, and several batteries; the prisoners amounting to several thousand., This morning General Grant, having ordered an attack along the whole line, telegraphs as follows:  ""Both Wright and Parke got through the enemy's lines., The battle now rages furiously., General Sheridan, with his cavalry, the Fifth corps, and Miles's Division of the Second Corps, which was sent to him this morning, is now sweeping down from the west., ""All now looks highly favorable., General Ord is engaged, but I have not yet heard the result in his front."", Despatches are frequently coming in., All is going on finely., Generals Parke, Wright, and Ord's lines are extending from the Appomattox to Hatcher's Run., They have all broken through the enemy's intrenched lines, taking some forts, guns, and prisoners., Sheridan, with his own cavalry, the Fifth Corps, and part of the Second, is coming in from the west on the enemy's flank., Wright is already tearing up the Southside Railroad., ""Everything has been carried from the left of the Ninth Corps., The Sixth Corps alone captured more than three thousand prisoners., The Second and Twenty-fourth Corps captured forts, guns, and prisoners from the enemy, but I cannot tell the numbers., We are now closing around the works of the line immediately enveloping Petersburg., All looks remarkably well., I have not yet heard from Sheridan., His headquarters have been moved up to Banks's house, near the Boydton road, about three miles southwest of Petersburg."", At 4.30 P.M. to-day General Grant telegraphs that he has Petersburg completely enveloped from river below to river above, and has captured, since he started last Wednesday, about twelve thousand prisoners and fifty guns., He suggests that I shall go out and see him in the morning, which I think I will do., Tad and I are both well, and will be glad to see you and your party here at the time you name., Allow me to tender to you and all with you the nation's grateful thanks for this additional and magnificent success., At your kind suggestion I think I will meet you to-morrow., This morning Lieutenant-General Grant reports Petersburg evacuated, and he is confident that Richmond also is., He is pushing forward to cut off, if possible, the retreating rebel army., Yours received., Thanks for your caution, but I have already been to Petersburg., Staid with General Grant an hour and a half and returned here., It is certain now that Richmond is in our hands, and I think I will go there to-morrow., I will take care of myself., General Weitzel telegraphs from Richmond that of railroad stock he found there twenty-eight locomotives, forty-four passenger and baggage cars, and one hundred and six freight cars., At 3.30 this evening General Grant, from Sutherland's Station, ten miles from Petersburg toward Burkevllle, telegraphs as follows:  Yours of to-day received., I think there is no probability of my remaining here more than two days longer., If that is too long come down., ...]",3
302,"[These twelve thousand persons are thus fully committed to the Union and to perpetuate freedom in the State--committed to the very things, and nearly all things, the nation wants--and they ask the nation's recognition and its assistance to make good this committal., Now, if we reject and spurn them, we do our utmost to disorganize and disperse them., We, in fact, say to the white man: You are worthless or worse; we will neither help you nor be helped by you., To the blacks we say: This cup of liberty which these, your old masters, held to your lips, we will dash from you, and leave you to the chances of gathering the spilled and scattered contents in some vague and undefined when, where, and how., If this course, discouraging and paralyzing both white and black, has any tendency to bring Louisiana into proper practical relations with the Union, I have so far been unable to perceive it., If, on the contrary, we recognize and sustain the new government of Louisiana, the converse of all this is made true., We encourage the hearts and nerve the arms of twelve thousand to adhere to their work, and argue for it, and proselyte for it, and fight for it, and feed it, and grow it, and ripen it to a complete success., The colored man, too, in seeing all united for him, is inspired with vigilance, and energy, and daring to the same end., Grant that he desires the elective franchise, will he not attain it sooner by saving the already advanced steps towards it, than by running backward over them?, Concede that the new government of Louisiana is only to what it should be as the egg is to the fowl, we shall sooner have the fowl by hatching the egg than by smashing it., Again, if we reject Louisiana, we also reject one vote in favor of the proposed amendment to the National Constitution., To meet this proposition, it has been argued that no more than three fourths of those States which have not attempted secession are necessary to validly ratify the amendment., I do not commit myself against this, further than to say that such a ratification would be questionable, and sure to be persistently questioned, while a ratification by three fourths of all the States would be unquestioned and unquestionable., I repeat the question, Can Louisiana be brought into proper practical relation with the Union sooner by sustaining or by discarding her new State government?, What has been said of Louisiana will apply to other States., And yet so great peculiarities pertain to each State, and such important and sudden changes occur in the same State, and withal so new and unprecedented is the whole case, that no exclusive and inflexible plan can safely be prescribed as to details and collaterals., Such exclusive and inflexible plan would surely become a new entanglement., Important principles may and must be inflexible., In the present situation as the phrase goes, it may be my duty to make some new announcement to the people of the South., I am considering, and shall not fail to act, when satisfied that action will be proper., I have seen your despatch to Colonel Hardie about the matter of prayers., I do not remember hearing prayers spoken of while I was in Richmond; but I have no doubt you have acted in what appeared to you to be the spirit and temper manifested by me while there., Is there any sign of the rebel legislature coming together on the understanding of my letter to you?, If there is any such sign, inform me what it is; if there is no such sign, you may withdraw the offer., I have just seen Judge Campbell's letter to you of the 7th., He assumes, as appears to me, that I have called the insurgent legislature of Virginia together, as the rightful legislature of the State, to settle all differences with the United States., I have done no such thing., I spoke of them, not as a legislature, but as ""the gentlemen who have acted as the legislature of Virginia in support of the rebellion."", I did this on purpose to exclude the assumption that I was recognizing them as a rightful body., I deal with them as men having power de facto to do a specific thing, to wit: ""To withdraw the Virginia troops and other support from resistance to the General Government,"" for which, in the paper handed Judge Campbell, I promised a specific equivalent, to wit: a remission to the people of the State, except in certain cases, of the confiscation of their property., I meant this, and no more., Inasmuch, however, as Judge Campbell misconstrues this, and is still pressing for an armistice, contrary to the explicit statement of the paper I gave him, and particularly as General Grant has since captured the Virginia troops, so that giving a consideration for their withdrawal is no longer applicable, let my letter to you and the paper to Judge Campbell both be withdrawn, or countermanded, and he be notified of it., Do not now allow them to assemble, but if any have come, allow them safe return to their homes., Mr. Colfax, I want you to take a message from me to the miners whom you visit., I have very large ideas of the mineral wealth of our nation., I believe it practically inexhaustible., It abounds all over the Western country, from the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific, and its development has scarcely commenced., During the war, when we were adding a couple of millions of dollars every day to our national debt, I did not care about encouraging the increase in the volume of our precious metals., We had the country to save first., But now that the rebellion is overthrown, and we know pretty nearly the amount of our national debt, the more gold and silver we mine, we make the payment of that debt so much the easier., ""Now,"" said he, speaking with more emphasis, ""I am going to encourage that in every possible way., We shall have hundreds of thousands of disbanded soldiers, and many have feared that their return home in such great numbers might paralyze industry, by furnishing, suddenly, a greater supply of labor than there will be demand for., I am going to try to attract them to the hidden wealth of our mountain ranges, where there is room enough for all., Immigration, which even the war has not stopped, will land upon our shores hundreds of thousands more per year from overcrowded Europe., I intend to point them to the gold and silver that wait for them in the West., Tell the miners for me, that I shall promote their interests to the utmost of my ability;

303,"[THIS little volume (the result of meditation and experience) is not
intended as an exhaustive treatise on the much-written-upon subject
of the power of thought., It is suggestive rather than explanatory,
its object being to stimulate men and women to the discovery and
perception of the truth that--

""They themselves are makers of themselves."", by virtue of the thoughts, which they choose and encourage; that
mind is the master-weaver, both of the inner garment of character
and the outer garment of circumstance, and that, as they may have
hitherto woven in ignorance and pain they may now weave in
enlightenment and happiness., AS A MAN THINKETH

THOUGHT AND CHARACTER


THE aphorism, ""As a man thinketh in his heart so is he,"" not only
embraces the whole of a man's being, but is so comprehensive as to
reach out to every condition and circumstance of his life., A man is
literally _what he thinks,_ his character being the complete sum of
all his thoughts., As the plant springs from, and could not be without, the seed, so
every act of a man springs from the hidden seeds of thought, and
could not have appeared without them., This applies equally to those
acts called ""spontaneous"" and ""unpremeditated"" as to those, which
are deliberately executed., Act is the blossom of thought, and joy and suffering are its fruits;
thus does a man garner in the sweet and bitter fruitage of his own
husbandry., ""Thought in the mind hath made us, What we are
  By thought was wrought and built., If a man's mind
  Hath evil thoughts, pain comes on him as comes
  The wheel the ox behind...., ..If one endure
  In purity of thought, joy follows him
  As his own shadow--sure."", Man is a growth by law, and not a creation by artifice, and cause
and effect is as absolute and undeviating in the hidden realm of
thought as in the world of visible and material things., A noble and
Godlike character is not a thing of favour or chance, but is the
natural result of continued effort in right thinking, the effect of
long-cherished association with Godlike thoughts., An ignoble and
bestial character, by the same process, is the result of the
continued harbouring of grovelling thoughts., Man is made or unmade by himself; in the armoury of thought he
forges the weapons by which he destroys himself; he also fashions
the tools with which he builds for himself heavenly mansions of joy
and strength and peace., By the right choice and true application of
thought, man ascends to the Divine Perfection; by the abuse and
wrong application of thought, he descends below the level of the
beast., Between these two extremes are all the grades of character,
and man is their maker and master., Of all the beautiful truths pertaining to the soul which have been
restored and brought to light in this age, none is more gladdening
or fruitful of divine promise and confidence than this--that man is
the master of thought, the moulder of character, and the maker and
shaper of condition, environment, and destiny., As a being of Power, Intelligence, and Love, and the lord of his own
thoughts, man holds the key to every situation, and contains within
himself that transforming and regenerative agency by which he may
make himself what he wills., Man is always the master, even in his weaker and most abandoned
state; but in his weakness and degradation he is the foolish master
who misgoverns his ""household."", When he begins to reflect upon his
condition, and to search diligently for the Law upon which his being
is established, he then becomes the wise master, directing his
energies with intelligence, and fashioning his thoughts to fruitful
issues., Such is the _conscious_ master, and man can only thus become
by discovering _within himself_ the laws of thought; which discovery
is totally a matter of application, self analysis, and experience., Only by much searching and mining, are gold and diamonds obtained,
and man can find every truth connected with his being, if he will
dig deep into the mine of his soul; and that he is the maker of his
character, the moulder of his life, and the builder of his destiny,
he may unerringly prove, if he will watch, control, and alter his
thoughts, tracing their effects upon himself, upon others, and upon
his life and circumstances, linking cause and effect by patient
practice and investigation, and utilizing his every experience, even
to the most trivial, everyday occurrence, as a means of obtaining
that knowledge of himself which is Understanding, Wisdom, Power., In
this direction, as in no other, is the law absolute that ""He that
seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened;"" for
only by patience, practice, and ceaseless importunity can a man
enter the Door of the Temple of Knowledge., EFFECT OF THOUGHT ON CIRCUMSTANCES


MAN'S mind may be likened to a garden, which may be intelligently
cultivated or allowed to run wild; but whether cultivated or
neglected, it must, and will, _bring forth._ If no useful seeds are
_put_ into it, then an abundance of useless weed-seeds will _fall_
therein, and will continue to produce their kind., Just as a gardener cultivates his plot, keeping it free from weeds,
and growing the flowers and fruits which he requires, so may a man
tend the garden of his mind, weeding out all the wrong, useless, and
impure thoughts, and cultivating toward perfection the flowers and
fruits of right, useful, and pure thoughts., By pursuing this
process, a man sooner or later discovers that he is the
master-gardener of his soul, the director of his life., He also
reveals, within himself, the laws of thought, and understands, with
ever-increasing accuracy, how the thought-forces and mind elements
operate in the shaping of his character, circumstances, and destiny., Thought and character are one, and as character can only manifest
and discover itself through environment and circumstance, the outer
conditions of a person's life will always be found to be
harmoniously related to his inner state., This does not mean that a
man's circumstances at any given time are an indication of his
_entire_ character, but that those circumstances are so intimately
connected with some vital thought-element within himself that, for
the time being, they are indispensable to his development., Every man is where he is by the law of his being; the thoughts which
he has built into his character have brought him there, and in the
arrangement of his life there is no element of chance, but all is
the result of a law which cannot err., This is just as true of those
who feel ""out of harmony"" with their surroundings as of those who
are contented with them., As a progressive and evolving being, man is where he is that he may
learn that he may grow; and as he learns the spiritual lesson which
any circumstance contains for him, it passes away and gives place to
other circumstances., Man is buffeted by circumstances so long as he believes himself to
be the creature of outside conditions, but when he realizes that he
is a creative power, and that he may command the hidden soil and
seeds of his being out of which circumstances grow, he then becomes
the rightful master of himself., That circumstances grow out of thought every man knows who has for
any length of time practised self-control and self-purification, for
he will have noticed that the alteration in his circumstances has
been in exact ratio with his altered mental condition., So true is
this that when a man earnestly applies himself to remedy the defects
in his character, and makes swift and marked progress, he passes
rapidly through a succession of vicissitudes., The soul attracts that which it secretly harbours; that which it
loves, and also that which it fears; it reaches the height of its
cherished aspirations; it falls to the level of its unchastened
desires,--and circumstances are the means by which the soul receives
its own., Every thought-seed sown or allowed to fall into the mind, and to
take root there, produces its own, blossoming sooner or later into
act, and bearing its own fruitage of opportunity and circumstance., Good thoughts bear good fruit, bad thoughts bad fruit., The outer world of circumstance shapes itself to the inner world of
thought, and both pleasant and unpleasant external conditions are
factors, which make for the ultimate good of the individual., As the
reaper of his own harvest, man learns both by suffering and bliss., Following the inmost desires, aspirations, thoughts, by which he
allows himself to be dominated, (pursuing the will-o'-the-wisps of
impure imaginings or steadfastly walking the highway of strong and
high endeavour), a man at last arrives at their fruition and
fulfilment in the outer conditions of his life., The laws of growth
and adjustment everywhere obtains., A man does not come to the almshouse or the jail by the tyranny of
fate or circumstance, but by the pathway of grovelling thoughts and
base desires., Nor does a pure-minded man fall suddenly into crime by
stress of any mere external force; the criminal thought had long
been secretly fostered in the heart, and the hour of opportunity
revealed its gathered power., Circumstance does not make the man; it
reveals him to himself No such conditions can exist as descending
into vice and its attendant sufferings apart from vicious
inclinations, or ascending into virtue and its pure happiness
without the continued cultivation of virtuous aspirations; and man,
therefore, as the lord and master of thought, is the maker of
himself the shaper and author of environment., Even at birth the soul
comes to its own and through every step of its earthly pilgrimage it
attracts those combinations of conditions which reveal itself, which
are the reflections of its own purity and, impurity, its strength
and weakness., Men do not attract that which they _want,_ but that which they _are._
Their whims, fancies, and ambitions are thwarted at every step, but
their inmost thoughts and desires are fed with their own food, be it
foul or clean., The ""divinity that shapes our ends"" is in ourselves;
it is our very self., Only himself manacles man: thought and action
are the gaolers of Fate--they imprison, being base; they are also
the angels of Freedom--they liberate, being noble., Not what he
wishes and prays for does a man get, but what he justly earns., His
wishes and prayers are only gratified and answered when they
harmonize with his thoughts and actions., In the light of this truth, what, then, is the meaning of ""fighting
against circumstances?"", It means that a man is continually revolting
against an _effect_ without, while all the time he is nourishing and
preserving its _cause_ in his heart., That cause may take the form of
a conscious vice or an unconscious weakness; but whatever it is, it
stubbornly retards the efforts of its possessor, and thus calls
aloud for remedy., Men are anxious to improve their circumstances, but are unwilling to
improve themselves; they therefore remain bound., The man who does
not shrink from self-crucifixion can never fail to accomplish the
object upon which his heart is set., This is as true of earthly as of
heavenly things., Even the man whose sole object is to acquire wealth
must be prepared to make great personal sacrifices before he can
accomplish his object; and how much more so he who would realize a
strong and well-poised life?, Here is a man who is wretchedly poor., He is extremely anxious that
his surroundings and home comforts should be improved, yet all the
time he shirks his work, and considers he is justified in trying to
deceive his employer on the ground of the insufficiency of his
wages., Such a man does not understand the simplest rudiments of
those principles which are the basis of true prosperity, and is not
only totally unfitted to rise out of his wretchedness, but is
actually attracting to himself a still deeper wretchedness by
dwelling in, and acting out, indolent, deceptive, and unmanly
thoughts., Here is a rich man who is the victim of a painful and persistent
disease as the result of gluttony., He is willing to give large sums
of money to get rid of it, but he will not sacrifice his gluttonous
desires., He wants to gratify his taste for rich and unnatural viands
and have his health as well., Such a man is totally unfit to have
health, because he has not yet learned the first principles of a
healthy life., Here is an employer of labour who adopts crooked measures to avoid
paying the regulation wage, and, in the hope of making larger
profits, reduces the wages of his workpeople., Such a man is
altogether unfitted for prosperity, and when he finds himself
bankrupt, both as regards reputation and riches, he blames
circumstances, not knowing that he is the sole author of his
condition., I have introduced these three cases merely as illustrative of the
truth that man is the causer (though nearly always is unconsciously)
of his circumstances, and that, whilst aiming at a good end, he is
continually frustrating its accomplishment by encouraging thoughts
and desires which cannot possibly harmonize with that end., Such
cases could be multiplied and varied almost indefinitely, but this
is not necessary, as the reader can, if he so resolves, trace the
action of the laws of thought in his own mind and life, and until
this is done, mere external facts cannot serve as a ground of
reasoning., Circumstances, however, are so complicated, thought is so deeply
rooted, and the conditions of happiness vary so, vastly with
individuals, that a man's entire soul-condition (although it may be
known to himself) cannot be judged by another from the external
aspect of his life alone., A man may be honest in certain directions,
yet suffer privations; a man may be dishonest in certain directions,
yet acquire wealth; but the conclusion usually formed that the one
man fails _because of his particular honesty,_ and that the other
_prospers because of his particular dishonesty,_ is the result of a
superficial judgment, which assumes that the dishonest man is almost
totally corrupt, and the honest man almost entirely virtuous., In the
light of a deeper knowledge and wider experience such judgment is
found to be erroneous., The dishonest man may have some admirable
virtues, which the other does, not possess; and the honest man
obnoxious vices which are absent in the other., The honest man reaps
the good results of his honest thoughts and acts; he also brings
upon himself the sufferings, which his vices produce., The dishonest
man likewise garners his own suffering and happiness., It is pleasing to human vanity to believe that one suffers because
of one's virtue; but not until a man has extirpated every sickly,
bitter, and impure thought from his mind, and washed every sinful
stain from his soul, can he be in a position to know and declare
that his sufferings are the result of his good, and not of his bad
qualities; and on the way to, yet long before he has reached, that
supreme perfection, he will have found, working in his mind and
life, the Great Law which is absolutely just, and which cannot,
therefore, give good for evil, evil for good., Possessed of such
knowledge, he will then know, looking back upon his past ignorance
and blindness, that his life is, and always was, justly ordered, and
that all his past experiences, good and bad, were the equitable
outworking of his evolving, yet unevolved self., Good thoughts and actions can never produce bad results; bad
thoughts and actions can never produce good results., This is but
saying that nothing can come from corn but corn, nothing from
nettles but nettles., Men understand this law in the natural world,
and work with it; but few understand it in the mental and moral
world (though its operation there is just as simple and
undeviating), and they, therefore, do not co-operate with it., Suffering is _always_ the effect of wrong thought in some direction., It is an indication that the individual is out of harmony with
himself, with the Law of his being., The sole and supreme use of
suffering is to purify, to burn out all that is useless and impure., Suffering ceases for him who is pure., There could be no object in
burning gold after the dross had been removed, and a perfectly pure
and enlightened being could not suffer., The circumstances, which a man encounters with suffering, are the
result of his own mental in harmony., The circumstances, which a man
encounters with blessedness, are the result of his own mental
harmony., Blessedness, not material possessions, is the measure of
right thought; wretchedness, not lack of material possessions, is
the measure of wrong thought., A man may be cursed and rich; he may
be blessed and poor., Blessedness and riches are only joined together
when the riches are rightly and wisely used; and the poor man only
descends into wretchedness when he regards his lot as a burden
unjustly imposed., Indigence and indulgence are the two extremes of wretchedness., They
are both equally unnatural and the result of mental disorder., A man
is not rightly conditioned until he is a happy, healthy, and
prosperous being; and happiness, health, and prosperity are the
result of a harmonious adjustment of the inner with the outer, of
the man with his surroundings., A man only begins to be a man when he ceases to whine and revile,
and commences to search for the hidden justice which regulates his
life., And as he adapts his mind to that regulating factor, he ceases
to accuse others as the cause of his condition, and builds himself
up in strong and noble thoughts; ceases to kick against
circumstances, but begins to _use_ them as aids to his more rapid
progress, and as a means of discovering the hidden powers and
possibilities within himself., Law, not confusion, is the dominating principle in the universe;
justice, not injustice, is the soul and substance of life; and
righteousness, not corruption, is the moulding and moving force in
the spiritual government of the world., This being so, man has but to
right himself to find that the universe is right; and during the
process of putting himself right he will find that as he alters his
thoughts towards things and other people, things and other people
will alter towards him., The proof of this truth is in every person, and it therefore admits
of easy investigation by systematic introspection and self-analysis., Let a man radically alter his thoughts, and he will be astonished at

would look diminutive in comparison.If the media points out Subway??, ?s bread no longer contains Azodicarbonamide, refer to Talking Point 3.3., Mr. Trump prefers to support local businesses.A salt-of-the-Earth man like Trump does not eat at huge corporations like Subway., He eats at the same places Joe Everyman eats., Use this opportunity to plug a local business, claim that Donald loves to eat there., (Note: Cheryl, PLEASE check that the restaurant you plug is not a chain., How have you not heard of Bertucci???s?), This is a more than sufficient reason to avoid Subway ???, it has

history of the Universe into a single year, starting with the Big Bang at an estimated 13.8 billion years ago set at January 1st at midnight, and ending with this very second as the final, tiniest increment of time on December 31st., Much of the cosmic year passes before we actually reach the formation of Earth and appearance of the oldest known rocks within the first cosmic week of September, or 4 billion years ago., In contrast, the earliest hominids (10-12 million years ago) did not appear until the early afternoon of December 31st., Domestication of fire (400,000 years ago) about 15 cosmic minutes ago, and all of modern civilization (within 500 years) is compressed within the last second.The Cosmic Calendar is a useful tool, because it is really, really difficult to comprehend what a billion years means., By looking at the calendar, we realize that from a chronological aspect, human civilization has been incredibly insignificant., Looking at it a different way, we see that we are here because a combination and sequence of physical, chemical, and biological changes has allowed for ???us???, to happen.Let??, ?s look at early Earth, about 3.5 billion years ago., The atmosphere consisted mainly of carbon dioxide (CO2), ammonia (NH3), and methane (CH4), with just a trace amount of oxygen., A Google Image search of the phrase ??, ?Early Earth???, shows artist renditions featuring plenty of volcanoes and lightning., This is no place for humans, much less plants, reptiles, fish, or the nuclear fallout-surviving cockroach.It is in this environment that the first biomolecules appeared., There are a few different theories as to what drove their formation (Lightning!, Heat?, meteorite impact??), but either way, the first, simple bacterial cells probably formed about this time.Now, one of the major themes in ecology is the ??, ?ecological niche,???, which is defined as a specific, specialized role that an organism has in its habitat., No two species can occupy the same niche; one will almost always outcompete the other.As early Earth had abundant carbon dioxide, a life form appeared to occupy this niche, taking the abundant CO2 out of the air, and converting it to sugar and free oxygen.Sound familiar?, This is photosynthesis.These life forms, called cyanobacteria, or photosynthetic bacteria, were literal catalysts for atmospheric and oceanic change on Earth.1 The abundant amount of sunlight and carbon dioxide allowed for a massive increase and diversification of cyanobacteria, continuously taking up CO2, releasing oxygen, and being buried in sediment., At first, this increase in free oxygen had little effect on the composition of the atmosphere, due to the presence of compounds that can take up oxygen (oxygen sinks) such as hydrogen sulfide, or iron (converted to iron oxide)., After about 1.5 billion years, these sinks began to fill up, resulting in the increasing accumulation of free oxygen in the atmosphere.2This massive change in the composition of the atmosphere is known as the Great Oxygenation Event., It has also been called the Oxygen Catastrophe, Oxygen Crisis, even Oxygen Holocaust.If these names sound a bit dramatic, it??, ?s because it was an extremely dramatic event., As humans, we see the Oxygenation Event as a positive thing, as it made possible the development of higher plants and animals., However, oxygen was highly toxic to the abundant anaerobic bacteria living at this time, causing a massive die-off and retreat to oxygen-poor environments.There was another consequence of the ???rapid???, (remember, we are still on the scale of millions of years) and overwhelming change of the composition of Earth??, ?s atmosphere., It is well-known that CO2 and methane traps sunlight in the atmosphere to maintain a warm temperature, much like a greenhouse., Removal of carbon dioxide and oxidation of methane from the atmosphere took away the greenhouse effect, which resulted in a massive drop in temperature around 2.3 billion years ago, ushering in a complete snowball Earth-type ice age that lasted for several million years.Whoops., The exact dates and duration of these events is disputed,2 for example, opinions differ on the rates and oxygen concentrations, the major driving forces that resulted in the saturation of oxygen sinks, and the number of Snowball Earth events that occurred.There are a few takeaways here.1)	We commonly hear the phrase ??, ?Greenhouse Effect???, in a negative connotation., We do need some greenhouse gases to trap enough heat in the atmosphere so that Earth does not freeze over., But, please note that by the time humans came around, we likely had a sufficient greenhouse effect for our survival, so please do not use this as an argument for burning more fossil fuels.2)	The molecules that make up terrafirma, the ocean, and atmosphere are continuously interacting and reacting with one another., The fact that a buildup of free oxygen in the atmosphere caused a domino effect that resulted in Earth being a snowball for millions of years has suggested that we not underestimate the effect of even a small change in atmospheric composition., No matter what your elected officials tell you, CO2 is not just a ??, ?harmless plant food.??, ?33)	If we look at the current state of affairs,  we are literally reversing the Great Oxygenation Event., By burning fossil fuels, we are taking carbon from the ground, and releasing massive amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere., While some greenhouse effect is necessary, too much is what is causing the rising global temperatures that are wreaking havoc on our polar ice caps, and this leads to many, many things which threaten our livelihoods.I still maintain that the rise of cyanobacteria and the resulting changes that occurred were a good thing, since the most recent result was the development of human civilization., On the other hand, the Great Oxygenation Event did cause a mass extinction, killing off multitudes of critters that could not tolerate oxygen.Mass extinctions are a common, regular occurrence throughout Earth??, ?s history., The GOE was probably the earliest known mass extinction., There was a particularly devastating extinction at the end of the Permian Era (252 million years ago), which was also called the Great Dying., By the start of the subsequent Triassic period, about 96% of sea critters had died out, along with 70% of terrestrial critters.4 Probably the most famous mass extinction occurred at the Triassic-Jurassic period, which we know as that time in which all the dinosaurs died.We are currently in another mass extinction, which is being called the Holocene., There is overwhelming evidence that it is human-made, although for some reason politicians want to argue over that.A rather Circle-of-Life way of looking at Earth is the Gaia Hypothesis, which states that Earth is comprised of synergistic, self-regulating components that work as a whole to maintain life on the planet., It??, ?s a pretty neat way of looking at things., Simply put, all of the organisms, whether it be plants, animals, microbes, and fungi require the action of each other for the maintenance of optimal conditions.Along these lines, there is a second hypothesis that takes into account all of these mass extinctions, called the Medea Hypothesis., Medea was a figure in Greek mythology who killed her own children to get back at her unfaithful husband., I??, ?m not quite sure who is the unfaithful husband in this scenario, but the hypothesis states that Earth will every so often rid itself of higher forms of life, and return to a state where only single-celled organisms exist.5That brings us to our final takeaway:4)	 By figuring out what has happened in Earth??, ?s history, particularly what has shaped the planet for colonization by humans, we can develop strategies to either maintain control of these optimal ???Earth???, conditions, or use this knowledge to Terraform (make Earth-like) other planets., We will need this knowledge if in case we do end up mucking up Earth for human survival, or, that one day about 5 billion years down the road in which the sun will burn out, swell up, and engulf Mercury, Venus, and Earth., Mars will probably get away, the lucky bastard.On a last note, the answer to removal of excess CO2 and methane is not to introduce massive quantities of cyanobacteria into the environment., Cyanobacteria are quite toxic, and tend to spoil important ecosystems., 6 Don??, ?t do that.- -1  Water: The

work for the Family WhatsApp Group: Written records of their workday, detailed accounts as to the wellbeing of their romantic partners and/or pets, and congratulatory messages regarding a particularly unflattering photo of a risotto prepared by a family member.Both parties must agree to the following terms and conditions:1., Digital Natives shall agree to check the WhatsApp group once every 2-3 business days, and their responses to questions from Parents will be longer than ???yep,???, ???nah,???, and thumbs up emoji.2., Parents withdraw their right to contact Digital Natives on other social media platforms once this WhatsApp group has been established., All photos of shirts on sale at Barneys that they would previously tweet at Digital Natives will instead be delivered to this Family WhatsApp group., If this clause is violated, Digital Natives have the right to sue for damages to social media presence.3., Digital Natives agree that they will not take screenshots of the Family WhatsApp group for use in any Buzzfeed list about Funny Text Messages Parents Send Their Kids., Failure to comply will grant Parents the right to recount in painful detail a true moment of weakness they have observed in the Digital Native, to a social media platform of their choice.4., All communication within the Family WhatsApp group must take place only between the hours of 11 AM and 10 PM., Parents acknowledge that attempting to make contact with Digital Natives before 11 a.m. is unreasonable, as Digital Natives are still in bed attempting that bed yoga routine they just found on YouTube., Similarly, Digital Natives acknowledge that if a Parent??, ?s mobile phone goes off after 10:00 p.m., they have no choice but to assume that one of the Digital Natives has been kidnapped by a drug cartel.4a., The only exception to these time restrictions are messages sent from Digital Natives to Parents that include a list of random physical symptoms and a close-up photo of the back of the Digital Natives mouth, so Parents can confirm to Digital Natives that they do not appear to have a terminal illness., In exchange for this act of generosity, Digital Natives agree to respect and tolerate the videos and memes Parents proudly share with Digital Natives, and will not mention that they saw the goat yelling like a man video six years ago.5., Digital Natives understand that it is not appropriate to outsource their messages to the Family Whatsapp Group to a writer on Freelancer.com??, ?even if that writer??, ?s CV does say they ??, ?excel at giving writing a personal touch.???, Parents accept that after the 2013 Siri Racial Slur Incident, they will not use speech-to-text for any correspondence in the Family Whatsapp Group.6., Parents are restricted to sending one job advertisement per week to Digital Natives., Parents acknowledge that receiving these job ads can be hurtful for Digital natives, as if they were to apply for them, they would be compromising on their creativity.7., Digital Natives are restricted to requesting one Facebook like/share per week from a member of the Family Whatsapp Group for their confessional first-person essay about the pressures of growing up in an overbearing family.8., Even though WhatsApp uses end-to-end encryption that ensures no third-party can ever possibly decipher the data transferred, Digital Natives understand that Parents still don??, ?t think it??, ?s safe to discuss the exact location of the spare key for the back door.9., No GIFs.Finally, it is mutually agreed upon signing this contract that within 14 business days Parents and Digital Natives will have multiple bottles of wine at dinner and decide that the Family WhatsApp group should be shut down in favor of the usual weekly 10-15 minute Sunday

6, 7, 8, 10Regina George: 2, 5, 9An email blast goes out from the director of composition to all the adjuncts, graduate students, and temporary-contract full-time instructors who teach writing at a large state university., The director of composition is chipper about a professional development opportunity at a neighboring institution and he??, ?ll reserve space for any of the teacher-persons who want to go, the fee paid by the English Department., The invitation is for a workshop with a nationally recognized composition scholar, and the teachers can carpool., For teachers, professional development means a day without teaching, but a day spent talking about teaching, and this is a welcome and often productive change., Almost as an afterthought, the director of composition ends the email by saying anyone who would like to attend the workshop who teaches on that day should arrange for a substitute to teach their classes.If you??, ?ve never heard of substitute teachers for college classes, that??, ?s because they don??, ?t exist., A substitute is a teacher-person who goes from school to school, and from class to class, to sit in when the regular teacher has taken a day off., Since the students who attend high school, middle school, or elementary school are required by law to sit in those classrooms, the job of the substitute is to watch the kids, end of story., The teacher calls their principal and says they won??, ?t be coming in that day and the principal goes down the list until someone agrees to substitute., It??, ?s never been the teacher??, ?s responsibility.Professional development is important for teachers: professors go to conferences to stay relevant and to make contacts., It used to be that the university would pay for this, and that??, ?s still mostly true, though it??, ?s almost never the case for the kinds of teacher-persons who received the director of composition??, ?s email., The director of composition recognized that these were teacher-persons who needed professional development for different reasons., The adjuncts, the graduate students, and the temporary-contract full-time instructors were all in the same boat, valued for their semi-pro status, and the director of composition would escort them to the nationally recognized scholar like Scouts on their first camping trip., No one believes that the workshop attendees will ever achieve the heights of the national scholar, no matter what their potential, and in the meantime, they??, ?re still expected to adhere to university policy and to be sure the classes are being taught.The director of composition should have known more than anyone that it would be next to impossible for composition teachers to get substitutes for their classes, due to the number of them attending the workshop and the number of classes those teachers regularly taught., You see, there??, ?s no substitute pool for them to draw from, so they have to ask unpaid favors of each other, because they certainly can??, ?t ask the tenured professors, who have minimal contact with contingent faculty as they come and go from year to year., Despite the good intentions of the director of composition, the contingent teachers have been reminded that they can??, ?t pretend to claim the perks taken for granted by tenured professors and also do their jobs effectively.What college students buy with tuition dollars has changed, with a shift in the direction of the utility model of the public high school, with bodies in seats, and mandatory attendance., As a full-time teacher-person at a state university, I??, ?m asked to report on attendance, I have a required number of hours I??, ?m supposed to sit in the office I share with another professor who also has a required number of hours to spend there, and I??, ?m supposed to get a substitute if I know ahead of time that I??, ?m going to miss a class., I happen to believe, because I??, ?m an idealist, that students pay for an education, which is an abstract unquantifiable commodity., Meanwhile, administrators see tangibles that can be represented with numbers on spreadsheets: the number of students per department, the number of seats per class, the number of classes per semester., Whatever else we might say about student-persons, they are undoubtedly numbers, and they pay in dollars that can be divided, so that a class period that has been paid for must occur.When a student tells me they want to be a teacher I suggest they try substitute teaching., It doesn??, ?t cost anything, one doesn??, ?t need a license, and there??, ?s no prep., They only work the days they want to work and if they are even semi-competent, the schools will keep calling them back., For my own part, I had good experiences as a substitute teacher., It let me know that I was able to go into a classroom where I was greeted with extremely low expectations, yet I could trick the students into learning despite themselves., Anyone who thinks they want to teach will get a pretty quick sense of whether they still want to teach after they??, ?ve tried substituting.As sensible as this sounds, this suggestion, that a student should try substituting is almost always greeted by the student with disdain., We tend to think of ourselves as better than substitutes, even those with no teaching experience., And so asking someone to be a substitute for a college class only works if that teacher is already in a position that comes with a degree of disrespect., By comparison, instead of asking ??, ?Will you be the substitute for my classes????, a contingent teacher might try out some of these equivalent phrases on their colleagues: ??, ?Will you babysit my child?, Will you be a server at my wedding?, Will you pick up my mom from the airport????, The only reason I need a substitute for my classes is because the director of composition told me I did, and the only reason the director of composition told me I did was because the university administration, a.k.a., the numbers people, told the director that I did.I??, ?m in a position that comes with disrespect, though my students don??, ?t really know it, because whether I go to a workshop for faculty development or not, I??, ?m a professional., Sometimes, the students who turn their noses up at the suggestion that they try substitute teaching will say, ??, ?I don??, ?t want to teach high school., I want to do what you do., I want to teach college.??, ?I tell them that if they teach in the public secondary or elementary schools they??, ?ll have better job security and will likely be paid more., They might have to deal with student discipline or with standardized tests, but maybe that??, ?s not such a big deal., Maybe it just is., It??, ?s teaching after all., It??, ?s a calling.Blind faith in the capitalist meritocracy makes it surprising for a student to hear that a professor with a Ph.D. can make less than a teacher with a bachelor??, ?s degree, someone they might think of as more like a smart mom than a scholar., But at the end of the school year that teacher won??, ?t be let go simply because her contract has run out., She??, ?ll almost automatically be kept on the payroll, and she??, ?ll be given a raise., At public secondary or elementary schools it??, ?s easier to keep someone around than to do a new job search, so even without tenure there??, ?s almost always job security., At institutions of higher education, however, they pretty much always run job searches, even when they have someone they want to keep around., A professor on a temporary contract might be asked to reapply for the job they already have, or their renewable contract could be replaced with one that is nonrenewable, because the rules can change without warning.I cancel class to attend the workshop for faculty development, I make no attempt to get a substitute, and no one complains., I get to the workshop early and the director of composition sits at the table with me., By the end of the day, I think the director of composition has a better idea of me as a teacher than the impression I give shuffling through the halls exhausted between classes., It??, ?s a small triumph, since my contract will run out and a younger less-experienced teacher-person will soon take my place, very likely someone who won??, ?t question the absurdity of being asked to find a substitute for a college class.Numbers people are numbers people., They??, ?re going to do what they??, ?re paid to do., They don??, ?t sit in classrooms and most have never taught., ...]",100

But I screwed up the courage to ask for the brass ???Caius???, tag as a souvenir, fully aware that it was the height of American obnoxiousness but also knowing my life would be better in the days and

342,"[?s a lot of students, and a lot of classes, and a lot of papers, and, ironically, while Scribis mundani don??, ?t mind that work, since it comes with the territory, they also tend not to be the ones to do it, since there aren??, ?t enough Scribis mundani to go around, because they are usually hired into administrative positions where they are put in charge of the English teachers who do teach all of those composition students, almost universally the contingent faculty, hired on short-term contracts, as well as the graduate students with teaching assignments, the graduate school??, ?s version of the athletic scholarship., These ???temporary???, teachers can come from any of the three English teacher types, it doesn??, ?t matter, though the hierarchy persists in who gets hired out of these labor-intensive paper-grading coal mines into full-time tenure-track or ???permanent???, positions., Although most of the power is consolidated among the scholar-types, Scribis mundani do quite well for being the newest field with the smallest number of representatives, because they are put in charge of the army of contingent teachers, which can be anywhere from 1/3 to 2/3s of the English instructors in a department., Composition Ph.Ds., further heighten their stature in the broader field of English by claiming minor twentieth-century philosophers and theorists as their own, just as that philosopher has peaked in scholarly attention, especially those who had no interest or awareness of English composition as a field of study when they were alive., As these things go, a famous thinker will become all the rage, inspiring change in writing classrooms populated by nineteen-year-olds all over America, and the same papers (sometimes literally; thank you, plagiarism!), about the same tired subjects, will be graded by the rotating ranks of underpaid disrespected contingent faculty with the current popular philosopher in mind, to shift again five years later, when there??, ?s a new pedagogical trend (there??, ?s that word and they love it!, ).Scribis mundani often start out as Libris scholares, passionate about literature, but then when they find themselves in the classroom they encounter a new love, and they also figure out that it??, ?s easier to get a job as a Scribis mundanus, where scholarship may not even matter, since an administrator who can train, schedule, and speak for all of the underpaid temporary faculty is indeed valued and compensated., Ironically, these teacher-types, Scribis mundani, who love the classroom so much they actually study it and write about it, have fewer classes as a direct result of their administrative work, with enough course releases to get them down to one or two classes per semester., Life as a tenured English composition professor often includes: leadership in the department, a demonstrated love of teaching, and a light course load without much expectation for scholarship., It??, ?s also a field that??, ?s pretty wide open for new subjects ???, so one can see the attraction., Unfortunately, Scribis mundani may learn they either don??, ?t like or aren??, ?t suited for administrative work, except that they??, ?re stuck in it., Scribis mundani believe that literature has no utility, and they have tried to shift the focus of English studies to something more practical (pedagogy!, ), if only in the short term, if only for the self-perpetuating activity of teaching teachers about teaching.The last type of English professor, the artist-type, or Scribis artifex???, Oh boy, where to begin?, In our society you can??, ?t go around calling yourself an artist unless free market capitalism has made you rich enough to make your art your full-time job, such that there are little objects being consumed, either physical or digital, with your name on them., Those who teach prose-writing or poetry-writing at universities, as poets and/or fiction or nonfiction writers, can sometimes achieve financial security, not as a result of the popularity of their art, but by their integrity as artists, by which they might land a sweet (but very rare) tenure-track job., In order to find oneself on the tenure-track as Scribis artifex, however, one must have nearly achieved that nearly impossible pinnacle, self-sufficient artist, or to be born or married into financial independence, or to have married into the English department by partnering with another English professor with a tenure-track job.There are a lot of Scribis artifegum out there, and the work is fulfilling, since their writing is read outside of universities and the literature they are most likely to teach is contemporary., Scribis artifegum are very good writers and editors who may volunteer their time at literary journals or in writer??, ?s communities, but most often Scribis artifegum will be hired into low-paying ???temporary???, positions to be told how to teach by Scribis mundani, to be looked down upon by Libris scholares, and to grade all of those papers produced by the nineteen-year-olds forced to take English composition., One can eek out an existence in this way for quite some time, by moving from college to college, and from city to city, by agreeing to teach on short-term contracts while working on their poems, novels, stories, essays, plays, and screenplays., And Scribis artifex may very well publish such endeavors, but let??, ?s face it, no one really cares about art that hasn??, ?t been heavily marketed, or at least the majority of art consumers don???t., So the artist-types study very hard, sometimes publish very well, mostly while grading the papers of nineteen-year-olds as Libris scholares are paid two-times or three-times their salary for less work, and less vital work, as Scribis mundani continue to ???train???, Scribis artifegum, observe them, and select the eighty-dollar composition textbooks that the students will be required to buy and will later complain about on teacher evaluations.But it??, ?s a good life., It comes with summers off., And Scribis artifex can feel a kinship with the buggy protagonist of Kafka??, ?s most famous story while circling faculty parking lots in search of the rare open space and maybe, or maybe not, being awarded health insurance., You didn??, ?t think literary art should come easily, did you?, Scribis artifex believes in literature and so looks at everything else as failing to reach that high mark, including and sometimes especially English department colleagues., 5th wall: Address the director??, ?s concerns about

encounter the N-word., As a teacher there is no situation, no matter how well prefaced, that the N-word can be uttered in its full naked un-sanitized glory., As comedian Louis C.K., has noted (Google it because I won??, ?t even link to someone saying this word), when one party says ???N-word,???, it puts the real word in the other party??, ?s head, leading to the punch line: ??, ?You made me say it!???, There??, ?s no kind way of dancing around our violent disgusting history with respect to race, but in order to talk about it, as we should, we??, ?re left with ???N-word.???, To take some discomfort out of the air, consider the following: ??, ?Since this is a literature class, and since we??, ?re reading some of these passages out loud for discussion, we may encounter the occasional unexpected N-word., Please skip over it, or say ???N-word,???, or fucking anything but the actual word., I??, ?ll say ???fuck???, at the drop of a hat, but that other one?, Not gonna say it., Not

have to be ???on,???, even when class hasn??, ?t officially started., As students filter in, chitchat will ensue., Someone will tell a story about a car accident., Another will up the ante by telling a story about being carjacked., There will be outrageous stories about what a friend on the high plateau of drunkenness achieved without conscious effort., All this before class: tragic tales of human avarice, human error, human achievement., And then, since everyone is listening while each student holds court, and it??, ?s time to go ahead and start the class, the teacher might begin, ???I??, ?m going to go ahead and jump in here, and pardon my French, I??, ?m assuming you??, ?ve all watched late night cable TV or rented an R-rated flick from the Redbox, and so you??, ?ve heard the word

the F-bomb every morning until the end of the semester, it may be best to keep that fucker in the can., If you enjoy the carnivalesque chaos of education in revolt, however, then write the F-bomb into

the End of a Piecemeal Career in TeachingOn the last class day at the end of a temporary teaching contract ???, jobs many of us have wandered into because more permanent teaching jobs have gotten harder to come by, thanks to the takeover of universities by managers and bean counters ???, it might feel good to drop an F-bomb or two while explaining to the students that their fine teacher, like many thousands, is about to sail off the precipice of the teaching profession into a free fall of unemployment for the unforeseeable future, out of no fault of his own, but because someone in an expensive suit with a large corner office decided that at least one third of the teachers at this university, the same as any given university, should be temporary, and in this case, nonrenewable., So

348,"[Research shows that guns distort our ability to assess risk., When you hold a gun, you??, ?re more likely to believe that people around you are also holding guns, and you??, ?re subsequently more likely to react as if threatened ???, for example, by taking aim with your own gun., And psychologists have known for almost fifty years that the mere presence of a weapon makes people more aggressive., As I??, ?ve said before, a weapon may make you more dangerous, but it doesn??, ?t make you any smarter., Guns, in fact, make you stupider.Perhaps that??, ?s why so many gun owners who imitate the girl in the Glock ad end up shooting their wives, teammates, daughters, grandsons, and daughters by mistake.Putting your trust in a weapon also impedes your awareness of other, more effective and less risky actions that are within your power., It never seems to occur to the young woman in the Glock ad to call 911, although she can see a suspicious vehicle parked outside, and knows someone is lurking around her front door, where he could easily be spotted from the street by a cop., She doesn??, ?t call anyone else, either; perhaps she doesn??, ?t have any friends, or a phone., She doesn??, ?t even have a deadbolt on her front door, for heaven??, ?s sake., All she has is the gun., That, apparently, is a perfectly good substitute for rational thinking, according to Glock., Who needs a sound mind and a range of options when you have 16 bullets?And who needs love, either?, Or empathy, or tolerance?, Those are all things that will get you killed, because according to the gun lobby there are a lot of bad guys out there., The bad guy is a staple of firearms marketing ???, indeed, the entire ad campaign of any non-hunting or -sporting gun evaporates unless you assume his existence and proximity.Compared to the stalker in the Glock ad, this promotional video from Smith & Wesson (manufacturer of the semiautomatic rifle used in the Aurora, Colorado theatre shooting, gives us very little information about the people who are presumably about to be shot down., We see camouflage-clad men pointing rifles in a swamp., We see police officers pointing their guns across the hood of their car., We see a husband pull a gun from a nightstand while his wife cowers in the bed., We don??, ?t know who is about to die, but the assumption is that they deserve it., If you don??, ?t accept that premise, most gun ads are simply footage of people preparing to commit murder.By encouraging the belief that there are many circumstances under which it??, ?s acceptable for the average person to point a loaded weapon at a living human being, gun makers and seller are preaching the opposite of love: they??, ?re teaching unreasoning hatred., The premise of ads like Glock??, ?s and Smith & Wesson??, ?s is that guns are necessary tools because there are people out there who aren??, ?t merely bad, but who deserve summary execution., Lots of them, and we are all at risk of encountering them in our daily lives.It takes a special breed of salesman to traffic in that kind of ethical brainwashing ???, people like NRA Vice President Wayne LaPierre, who makes $985,000 per year to say things like ???Riots., Terrorists., Gangs., Lone criminals., These are perils we are sure to face ???, not just maybe,???, and ??, ?there is no greater freedom than the right to survive and protect our families with all the rifles, shotguns, and handguns we want.???, LaPierre personifies the American firearms trade: white, male, insulated from risk by his status and wealth, he is also increasingly angry, paranoid, and irrational ???, in public, in the course of doing his job, as an official mouthpiece of the industry., Sometimes I wonder what happened to LaPierre, what trauma he suffered to make him so angry that he feels justified using the deaths of twenty kindergartners to advocate for more gun sales., Then I recall the research showing that the mere presence of guns make us more aggressive, more paranoid., And I think LaPierre may simply be a victim of his own salesmanship.He is no exception; LaPierre??, ?s mindset is the norm among gun promoters., Of all the businesses that make up Fear, Inc., ???, all the companies touting goods and services to quell our fears ???, the firearms industry is the only one that seems to believe its own bullshit., It has created a myth of ceaseless, directionless terror, and swallowed it whole., The gun lobby is afraid of facts, laws, moms, and fast-food outlets., It has, quite publicly and deliberately, as a matter of policy, rejected compassion and reason.This sociopathic approach to marketing earns gun and ammunition manufacturers $16 billion a year., What has it gotten the rest of us?, American taxpayers pony up $12.8 million every day to cover damage done by gun violence ???, medical and legal costs, prison funding, mental health care, and more., Guns kill about 30,000 of us each year and send another 80,000 or so to the emergency room., Since 1968, firearms have killed more Americans than all the wars in our nation??, ?s history.We??, ?re not buying their guns or their arguments, yet somehow, we??, ?re still paying., 1., America??, ?s heartland2., West of Manhattan3., Farm-y4., Dairy country5., Cattle country6., White people country7., A place with an inexplicable tradition of carving celebrity busts out of butter8., Where millennials leave to move to Manhattan9., Where 40-somethings return to after moving to Manhattan, having children and realizing their parents won??, ?t hand over apartment down payments10., Where dreams die11., Nice12., FlatHey., Hey pal., Yeah ???, you., The guy with the suffix., What??, ?s your name, pal?, Septuagenarian?, Jesus ???, that??, ?s a mouthful, huh?, What is that?, Some kind of Greek or something?, That??, ?s cool ???, I got no problem with the Greeks., They tend to get a little loosey-goosey with their present progressives, but you know what?, I like that., ...]",100

then it gave the phone number for a hotline for runaway kids., (Cell phones didn??, ?t yet exist and pay phones were still common, so the quarter was to make the phone call., )As it happened, the

353,"[?Hey, this gender thing doesn??, ?t seem fair., How come they get to vote, own property, and go to college and we don???t???, ?No, Mary Wollstonecraft was not the first feminist., That??, ?s like saying she was the first woman; it??, ?s just not possible or rational, and negates the thoughts and opinions of many who came before her.It??, ?s slightly more accurate to say that Mary Wollstonecraft was the first modern feminist., I don??, ?t know that I??, ?m always entirely clear about what that means, either, except that putting the word ???modern???, in there helps us see that her brand of feminism (though they hadn??, ?t yet coined the term when she lived) is recognizable to us today.Not only recognizable, but almost eerily similar., Wollstonecraft was an essayist, novelist, and translator; her best-known work is A Vindication of the Rights of Woman, in which she attributes gender disparities in part ??, ?to a false system of education, gathered from the books written on this subject by men who, considering females rather as women than human creatures, have been more anxious to make them alluring mistresses than affectionate wives and rational mothers; and the understanding of the sex has been so [cheated] by this???, that the civilized women of the present century, with a few exceptions, are only anxious to inspire love, when they ought to cherish ambition, and by their abilities and virtues exact respect.??, ?And if you think that??, ?s not still true, you haven??, ?t watched enough reality TV., I have yet to see an episode of The Bachelor in which the group dates are about which woman is the best reader or most respected mathematician.Isn??, ?t it frustrating to see that we are STILL working on issues that Wollstonecraft wrote about so eloquently over 200 years ago?This is just one reason Mary Wollstonecraft should be pretty pissed off.Wollstonecraft??, ?s ideas lurked in shadows for a long time because after she died her husband tried to do a nice thing., Damn him, anyway.A Vindication of the Rights of Woman was controversial but overall quite well-received., After Wollstonecraft died, her husband, William Godwin, wrote Memoirs of the Author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman., It was a sweet gesture, wanting her to be immortalized that way, but in the book Godwin revealed what few had known, namely that Wollstonecraft had never married the father of her first daughter, Fanny, and had only reluctantly married Godwin after becoming pregnant with her second daughter, Mary.So, Wollstonecraft has another reason to be pretty pissed off: Details about her personal life soiled her reputation to the point of nearly derailing the feminist movement for a time., (This is not to discount other feminist voices, only to emphasize that Wollstonecraft was perhaps the loudest and best-known, therefore any backlash against her would certainly make others shy away from making similar arguments, lest their own personal lives be trotted out for everyone to judge., )If you??, ?re wondering, William Godwin??, ?s considerable reputation as a thinker and writer suffered only minimally for revelations that his child with Wollstonecraft was conceived out of wedlock, to which Wollstonecraft would surely exclaim, ???Yes!, My point exactly!, This is what I??, ?ve been writing about in all of my work!, A double standard exists that is destructive and dangerous to both men and women!??, ?I doubt that she would have used that many exclamation points, but I got excited and editorialized it for her.The final reason (well, the last one I have time to mention here) for Wollstonecraft to be pretty pissed off is also the final irony of her life., When Wollstonecraft gave birth to her second daughter, she was assisted by a female midwife., All was well, except that Wollstonecraft did not deliver the placenta., Because of new (for the time) standards for medical practice dictating that doctors should have specific types of degrees, and because women were excluded from higher education, the number of female midwives dropped as the number of college-educated male doctors rose., Combine this fact with a lack of knowledge about germs and Wollstonecraft ends up with a male doctor at her bedside who uses his unwashed hands to try to remove the placenta, and days later Wollstonecraft dies of infection.Cruel irony, to be sure., But Mary Wollstonecraft has the last laugh, because the very daughter she died giving birth to would go on to become Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin Shelley, author of Frankenstein and fierce feminist in her own right., With thanks to Daniele Dickerson and Sean Pessin- -The game is quite simple., Each participant, starting with the youngest, names a novel published

chances are Woolf was smarter)., And now she??, ?s pissed.This should not, however, intimidate us lowly souls and keep us from reading Woolf., Famous for her stream-of-consciousness style of writing, Woolf brings us into her thoughts when she writes, and we feel connected to her., If you??, ?re only willing to let yourself be absorbed by her words, she will envelop you and guide you.But she will also kick your ass.Let??, ?s be honest; if you??, ?ve read Virginia Woolf??, ?s writing, you??, ?ve probably gotten the sense (as I have) that she was a bit pissed off during her lifetime., She hid it well most of the time, under a proper English Victorian-on-her-way-to-being-Modern veneer., But she was awfully ticked, I think, that the generation before her still had what she felt were old-fashioned expectations, that society was making such slow progress toward equality for women, that there was such trauma in her personal life as well as the world at large, and more.Virginia Woolf, were she still alive, or somehow able to see and hear our world today, would be pissed that talk of her death so often precedes (and sometimes eclipses) talk of her work and her life.In her February 17, 1922 diary, Woolf writes, ??, ?I meant to write about death, only life came breaking in as usual.???, The opposite happens when people today talk about Woolf, as though they mean to talk about life, only death comes breaking in.Yes, she killed herself in 1941, when she was 59 years old., She filled her pockets with stones and walked into the river., It??, ?s tragic, and by no means do I intend to brush it off as insignificant, but it??, ?s not the only compelling thing about her.Adeline Virginia Stephen Woolf was born in 1882 to well-known and highly intellectual parents with a blended family., Woolf suffered greatly when she was 13 years old and her mother died; two years later her half-sister died, and seven years after that her father died., Woolf suffered ???breakdowns???, throughout her life, and was diagnosed with manic-depressive, bipolar affective disorder, and bipolar disorder, depending on who you ask and which generation they are a part of.Woolf married Leonard Woolf in 1912, and had an affair with Vita Sackville-West in 1922., The book Orlando is usually read as a love letter to Vita.Woolf wrote nine novels, six short story collections, three biographies, fourteen nonfiction books, seven autobiographies, one drama, one translation, and many prefaces, letters, and diaries., All of this while not only surviving two world wars, but being in great distress during World War II, after the Woolfs???, London home was destroyed in the Blitz and there was considerable danger for Leonard, who was Jewish.Cheery, no?, We needn??, ?t wonder why she may have been pissed off while alive.I think our focus on Woolf??, ?s death occurs because we??, ?re uncomfortable with her uncertainty or her ambiguity, or the way she draws out our own uncertainties and ambiguities., We can??, ?t categorize her, even though at first glance there are many categories for her: Modernist, feminist, Bloomsbury, writer, suicide, bisexual, and more., But just dip a finger below the surface and you??, ?re beset with contradictions.In our time as our understanding of things like sexuality and gender, age, what constitutes news, our understanding of media and its reputability (or lack thereof), becomes more fluid, both more and less complicated, and our definition of humanity broadens and deepens, we owe it to ourselves to read and appreciate Virginia Woolf., She was 100 years ahead of us in her ideas and experimentation., We should be running to catch up instead of letting her pass by while we chatter on about her death.If this sounds like a giant advertisement for Woolf, well, good., If I made a kerbillion dollars (which I??, ?m sure is coming any day now, since most teachers and writers live the high life), I??, ?d have purchased a 30-second slot during the Super Bowl to say READ VIRGINIA WOOLF., SHE WAS PISSED THEN AND SHE??, ?S PISSED NOW BECAUSE IT IS TAKING FOREVER FOR US TO CATCH UP TO HER., Oh, and STOP FOCUSING FIRST AND ONLY ON HER DEATH.Yes, it??, ?d be in all caps because it??, ?s a proclamation that deserves to be shouted.As connected as I feel to Woolf when I read her work, few things terrify me more than the idea of actually speaking with her., I??, ?m sure I??, ?d be in such awe that I wouldn??, ?t be able to form a complete sentence., Still, when the ??, ?Who, living or dead, would you have a beer with if you could???, question becomes reality (as I know it will), I might still dare to choose Virginia Woolf, for the pleasure of listening to her kick my ass., My fellow Americans, as I have crisscrossed this country, one thing has become clear., When it comes to religion, we are a nation of true believers., But there are so many faiths, and as a candidate, picking the wrong one might be the difference between you trusting me with your vote, and choosing one of my opponents., And that is why I stand before you today as the only candidate with the conviction to say what is in my heart, what is deep in the core of my being: that it is YOUR faith that informs everything I say or do.I know what you are thinking., I have that wrong., It should be MY faith informs everything I say or do., But I did not misspeak., Rather than do the arrogant thing as my opponents do and tell you my beliefs, I will wait for you to tell me what you believe, then magically believe it as well., ...]",100

California with his parents and sister in the late nineties., In 2009, he graduated from the University of California-San Diego where he studied literature and writing., Castillo helped organize ??, ?Lectric Collective, an art and poetry collaboration in the Bay Area, and he was a founding editor of Vertebrae., He has lived in Oceanside, La Jolla, Oakland, San Francisco, and Iowa City, where he received an MFA in poetry from the University of Iowa.Castillo recently spoke over email with McSweeney??, ?s editors Dominic Luxford and Jesse Nathan about his first book, Remains, the tenth collection in the McSweeney??, ?s Poetry Series.- - -McSWEENEY??, ?S: Who are you writing for?JES?, ?S CASTILLO: I guess I imagine I??, ?m writing for someone like myself: someone who needs solitude from time to time to stay sane., Who lives in the fragmented flux of the post-industrial, computerized world, and takes comfort and nourishment from books.McSWEENEY??, ?S: How did the form for Remains develop?CASTILLO: When I was twenty-three, I read Ron Silliman for the first time, and that??, ?s also when I read Ben Lerner??, ?s elegant and instructive Mean Free Path., The way Silliman and Lerner used the book (each in distinct ways) as the measure for structuring a poem was really exciting to me, and it made me want to write a book-length poem., I was excited by the idea of finding a form that could sustain its momentum for a long time and contain potentially any subject., The serial structure seemed ideal, a long poem that advanced via self-sustaining sections that complemented each other.I came about the poem??, ?s actual form, which is fairly simple, sort of by chance., I guess the interesting part is that I wrote the poem on index cards., For the two years that I spent writing it, I carried a stack of twenty or so index cards wherever I went, and whenever I saw, read, or experienced something that made me think of a line, I would take out a card and fill it out, usually in one go, writing intuitively without stopping until the card was filled., Each card constituted a section., Writing on index cards meant I could carry my materials easily wherever I went., I wrote plenty of sections sitting at a desk or a table, but I also wrote many in transit, at parties, on walks, and so on., With the index cards taking care of the poem??, ?s formal unity, I was free to just focus on filling them out., And because the cards weren??, ?t bound, I could more easily think of each as its own separate entity or field, its own small world., And so I felt free to experiment within each one, to try out different modes of voice and formal tricks, trusting they were all part of the same poem, the same book.I came across Jack Spicer??, ?s lectures when I was about half way through writing Remains., I like his description of the serial poem as a poem that could virtually go on forever, or until the poet dies or gets sick of writing the poem., I think another thing that ends a potentially endless poem is when the feeling that engendered the poem ends or changes, in other words when the poet??, ?s worldview changes significantly from the one he had when he started the poem., Then it is no longer the same poem., I think that??, ?s more or less what happened with Remains., Had I stayed the same person, retained the way of seeing the world that I had when I started writing the poem, I might??, ?ve kept going with it, but that didn??, ?t happen., Maybe there is a way to build into a long poem the ability to evolve, so it can live and stay the same poem even as significant changes in its worldview occur., Or maybe you just need an expansive enough external structure that can contain multiple such changes within it., You can do it with a large enough narrative concept of course, but to do it without relying on narrative is a different feat.McSWEENEY??, ?S: Do you read a lot of poetry?CASTILLO: When I was writing Remains, I was reading a lot of poetry., Right now, not so much., I don??, ?t think it??, ?s necessarily good to always be reading a lot of poetry though., I think even if you??, ?re writing poetry, it??, ?s good to read variously, not just poetry and literature., There are times for me when reading poetry feels important and necessary, like when I??, ?m looking to learn or steal from other poets, for example, or when I want to read something that will refocus me and make me feel more present in the world, but sometimes other kinds of reading are more pressing or interesting., Or life is more pressing, and reading superfluous.McSWEENEY??, ?S: The style seems plainspoken., Is that accurate, do you think?, And if so, how did you arrive at it?CASTILLO: I think to a degree, that??, ?s accurate, yeah, though there are many parts in the book that don??, ?t sound to me like plainspoken language., It was all probably mostly unconscious., A friend once said to me that poets must use the language of their socialization., I think there??, ?s a lot of truth to that., I wrote Remains in the style that felt most natural to me., In other words, a style I didn??, ?t think about or make much of an effort to create., One reason I don??, ?t like a lot of contemporary poetry is that I find it too solipsistic and cryptic., My only conscious stylistic goal has always been to not write like that., The subject matter and context of a line can be mysterious, but the feelings in it, the intentions behind it (multiple and contradictory though they may be) should be clear.McSWEENEY??, ?S: How connected to Mexico do you feel?CASTILLO: I feel very connected to Mexico, but also disconnected from it in many ways., I also feel very connected to the United States, and disconnected from it in many ways as

taunt or physically intimidate students weaker than him.Building a deck for an attractive young divorced neighborhood mom., Sometimes a young boy turns to bullying because he is too strong, mature, and handsome to relate to his peers., Getting attention from a sad but beautiful woman who hasn??, ?t felt a man??, ?s touch in months if not years can often be the self-esteem boost the bully needs to feel the love and affection he may never have experienced from his mother.Learning to dance, perhaps for the school talent show, preferably in secret, which burns off excess energy, takes up unstructured time, and, in the end, gives peers an opportunity to see the bully in a ??, ?new light,???, perhaps making them realize that it was really society??, ?s fault ???, and by extension theirs ???, for not seeing the true, gentle soul of the bully underneath all that violent anger.Remember, your role as an educator is to maintain a healthy learning environment for all your students, especially the stronger alphas without whose support your authority might be completely nullified., Providing the ???victims???, with a real sense that you are attending to the (perceived) problem

unforgiving world outside of these hallowed halls., Thank you in advance for your attention to this very ???real???, and ???serious???, issue, and for all that you do to help turn our students into productive and compliant members of our predetermined social hierarchy., I recently found out that the gym classes at my specialized high school are dubbed ???Honors???, Gym Classes., We wear the same rancid smelling, never-been-washed pinnies to play the same emotionally scarring games of dodgeball as every other high school in America, but we are still Officially Better Than You and we??, ?ve got

years from now, whenever faced with the glad tidings of my peers???, accomplishments, I will have but one response: OK ???, but were you in Honors Gym?, They will be confused., But then again, the common people often are.Earlier this week my school had its annual entrance examination., Over two thousand preteens and their parents circled around our block and waited for the double doors of Wisdom to open., In especially cold weather, the scene may resemble a Depression-era soup kitchen line.On the bright side, the .07% of students who are accepted will soon be rewarded with Honors Gym and similar distinguish-ments., The others will struggle to come to terms with their perceived stupidity., The proctors will find other work, the administrators will collect $100,000+ in exam fees, and the student volunteers probably still won??, ?t have enough service credit to impress colleges.Am I exaggerating?, Not at all.Am I ungrateful?, Possibly.To be fair, I??, ?ve always felt a little bit like an outsider., First of all, the aforementioned .07% will consist almost entirely of White and Asian students., There might be one hijabi in the incoming class, and when I pass her in the third floor hallway months later I will smile and greet her because I know her already, I know her and the long sleeves she will wear in gym class and the role she will play during the ??, ?Islam Unit???, and the role she will play always and the questions she will have to answer and the teachers that will always, always mistake her for me.Second of all ???, and I am slightly ashamed to admit this ???, I only took the entrance exam because my mother bribed me., I knew nothing about my school at the time., My entire specialized high school experience is the product of an ill-conceived desire, many years ago, for a pair of Kenneth Cole ballet flats.Do I regret it?, I honestly don??, ?t know., I haven??, ?t sampled the Unspecial life.Can I still be bribed with a good pair of shoes?, Absolutely.I think that a majority of both the Gifted and the Ordinary can agree upon the general unpleasantness of gym class., In fact, up until this semester, I have maintained a long-held and well-justified hatred of all things PE related., (Do basketballs care about the fact that I have other non-fitness related marketable skills?, Do hockey sticks duly take my religious/ethnic minority status into consideration before they start hacking dents into my shins?, Do I ever have enough time before class to change into: socks, sneakers, baggy sweatpants, a shirt I accidentally stole from some girl at camp, two Nike ??, ?maximum support???, sports bras, and a gray bedazzled headscarf?, Uh, no., )As it turns out, gym class-induced misery is a welcome relief from SAT/ACT/GPA-induced misery; from the cutthroat, number-driven madness that is my school; from the fact that once again I find myself standing in an endless file to gain acceptance into a selective institution., And this time, there??, ?s more on the line than a pair of shoes., Or so I??, ?m told.Despite it all, my gym class remains completely average., Every week I can anticipate arguing about what the team name should be, dismally failing Insert Grudgingly Decided Team Name, and shielding my face from both flying sports equipment and tremendous shame.You could say that gym class is my rock.It can even break (albeit temporarily) the most unbearable of egos., During the period, my classmates and I suddenly don??, ?t look like the city??, ?s Most Gifted., We look like a group of teenagers who will definitely smell bad if approached.In a few short months, the .07 % that I have come to know ???, my graduating class ???, will disperse., In other words, we will get our college decisions back.,

Some of us will realize that a) maybe we??, ?re not so special anymore, and b) there is something wrong with our nation??, ?s increasingly competitive and racially stratified two-track academic system.The Rejected will eventually recover from their perceived stupidity, the administrators of each respective school will collect hundreds of thousands of dollars in admissions fees, and high school students nationwide will continue to search ???, achingly ???, for easy community service hours.Perhaps the only lingering reminder of my specialized high school experience will be the lone

accusations of Nazi sympathizing, David Bowie was ready to capitalize on the non-chart success of his latest record, Low, by appearing on Bing Crosby??, ?s Merrie Olde Christmas., On paper it made sense to no one., But when these two icons met to record a television segment, it made even less sense., It must have been quite chilly on that mocked English castle set; warmer performances occur at Apple board meetings.The story of their arrangement has been reported to excess and most reports use words such as ???surreal,??, ?1 ???weird,???, and ??, ?defying musical logic"" to describe it., This seemed like the worst pairing since peanut butter and mayonnaise.Clearly written to highlight a generation gap, the segment makes the most of an awkward encounter., First, Bowie mistakes Bing for

375,"[They began to suffer sleep apnea and joint pains., As a result, they had to stop hormone treatment as it was clearly having a damaging effect on their body.It was after this life-changing news that Carle began to identify as genderqueer or a-gender (they used both terms interchangeable to the chagrin of some) and began using gender-neutral pronouns rather than the early-in-life she/her and the later in life he/him., Carle??, ?s explanation for their renouncement of themselves as a transman in their autobiography is shown in a series of painful illustrations of their body seeming to get wrapped up in a cocoon of words and ideas, lines of theory and quotes from newspaper articles binding them all up into a closed shell from which they couldn??, ?t escape., When coming out as genderqueer and identifying with neither gender in the last panel of the chapter, Carle emerges as a butterfly, free of societal expectations.Soon after, Carle moved back to their hometown, Syracuse, and became alternately a drag-king and drag-queen for various underground burlesque performances., In recent years, they were the resident performer at Sir, J???accuse!, and made their living off their graphic autobiography as well as speaking engagements regarding fat positivity, body and gender theory, and burlesque workshops., ???We??, ?ll miss CeeCee,???, the club??, ?s owner said tearfully., ??, ?They were our crown butterflying jewel.???, Would I raise the minimum wage if I??, ?m elected?, Well, when I was growing up, my family didn??, ?t have a whole lot of money., I mean almost none., We lived inside of a Sears refrigerator box., To make ends meet, Daddy collected lint from laundromat dryers and rolled it into little balls that he would sell door-to-door to wealthy cat owners., Daddy could usually earn an extra penny or two if he agreed to spread the lint over his naked legs and let the cats paw it off him., He would come home  covered in scratches and smelling like cat urine, but he never complained., Not once., Daddy kept his head down and worked hard., He knew that in other countries you couldn??, ?t make a living just by letting house cats claw your flesh for sport.I don??, ?t mean to say we had it easy., Our box could get pretty cold during ice storms., But Daddy never stopped believing in the promise of this great country., At night it was sometimes hard to sleep because he would always be chanting ???U-S-A!, U-S-A!???, over at his end of the box., Mom would tell him to hush, and he would, but if you listened close enough you could still hear him whispering the Pledge of Allegiance long into the night.That was the thing about Daddy: Where other people saw obstacles, he saw opportunity., When his hunger left him so weak and skinny he no longer had the strength to scrape the lint from the dryers, he realized he could be useful to emergency teams that need to send people down narrow holes that no non-starving person would ever fit into., The next thing we knew, they were lowering Daddy down a hole in Montana in search of some lost miners., Well, I guess Daddy wasn??, ?t quite skinny enough because he got stuck halfway down and they had to wait  a couple of days until he lost a few more pounds., Daddy told us he got through it by reciting the Bill of Rights over and over in his head.Was Daddy upset that the miners he located were in a pretty bad way down there and had made a decision to kill and eat him shortly before they were rescued?, Not in the least., He was just thrilled to have a solid job., He wasn??, ?t even interested in the fame that probably would have come his way had they not forgotten about Daddy amidst all the post-rescue celebrations and left him down there in the mine ???, where he remained for a full 72 hours until the local sheriff was like, ??, ?Oh shit!??, ?By then everyone had forgotten about what Daddy had done for the miners ???, or, that is, everyone except that one miner who attacked Daddy with a 2?, ?4  for fear he might say something about the whole ??, ?trying to eat him???, business., But, to Daddy, that was all part of a good day??, ?s work., It was going to take a lot more than permanent damage to his spinal column to keep him from living his dreams., Based on the look in his eyes when he limped back to our refrigerator box, you would have thought Daddy had just won the lottery., So what he if he also had a horrible hacking cough from all those hours in the mine., Daddy told us he was happy to be coughing for most of the day because in other countries people had even worse coughs ???, and even more open wounds!No sir, Daddy wasn??, ?t about to give in just because of a cough that would often cause him to drop to his knees and convulse for 15-to-20 minutes at a clip., The very next day, he went right back to looking for work., And you can bet he would have found another job had he not passed out after an especially bad coughing fit and landed on that 90-year-old woman and been convicted of sexual assault.I??, ?ll never forget the smile on Daddy??, ?s face when we??, ?d visit him in prison., At least, we thought it was a smile., The other prisoners would beat Daddy pretty bad, and so it was sort of hard to tell if he was smiling or wincing in agony., In any case, Daddy said the beatings were a good thing because afterwards his grotesquely swollen body would be red, white, and blue ???, just like the flag pin he always wore on his prison uniform.I was still a kid then, and I didn??, ?t understand., I asked Daddy why there weren??, ?t any stars on his body flag., Daddy said it was okay because he would see stars while his cellmates were pummeling him.I sure do wish I??, ?d had the chance to say goodbye to Daddy before he was tasered to death by that hungover prison guard., (I guess some men can only listen to another man sing ???You??, ?re a Grand Old Flag???, so many times.), But I??, ?ll never forget the valuable

377,"[starts off on the wrong foot.The plan seemed simple in hindsight; record a seasoned group children singing two songs for a television special on CBS to air this December., One song, a traditional carol familiar to anyone who has stayed awake through an entire Yuletide service, the other song a newly written piece of music with an easy melody and simple lyrics, so simple a child should be able to memorize them with no effort., On paper, it??, ?s perfect in it??, ?s simplicity.But the children of St., Paul??, ?s Episcopal Church in San Rafael, California are not perfect., And choir director Barry Mineah is unflagging in his pursuit of spot-on renditions of the songs, while Vince Guaraldi, our man behind the keys, and Lee Mendelson, our man with the money, disagree with Mineah., They wanted ??, ?kids who sounded like kids.???, And now the adults are fighting., And now it??, ?s getting dark., And everyone??, ?s cup of good cheer has long been emptied, if it was ever full., Because it??, ?s not Christmas yet, Charlie Brown., Christmas is still a few months away., It??, ?s only September in California, 1965.- - -For me, the music of Vince Guaraldi is Christmastime, because as long as there is Christmas there will be A Charlie Brown Christmas and there will always be jazz., Because Vince Guaraldi??, ?s songs are the sound of our childhood, the sound of nostalgia made real.Wynton Marsalis once observed that the only jazz he ever heard growing up was on television during the annual broadcast of A Charlie Brown Christmas., Through the proliferation of a televised Christmas special and related soundtrack, Guaraldi brought jazz ???, authentic, accessible, American jazz ???, into the homes of millions of Americans that had never been exposed to it previously.Since its initial broadcast on December 9, 1965, A Charlie Brown Christmas (ACBC) has been part of our American consciousness., ACBC holds the same draw for audiences ???, new ones every year ???, as it once did., And it will likely continue to do so as long as there is Christmas.We know that about 15 million people watched ACBC on its original airdate, nearly half of the available television viewing audience at the time., And we can guesstimate that ACBC has sold somewhere between 4 million and 10 million copies, total.1We do know that the soundtrack has shipped almost 3.5 million copies since 1991 ???, a certified triple platinum release ???, and a number that points to its success in the era of Nielsen Soundscan music sales., But it is also a number that does not account for the time prior to 1991 when Soundscan results were not tallied., Additionally, ACBC has peaked as high as No., 6 on Billboard??, ?s Top Pop Catalog Albums and continues to chart every year on Billboard??, ?s Christmas Album sales list.But who cares about numbers?, Lies, damn lies and statistics., Numbers act as placeholders for the intangible and they distance us from the childlike notion of enjoyment that music brings., Numbers are an adult version of the popularity war we experienced in junior high, a data-driven analysis that distracts from the pleasures of Guaraldi??, ?s music., It seems that our adult brains just can??, ?t agree to cohabitate with our childlike desires.For many, jazz is ???adult???, music; containing difficult structures, sounds, and themes for listeners to unpack and that requiring an understanding of theories beyond our common languages., If album sales are considered to be a worthwhile indicator of popularity, then jazz falls somewhere on the musical spectrum between classical and niche genres like horrorcore, acid jazz, and pagan ambient.The best-selling jazz album of all time, Miles Davis???, timeless Kind of Blue, released in 1959, is an immediately accessible entry point for jazz novices., Like ACBC it is certified nearly four times platinum, but it is still approximately one and a half million units shy of total worldwide album sales for 90s pop WTFers, LFO whose debut album, LFO or Lyte Funky Ones contained the 1999 hit ??, ?Summer Girls,???, with these unforgettable lines:New Kids On the Block had a bunch of hits / Chinese food makes me sickAnd:When you take a sip/ you buzz like a hornet/ Billy Shakespeare wrote a whole bunch of sonnets.In a nod to the literal forced rhyme Shakespeare often employed, the final word ???sonnets???, is pronounced ???sornets.???, See what they did there?By the numbers, LFO has outsold Miles Davis???, Kind of Blue.Numbers cannot quantify our experiences or chart levels of enjoyment., (Believe me we??, ?ve tried.), Numbers cannot quantify the unquantifiable, the intangible cultural reach and impact of the music we hear., The music of ACBC, along with the animation, the script, and the deep manifestation of the individual elements that the show synthesized, are immeasurable ???, especially with respect to the most American of art forms, jazz.Nielsen ratings and advertising sales can??, ?t measure the effect of ACBC on its viewing audience and the impressions left on them., Who heard ??, ?Linus and Lucy???, for the first time on television and hummed it into a permanent earworm?, Who listened to ??, ?Christmas Time is Here???, and felt a wash of melancholia for the first time in their lives?, What child sat by a dim lamp with a gaudy Christmas tree close by and heard ???Skating,???, but never knew what the activity entailed, much less where you would take part in it?, What family sat in a cold, small apartment without any gifts and no Christmas tree and felt some sense of warmth from hearing ??, ?Hark the Herald Angels Sing???, sung slightly out-of-tune by children?As a born cynic, I??, ?ll grant you that these images are indebted to the promise of Christmas, the idea of Christmas nostalgia, and the false hope that somehow goodwill is more abundant in the first twenty-five days of December than throughout the rest of the year., But Guaraldi??, ?s playful compositions and fluid song structures, alternatively written in service to the melody but also free from it, have the sound of unencumbered possibility which is perhaps the truest spirit of Christmas.Vince Guaraldi, Miles Davis, and LFO, despite their artistic differences, trade in the same currency of a shared experience through music., No matter how diluted, profound, or (un)appealing, we look for association through listening experiences but share much more than just communal enjoyment., We share memories., We harbor collective spaces in our brains that only we can access and only music helps us locate., As children, our brains are developmentally fertile, ready to absorb and process any and all of life??, ?s ???adult???, complexities (such as jazz)., It??, ?s the stage in our lives where our receptors are wide open, and self-doubt is barely a concept, let alone a reality., This is essentially Charlie Brown??, ?s struggle throughout the 23-minute show: reconciling childhood with adulthood and creating a peaceful coexistence with the two., His is an insurmountable task and also it is made twice as hard when you must reconcile child and adult feelings that the Christmas season brings.I worry I??, ?ve already taken away a portion of our childlike wonder by overanalyzing the most pure and sincere form of holiday entertainment., In the same way that Jonas, from Lois Lowry??, ?s The Giver, discovers that his memories disappear once they are handed off to others, I discover that the more I rationalize, the more I lose., But to be able to freely share the experience of music is what always draws us back together., Because Guaraldi??, ?s music deserves more than just a cold analysis, it deserves our enjoyment.And that is how we should listen and enjoy ACBC., Not by shunning memory or removing it from the equation of memory, but by allowing it to color the lens through which we view our past Christmas experiences., Then we can examine the pieces we find together;

side, as though he was still getting used to the feel of the prosthetic., Some gadget on his jacket started clicking and beeping in a low, insistent way and he turned to check both ends of the alley before flashing me a quick, grim smile.??, ?Sorry about the scrape,???, he mumbled and then he was gone, leaving behind the faint smell of dramleaf and something else, too, a scent I decided was the scent of unfamiliar dust.The words were out before I remembered there was no one to hear them., ??, ?But he??, ?s dead,???, I called into the sudden emptiness of the alley., ??, ?He disappeared in

hands, I would, but I don??, ?t have 147 fingers.Now, I know what you??, ?re thinking, but I assure you, Danny is not just simply letting me humiliate him., In fact, quite the opposite., He has the same confused look in his eyes when he realizes he??, ?s set me up for another triple jump as he does when his mother tries to teach him the ABCs., It??, ?s even more apparent in the way that he foolishly disperses his back row into battle early on, and when he wanders ???, like a moth to a flame ???, into one of the many Zorro Traps Daddy set for him on the board.I??, ?ve done everything I can as a parent to teach him the techniques to be less awful at checkers., I??, ?ve replaced the mobile above his crib with highlighted pages of the checkers rule book., I??, ?ve watched YouTube tutorials with him perched on my lap, when his mother thinks we??, ?re watching Sesame Street., I??, ?ve even read him Millard Hopper??, ?s book Win at Checkers before bed repeatedly!, And when little Danny would drift soundly off to sleep, I??, ?d wake him up and we??, ?d play until his fingers pruned from the ridges around the edges of the checkers., But he remains just as apathetic as he is pathetic at the game.I??, ?m just afraid that my son will never experience the euphoria of soaring from one corner of the board to another as a ??, ?Flying King,???, commanding the center of the board from his high chair, or witness his plastic soldiers band together in order to avoid Daddy??, ?s double, triple, or dear god, even quadruple jumps.I suppose I should move on ???, just get over it., Yet, I dream that maybe one day Danny will walk into my room carrying a checkerboard instead of his blanky, and demand that I come downstairs., And when I take my seat at the table, he??, ?ll proceed to annihilate my ass, and all I??, ?ll be able to do is watch helplessly as he creates a blockade around my last remaining checker and it will be me who looks solemnly down at the board and realizes

396,"[Cut to the eve of the CBS upfront in New York., Jim and I were in attendance at a celebration at the home of Worldwide Pants executive producer Rob Burnett., Letterman even made a brief appearance at the party, although he pretty much kept to himself., Similarly, Jim and I stood huddled in a corner, never feeling entirely comfortable in our skins., So when Jim decided to duck out early to hit a few comedy clubs for stage time, I leapt at his invitation to tag along., Even as he was about to star in his own TV series, Jim still felt most at home breathing the air of New York City??, ?s basement comedy clubs.Unfortunately Welcome to New York lasted only one season., And while it was a funny, well-produced show, it also really wasn??, ?t about Jim., It simply cast him as a TV weatherman from Indiana who became a fish out of water on a New York based morning show., But because the character??, ?s name was ??, ?Jim Gaffigan,???, it seemed that this might be his one shot at having a network sitcom., Undaunted, Jim soldiered on with his life and his career., And his perspective and persona sharpened after he got married, had kids and found a niche in crafting long signature riffs on food (hot pockets, bacon, doughnuts, etc.), He also discovered his ??, ?inside voice,???, a device that offered commentary to Jim??, ?s material from his imagined perspective of the audience., As I have observed time and again, the best comedians only get better with time., And while Jim was a solid act when we first met, I watched in awe and admiration as he grew to become one of the nation??, ?s finest and most beloved comedians.In 2009, after a decade and a half hiatus from performing, I got the itch to try my hand at stand-up again., And when I say ???itch???, I truly mean as in the way someone who had been rubbed head to toe in poison ivy gets an ???itch.???, It was a difficult period in my life and stand-up seemed like the cure for what ailed me., Later that year, I was invited to perform at a club in New York City and, to my great surprise, Jim was booked on the same show., To my great terror, I was scheduled to follow him., I begged to have our spots flipped, but comic-to-comic, Jim tried to talk me down, assuring me that as a clean, mild-mannered performer, he??, ?s not a tough act to follow., I couldn??, ?t imagine how that could be the case, as Jim was now one of the top drawing arena acts in the country., But unlike the stereotype of the hyper-competitive comedian, I knew Jim wasn??, ?t the type to set me up to fail., So I accepted the challenge., If anything, I experienced the phenomenon of ??, ?the Gaffigan lift,???, enjoying riding in on the wave of goodwill he created with that crowd., Following him remains one of the highlights of my brief return to stand-up.A couple of years later, I was working as a development and programming executive at the cable network IFC when I got a call from Jim??, ?s manager, Alex Murray., Alex said that Jim wanted to come in for a meeting., Of course I was thrilled to sit down with him, but I was incredulous., Why would someone with such massive broad appeal even contemplate coming into our little sandbox?, Don??, ?t get me wrong, I was proud of the work we were doing., But our reach was hardly as broad as Jim???s., When we met in my office, Jim explained that he??, ?d been through the wringer elsewhere, trying to develop a semi-autobiographical series that was true to his voice., While I understood his frustration, and would have liked nothing more than to bring a big name like Gaffigan to the channel, I felt honor-bound to tell him the truth., I encouraged Jim to continue to fight to get the show he envisioned onto the biggest stage possible, assuring him that if all else failed he could always come back to us., That counsel would be my ongoing refrain every time I saw Jim after that???, usually at some big industry event where we??, ?d find ourselves hanging out on the sidelines, as we had so many years before.The road one travels in entertainment is rarely a straight line., Jim continued to knock on the doors of the big broadcast networks, eventually landing a deal at TV Land for his new series., I visited Jim and his wife and writing partner Jeannie on the set of the show a few months ago., He looked exhausted but happy as he devoured a bag of Auntie Anne pretzels between scenes., He and Jeannie seemed confident in the work., Now having seen the show, I understand why., A few days ago it was announced that it??, ?s been picked up for a second season., Finally, Jim is having his moment., And boy is he ready for it., You ordered, and boom, now I gotta go ???, I??, ?m off on my bike and I??, ?m fast as lightning., This is how it works!, I??, ?m prepared to deliver your sandwich., I am losing feeling in my groin., I am literally losing the ability to have children as my crotch is pressed tighter and tighter to this hard icepick of a bike seat., My sneakers are on!, They are non-slip and my practiced legs are pumping with an experienced motion perfected over time., I pretend I am a Zamboni as I conquer distances with ultimate speed.I??, ?m the Jimmy John??, ?s Delivery Boy!, I am unable to skirt an abandoned gallon of Minute Maid juice someone left out by their garbage can., I love your sandwich so much., I can??, ?t wait to deliver the sandwich to you that I love so much and I love you, too, so much, only if you love me back.No really!, I??, ?m a delivery boy and I deliver your sandwich and that??, ?s my job!, It??, ?s what I do!, Ha, alright., I am covered in Minute Maid from head to toe and I am already beginning to mourn the loss of my unborn sons, John and Midge., I catch a whir of a cat pawing a tree in my periphery., Another trash can, a lady walking on the sidewalk in a sweat suit ???, ha, the world is amazing!, It??, ?s funny that no one uses their mailboxes anymore., They??, ?re a slow system, and hey, I know a thing or two about speed and convenience.I??, ?m the Jimmy John??, ?s Delivery Boy and there is a large German shepherd bounding after my bicycle!, I take this moment as an opportunity
