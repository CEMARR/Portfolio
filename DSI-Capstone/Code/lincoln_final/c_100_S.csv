0|"[Having become a candidate for the honorable office of one of your Representatives in the next General Assembly of this State, in according with an established custom and the principles of true Republicanism it becomes my duty to make known to you, the people whom I propose to represent, my sentiments with regard to local affairs., Time and experience have verified to a demonstration the public utility of internal improvements., That the poorest and most thinly populated countries would be greatly benefited by the opening of good roads, and in the clearing of navigable streams within their limits, is what no person will deny., Yet it is folly to undertake works of this or any other without first knowing that we are able to finish them--as half-finished work generally proves to be labor lost., There cannot justly be any objection to having railroads and canals, any more than to other good things, provided they cost nothing., The only objection is to paying for them; and the objection arises from the want of ability to pay., With respect to the County of Sangamon, some  Yet, however desirable an object the construction of a railroad through our country may be, however high our imaginations may be heated at thoughts of it,--there is always a heart-appalling shock accompanying the amount of its cost, which forces us to shrink from our pleasing anticipations., The probable cost of this contemplated railroad is estimated at $290,000; the bare statement of which, in my opinion, is sufficient to justify the belief that the improvement of the Sangamon River is an object much better suited to our infant resources., What the cost of this work would be, I am unable to say., It is probable, however, that it would not be greater than is common to streams of the same length., Finally, I believe the improvement of the Sangamon River to be vastly important and highly desirable to the people of the county; and, if elected, any measure in the Legislature having this for its object, which may appear judicious, will meet my approbation and receive my support., It appears that the practice of loaning money at exorbitant rates of interest has already been opened as a field for discussion; so I suppose I may enter upon it without claiming the honor or risking the danger which may await its first explorer., It seems as though we are never to have an end to this baneful and corroding system, acting almost as prejudicially to the general interests of the community as a direct tax of several thousand dollars annually laid on each county for the benefit of a few individuals only, unless there be a law made fixing the limits of usury., A law for this purpose, I am of opinion, may be made without materially injuring any class of people., In cases of extreme necessity, there could always be means found to cheat the law; while in all other cases it would have its intended effect., I would favor the passage of a law on this subject which might not be very easily evaded., Let it be such that the labor and difficulty of evading it could only be justified in cases of greatest necessity., Upon the subject of education, not presuming to dictate any plan or system respecting it, I can only say that I view it as the most important subject which we as a people can be engaged in., That every man may receive at least a moderate education, and thereby be enabled to read the histories of his own and other countries, by which he may duly appreciate the value of our free institutions, appears to be an object of vital importance, even on this account alone, to say nothing of the advantages and satisfaction to be derived from all being able to read the Scriptures, and other works both of a religious and moral nature, for themselves., For my part, I desire to see the time when education--and by its means, morality, sobriety, enterprise, and industry--shall become much more general than at present, and should be gratified to have it in my power to contribute something to the advancement of any measure which might have a tendency to accelerate that happy period., With regard to existing laws, some alterations are thought to be necessary., Many respectable men have suggested that our estray laws, the law respecting the issuing of executions, the road law, and some others, are deficient in their present form, and require alterations., But, considering the great probability that the framers of those laws were wiser than myself, I should prefer not meddling with them, unless they were first attacked by others; in which case I should feel it both a privilege and a duty to take that stand which, in my view, might tend most to the advancement of justice., But, fellow-citizens, I shall conclude., Considering the great degree of modesty which should always attend youth, it is probable I have already been more presuming than becomes me., However, upon the subjects of which I have treated, I have spoken as I have thought., I may be wrong in regard to any or all of them; but, holding it a sound maxim that it is better only sometimes to be right than at all times to be wrong, so soon as I discover my opinions to be erroneous, I shall be ready to renounce them., Every man is said to have his peculiar ambition., Whether it be true or not, I can say, for one, that I have no other so great as that of being truly esteemed of my fellow-men, by rendering myself worthy of their esteem., How far I shall succeed in gratifying this ambition is yet to be developed., I am young, and unknown to many of you., I was born, and have ever remained, in the most humble walks of life., I have no wealthy or popular relations or friends to recommend me., My case is thrown exclusively upon the independent voters of the county; and, if elected, they will have conferred a favor upon me for which I shall be unremitting in my labors to compensate., But, if the good people in their wisdom shall see fit to keep me in the background, I have been too familiar with disappointments to be very much chagrined., In regard to the time David Rankin served the enclosed discharge shows correctly--as well as I can recollect--having no writing to refer., The transfer of Rankin from my company occurred as follows: Rankin having lost his horse at Dixon's ferry and having acquaintance in one of the foot companies who were going down the river was desirous to go with them, and one Galishen being an acquaintance of mine and belonging to the company in which Rankin wished to go wished to leave it and join mine, this being the case it was agreed that they should exchange places and answer to each other's names--as it was expected we all would be discharged in very few days., As to a blanket--I have no knowledge of Rankin ever getting any., The above embraces all the facts now in my recollection which are pertinent to the case., I shall take pleasure in giving any further information in my power should you call on me., At your request I send you a receipt for the postage on your paper., I am somewhat surprised at your request., I will, however, comply with it., The law requires newspaper postage to be paid in advance, and now that I have waited a full year you choose to wound my feelings by insinuating that unless you get a receipt I will probably make you pay it again., In your paper of last Saturday I see a communication, over the signature of ""Many Voters,"" in which the candidates who are announced in the Journal are called upon to ""show their hands."", Agreed., Here's mine., I go for all sharing the privileges of the government who assist in bearing its burdens., Consequently, I go for admitting all whites to the right of suffrage who pay taxes or bear arms (by no means excluding females)., If elected, I shall consider the whole people of Sangamon my constituents, as well those that oppose as those that support me., While acting as their representative, I shall be governed by their will on all subjects upon which I have the means of knowing what their will is; and upon all others I shall do what my own judgment teaches me will best advance their interests., Whether elected or not, I go for distributing the proceeds of the sales of the public lands to the several States, to enable our State, in common with others, to dig canals and construct railroads without borrowing money and paying the interest on it., If alive on the first Monday in November, I shall vote for Hugh L. White for President., I am told that during my absence last week you passed through this place, and stated publicly that you were in possession of a fact or facts which, if known to the public, would entirely destroy the prospects of N. W. Edwards and myself at the ensuing election; but that, through favor to us, you should forbear to divulge them., No one has needed favors more than I, and, generally, few have been less unwilling to accept them; but in this case favor to me would be injustice to the public, and therefore I must beg your pardon for declining it., That I once had the confidence of the people of Sangamon, is sufficiently evident; and if I have since done anything, either by design or misadventure, which if known would subject me to a forfeiture of that confidence, he that knows of that thing, and conceals it, is a traitor to his country's interest., I find myself wholly unable to form any conjecture of what fact or facts, real or supposed, you spoke; but my opinion of your veracity will not permit me for a moment to doubt that you at least believed what you said., I am flattered with the personal regard you manifested for me; but I do hope that, on more mature reflection, you will view the public interest as a paramount consideration, and therefore determine to let the worst come., I here assure you that the candid statement of facts on your part, however low it may sink me, shall never break the tie of personal friendship between us., I wish an answer to this, and you are at liberty to publish both, if you choose., I have been sick ever since my arrival, or I should have written sooner., It is but little difference, however, as I have very little even yet to write., And more, the longer I can avoid the mortification of looking in the post-office for your letter and not finding it, the better., You see I am mad about that old letter yet., I don't like very well to risk you again., I'll try you once more, anyhow., The new State House is not yet finished, and consequently the Legislature is doing little or nothing., The governor delivered an inflammatory political message, and it is expected there will be some sparring between the parties about it as soon as the two Houses get to business., Taylor delivered up his petition for the new county to one of our members this morning., I am told he despairs of its success, on account of all the members from Morgan County opposing it., There are names enough on the petition, I think, to justify the members from our county in going for it; but if the members from Morgan oppose it, which they say they will, the chance will be bad., Our chance to take the seat of government to Springfield is better than I expected., An internal-improvement convention was held there since we met, which recommended a loan of several millions of dollars, on the faith of the State, to construct railroads., Some of the Legislature are for it, and some against it; which has the majority I cannot tell., There is great strife and struggling for the office of the United States Senator here at this time., It is probable we shall ease their pains in a few days., The opposition men have no candidate of their own, and consequently they will smile as complacently at the angry snarl of the contending Van Buren candidates and their respective friends as the Christian does at Satan's rage., You recollect that I mentioned at the outset of this letter that I had been unwell., That is the fact, though I believe I am about well now; but that, with other things I cannot account for, have conspired, and have gotten my spirits so low that I feel that I would rather be any place in the world than here., I really cannot endure the thought of staying here ten weeks., Write back as soon as you get this, and, if possible, say something that will please me, for really I have not been pleased since I left you., This letter is so dry and stupid that I am ashamed to send it, but with my present feelings I cannot do any better., Give my best respects to Mr. and Mrs., Able and family., Lest I should fall into the too common error of being mistaken in regard to which side I design to be upon, I shall make it my first care to remove all doubt on that point, by declaring that I am opposed to the resolution under consideration, in toto., Before I proceed to the body of the subject, I will further remark, that it is not without a considerable degree of apprehension that I venture to cross the track of the gentleman from Coles [Mr. Linder]., Indeed, I do not believe I could muster a sufficiency of courage to come in contact with that gentleman, were it not for the fact that he, some days since, most graciously condescended to assure us that he would never be found wasting ammunition on small game., On the same fortunate occasion, he further gave us to understand, that he regarded himself as being decidedly the superior of our common friend from Randolph [Mr. Shields]; and feeling, as I really do, that I, to say the most of myself, am nothing more than the peer of our friend from Randolph, I shall regard the gentleman from Coles as decidedly my superior also, and consequently, in the course of what I shall have to say, whenever I shall have occasion to allude to that gentleman, I shall endeavor to adopt that kind of court language which I understand to be due to decided superiority., In one faculty, at least, there can be no dispute of the gentleman's superiority over me and most other men, and that is, the faculty of entangling a subject, so that neither himself, or any other man, can find head or tail to it., Here he has introduced a resolution embracing ninety-nine printed lines across common writing paper, and yet more than one half of his opening speech has been made upon subjects about which there is not one word said in his resolution., Though his resolution embraces nothing in regard to the constitutionality of the Bank, much of what he has said has been with a view to make the impression that it was unconstitutional in its inception., Now, although I am satisfied that an ample field may be found within the pale of the resolution, at least for small game, yet, as the gentleman has traveled out of it, I feel that I may, with all due humility, venture to follow him., The gentleman has discovered that some gentleman at Washington city has been upon the very eve of deciding our Bank unconstitutional, and that he would probably have completed his very authentic decision, had not some one of the Bank officers placed his hand upon his mouth, and begged him to withhold it., The fact that the individuals composing our Supreme Court have, in an official capacity, decided in favor of the constitutionality of the Bank, would, in my mind, seem a sufficient answer to this., It is a fact known to all, that the members of the Supreme Court, together with the Governor, form a Council of Revision, and that this Council approved this Bank charter., I ask, then, if the extra-judicial decision not quite but almost made by the gentleman at Washington, before whom, by the way, the question of the constitutionality of our Bank never has, nor never can come--is to be taken as paramount to a decision officially made by that tribunal, by which, and which alone, the constitutionality of the Bank can ever be settled?, But, aside from this view of the subject, I would ask, if the committee which this resolution proposes to appoint are to examine into the Constitutionality of the Bank?, Are they to be clothed with power to send for persons and papers, for this object?, And after they have found the bank to be unconstitutional, and decided it so, how are they to enforce their decision?, What will their decision amount to?, ...]"|3
1|"[I was only endeavoring to show that there was at least as great a probability of any seven members that could be selected from this House being bribed to act corruptly, as there was that the twenty-four commissioners had been so bribed., By a reference to the ninth section of the Bank charter, it will be seen that those commissioners were John Tilson, Robert K. McLaughlin, Daniel Warm, A.G. S. Wight, John C. Riley, W. H. Davidson, Edward M. Wilson, Edward L. Pierson, Robert R. Green, Ezra Baker, Aquilla Wren, John Taylor, Samuel C. Christy, Edmund Roberts, Benjamin Godfrey, Thomas Mather, A. M. Jenkins, W. Linn, W. S. Gilman, Charles Prentice, Richard I. Hamilton, A.H. Buckner, W. F. Thornton, and Edmund D. Taylor., These are twenty-four of the most respectable men in the State., Probably no twenty-four men could be selected in the State with whom the people are better acquainted, or in whose honor and integrity they would more readily place confidence., And I now repeat, that there is less probability that those men have been bribed and corrupted, than that any seven men, or rather any six men, that could be selected from the members of this House, might be so bribed and corrupted, even though they were headed and led on by ""decided superiority"" himself., In all seriousness, I ask every reasonable man, if an issue be joined by these twenty-four commissioners, on the one part, and any other seven men, on the other part, and the whole depend upon the honor and integrity of the contending parties, to which party would the greatest degree of credit be due?, Again: Another consideration is, that we have no right to make the examination., What I shall say upon this head I design exclusively for the law-loving and law-abiding part of the House., To those who claim omnipotence for the Legislature, and who in the plenitude of their assumed powers are disposed to disregard the Constitution, law, good faith, moral right, and everything else, I have not a word to say., But to the law-abiding part I say, examine the Bank charter, go examine the Constitution, go examine the acts that the General Assembly of this State has passed, and you will find just as much authority given in each and every of them to compel the Bank to bring its coffers to this hall and to pour their contents upon this floor, as to compel it to submit to this examination which this resolution proposes., Why, Sir, the gentleman from Coles, the mover of this resolution, very lately denied on this floor that the Legislature had any right to repeal or otherwise meddle with its own acts, when those acts were made in the nature of contracts, and had been accepted and acted on by other parties., Now I ask if this resolution does not propose, for this House alone, to do what he, but the other day, denied the right of the whole Legislature to do?, He must either abandon the position he then took, or he must now vote against his own resolution., It is no difference to me, and I presume but little to any one else, which he does., I am by no means the special advocate of the Bank., I have long thought that it would be well for it to report its condition to the General Assembly, and that cases might occur, when it might be proper to make an examination of its affairs by a committee., Accordingly, during the last session, while a bill supplemental to the Bank charter was pending before the House, I offered an amendment to the same, in these words: ""The said corporation shall, at the next session of the General Assembly, and at each subsequent General Session, during the existence of its charter, report to the same the amount of debts due from said corporation; the amount of debts due to the same; the amount of specie in its vaults, and an account of all lands then owned by the same, and the amount for which such lands have been taken; and moreover, if said corporation shall at any time neglect or refuse to submit its books, papers, and all and everything necessary for a full and fair examination of its affairs, to any person or persons appointed by the General Assembly, for the purpose of making such examination, the said corporation shall forfeit its charter."", This amendment was negatived by a vote of 34 to 15., Eleven of the 34 who voted against it are now members of this House; and though it would be out of order to call their names, I hope they will all recollect themselves, and not vote for this examination to be made without authority, inasmuch as they refused to receive the authority when it was in their power to do so., I have said that cases might occur, when an examination might be proper; but I do not believe any such case has now occurred; and if it has, I should still be opposed to making an examination without legal authority., I am opposed to encouraging that lawless and mobocratic spirit, whether in relation to the Bank or anything else, which is already abroad in the land and is spreading with rapid and fearful impetuosity, to the ultimate overthrow of every institution, of every moral principle, in which persons and property have hitherto found security., But supposing we had the authority, I would ask what good can result from the examination?, Can we declare the Bank unconstitutional, and compel it to desist from the abuses of its power, provided we find such abuses to exist?, Can we repair the injuries which it may have done to individuals?, Most certainly we can do none of these things., Why then shall we spend the public money in such employment?, Oh, say the examiners, we can injure the credit of the Bank, if nothing else, Please tell me, gentlemen, who will suffer most by that?, You cannot injure, to any extent, the stockholders., They are men of wealth--of large capital; and consequently, beyond the power of malice., But by injuring the credit of the Bank, you will depreciate the value of its paper in the hands of the honest and unsuspecting farmer and mechanic, and that is all you can do., But suppose you could effect your whole purpose; suppose you could wipe the Bank from existence, which is the grand ultimatum of the project, what would be the consequence?, why, Sir, we should spend several thousand dollars of the public treasure in the operation, annihilate the currency of the State, render valueless in the hands of our people that reward of their former labors, and finally be once more under the comfortable obligation of paying the Wiggins loan, principal and interest., As a subject for the remarks of the evening, ""The Perpetuation of our Political Institutions"" is selected., In the great journal of things happening under the sun, we, the American people, find our account running under date of the nineteenth century of the Christian era., We find ourselves in the peaceful possession of the fairest portion of the earth as regards extent of territory, fertility of soil, and salubrity of climate., We find ourselves under the government of a system of political institutions conducing more essentially to the ends of civil and religious liberty than any of which the history of former times tells us., We, when mounting the stage of existence, found ourselves the legal inheritors of these fundamental blessings., We toiled not in the acquirement or establishment of them; they are a legacy bequeathed us by a once hardy, brave, and patriotic, but now lamented and departed, race of ancestors., Theirs was the task (and nobly they performed it) to possess themselves, and through themselves us, of this goodly land, and to uprear upon its hills and its valleys a political edifice of liberty and equal rights; it is ours only to transmit these--the former unprofaned by the foot of an invader, the latter undecayed by the lapse of time and untorn by usurpation--to the latest generation that fate shall permit the world to know., This task gratitude to our fathers, justice to ourselves, duty to posterity, and love for our species in general, all imperatively require us faithfully to perform., How then shall we perform it?, At what point shall we expect the approach of danger?, By what means shall we fortify against it?, Shall we expect some transatlantic military giant to step the ocean and crush us at a blow?, Never!, All the armies of Europe, Asia, and Africa combined, with all the treasure of the earth (our own excepted) in their military chest, with a Bonaparte for a commander, could not by force take a drink from the Ohio or make a track on the Blue Ridge in a trial of a thousand years., At what point then is the approach of danger to be expected?, I answer: If it ever reach us it must spring up amongst us; it cannot come from abroad., If destruction be our lot we must ourselves be its author and finisher., As a nation of freemen we must live through all time, or die by suicide., I hope I am over-wary; but if I am not, there is even now something of ill omen amongst us., I mean the increasing disregard for law which pervades the country--the growing disposition to substitute the wild and furious passions in lieu of the sober judgment of courts, and the worse than savage mobs for the executive ministers of justice., This disposition is awfully fearful in any community; and that it now exists in ours, though grating to our feelings to admit, it would be a violation of truth and an insult to our intelligence to deny., Accounts of outrages committed by mobs form the everyday news of the times., They have pervaded the country from New England to Louisiana; they are neither peculiar to the eternal snows of the former nor the burning suns of the latter; they are not the creature of climate, neither are they confined to the slave holding or the non-slave holding States., Alike they spring up among the pleasure-hunting masters of Southern slaves, and the order-loving citizens of the land of steady habits., Whatever then their cause may be, it is common to the whole country., It would be tedious as well as useless to recount the horrors of all of them., Those happening in the State of Mississippi and at St. Louis are perhaps the most dangerous in example and revolting to humanity., In the Mississippi case they first commenced by hanging the regular gamblers--a set of men certainly not following for a livelihood a very useful or very honest occupation, but one which, so far from being forbidden by the laws, was actually licensed by an act of the Legislature passed but a single year before., Next, negroes suspected of conspiring to raise an insurrection were caught up and hanged in all parts of the State; then, white men supposed to be leagued with the negroes; and finally, strangers from neighboring States, going thither on business, were in many instances subjected to the same fate., Thus went on this process of hanging, from gamblers to negroes, from negroes to white citizens, and from these to strangers, till dead men were seen literally dangling from the boughs of trees upon every roadside, and in numbers almost sufficient to rival the native Spanish moss of the country as a drapery of the forest., Turn then to that horror-striking scene at St. Louis., A single victim only was sacrificed there., This story is very short, and is perhaps the most highly tragic of anything of its length that has ever been witnessed in real life., A mulatto man by the name of McIntosh was seized in the street, dragged to the suburbs of the city, chained to a tree, and actually burned to death; and all within a single hour from the time he had been a freeman attending to his own business and at peace with the world., Such are the effects of mob law, and such are the scenes becoming more and more frequent in this land so lately famed for love of law and order, and the stories of which have even now grown too familiar to attract anything more than an idle remark., But you are perhaps ready to ask, ""What has this to do with the perpetuation of our political institutions?"", I answer, It has much to do with it., Its direct consequences are, comparatively speaking, but a small evil, and much of its danger consists in the proneness of our minds to regard its direct as its only consequences., Abstractly considered, the hanging of the gamblers at Vicksburg was of but little consequence., They constitute a portion of population that is worse than useless in any community; and their death, if no pernicious example be set by it, is never matter of reasonable regret with any one., If they were annually swept from the stage of existence by the plague or smallpox, honest men would perhaps be much profited by the operation., Similar too is the correct reasoning in regard to the burning of the negro at St. Louis., He had forfeited his life by the perpetration of an outrageous murder upon one of the most worthy and respectable citizens of the city, and had he not died as he did, he must have died by the sentence of the law in a very short time afterwards., As to him alone, it was as well the way it was as it could otherwise have been., But the example in either case was fearful., When men take it in their heads to-day to hang gamblers or burn murderers, they should recollect that in the confusion usually attending such transactions they will be as likely to hang or burn some one who is neither a gambler nor a murderer as one who is, and that, acting upon the example they set, the mob of to-morrow may, and probably will, hang or burn some of them by the very same mistake., And not only so: the innocent, those who have ever set their faces against violations of law in every shape, alike with the guilty fall victims to the ravages of mob law; and thus it goes on, step by step, till all the walls erected for the defense of the persons and property of individuals are trodden down and disregarded., But all this, even, is not the full extent of the evil., By such examples, by instances of the perpetrators of such acts going unpunished, the lawless in spirit are encouraged to become lawless in practice; and having been used to no restraint but dread of punishment, they thus become absolutely unrestrained., Having ever regarded government as their deadliest bane, they make a jubilee of the suspension of its operations, and pray for nothing so much as its total annihilation., While, on the other hand, good men, men who love tranquillity, who desire to abide by the laws and enjoy their benefits, who would gladly spill their blood in the defense of their country, seeing their property destroyed, their families insulted, and their lives endangered, their persons injured, and seeing nothing in prospect that forebodes a change for the better, become tired of and disgusted with a government that offers them no protection, and are not much averse to a change in which they imagine they have nothing to lose., Thus, then, by the operation of this mobocratic spirit which all must admit is now abroad in the land, the strongest bulwark of any government, and particularly of those constituted like ours, may effectually be broken down and destroyed--I mean the attachment of the people., Whenever this effect shall be produced among us; whenever the vicious portion of population shall be permitted to gather in bands of hundreds and thousands, and burn churches, ravage and rob provision-stores, throw printing presses into rivers, shoot editors, and hang and burn obnoxious persons at pleasure and with impunity, depend on it, this government cannot last., By such things the feelings of the best citizens will become more or less alienated from it, and thus it will be left without friends, or with too few, and those few too weak to make their friendship effectual., At such a time, and under such circumstances, men of sufficient talent and ambition will not be wanting to seize the opportunity, strike the blow, and overturn that fair fabric which for the last half century has been the fondest hope of the lovers of freedom throughout the world., I know the American people are much attached to their government; I know they would suffer much for its sake; I know they would endure evils long and patiently before they would ever think of exchanging it for another,--yet, notwithstanding all this, if the laws be continually despised and disregarded, if their rights to be secure in their persons and property are held by no better tenure than the caprice of a mob, the alienation of their affections from the government is the natural consequence; and to that, sooner or later, it must come., Here, then, is one point at which danger may be expected., The question recurs, How shall we fortify against it?, The answer is simple., Let every American, every lover of liberty, every well-wisher to his posterity swear by the blood of the Revolution never to violate in the least particular the laws of the country, and never to tolerate their violation by others., As the patriots of seventy-six did to the support of the Declaration of Independence, so to the support of the Constitution and laws let every American pledge his life, his property, and his sacred honor., Let every man remember that to violate the law is to trample on the blood of his father, and to tear the charter of his own and his children's liberty., Let reverence for the laws be breathed by every American mother to the lisping babe that prattles on her lap; let it be taught in schools, in seminaries, and in colleges; let it be written in primers, spelling books, and in almanacs; let it be preached from the pulpit, proclaimed in legislative halls, and enforced in courts of justice., And, in short, let it become the political religion of the nation; and let the old and the young, the rich and the poor, the grave and the gay of all sexes and tongues and colors and conditions, sacrifice unceasingly upon its altars., While ever a state of feeling such as this shall universally or even very generally prevail throughout the nation, vain will be every effort, and fruitless every attempt, to subvert our national freedom., When, I so pressingly urge a strict observance of all the laws, let me not be understood as saying there are no bad laws, or that grievances may not arise for the redress of which no legal provisions have been made., I mean to say no such thing., But I do mean to say that although bad laws, if they exist, should be repealed as soon as possible, still, while they continue in force, for the sake of example they should be religiously observed., ...]"|3
2|"[I am afraid you would not be satisfied., There is a great deal of flourishing about in carriages here, which it would be your doom to see without sharing it., You would have to be poor, without the means of hiding your poverty., Do you believe you could bear that patiently?, Whatever woman may cast her lot with mine, should any ever do so, it is my intention to do all in my power to make her happy and contented; and there is nothing I can imagine that would make me more unhappy than to fail in the effort., I know I should be much happier with you than the way I am, provided I saw no signs of discontent in you., What you have said to me may have been in the way of jest, or I may have misunderstood you., If so, then let it be forgotten; if otherwise, I much wish you would think seriously before you decide., What I have said I will most positively abide by, provided you wish it., My opinion is that you had better not do it., You have not been accustomed to hardship, and it may be more severe than you now imagine., I know you are capable of thinking correctly on any subject, and if you deliberate maturely upon this subject before you decide, then I am willing to abide your decision., You must write me a good long letter after you get this., You have nothing else to do, and though it might not seem interesting to you after you had written it, it would be a good deal of company to me in this ""busy wilderness."", Tell your sister I don't want to hear any more about selling out and moving., That gives me the ""hypo"" whenever I think of it., DEAR SIR:-Mr. Edwards tells me you wish to know whether the act to which your own incorporation provision was attached passed into a law., It did., You can organize under the general incorporation law as soon as you choose., I also tacked a provision onto a fellow's bill to authorize the relocation of the road from Salem down to your town, but I am not certain whether or not the bill passed, neither do I suppose I can ascertain before the law will be published, if it is a law., Bowling Greene, Bennette Abe?, and yourself are appointed to make the change., No news., No excitement except a little about the election of Monday next., I suppose, of course, our friend Dr. Heney stands no chance in your diggings., FRIEND MARY: You will no doubt think it rather strange that I should write you a letter on the same day on which we parted, and I can only account for it by supposing that seeing you lately makes me think of you more than usual; while at our late meeting we had but few expressions of thoughts., You must know that I cannot see you, or think of you, with entire indifference; and yet it may be that you are mistaken in regard to what my real feelings toward you are., If I knew you were not, I should not have troubled you with this letter., Perhaps any other man would know enough without information; but I consider it my peculiar right to plead ignorance, and your bounden duty to allow the plea., I want in all cases to do right; and most particularly so in all cases with women., I want, at this particular time, more than any thing else to do right with you; and if I knew it would be doing right, as I rather suspect it would, to let you alone I would do it., And, for the purpose of making the matter as plain as possible, I now say that you can drop the subject, dismiss your thoughts (if you ever had any) from me for ever and leave this letter unanswered without calling forth one accusing murmur from me., And I will even go further and say that, if it will add anything to your comfort or peace of mind to do so, it is my sincere wish that you should., Do not understand by this that I wish to cut your acquaintance., I mean no such thing., What I do wish is that our further acquaintance shall depend upon yourself., If such further acquaintance would contribute nothing to your happiness, I am sure it would not to mine., If you feel yourself in any degree bound to me, I am now willing to release you, provided you wish it; while on the other hand I am willing and even anxious to bind you faster if I can be convinced that it will, in any considerable degree, add to your happiness., This, indeed, is the whole question with me., Nothing would make me more miserable than to believe you miserable, nothing more happy than to know you were so., In what I have now said, I think I cannot be misunderstood; and to make myself understood is the only object of this letter., If it suits you best not to answer this, farewell., A long life and a merry one attend you., But, if you conclude to write back, speak as plainly as I do., There can neither be harm nor danger in saying to me anything you think, just in the manner you think it., My respects to your sister., Your friend, LINCOLN., In accordance with our determination, as expressed last week, we present to the reader the articles which were published in hand-bill form, in reference to the case of the heirs of Joseph Anderson vs. James Adams., These articles can now be read uninfluenced by personal or party feeling, and with the sole motive of learning the truth., When that is done, the reader can pass his own judgment on the matters at issue., We only regret in this case, that the publications were not made some weeks before the election., Such a course might have prevented the expressions of regret, which have often been heard since, from different individuals, on account of the disposition they made of their votes., To the Public:  It is well known to most of you, that there is existing at this time considerable excitement in regard to Gen. Adams's titles to certain tracts of land, and the manner in which he acquired them., As I understand, the Gen. charges that the whole has been gotten up by a knot of lawyers to injure his election; and as I am one of the knot to which he refers, and as I happen to be in possession of facts connected with the matter, I will, in as brief a manner as possible, make a statement of them, together with the means by which I arrived at the knowledge of them., Sometime in May or June last, a widow woman, by the name of Anderson, and her son, who resides in Fulton county, came to Springfield, for the purpose as they said of selling a ten acre lot of ground lying near town, which they claimed as the property of the deceased husband and father., When they reached town they found the land was claimed by Gen. Adams., John T. Stuart and myself were employed to look into the matter, and if it was thought we could do so with any prospect of success, to commence a suit for the land., I went immediately to the recorder's office to examine Adams's title, and found that the land had been entered by one Dixon, deeded by Dixon to Thomas, by Thomas to one Miller, and by Miller to Gen. Adams., The oldest of these three deeds was about ten or eleven years old, and the latest more than five, all recorded at the same time, and that within less than one year., This I thought a suspicious circumstance, and I was thereby induced to examine the deeds very closely, with a view to the discovery of some defect by which to overturn the title, being almost convinced then it was founded in fraud., I discovered that in the deed from Thomas to Miller, although Miller's name stood in a sort of marginal note on the record book, it was nowhere in the deed itself., I told the fact to Talbott, the recorder, and proposed to him that he should go to Gen. Adams's and get the original deed, and compare it with the record, and thereby ascertain whether the defect was in the original or there was merely an error in the recording., As Talbott afterwards told me, he went to the General's, but not finding him at home, got the deed from his son, which, when compared with the record, proved what we had discovered was merely an error of the recorder., After Mr. Talbott corrected the record, he brought the original to our office, as I then thought and think yet, to show us that it was right., When he came into the room he handed the deed to me, remarking that the fault was all his own., On opening it, another paper fell out of it, which on examination proved to be an assignment of a judgment in the Circuit Court of Sangamon County from Joseph Anderson, the late husband of the widow above named, to James Adams, the judgment being in favor of said Anderson against one Joseph Miller., Knowing that this judgment had some connection with the land affair, I immediately took a copy of it, which is word for word, letter for letter and cross for cross as follows:  Judgment in Sangamon Circuit Court against Joseph Miller obtained on a note originally 25 dolls and interest thereon accrued., I assign all my right, title and interest to James Adams which is in consideration of a debt I owe said Adams., As the copy shows, it bore date May 10, 1827; although the judgment assigned by it was not obtained until the October afterwards, as may be seen by any one on the records of the Circuit Court., Two other strange circumstances attended it which cannot be represented by a copy., One of them was, that the date ""1827"" had first been made ""1837"" and, without the figure ""3,"" being fully obliterated, the figure ""2"" had afterwards been made on top of it; the other was that, although the date was ten years old, the writing on it, from the freshness of its appearance, was thought by many, and I believe by all who saw it, not to be more than a week old., The paper on which it was written had a very old appearance; and there were some old figures on the back of it which made the freshness of the writing on the face of it much more striking than I suppose it otherwise might have been., The reader's curiosity is no doubt excited to know what connection this assignment had with the land in question., The story is this: Dixon sold and deeded the land to Thomas; Thomas sold it to Anderson; but before he gave a deed, Anderson sold it to Miller, and took Miller's note for the purchase money., When this note became due, Anderson sued Miller on it, and Miller procured an injunction from the Court of Chancery to stay the collection of the money until he should get a deed for the land., Gen. Adams was employed as an attorney by Anderson in this chancery suit, and at the October term, 1827, the injunction was dissolved, and a judgment given in favor of Anderson against Miller; and it was provided that Thomas was to execute a deed for the land in favor of Miller and deliver it to Gen. Adams, to be held up by him till Miller paid the judgment, and then to deliver it to him., Miller left the county without paying the judgment., Anderson moved to Fulton county, where he has since died When the widow came to Springfield last May or June, as before mentioned, and found the land deeded to Gen. Adams by Miller, she was naturally led to inquire why the money due upon the judgment had not been sent to them, inasmuch as he, Gen. Adams, had no authority to deliver Thomas's deed to Miller until the money was paid., Then it was the General told her, or perhaps her son, who came with her, that Anderson, in his lifetime, had assigned the judgment to him, Gen. Adams., I am now told that the General is exhibiting an assignment of the same judgment bearing date ""1828"" and in other respects differing from the one described; and that he is asserting that no such assignment as the one copied by me ever existed; or if there did, it was forged between Talbott and the lawyers, and slipped into his papers for the purpose of injuring him., Now, I can only say that I know precisely such a one did exist, and that Ben., Talbott, Wm., Butler, C.R., Matheny, John T. Stuart, Judge Logan, Robert Irwin, P. C. Canedy and S. M. Tinsley, all saw and examined it, and that at least one half of them will swear that IT WAS IN GENERAL ADAMS'S HANDWRITING!!, And further, I know that Talbott will swear that he got it out of the General's possession, and returned it into his possession again., The assignment which the General is now exhibiting purports to have been by Anderson in writing., The one I copied was signed with a cross., I am told that Gen. Neale says that he will swear that he heard Gen. Adams tell young Anderson that the assignment made by his father was signed with a cross., The above are 'facts,' as stated., I leave them without comment., I have given the names of persons who have knowledge of these facts, in order that any one who chooses may call on them and ascertain how far they will corroborate my statements., I have only made these statements because I am known by many to be one of the individuals against whom the charge of forging the assignment and slipping it into the General's papers has been made, and because our silence might be construed into a confession of its truth., I shall not subscribe my name; but I hereby authorize the editor of the Journal to give it up to any one that may call for it., In the Republican of this morning a publication of Gen. Adams's appears, in which my name is used quite unreservedly., For this I thank the General., I thank him because it gives me an opportunity, without appearing obtrusive, of explaining a part of a former publication of mine, which appears to me to have been misunderstood by many., In the former publication alluded to, I stated, in substance, that Mr. Talbott got a deed from a son of Gen. Adams's for the purpose of correcting a mistake that had occurred on the record of the said deed in the recorder's office; that he corrected the record, and brought the deed and handed it to me, and that on opening the deed, another paper, being the assignment of a judgment, fell out of it., This statement Gen. Adams and the editor of the Republican have seized upon as a most palpable evidence of fabrication and falsehood., They set themselves gravely about proving that the assignment could not have been in the deed when Talbott got it from young Adams, as he, Talbott, would have seen it when he opened the deed to correct the record., Now, the truth is, Talbott did see the assignment when he opened the deed, or at least he told me he did on the same day; and I only omitted to say so, in my former publication, because it was a matter of such palpable and necessary inference., ...]"|3
3|"[Now, without attempting to explain, he furnishes me with another witness (Tinsley) by which the same thing is proved, to wit, that the assignment was not manufactured just before the election; but that it was some weeks before., Let it be borne in mind that Adams made this statement--has himself furnished two witnesses to prove its falsehood, and does not attempt to deny or explain it., Before going farther, let a pin be stuck here, labeled ""One lie proved and confessed."", On the 6th of September he said he had before stated in the hand-bill that he held an assignment dated May 20th, 1828, which in reply I pronounced to be false, and referred to the hand-bill for the truth of what I said., This week he forgets to make any explanation of this., Let another pin be stuck here, labelled as before., I mention these things because, if, when I convict him in one falsehood, he is permitted to shift his ground and pass it by in silence, there can be no end to this controversy., The first thing that attracts my attention in the General's present production is the information he is pleased to give to ""those who are made to suffer at his (my) hands."", Under present circumstances, this cannot apply to me, for I am not a widow nor an orphan: nor have I a wife or children who might by possibility become such., Such, however, I have no doubt, have been, and will again be made to suffer at his hands!, Hands!, Yes, they are the mischievous agents., The next thing I shall notice is his favorite expression, ""not of lawyers, doctors and others,"" which he is so fond of applying to all who dare expose his rascality., Now, let it be remembered that when he first came to this country he attempted to impose himself upon the community as a lawyer, and actually carried the attempt so far as to induce a man who was under a charge of murder to entrust the defence of his life in his hands, and finally took his money and got him hanged., Is this the man that is to raise a breeze in his favor by abusing lawyers?, If he is not himself a lawyer, it is for the lack of sense, and not of inclination., If he is not a lawyer, he is a liar, for he proclaimed himself a lawyer, and got a man hanged by depending on him., Passing over such parts of the article as have neither fact nor argument in them, I come to the question asked by Adams whether any person ever saw the assignment in his possession., This is an insult to common sense., Talbott has sworn once and repeated time and again, that he got it out of Adams's possession and returned it into the same possession., Still, as though he was addressing fools, he has assurance to ask if any person ever saw it in his possession., Next I quote a sentence, ""Now my son Lucian swears that when Talbott called for the deed, that he, Talbott, opened it and pointed out the error."", True., His son Lucian did swear as he says; and in doing so, he swore what I will prove by his own affidavit to be a falsehood., Turn to Lucian's affidavit, and you will there see that Talbott called for the deed by which to correct an error on the record., Thus it appears that the error in question was on the record, and not in the deed., How then could Talbott open the deed and point out the error?, Where a thing is not, it cannot be pointed out., The error was not in the deed, and of course could not be pointed out there., This does not merely prove that the error could not be pointed out, as Lucian swore it was; but it proves, too, that the deed was not opened in his presence with a special view to the error, for if it had been, he could not have failed to see that there was no error in it., It is easy enough to see why Lucian swore this., His object was to prove that the assignment was not in the deed when Talbott got it: but it was discovered he could not swear this safely, without first swearing the deed was opened--and if he swore it was opened, he must show a motive for opening it, and the conclusion with him and his father was that the pointing out the error would appear the most plausible., For the purpose of showing that the assignment was not in the bundle when Talbott got it, is the story introduced into Lucian's affidavit that the deeds were counted., It is a remarkable fact, and one that should stand as a warning to all liars and fabricators, that in this short affidavit of Lucian's he only attempted to depart from the truth, so far as I have the means of knowing, in two points, to wit, in the opening the deed and pointing out the error and the counting of the deeds,--and in both of these he caught himself., About the counting, he caught himself thus--after saying the bundle contained five deeds and a lease, he proceeds, ""and I saw no other papers than the said deed and lease."", First he has six papers, and then he saw none but two; for ""my son Lucian's"" benefit, let a pin be stuck here., Adams again adduces the argument, that he could not have forged the assignment, for the reason that he could have had no motive for it., With those that know the facts there is no absence of motive., Admitting the paper which he has filed in the suit to be genuine, it is clear that it cannot answer the purpose for which he designs it., Hence his motive for making one that he supposed would answer is obvious., His making the date too old is also easily enough accounted for., The records were not in his hands, and then, there being some considerable talk upon this particular subject, he knew he could not examine the records to ascertain the precise dates without subjecting himself to suspicion; and hence he concluded to try it by guess, and, as it turned out, missed it a little., About Miller's deposition I have a word to say., In the first place, Miller's answer to the first question shows upon its face that he had been tampered with, and the answer dictated to him., He was asked if he knew Joel Wright and James Adams; and above three-fourths of his answer consists of what he knew about Joseph Anderson, a man about whom nothing had been asked, nor a word said in the question--a fact that can only be accounted for upon the supposition that Adams had secretly told him what he wished him to swear to., Another of Miller's answers I will prove both by common sense and the Court of Record is untrue., To one question he answers, ""Anderson brought a suit against me before James Adams, then an acting justice of the peace in Sangamon County, before whom he obtained a judgment., ""Q.--Did you remove the same by injunction to the Sangamon Circuit Court?, Ans.--I did remove it."", Now mark--it is said he removed it by injunction., The word ""injunction"" in common language imports a command that some person or thing shall not move or be removed; in law it has the same meaning., An injunction issuing out of chancery to a justice of the peace is a command to him to stop all proceedings in a named case until further orders., It is not an order to remove but to stop or stay something that is already moving., Besides this, the records of the Sangamon Circuit Court show that the judgment of which Miller swore was never removed into said Court by injunction or otherwise., I have now to take notice of a part of Adams's address which in the order of time should have been noticed before., It is in these words: ""I have now shown, in the opinion of two competent judges, that the handwriting of the forged assignment differed from mine, and by one of them that it could not be mistaken for mine."", That is false., Tinsley no doubt is the judge referred to; and by reference to his certificate it will be seen that he did not say the handwriting of the assignment could not be mistaken for Adams's--nor did he use any other expression substantially, or anything near substantially, the same., But if Tinsley had said the handwriting could not be mistaken for Adams's, it would have been equally unfortunate for Adams: for it then would have contradicted Keys, who says, ""I looked at the writing and judged it the said Adams's or a good imitation."", Adams speaks with much apparent confidence of his success on attending lawsuits, and the ultimate maintenance of his title to the land in question., Without wishing to disturb the pleasure of his dream, I would say to him that it is not impossible that he may yet be taught to sing a different song in relation to the matter., At the end of Miller's deposition, Adams asks, ""Will Mr. Lincoln now say that he is almost convinced my title to this ten acre tract of land is founded in fraud?"", I answer, I will not., I will now change the phraseology so as to make it run--I am quite convinced, &c. I cannot pass in silence Adams's assertion that he has proved that the forged assignment was not in the deed when it came from his house by Talbott, the recorder., In this, although Talbott has sworn that the assignment was in the bundle of deeds when it came from his house, Adams has the unaccountable assurance to say that he has proved the contrary by Talbott., Let him or his friends attempt to show wherein he proved any such thing by Talbott., In his publication of the 6th of September he hinted to Talbott, that he might be mistaken., In his present, speaking of Talbott and me he says ""They may have been imposed upon."", Can any man of the least penetration fail to see the object of this?, After he has stormed and raged till he hopes and imagines he has got us a little scared he wishes to softly whisper in our ears, ""If you'll quit I will."", If he could get us to say that some unknown, undefined being had slipped the assignment into our hands without our knowledge, not a doubt remains but that he would immediately discover that we were the purest men on earth., This is the ground he evidently wishes us to understand he is willing to compromise upon., But we ask no such charity at his hands., We are neither mistaken nor imposed upon., We have made the statements we have because we know them to be true and we choose to live or die by them., Esq., Carter, who is Adams's friend, personal and political, will recollect, that, on the 5th of this month, he (Adams), with a great affectation of modesty, declared that he would never introduce his own child as a witness., Notwithstanding this affectation of modesty, he has in his present publication introduced his child as witness; and as if to show with how much contempt he could treat his own declaration, he has had this same Esq., Carter to administer the oath to him., And so important a witness does he consider him, and so entirely does the whole of his entire present production depend upon the testimony of his child, that in it he has mentioned ""my son,"" ""my son Lucian,"" ""Lucian, my son,"" and the like expressions no less than fifteen different times., Let it be remembered here, that I have shown the affidavit of ""my darling son Lucian"" to be false by the evidence apparent on its own face; and I now ask if that affidavit be taken away what foundation will the fabric have left to stand upon?, General Adams's publications and out-door maneuvering, taken in connection with the editorial articles of the Republican, are not more foolish and contradictory than they are ludicrous and amusing., One week the Republican notifies the public that Gen. Adams is preparing an instrument that will tear, rend, split, rive, blow up, confound, overwhelm, annihilate, extinguish, exterminate, burst asunder, and grind to powder all its slanderers, and particularly Talbott and Lincoln--all of which is to be done in due time., Then for two or three weeks all is calm--not a word said., Again the Republican comes forth with a mere passing remark that ""public"" opinion has decided in favor of Gen. Adams, and intimates that he will give himself no more trouble about the matter., In the meantime Adams himself is prowling about and, as Burns says of the devil, ""For prey, and holes and corners tryin',"" and in one instance goes so far as to take an old acquaintance of mine several steps from a crowd and, apparently weighed down with the importance of his business, gravely and solemnly asks him if ""he ever heard Lincoln say he was a deist."", Anon the Republican comes again., ""We invite the attention of the public to General Adams's communication,"" &c. ""The victory is a great one, the triumph is overwhelming."", I really believe the editor of the Illinois Republican is fool enough to think General Adams leads off--""Authors most egregiously mistaken &c. Most woefully shall their presumption be punished,"" &c. (Lord have mercy on us.), ""The hour is yet to come, yea, nigh at hand--(how long first do you reckon?), --when the Journal and its junto shall say, I have appeared too early."", ""Their infamy shall be laid bare to the public gaze."", Suddenly the General appears to relent at the severity with which he is treating us and he exclaims: ""The condemnation of my enemies is the inevitable result of my own defense."", For your health's sake, dear Gen., do not permit your tenderness of heart to afflict you so much on our account., For some reason (perhaps because we are killed so quickly) we shall never be sensible of our suffering., Farewell, General., I will see you again at court if not before--when and where we will settle the question whether you or the widow shall have the land., Without apologizing for being egotistical, I shall make the history of so much of my life as has elapsed since I saw you the subject of this letter., And, by the way, I now discover that, in order to give a full and intelligible account of the things I have done and suffered since I saw you, I shall necessarily have to relate some that happened before., It was, then, in the autumn of 1836 that a married lady of my acquaintance, and who was a great friend of mine, being about to pay a visit to her father and other relatives residing in Kentucky, proposed to me that on her return she would bring a sister of hers with her on condition that I would engage to become her brother-in-law with all convenient despatch., ...]"|3
4|"[I protest against this assertion., I assert that we have again and again, during this discussion, urged facts and arguments against the subtreasury which they have neither dared to deny nor attempted to answer., But lest some may be led to believe that we really wish to avoid the question, I now propose, in my humble way, to urge those arguments again; at the same time begging the audience to mark well the positions I shall take and the proof I shall offer to sustain them, and that they will not again permit Mr. Douglas or his friends to escape the force of them by a round and groundless assertion that we ""dare not meet them in argument."", Of the subtreasury, then, as contrasted with a national bank for the before-enumerated purposes, I lay down the following propositions, to wit: (1) It will injuriously affect the community by its operation on the circulating medium., (2) It will be a more expensive fiscal agent., (3) It will be a less secure depository of the public money., To show the truth of the first proposition, let us take a short review of our condition under the operation of a national bank., It was the depository of the public revenues., Between the collection of those revenues and the disbursement of them by the government, the bank was permitted to and did actually loan them out to individuals, and hence the large amount of money actually collected for revenue purposes, which by any other plan would have been idle a great portion of the time, was kept almost constantly in circulation., Any person who will reflect that money is only valuable while in circulation will readily perceive that any device which will keep the government revenues in constant circulation, instead of being locked up in idleness, is no inconsiderable advantage., By the subtreasury the revenue is to be collected and kept in iron boxes until the government wants it for disbursement; thus robbing the people of the use of it, while the government does not itself need it, and while the money is performing no nobler office than that of rusting in iron boxes., The natural effect of this change of policy, every one will see, is to reduce the quantity of money in circulation., But, again, by the subtreasury scheme the revenue is to be collected in specie., I anticipate that this will be disputed., I expect to hear it said that it is not the policy of the administration to collect the revenue in specie., If it shall, I reply that Mr. Van Buren, in his message recommending the subtreasury, expended nearly a column of that document in an attempt to persuade Congress to provide for the collection of the revenue in specie exclusively; and he concludes with these words:  ""It may be safely assumed that no motive of convenience to the citizens requires the reception of bank paper."", In addition to this, Mr. Silas Wright, Senator from New York, and the political, personal and confidential friend of Mr. Van Buren, drafted and introduced into the Senate the first subtreasury bill, and that bill provided for ultimately collecting the revenue in specie., It is true, I know, that that clause was stricken from the bill, but it was done by the votes of the Whigs, aided by a portion only of the Van Buren senators., No subtreasury bill has yet become a law, though two or three have been considered by Congress, some with and some without the specie clause; so that I admit there is room for quibbling upon the question of whether the administration favor the exclusive specie doctrine or not; but I take it that the fact that the President at first urged the specie doctrine, and that under his recommendation the first bill introduced embraced it, warrants us in charging it as the policy of the party until their head as publicly recants it as he at first espoused it., I repeat, then, that by the subtreasury the revenue is to be collected in specie., Now mark what the effect of this must be., By all estimates ever made there are but between sixty and eighty millions of specie in the United States., The expenditures of the Government for the year 1838--the last for which we have had the report--were forty millions., Thus it is seen that if the whole revenue be collected in specie, it will take more than half of all the specie in the nation to do it., By this means more than half of all the specie belonging to the fifteen millions of souls who compose the whole population of the country is thrown into the hands of the public office-holders, and other public creditors comprising in number perhaps not more than one quarter of a million, leaving the other fourteen millions and three quarters to get along as they best can, with less than one half of the specie of the country, and whatever rags and shinplasters they may be able to put, and keep, in circulation., By this means, every office-holder and other public creditor may, and most likely will, set up shaver; and a most glorious harvest will the specie-men have of it,--each specie-man, upon a fair division, having to his share the fleecing of about fifty-nine rag-men., In all candor let me ask, was such a system for benefiting the few at the expense of the many ever before devised?, And was the sacred name of Democracy ever before made to indorse such an enormity against the rights of the people?, I have already said that the subtreasury will reduce the quantity of money in circulation., This position is strengthened by the recollection that the revenue is to be collected in Specie, so that the mere amount of revenue is not all that is withdrawn, but the amount of paper circulation that the forty millions would serve as a basis to is withdrawn, which would be in a sound state at least one hundred millions., When one hundred millions, or more, of the circulation we now have shall be withdrawn, who can contemplate without terror the distress, ruin, bankruptcy, and beggary that must follow?, The man who has purchased any article--say a horse--on credit, at one hundred dollars, when there are two hundred millions circulating in the country, if the quantity be reduced to one hundred millions by the arrival of pay-day, will find the horse but sufficient to pay half the debt; and the other half must either be paid out of his other means, and thereby become a clear loss to him, or go unpaid, and thereby become a clear loss to his creditor., What I have here said of a single case of the purchase of a horse will hold good in every case of a debt existing at the time a reduction in the quantity of money occurs, by whomsoever, and for whatsoever, it may have been contracted., It may be said that what the debtor loses the creditor gains by this operation; but on examination this will be found true only to a very limited extent., It is more generally true that all lose by it--the creditor by losing more of his debts than he gains by the increased value of those he collects; the debtor by either parting with more of his property to pay his debts than he received in contracting them, or by entirely breaking up his business, and thereby being thrown upon the world in idleness., The general distress thus created will, to be sure, be temporary, because, whatever change may occur in the quantity of money in any community, time will adjust the derangement produced; but while that adjustment is progressing, all suffer more or less, and very many lose everything that renders life desirable., Why, then, shall we suffer a severe difficulty, even though it be but temporary, unless we receive some equivalent for it?, What I have been saying as to the effect produced by a reduction of the quantity of money relates to the whole country., I now propose to show that it would produce a peculiar and permanent hardship upon the citizens of those States and Territories in which the public lands lie., The land-offices in those States and Territories, as all know, form the great gulf by which all, or nearly all, the money in them is swallowed up., When the quantity of money shall be reduced, and consequently everything under individual control brought down in proportion, the price of those lands, being fixed by law, will remain as now., Of necessity it will follow that the produce or labor that now raises money sufficient to purchase eighty acres will then raise but sufficient to purchase forty, or perhaps not that much; and this difficulty and hardship will last as long, in some degree, as any portion of these lands shall remain undisposed of., Knowing, as I well do, the difficulty that poor people now encounter in procuring homes, I hesitate not to say that when the price of the public lands shall be doubled or trebled, or, which is the same thing, produce and labor cut down to one half or one third of their present prices, it will be little less than impossible for them to procure those homes at all....  Well, then, what did become of him?, (Postmaster General Barry) Why, the President immediately expressed his high disapprobation of his almost unequaled incapacity and corruption by appointing him to a foreign mission, with a salary and outfit of $18,000 a year!, The party now attempt to throw Barry off, and to avoid the responsibility of his sins., Did not the President indorse those sins when, on the very heel of their commission, he appointed their author to the very highest and most honorable office in his gift, and which is but a single step behind the very goal of American political ambition?, I return to another of Mr. Douglas's excuses for the expenditures of 1838, at the same time announcing the pleasing intelligence that this is the last one., He says that ten millions of that year's expenditure was a contingent appropriation, to prosecute an anticipated war with Great Britain on the Maine boundary question., Few words will settle this., First, that the ten millions appropriated was not made till 1839, and consequently could not have been expended in 1838; second, although it was appropriated, it has never been expended at all., Those who heard Mr. Douglas recollect that he indulged himself in a contemptuous expression of pity for me., ""Now he's got me,"" thought I., But when he went on to say that five millions of the expenditure of 1838 were payments of the French indemnities, which I knew to be untrue; that five millions had been for the post-office, which I knew to be untrue; that ten millions had been for the Maine boundary war, which I not only knew to be untrue, but supremely ridiculous also; and when I saw that he was stupid enough to hope that I would permit such groundless and audacious assertions to go unexposed,--I readily consented that, on the score both of veracity and sagacity, the audience should judge whether he or I were the more deserving of the world's contempt., Mr. Lamborn insists that the difference between the Van Buren party and the Whigs is that, although the former sometimes err in practice, they are always correct in principle, whereas the latter are wrong in principle; and, better to impress this proposition, he uses a figurative expression in these words: ""The Democrats are vulnerable in the heel, but they are sound in the head and the heart."", The first branch of the figure--that is, that the Democrats are vulnerable in the heel--I admit is not merely figuratively, but literally true., Who that looks but for a moment at their Swartwouts, their Prices, their Harringtons, and their hundreds of others, scampering away with the public money to Texas, to Europe, and to every spot of the earth where a villain may hope to find refuge from justice, can at all doubt that they are most distressingly affected in their heels with a species of ""running itch""?, It seems that this malady of their heels operates on these sound-headed and honest-hearted creatures very much like the cork leg in the comic song did on its owner: which, when he had once got started on it, the more he tried to stop it, the more it would run away., At the hazard of wearing this point threadbare, I will relate an anecdote which seems too strikingly in point to be omitted., A witty Irish soldier, who was always boasting of his bravery when no danger was near, but who invariably retreated without orders at the first charge of an engagement, being asked by his captain why he did so, replied: ""Captain, I have as brave a heart as Julius Caesar ever had; but, somehow or other, whenever danger approaches, my cowardly legs will run away with it."", So with Mr. Lamborn's party., They take the public money into their hand for the most laudable purpose that wise heads and honest hearts can dictate; but before they can possibly get it out again, their rascally ""vulnerable heels"" will run away with them., Seriously this proposition of Mr. Lamborn is nothing more or less than a request that his party may be tried by their professions instead of their practices., Perhaps no position that the party assumes is more liable to or more deserving of exposure than this very modest request; and nothing but the unwarrantable length to which I have already extended these remarks forbids me now attempting to expose it., For the reason given, I pass it by., I shall advert to but one more point., Mr. Lamborn refers to the late elections in the States, and from their results confidently predicts that every State in the Union will vote for Mr. Van Buren at the next Presidential election., Address that argument to cowards and to knaves; with the free and the brave it will effect nothing., It may be true; if it must, let it., Many free countries have lost their liberty, and ours may lose hers; but if she shall, be it my proudest plume, not that I was the last to desert, but that I never deserted her., I know that the great volcano at Washington, aroused and directed by the evil spirit that reigns there, is belching forth the lava of political corruption in a current broad and deep, which is sweeping with frightful velocity over the whole length and breadth of the land, bidding fair to leave unscathed no green spot or living thing; while on its bosom are riding, like demons on the waves of hell, the imps of that evil spirit, and fiendishly taunting all those who dare resist its destroying course with the hopelessness of their effort; and, knowing this, I cannot deny that all may be swept away., Broken by it I, too, may be; bow to it I never will., The probability that we may fall in the struggle ought not to deter us from the support of a cause we believe to be just; it shall not deter me., If ever I feel the soul within me elevate and expand to those dimensions not wholly unworthy of its almighty Architect, it is when I contemplate the cause of my country deserted by all the world beside, and I standing up boldly and alone, and hurling defiance at her victorious oppressors., Here, without contemplating consequences, before high heaven and in the face of the world, I swear eternal fidelity to the just cause, as I deem it, of the land of my life, my liberty, and my love., And who that thinks with me will not fearlessly adopt the oath that I take?, Let none falter who thinks he is right, and we may succeed., But if, after all, we shall fail, be it so., We still shall have the proud consolation of saying to our consciences, and to the departed shade of our country's freedom, that the cause approved of our judgment, and adored of our hearts, in disaster, in chains, in torture, in death, we never faltered in defending., Dr. Henry will write you all the political news., I write this about some little matters of business., You recollect you told me you had drawn the Chicago Masark money, and sent it to the claimants., A hawk-billed Yankee is here besetting me at every turn I take, saying that Robert Kinzie never received the eighty dollars to which he was entitled., Can you tell me anything about the matter?, Again, old Mr. Wright, who lives up South Fork somewhere, is teasing me continually about some deeds which he says he left with you, but which I can find nothing of., Can you tell me where they are?, The Legislature is in session and has suffered the bank to forfeit its charter without benefit of clergy., There seems to be little disposition to resuscitate it., Whenever a letter comes from you to Mrs.____________ I carry it to her, and then I see Betty; she is a tolerable nice ""fellow"" now., Maybe I will write again when I get more time., Your friend as ever, A. LINCOLN  P. S.--The Democratic giant is here, but he is not much worth talking about., A.L., In obedience to a resolution of the Whig State convention, we have appointed you the Central Whig Committee of your county., The trust confided to you will be one of watchfulness and labor; but we hope the glory of having contributed to the overthrow of the corrupt powers that now control our beloved country will be a sufficient reward for the time and labor you will devote to it., Our Whig brethren throughout the Union have met in convention, and after due deliberation and mutual concessions have elected candidates for the Presidency and Vice-Presidency not only worthy of our cause, but worthy of the support of every true patriot who would have our country redeemed, and her institutions honestly and faithfully administered., To overthrow the trained bands that are opposed to us whose salaried officers are ever on the watch, and whose misguided followers are ever ready to obey their smallest commands, every Whig must not only know his duty, but must firmly resolve, whatever of time and labor it may cost, boldly and faithfully to do it., Our intention is to organize the whole State, so that every Whig can be brought to the polls in the coming Presidential contest., We cannot do this, however, without your co-operation; and as we do our duty, so we shall expect you to do yours., After due deliberation, the following is the plan of organization, and the duties required of each county committee:  To divide their county into small districts, and to appoint in each a subcommittee, whose duty it shall be to make a perfect list of all the voters in their respective districts, and to ascertain with certainty for whom they will vote., If they meet with men who are doubtful as to the man they will support, such voters should be designated in separate lines, with the name of the man they will probably support., It will be the duty of said subcommittee to keep a constant watch on the doubtful voters, and from time to time have them talked to by those in whom they have the most confidence, and also to place in their hands such documents as will enlighten and influence them., ...]"|3
5|"[When the General Assembly, now about adjourning, assembled in November last, from the bankrupt state of the public treasury, the pecuniary embarrassments prevailing in every department of society, the dilapidated state of the public works, and the impending danger of the degradation of the State, you had a right to expect that your representatives would lose no time in devising and adopting measures to avert threatened calamities, alleviate the distresses of the people, and allay the fearful apprehensions in regard to the future prosperity of the State., It was not expected by you that the spirit of party would take the lead in the councils of the State, and make every interest bend to its demands., Nor was it expected that any party would assume to itself the entire control of legislation, and convert the means and offices of the State, and the substance of the people, into aliment for party subsistence., Neither could it have been expected by you that party spirit, however strong its desires and unreasonable its demands, would have passed the sanctuary of the Constitution, and entered with its unhallowed and hideous form into the formation of the judiciary system., At the early period of the session, measures were adopted by the dominant party to take possession of the State, to fill all public offices with party men, and make every measure affecting the interests of the people and the credit of the State operate in furtherance of their party views., The merits of men and measures therefore became the subject of discussion in caucus, instead of the halls of legislation, and decisions there made by a minority of the Legislature have been executed and carried into effect by the force of party discipline, without any regard whatever to the rights of the people or the interests of the State., The Supreme Court of the State was organized, and judges appointed, according to the provisions of the Constitution, in 1824., The people have never complained of the organization of that court; no attempt has ever before been made to change that department., Respect for public opinion, and regard for the rights and liberties of the people, have hitherto restrained the spirit of party from attacks upon the independence and integrity of the judiciary., The same judges have continued in office since 1824; their decisions have not been the subject of complaint among the people; the integrity and honesty of the court have not been questioned, and it has never been supposed that the court has ever permitted party prejudice or party considerations to operate upon their decisions., The court was made to consist of four judges, and by the Constitution two form a quorum for the transaction of business., With this tribunal, thus constituted, the people have been satisfied for near sixteen years., The same law which organized the Supreme Court in 1824 also established and organized circuit courts to be held in each county in the State, and five circuit judges were appointed to hold those courts., In 1826 the Legislature abolished these circuit courts, repealed the judges out of office, and required the judges of the Supreme Court to hold the circuit courts., The reasons assigned for this change were, first, that the business of the country could be better attended to by the four judges of the Supreme Court than by the two sets of judges; and, second, the state of the public treasury forbade the employment of unnecessary officers., In 1828 a circuit was established north of the Illinois River, in order to meet the wants of the people, and a circuit judge was appointed to hold the courts in that circuit., In 1834 the circuit-court system was again established throughout the State, circuit judges appointed to hold the courts, and the judges of the Supreme Court were relieved from the performance of circuit court duties., The change was recommended by the then acting governor of the State, General W. L. D. Ewing, in the following terms:  ""The augmented population of the State, the multiplied number of organized counties, as well as the increase of business in all, has long since convinced every one conversant with this department of our government of the indispensable necessity of an alteration in our judiciary system, and the subject is therefore recommended to the earnest patriotic consideration of the Legislature., The present system has never been exempt from serious and weighty objections., The idea of appealing from the circuit court to the same judges in the Supreme Court is recommended by little hopes of redress to the injured party below., The duties of the circuit, too, it may be added, consume one half of the year, leaving a small and inadequate portion of time (when that required for domestic purposes is deducted) to erect, in the decisions of the Supreme Court, a judicial monument of legal learning and research, which the talent and ability of the court might otherwise be entirely competent to."", With this organization of circuit courts the people have never complained., The only complaints which we have heard have come from circuits which were so large that the judges could not dispose of the business, and the circuits in which Judges Pearson and Ralston lately presided., Whilst the honor and credit of the State demanded legislation upon the subject of the public debt, the canal, the unfinished public works, and the embarrassments of the people, the judiciary stood upon a basis which required no change--no legislative action., Yet the party in power, neglecting every interest requiring legislative action, and wholly disregarding the rights, wishes, and interests of the people, has, for the unholy purpose of providing places for its partisans and supplying them with large salaries, disorganized that department of the government., Provision is made for the election of five party judges of the Supreme Court, the proscription of four circuit judges, and the appointment of party clerks in more than half the counties of the State., Men professing respect for public opinion, and acknowledged to be leaders of the party, have avowed in the halls of legislation that the change in the judiciary was intended to produce political results favorable to their party and party friends., The immutable principles of justice are to make way for party interests, and the bonds of social order are to be rent in twain, in order that a desperate faction may be sustained at the expense of the people., The change proposed in the judiciary was supported upon grounds so destructive to the institutions of the country, and so entirely at war with the rights and liberties of the people, that the party could not secure entire unanimity in its support, three Democrats of the Senate and five of the House voting against the measure., They were unwilling to see the temples of justice and the seats of independent judges occupied by the tools of faction., The declarations of the party leaders, the selection of party men for judges, and the total disregard for the public will in the adoption of the measure, prove conclusively that the object has been not reform, but destruction; not the advancement of the highest interests of the State, but the predominance of party., We cannot in this manner undertake to point out all the objections to this party measure; we present you with those stated by the Council of Revision upon returning the bill, and we ask for them a candid consideration., Believing that the independence of the judiciary has been destroyed, that hereafter our courts will be independent of the people, and entirely dependent upon the Legislature; that our rights of property and liberty of conscience can no longer be regarded as safe from the encroachments of unconstitutional legislation; and knowing of no other remedy which can be adopted consistently with the peace and good order of society, we call upon you to avail yourselves of the opportunity afforded, and, at the next general election, vote for a convention of the people., For the reasons thus presented, and for others no less apparent, the undersigned cannot assent to the passage of the bill, or permit it to become a law, without this evidence of their disapprobation; and they now protest against the reorganization of the judiciary, because--(1) It violates the great principles of free government by subjecting the judiciary to the Legislature., (2) It is a fatal blow at the independence of the judges and the constitutional term of their office., (3) It is a measure not asked for, or wished for, by the people., (4) It will greatly increase the expense of our courts, or else greatly diminish their utility., (5) It will give our courts a political and partisan character, thereby impairing public confidence in their decisions., (6) It will impair our standing with other States and the world., (7)It is a party measure for party purposes, from which no practical good to the people can possibly arise, but which may be the source of immeasurable evils., The undersigned are well aware that this protest will be altogether unavailing with the majority of this body., The blow has already fallen, and we are compelled to stand by, the mournful spectators of the ruin it will cause., We have had the highest state of excitement here for a week past that our community has ever witnessed; and, although the public feeling is somewhat allayed, the curious affair which aroused it is very far from being even yet cleared of mystery., It would take a quire of paper to give you anything like a full account of it, and I therefore only propose a brief outline., The chief personages in the drama are Archibald Fisher, supposed to be murdered, and Archibald Trailor, Henry Trailor, and William Trailor, supposed to have murdered him., The three Trailors are brothers: the first, Arch., as you know, lives in town; the second, Henry, in Clary's Grove; and the third, William, in Warren County; and Fisher, the supposed murdered, being without a family, had made his home with William., On Saturday evening, being the 29th of May, Fisher and William came to Henry's in a one-horse dearborn, and there stayed over Sunday; and on Monday all three came to Springfield (Henry on horseback) and joined Archibald at Myers's, the Dutch carpenter., That evening at supper Fisher was missing, and so next morning some ineffectual search was made for him; and on Tuesday, at one o'clock P.M., William and Henry started home without him., In a day or two Henry and one or two of his Clary-Grove neighbors came back for him again, and advertised his disappearance in the papers., The knowledge of the matter thus far had not been general, and here it dropped entirely, till about the 10th instant, when Keys received a letter from the postmaster in Warren County, that William had arrived at home, and was telling a very mysterious and improbable story about the disappearance of Fisher, which induced the community there to suppose he had been disposed of unfairly., Keys made this letter public, which immediately set the whole town and adjoining county agog., And so it has continued until yesterday., The mass of the people commenced a systematic search for the dead body, while Wickersham was despatched to arrest Henry Trailor at the Grove, and Jim Maxcy to Warren to arrest William., On Monday last, Henry was brought in, and showed an evident inclination to insinuate that he knew Fisher to be dead, and that Arch., and William had killed him., He said he guessed the body could be found in Spring Creek, between the Beardstown road and Hickox's mill., Away the people swept like a herd of buffalo, and cut down Hickox's mill-dam nolens volens, to draw the water out of the pond, and then went up and down and down and up the creek, fishing and raking, and raking and ducking and diving for two days, and, after all, no dead body found., In the meantime a sort of scuffling-ground had been found in the brush in the angle, or point, where the road leading into the woods past the brewery and the one leading in past the brick-yard meet., From the scuffle-ground was the sign of something about the size of a man having been dragged to the edge of the thicket, where it joined the track of some small-wheeled carriage drawn by one horse, as shown by the road-tracks., The carriage-track led off toward Spring Creek., Near this drag-trail Dr. Merryman found two hairs, which, after a long scientific examination, he pronounced to be triangular human hairs, which term, he says, includes within it the whiskers, the hair growing under the arms and on other parts of the body; and he judged that these two were of the whiskers, because the ends were cut, showing that they had flourished in the neighborhood of the razor's operations., On Thursday last Jim Maxcy brought in William Trailor from Warren., On the same day Arch., was arrested and put in jail., Yesterday (Friday) William was put upon his examining trial before May and Lovely., Archibald and Henry were both present., Lamborn prosecuted, and Logan, Baker, and your humble servant defended., A great many witnesses were introduced and examined, but I shall only mention those whose testimony seemed most important., The first of these was Captain Ransdell., He swore that when William and Henry left Springfield for home on Tuesday before mentioned they did not take the direct route,--which, you know, leads by the butcher shop,--but that they followed the street north until they got opposite, or nearly opposite, May's new house, after which he could not see them from where he stood; and it was afterwards proved that in about an hour after they started, they came into the street by the butcher shop from toward the brickyard., Dr. Merryman and others swore to what is stated about the scuffle-ground, drag-trail, whiskers, and carriage tracks., Henry was then introduced by the prosecution., He swore that when they started for home they went out north, as Ransdell stated, and turned down west by the brick-yard into the woods, and there met Archibald; that they proceeded a small distance farther, when he was placed as a sentinel to watch for and announce the approach of any one that might happen that way; that William and Arch., took the dearborn out of the road a small distance to the edge of the thicket, where they stopped, and he saw them lift the body of a man into it; that they then moved off with the carriage in the direction of Hickox's mill, and he loitered about for something like an hour, when William returned with the carriage, but without Arch., and said they had put him in a safe place; that they went somehow he did not know exactly how--into the road close to the brewery, and proceeded on to Clary's Grove., He also stated that some time during the day William told him that he and Arch., had killed Fisher the evening before; that the way they did it was by him William knocking him down with a club, and Arch., then choking him to death., An old man from Warren, called Dr. Gilmore, was then introduced on the part of the defense., He swore that he had known Fisher for several years; that Fisher had resided at his house a long time at each of two different spells--once while he built a barn for him, and once while he was doctored for some chronic disease; that two or three years ago Fisher had a serious hurt in his head by the bursting of a gun, since which he had been subject to continued bad health and occasional aberration of mind., He also stated that on last Tuesday, being the same day that Maxcy arrested William Trailor, he (the doctor) was from home in the early part of the day, and on his return, about eleven o'clock, found Fisher at his house in bed, and apparently very unwell; that he asked him how he came from Springfield; that Fisher said he had come by Peoria, and also told of several other places he had been at more in the direction of Peoria, which showed that he at the time of speaking did not know where he had been wandering about in a state of derangement., He further stated that in about two hours he received a note from one of Trailor's friends, advising him of his arrest, and requesting him to go on to Springfield as a witness, to testify as to the state of Fisher's health in former times; that he immediately set off, calling up two of his neighbors as company, and, riding all evening and all night, overtook Maxcy and William at Lewiston in Fulton County; that Maxcy refusing to discharge Trailor upon his statement, his two neighbors returned and he came on to Springfield., Some question being made as to whether the doctor's story was not a fabrication, several acquaintances of his (among whom was the same postmaster who wrote Keys, as before mentioned) were introduced as sort of compurgators, who swore that they knew the doctor to be of good character for truth and veracity, and generally of good character in every way., Here the testimony ended, and the Trailors were discharged, Arch., and William expressing both in word and manner their entire confidence that Fisher would be found alive at the doctor's by Galloway, Mallory, and Myers, who a day before had been despatched for that purpose; which Henry still protested that no power on earth could ever show Fisher alive., Thus stands this curious affair., When the doctor's story was first made public, it was amusing to scan and contemplate the countenances and hear the remarks of those who had been actively in search for the dead body: some looked quizzical, some melancholy, and some furiously angry., Porter, who had been very active, swore he always knew the man was not dead, and that he had not stirred an inch to hunt for him; Langford, who had taken the lead in cutting down Hickox's mill-dam, and wanted to hang Hickox for objecting, looked most awfully woebegone: he seemed the ""victim of unrequited affection,"" as represented in the comic almanacs we used to laugh over; and Hart, the little drayman that hauled Molly home once, said it was too damned bad to have so much trouble, and no hanging after all., I commenced this letter on yesterday, since which I received yours of the 13th., I stick to my promise to come to Louisville., Nothing new here except what I have written., I have not seen ______ since my last trip, and I am going out there as soon as I mail this letter., It having been charged in some of the public prints that Harry Wilton, late United States marshal for the district of Illinois, had used his office for political effect, in the appointment of deputies for the taking of the census for the year 1840, we, the undersigned, were called upon by Mr. Wilton to examine the papers in his possession relative to these appointments, and to ascertain therefrom the correctness or incorrectness of such charge., We accompanied Mr. Wilton to a room, and examined the matter as fully as we could with the means afforded us., The only sources of information bearing on the subject which were submitted to us were the letters, etc., recommending and opposing the various appointments made, and Mr. Wilton's verbal statements concerning the same., From these letters, etc., it appears that in some instances appointments were made in accordance with the recommendations of leading Whigs, and in opposition to those of leading Democrats; among which instances the appointments at Scott, Wayne, Madison, and Lawrence are the strongest., According to Mr. Wilton's statement of the seventy-six appointments we examined, fifty-four were of Democrats, eleven of Whigs, and eleven of unknown politics., The chief ground of complaint against Mr. Wilton, as we had understood it, was because of his appointment of so many Democratic candidates for the Legislature, thus giving them a decided advantage over their Whig opponents; and consequently our attention was directed rather particularly to that point., We found that there were many such appointments, among which were those in Tazewell, McLean, Iroquois, Coles, Menard, Wayne, Washington, Fayette, etc., ; and we did not learn that there was one instance in which a Whig candidate for the Legislature had been appointed., There was no written evidence before us showing us at what time those appointments were made; but Mr. Wilton stated that they all with one exception were made before those appointed became candidates for the Legislature, and the letters, etc., recommending them all bear date before, and most of them long before, those appointed were publicly announced candidates., ...]"|3

LINCOLN., P.

nor is it material, as the business can be done in our names., Thinking it may aid you a little, I send you one of our blank forms of Petitions., It, you will see, is framed to be sworn to before the Federal court clerk, and, in your cases, will have [to] be so far changed as to be sworn to before the clerk of your circuit court; and his certificate must be accompanied with his official seal., The schedules, too, must be attended to., Be sure that they contain the creditors' names, their residences, the amounts due each, the debtors' names, their residences, and the amounts they owe, also all property and where located., Also be sure that the schedules are all signed by the applicants as well as the Petition., Publication will have to be made here in one paper, and in one nearest the residence of the applicant., Write us in each case where the last advertisement is to be sent, whether to you or to what paper., I believe I have now said everything that can be of any advantage., Your friend as ever  I never encourage deceit, and falsehood, especially if you have got a bad memory, is the worst enemy a fellow can have., The fact is truth is your truest friend, no matter what the circumstances are., Notwithstanding this copy-book preamble, my boy, I am inclined to suggest a little prudence on your part., You see I have a congenital aversion to failure, and the sudden announcement to your Uncle Andrew of the success of your ""lamp rubbing"" might possibly prevent your passing the severe physical examination to which you will be subjected in order to enter the Military Academy., You see I should like to have a perfect soldier credited to dear old Illinois--no broken bones, scalp wounds, etc., So I think it might be wise to hand this letter from me in to your good uncle through his room-window after he has had a comfortable dinner, and watch its effect from the top of the pigeon-house., I have just told the folks here in Springfield on this 111th anniversary of the birth of him whose name, mightiest in the cause of civil liberty, still mightiest in the cause of moral reformation, we mention in solemn awe, in naked, deathless splendor, that the one victory we can ever call complete will be that one which proclaims that there is not one slave or one drunkard on the face of God's green earth., Recruit for this victory., Now, boy, on your march, don't you go and forget the old maxim that ""one drop of honey catches more flies than a half-gallon of gall."", Load your musket with this maxim, and smoke it in your pipe., Although the temperance cause has been in progress for near twenty years, it is apparent to all that it is just now being crowned with a degree of success hitherto unparalleled., The list of its friends is daily swelled by the additions of fifties, of hundreds, and of thousands., The cause itself seems suddenly transformed from a cold abstract theory to a living, breathing, active, and powerful chieftain, going forth ""conquering and to conquer."", The citadels of his great adversary are daily being stormed and dismantled; his temple and his altars, where the rites of his idolatrous worship have long been performed, and where human sacrifices have long been wont to be made, are daily desecrated and deserted., The triumph of the conqueror's fame is sounding from hill to hill, from sea to sea, and from land to land, and calling millions to his standard at a blast., For this new and splendid success we heartily rejoice., That that success is so much greater now than heretofore is doubtless owing to rational causes; and if we would have it continue, we shall do well to inquire what those causes are., The warfare heretofore waged against the demon intemperance has somehow or other been erroneous., Either the champions engaged or the tactics they adopted have not been the most proper., These champions for the most part have been preachers, lawyers, and hired agents., Between these and the mass of mankind there is a want of approachability, if the term be admissible, partially, at least, fatal to their success., They are supposed to have no sympathy of feeling or interest with those very persons whom it is their object to convince and persuade., And again, it is so common and so easy to ascribe motives to men of these classes other than those they profess to act upon., The preacher, it is said, advocates temperance because he is a fanatic, and desires a union of the Church and State; the lawyer from his pride and vanity of hearing himself speak; and the hired agent for his salary., But when one who has long been known as a victim of intemperance bursts the fetters that have bound him, and appears before his neighbors ""clothed and in his right mind,"" a redeemed specimen of long-lost humanity, and stands up, with tears of joy trembling in his eyes, to tell of the miseries once endured, now to be endured no more forever; of his once naked and starving children, now clad and fed comfortably; of a wife long weighed down with woe, weeping, and a broken heart, now restored to health, happiness, and a renewed affection; and how easily it is all done, once it is resolved to be done; how simple his language!, there is a logic and an eloquence in it that few with human feelings can resist., They cannot say that he desires a union of Church and State, for he is not a church member; they cannot say he is vain of hearing himself speak, for his whole demeanor shows he would gladly avoid speaking at all; they cannot say he speaks for pay, for he receives none, and asks for none., Nor can his sincerity in any way be doubted, or his sympathy for those he would persuade to imitate his example be denied., In my judgment, it is to the battles of this new class of champions that our late success is greatly, perhaps chiefly, owing., But, had the old-school champions themselves been of the most wise selecting, was their system of tactics the most judicious?, It seems to me it was not., Too much denunciation against dram-sellers and dram-drinkers was indulged in., This I think was both impolitic and unjust., It was impolitic, because it is not much in the nature of man to be driven to anything; still less to be driven about that which is exclusively his own business; and least of all where such driving is to be submitted to at the expense of pecuniary interest or burning appetite., When the dram-seller and drinker were incessantly told not in accents of entreaty and persuasion, diffidently addressed by erring man to an erring brother, but in the thundering tones of anathema and denunciation with which the lordly judge often groups together all the crimes of the felon's life, and thrusts them in his face just ere he passes sentence of death upon him that they were the authors of all the vice and misery and crime in the land; that they were the manufacturers and material of all the thieves and robbers and murderers that infest the earth; that their houses were the workshops of the devil; and that their persons should be shunned by all the good and virtuous, as moral pestilences--I say, when they were told all this, and in this way, it is not wonderful that they were slow to acknowledge the truth of such denunciations, and to join the ranks of their denouncers in a hue and cry against themselves., To have expected them to do otherwise than they did to have expected them not to meet denunciation with denunciation, crimination with crimination, and anathema with anathema--was to expect a reversal of human nature, which is God's decree and can never be reversed., When the conduct of men is designed to be influenced, persuasion, kind, unassuming persuasion, should ever be adopted., It is an old and a true maxim that ""a drop of honey catches more flies than a gallon of gall."", So with men., If you would win a man to your cause, first convince him that you are his sincere friend., Therein is a drop of honey that catches his heart, which, say what he will, is the great highroad to his reason; and which, when once gained, you will find but little trouble in convincing his judgment of the justice of your cause, if indeed that cause really be a just one., On the contrary, assume to dictate to his judgment, or to command his action, or to mark him as one to be shunned and despised, and he will retreat within himself, close all the avenues to his head and his heart; and though your cause be naked truth itself, transformed to the heaviest lance, harder than steel, and sharper than steel can be made, and though you throw it with more than herculean force and precision, you shall be no more able to pierce him than to penetrate the hard shell of a tortoise with a rye straw., Such is man, and so must he be understood by those who would lead him, even to his own best interests., On this point the Washingtonians greatly excel the temperance advocates of former times., Those whom they desire to convince and persuade are their old friends and companions., They know they are not demons, nor even the worst of men; they know that generally they are kind, generous, and charitable even beyond the example of their more staid and sober neighbors., They are practical philanthropists; and they glow with a generous and brotherly zeal that mere theorizers are incapable of feeling., Benevolence and charity possess their hearts entirely; and out of the abundance of their hearts their tongues give utterance; ""love through all their actions runs, and all their words are mild."", In this spirit they speak and act, and in the same they are heard and regarded., And when such is the temper of the advocate, and such of the audience, no good cause can be unsuccessful., But I have said that denunciations against dramsellers and dram-drinkers are unjust, as well as impolitic., Let us see., I have not inquired at what period of time the use of intoxicating liquors commenced; nor is it important to know., It is sufficient that, to all of us who now inhabit the world, the practice of drinking them is just as old as the world itself that is, we have seen the one just as long as we have seen the other., When all such of us as have now reached the years of maturity first opened our eyes upon the stage of existence, we found intoxicating liquor recognized by everybody, used by everybody, repudiated by nobody., It commonly entered into the first draught of the infant and the last draught of the dying man., From the sideboard of the parson down to the ragged pocket of the houseless loafer, it was constantly found., Physicians proscribed it in this, that, and the other disease; government provided it for soldiers and sailors; and to have a rolling or raising, a husking or ""hoedown,"" anywhere about without it was positively insufferable., So, too, it was everywhere a respectable article of manufacture and merchandise., The making of it was regarded as an honorable livelihood, and he who could make most was the most enterprising and respectable., Large and small manufactories of it were everywhere erected, in which all the earthly goods of their owners were invested., Wagons drew it from town to town; boats bore it from clime to clime, and the winds wafted it from nation to nation; and merchants bought and sold it, by wholesale and retail, with precisely the same feelings on the part of the seller, buyer, and bystander as are felt at the selling and buying of ploughs, beef, bacon, or any other of the real necessaries of life., Universal public opinion not only tolerated but recognized and adopted its use., It is true that even then it was known and acknowledged that many were greatly injured by it; but none seemed to think the injury arose from the use of a bad thing, but from the abuse of a very good thing., The victims of it were to be pitied and compassionated, just as are the heirs of consumption and other hereditary diseases., Their failing was treated as a misfortune, and not as a crime, or even as a disgrace., If, then, what I have been saying is true, is it wonderful that some should think and act now as all thought and acted twenty years ago?, and is it just to assail, condemn, or despise them for doing so?, The universal sense of mankind on any subject is an argument, or at least an influence, not easily overcome., The success of the argument in favor of the existence of an overruling Providence mainly depends upon that sense; and men ought not in justice to be denounced for yielding to it in any case, or giving it up slowly, especially when they are backed by interest, fixed habits, or burning appetites., Another error, as it seems to me, into which the old reformers fell, was the position that all habitual drunkards were utterly incorrigible, and therefore must be turned adrift and damned without remedy in order that the grace of temperance might abound, to the temperate then, and to all mankind some hundreds of years thereafter., There is in this some thing so repugnant to humanity, so uncharitable, so cold-blooded and feelingless, that it, never did nor ever can enlist the enthusiasm of a popular cause., We could not love the man who taught it we could not hear him with patience., The heart could not throw open its portals to it, the generous man could not adopt it--it could not mix with his blood., It looked so fiendishly selfish, so like throwing fathers and brothers overboard to lighten the boat for our security, that the noble-minded shrank from the manifest meanness of the thing., ...]"|3
7|"[Reign of reason, all hail!, And when the victory shall be complete, when there shall be neither a slave nor a drunkard on the earth, how proud the title of that land which may truly claim to be the birthplace and the cradle of both those revolutions that shall have ended in that victory., How nobly distinguished that people who shall have planted and nurtured to maturity both the political and moral freedom of their species., This is the one hundred and tenth anniversary of the birthday of Washington; we are met to celebrate this day., Washington is the mightiest name of earth long since mightiest in the cause of civil liberty, still mightiest in moral reformation., On that name no eulogy is expected., It cannot be., To add brightness to the sun or glory to the name of Washington is alike impossible., Let none attempt it., In solemn awe pronounce the name, and in its naked deathless splendor leave it shining on., DEAR SPEED:--Yours of the 16th instant, announcing that Miss Fanny and you are ""no more twain, but one flesh,"" reached me this morning., I have no way of telling you how much happiness I wish you both, though I believe you both can conceive it., I feel somewhat jealous of both of you now: you will be so exclusively concerned for one another, that I shall be forgotten entirely., My acquaintance with Miss Fanny (I call her this, lest you should think I am speaking of your mother) was too short for me to reasonably hope to long be remembered by her; and still I am sure I shall not forget her soon., Try if you cannot remind her of that debt she owes me--and be sure you do not interfere to prevent her paying it., I regret to learn that you have resolved to not return to Illinois., I shall be very lonesome without you., How miserably things seem to be arranged in this world!, If we have no friends, we have no pleasure; and if we have them, we are sure to lose them, and be doubly pained by the loss., I did hope she and you would make your home here; but I own I have no right to insist., You owe obligations to her ten thousand times more sacred than you can owe to others, and in that light let them be respected and observed., It is natural that she should desire to remain with her relatives and friends., As to friends, however, she could not need them anywhere: she would have them in abundance here., Give my kind remembrance to Mr. Williamson and his family, particularly Miss Elizabeth; also to your mother, brother, and sisters., Ask little Eliza Davis if she will ride to town with me if I come there again., And finally, give Fanny a double reciprocation of all the love she sent me., Write me often, and believe me  P. S. Poor Easthouse is gone at last., He died awhile before day this morning., They say he was very loath to die...., I received yours of the 12th written the day you went down to William's place, some days since, but delayed answering it till I should receive the promised one of the 16th, which came last night., I opened the letter with intense anxiety and trepidation; so much so, that, although it turned out better than I expected, I have hardly yet, at a distance of ten hours, become calm., I tell you, Speed, our forebodings (for which you and I are peculiar) are all the worst sort of nonsense., I fancied, from the time I received your letter of Saturday, that the one of Wednesday was never to come, and yet it did come, and what is more, it is perfectly clear, both from its tone and handwriting, that you were much happier, or, if you think the term preferable, less miserable, when you wrote it than when you wrote the last one before., You had so obviously improved at the very time I so much fancied you would have grown worse., You say that something indescribably horrible and alarming still haunts you., You will not say that three months from now, I will venture., When your nerves once get steady now, the whole trouble will be over forever., Nor should you become impatient at their being even very slow in becoming steady., Again you say, you much fear that that Elysium of which you have dreamed so much is never to be realized., Well, if it shall not, I dare swear it will not be the fault of her who is now your wife., I now have no doubt that it is the peculiar misfortune of both you and me to dream dreams of Elysium far exceeding all that anything earthly can realize., Far short of your dreams as you may be, no woman could do more to realize them than that same black-eyed Fanny., If you could but contemplate her through my imagination, it would appear ridiculous to you that any one should for a moment think of being unhappy with her., My old father used to have a saying that ""If you make a bad bargain, hug it all the tighter""; and it occurs to me that if the bargain you have just closed can possibly be called a bad one, it is certainly the most pleasant one for applying that maxim to which my fancy can by any effort picture., I write another letter, enclosing this, which you can show her, if she desires it., I do this because she would think strangely, perhaps, should you tell her that you received no letters from me, or, telling her you do, refuse to let her see them., I close this, entertaining the confident hope that every successive letter I shall have from you (which I here pray may not be few, nor far between) may show you possessing a more steady hand and cheerful heart than the last preceding it., Yours of the 10th instant was received three or four days since., You know I am sincere when I tell you the pleasure its contents gave me was, and is, inexpressible., As to your farm matter, I have no sympathy with you., I have no farm, nor ever expect to have, and consequently have not studied the subject enough to be much interested with it., I can only say that I am glad you are satisfied and pleased with it., But on that other subject, to me of the most intense interest whether in joy or sorrow, I never had the power to withhold my sympathy from you., It cannot be told how it now thrills me with joy to hear you say you are ""far happier than you ever expected to be."", That much I know is enough., I know you too well to suppose your expectations were not, at least, sometimes extravagant, and if the reality exceeds them all, I say, Enough, dear Lord., I am not going beyond the truth when I tell you that the short space it took me to read your last letter gave me more pleasure than the total sum of all I have enjoyed since the fatal 1st of January, 1841., Since then it seems to me I should have been entirely happy, but for the never-absent idea that there is one still unhappy whom I have contributed to make so., That still kills my soul., I cannot but reproach myself for even wishing to be happy while she is otherwise., She accompanied a large party on the railroad cars to Jacksonville last Monday, and on her return spoke, so that I heard of it, of having enjoyed the trip exceedingly., God be praised for that., You know with what sleepless vigilance I have watched you ever since the commencement of your affair; and although I am almost confident it is useless, I cannot forbear once more to say that I think it is even yet possible for your spirits to flag down and leave you miserable., If they should, don't fail to remember that they cannot long remain so., One thing I can tell you which I know you will be glad to hear, and that is that I have seen--and scrutinized her feelings as well as I could, and am fully convinced she is far happier now than she has been for the last fifteen months past., You will see by the last Sangamon Journal, that I made a temperance speech on the 22d of February, which I claim that Fanny and you shall read as an act of charity to me; for I cannot learn that anybody else has read it, or is likely to., Fortunately it is not very long, and I shall deem it a sufficient compliance with my request if one of you listens while the other reads it., As to your Lockridge matter, it is only necessary to say that there has been no court since you left, and that the next commences to-morrow morning, during which I suppose we cannot fail to get a judgment., I wish you would learn of Everett what he would take, over and above a discharge for all the trouble we have been at, to take his business out of our hands and give it to somebody else., It is impossible to collect money on that or any other claim here now; and although you know I am not a very petulant man, I declare I am almost out of patience with Mr. Everett's importunity., It seems like he not only writes all the letters he can himself, but gets everybody else in Louisville and vicinity to be constantly writing to us about his claim., I have always said that Mr. Everett is a very clever fellow, and I am very sorry he cannot be obliged; but it does seem to me he ought to know we are interested to collect his claim, and therefore would do it if we could., I am neither joking nor in a pet when I say we would thank him to transfer his business to some other, without any compensation for what we have done, provided he will see the court cost paid, for which we are security., The sweet violet you inclosed came safely to hand, but it was so dry, and mashed so flat, that it crumbled to dust at the first attempt to handle it., The juice that mashed out of it stained a place in the letter, which I mean to preserve and cherish for the sake of her who procured it to be sent., My renewed good wishes to her in particular, and generally to all such of your relations who know me., Yours of the 16th June was received only a day or two since., It was not mailed at Louisville till the 25th., You speak of the great time that has elapsed since I wrote you., Let me explain that., Your letter reached here a day or two after I started on the circuit., I was gone five or six weeks, so that I got the letters only a few weeks before Butler started to your country., I thought it scarcely worth while to write you the news which he could and would tell you more in detail., On his return he told me you would write me soon, and so I waited for your letter., As to my having been displeased with your advice, surely you know better than that., I know you do, and therefore will not labor to convince you., True, that subject is painful to me; but it is not your silence, or the silence of all the world, that can make me forget it., I acknowledge the correctness of your advice too; but before I resolve to do the one thing or the other, I must gain my confidence in my own ability to keep my resolves when they are made., In that ability you know I once prided myself as the only or chief gem of my character; that gem I lost--how and where you know too well., I have not yet regained it; and until I do, I cannot trust myself in any matter of much importance., I believe now that had you understood my case at the time as well as I understand yours afterward, by the aid you would have given me I should have sailed through clear, but that does not now afford me sufficient confidence to begin that or the like of that again., You make a kind acknowledgment of your obligations to me for your present happiness., I am pleased with that acknowledgment., But a thousand times more am I pleased to know that you enjoy a degree of happiness worthy of an acknowledgment., The truth is, I am not sure that there was any merit with me in the part I took in your difficulty; I was drawn to it by a fate., If I would I could not have done less than I did., I always was superstitious; I believe God made me one of the instruments of bringing your Fanny and you together, which union I have no doubt He had fore-ordained., Whatever He designs He will do for me yet., ""Stand still, and see the salvation of the Lord"" is my text just now., If, as you say, you have told Fanny all, I should have no objection to her seeing this letter, but for its reference to our friend here: let her seeing it depend upon whether she has ever known anything of my affairs; and if she has not, do not let her., ...]"|3

and it's just like everything the cursed British Whigs do., First they'll do some divilment, and then they'll tell a lie to hide it., And they don't care how plain a lie it is; they think they can cram any sort of a one down the throats of the ignorant Locofocos, as they call the Democrats."", ""Why, Jeff, you 're crazy: you don't mean to say Shields is a Whig!"", ""Yes, I do."", ""Why, look here!, the proclamation is in your own Democratic paper, as you call it."", ""I know it;

and the sweet distress he seemed to be in,--his very features, in the ecstatic agony of his soul, spoke audibly and distinctly, 'Dear girls, it is distressing, but I cannot marry you all., Too well I know how much you suffer; but do, do remember, it is not my fault that I am so handsome and so interesting.', ""As this last was expressed by a most exquisite contortion of his face, he seized hold of one of their hands, and squeezed, and held on to it about a quarter of an hour., 'Oh, my good fellow!', says I to myself, 'if that was one of our Democratic gals in the Lost Townships, the way you 'd get a brass pin let into you would be about up to the head.', He a Democrat!, Fiddlesticks!, I tell you, Aunt 'Becca, he's a Whig, and no mistake; nobody but a Whig could make such a conceity dunce of himself."", ""Well,"" says I, ""maybe he is; but, if he is, I 'm mistaken the worst sort., Maybe so, maybe so; but, if I am, I'll suffer by it; I'll be a Democrat if it turns out that Shields is a Whig, considerin' you shall be a Whig if he turns out a Democrat."", ""A bargain, by jingoes!"", says he; ""but how will we find out?"", ""Why,"" says I, ""we'll just write and ax the printer."", ""Agreed again!"", says he; ""and by thunder!, if it does turn out that Shields is a Democrat, I never will----""  ""Jefferson!, Jefferson!"", ""What do you want, Peggy?"", ""Do get through your everlasting clatter some time, and bring me a gourd of water; the child's been crying for a drink this livelong hour."", ""Let it die, then; it may as well die for water as to be taxed to death to fatten officers of State."", Jeff run off to get the water, though, just like he hadn't been saying anything spiteful, for he's a raal good-hearted fellow, after all, once you get at the foundation of him., I walked into the house, and, ""Why, Peggy,"" says I, ""I declare we like to forgot you altogether."", ""Oh, yes,"" says she, ""when a body can't help themselves, everybody soon forgets 'em; but, thank God!, by day after to-morrow I shall be well enough to milk the cows, and pen the calves, and wring the contrary ones' tails for 'em, and no thanks to nobody."", ""Good evening, Peggy,"" says I, and so I sloped, for I seed she was mad at me for making Jeff neglect her so long., And now, Mr., Printer, will you be sure to let us know in your next paper whether this Shields is a Whig or a Democrat?, I don't care about it for myself, for I know well enough how it is already; but I want to convince Jeff., It may do some good to let him, and others like him, know who and what these officers of State are., It may help to send the present hypocritical set to where they belong, and to fill the places they now disgrace with men who will do more work for less pay, and take fewer airs while they are doing it., It ain't sensible to think that the same men who get us in trouble will change their course; and yet it's pretty plain if some change for the better is not made, it's not long that either Peggy or I or any of us will have a cow left to milk, or a calf's tail to wring., We hear you are to visit Indianapolis, Indiana, on the 5th Of October next., If our information in this is correct we hope you will not deny us the pleasure of seeing you in our State., We are aware of the toil necessarily incident to a journey by one circumstanced as you are; but once you have embarked, as you have already determined to do, the toil would not be greatly augmented by extending the journey to our capital., The season of the year will be most favorable for good roads, and pleasant weather; and although we cannot but believe you would be highly gratified with such a visit to the prairie-land, the pleasure it would give us and thousands such as we is beyond all question., You have never visited Illinois, or at least this portion of it; and should you now yield to our request, we promise you such a reception as shall be worthy of the man on whom are now turned the fondest hopes of a great and suffering nation., Please inform us at the earliest convenience whether we may expect you., I regret that my absence on public business compelled me to postpone a matter of private consideration a little longer than I could have desired., It will only be necessary, however, to account for it by informing you that I have been to Quincy on business that would not admit of delay., I will now state briefly the reasons of my troubling you with this communication, the disagreeable nature of which I regret, as I had hoped to avoid any difficulty with any one in Springfield while residing there, by endeavoring to conduct myself in such a way amongst both my political friends and opponents as to escape the necessity of any., Whilst thus abstaining from giving provocation, I have become the object of slander, vituperation, and personal abuse, which were I capable of submitting to, I would prove myself worthy of the whole of it., In two or three of the last numbers of the Sangamon Journal, articles of the most personal nature and calculated to degrade me have made their appearance., On inquiring, I was informed by the editor of that paper, through the medium of my friend General Whitesides, that you are the author of those articles., This information satisfies me that I have become by some means or other the object of your secret hostility., I will not take the trouble of inquiring into the reason of all this; but I will take the liberty of requiring a full, positive, and absolute retraction of all offensive allusions used by you in these communications, in relation to my private character and standing as a man, as an apology for the insults conveyed in them., This may prevent consequences which no one will regret more than myself., JYour note of to-day was handed me by General Whitesides., In that note you say you have been informed, through the medium of the editor of the Journal, that I am the author of certain articles in that paper which you deem personally abusive of you; and without stopping to inquire whether I really am the author, or to point out what is offensive in them, you demand an unqualified retraction of all that is offensive, and then proceed to hint at consequences., Now, sir, there is in this so much assumption of facts and so much of menace as to consequences, that I cannot submit to answer that note any further than I have, and to add that the consequences to which I suppose you allude would be matter of as great regret to me as it possibly could to you., In reply to my note of this date, you intimate that I assume facts and menace consequences, and that you cannot submit to answer it further., As now, sir, you desire it, I will be a little more particular., The editor of the Sangamon Journal gave me to understand that you are the author of an article which appeared, I think, in that paper of the 2d September instant, headed ""The Lost Townships,"" and signed Rebecca or 'Becca., I would therefore take the liberty of asking whether you are the author of said article, or any other over the same signature which has appeared in any of the late numbers of that paper., If so, I repeat my request of an absolute retraction of all offensive allusions contained therein in relation to my private character and standing., If you are not the author of any of these articles, your denial will be sufficient., I will say further, it is not my intention to menace, but to do myself justice., In case Whitesides shall signify a wish to adjust this affair without further difficulty, let him know that if the present papers be withdrawn, and a note from Mr. Shields asking to know if I am the author of the articles of which he complains, and asking that I shall make him gentlemanly satisfaction if I am the author, and this without menace, or dictation as to what that satisfaction shall be, a pledge is made that the following answer shall be given:  ""I did write the 'Lost Townships' letter which appeared in the Journal of the 2d instant, but had no participation in any form in any other article alluding to you., I wrote that wholly for political effect--I had no intention of injuring your personal or private character or standing as a man or a gentleman; and I did not then think, and do not now think, that that article could produce or has produced that effect against you; and had I anticipated such an effect I would have forborne to write it., And I will add that your conduct toward me, so far as I know, had always been gentlemanly; and that I had no personal pique against you, and no cause for any."", If this should be done, I leave it with you to arrange what shall and what shall not be published., If nothing like this is done, the preliminaries of the fight are to be--  First., Weapons: Cavalry broadswords of the largest size, precisely equal in all respects, and such as now used by the cavalry company at Jacksonville., Second., Position: A plank ten feet long, and from nine to twelve inches broad, to be firmly fixed on edge, on the ground, as the line between us, which neither is to pass his foot over upon forfeit of his life., Next a line drawn on the ground on either side of said plank and parallel with it, each at the distance of the whole length of the sword and three feet additional from the plank; and the passing of his own such line by either party during the fight shall be deemed a surrender of the contest., Third., Time: On Thursday evening at five o'clock, if you can get it so; but in no case to be at a greater distance of time than Friday evening at five o'clock., Fourth., Place: Within three miles of Alton, on the opposite side of the river, the particular spot to be agreed on by you., Any preliminary details coming within the above rules you are at liberty to make at your discretion; but you are in no case to swerve from these rules, or to pass beyond their limits., You have heard of my duel with Shields, and I have now to inform you that the dueling business still rages in this city., Day before yesterday Shields challenged Butler, who accepted, and proposed fighting next morning at sunrise in Bob Allen's meadow, one hundred yards' distance, with rifles., To this Whitesides, Shields's second, said ""No,"" because of the law., Thus ended duel No., 2., ...]"|3
9|"[And, again, by the tariff system the whole revenue is paid by the consumers of foreign goods, and those chiefly the luxuries, and not the necessaries, of life., By this system the man who contents himself to live upon the products of his own country pays nothing at all., And surely that country is extensive enough, and its products abundant and varied enough, to answer all the real wants of its people., In short, by this system the burthen of revenue falls almost entirely on the wealthy and luxurious few, while the substantial and laboring many who live at home, and upon home products, go entirely free., By the direct-tax system none can escape., However strictly the citizen may exclude from his premises all foreign luxuries,--fine cloths, fine silks, rich wines, golden chains, and diamond rings,--still, for the possession of his house, his barn, and his homespun, he is to be perpetually haunted and harassed by the tax-gatherer., With these views we leave it to be determined whether we or our opponents are the more truly democratic on the subject., The third resolution declares the necessity and propriety of a national bank., During the last fifty years so much has been said and written both as to the constitutionality and expediency of such an institution, that we could not hope to improve in the least on former discussions of the subject, were we to undertake it., We, therefore, upon the question of constitutionality content ourselves with remarking the facts that the first national bank was established chiefly by the same men who formed the Constitution, at a time when that instrument was but two years old, and receiving the sanction, as President, of the immortal Washington; that the second received the sanction, as President, of Mr. Madison, to whom common consent has awarded the proud title of ""Father of the Constitution""; and subsequently the sanction of the Supreme Court, the most enlightened judicial tribunal in the world., Upon the question of expediency, we only ask you to examine the history of the times during the existence of the two banks, and compare those times with the miserable present., The fourth resolution declares the expediency of Mr. Clay's land bill., Much incomprehensible jargon is often used against the constitutionality of this measure., We forbear, in this place, attempting an answer to it, simply because, in our opinion, those who urge it are through party zeal resolved not to see or acknowledge the truth., The question of expediency, at least so far as Illinois is concerned, seems to us the clearest imaginable., By the bill we are to receive annually a large sum of money, no part of which we otherwise receive., The precise annual sum cannot be known in advance; it doubtless will vary in different years., Still it is something to know that in the last year--a year of almost unparalleled pecuniary pressure--it amounted to more than forty thousand dollars., This annual income, in the midst of our almost insupportable difficulties, in the days of our severest necessity, our political opponents are furiously resolving to take and keep from us., And for what?, Many silly reasons are given, as is usual in cases where a single good one is not to be found., One is that by giving us the proceeds of the lands we impoverish the national treasury, and thereby render necessary an increase of the tariff., This may be true; but if so, the amount of it only is that those whose pride, whose abundance of means, prompt them to spurn the manufactures of our country, and to strut in British cloaks and coats and pantaloons, may have to pay a few cents more on the yard for the cloth that makes them., A terrible evil, truly, to the Illinois farmer, who never wore, nor ever expects to wear, a single yard of British goods in his whole life., Another of their reasons is that by the passage and continuance of Mr. Clay's bill, we prevent the passage of a bill which would give us more., This, if it were sound in itself, is waging destructive war with the former position; for if Mr. Clay's bill impoverishes the treasury too much, what shall be said of one that impoverishes it still more?, But it is not sound in itself., It is not true that Mr. Clay's bill prevents the passage of one more favorable to us of the new States., Considering the strength and opposite interest of the old States, the wonder is that they ever permitted one to pass so favorable as Mr. Clay's., The last twenty-odd years' efforts to reduce the price of the lands, and to pass graduation bills and cession bills, prove the assertion to be true; and if there were no experience in support of it, the reason itself is plain., The States in which none, or few, of the public lands lie, and those consequently interested against parting with them except for the best price, are the majority; and a moment's reflection will show that they must ever continue the majority, because by the time one of the original new States (Ohio, for example) becomes populous and gets weight in Congress, the public lands in her limits are so nearly sold out that in every point material to this question she becomes an old State., She does not wish the price reduced, because there is none left for her citizens to buy; she does not wish them ceded to the States in which they lie, because they no longer lie in her limits, and she will get nothing by the cession., In the nature of things, the States interested in the reduction of price, in graduation, in cession, and in all similar projects, never can be the majority., Nor is there reason to hope that any of them can ever succeed as a Democratic party measure, because we have heretofore seen that party in full power, year after year, with many of their leaders making loud professions in favor of these projects, and yet doing nothing., What reason, then, is there to believe they will hereafter do better?, In every light in which we can view this question, it amounts simply to this: Shall we accept our share of the proceeds under Mr. Clay's bill, or shall we rather reject that and get nothing?, The fifth resolution recommends that a Whig candidate for Congress be run in every district, regardless of the chances of success., We are aware that it is sometimes a temporary gratification, when a friend cannot succeed, to be able to choose between opponents; but we believe that that gratification is the seed-time which never fails to be followed by a most abundant harvest of bitterness., By this policy we entangle ourselves., By voting for our opponents, such of us as do it in some measure estop ourselves to complain of their acts, however glaringly wrong we may believe them to be., By this policy no one portion of our friends can ever be certain as to what course another portion may adopt; and by this want of mutual and perfect understanding our political identity is partially frittered away and lost., And, again, those who are thus elected by our aid ever become our bitterest persecutors., Take a few prominent examples., In 1830 Reynolds was elected Governor; in 1835 we exerted our whole strength to elect Judge Young to the United States Senate, which effort, though failing, gave him the prominence that subsequently elected him; in 1836 General Ewing, was so elected to the United States Senate; and yet let us ask what three men have been more perseveringly vindictive in their assaults upon all our men and measures than they?, During the last summer the whole State was covered with pamphlet editions of misrepresentations against us, methodized into chapters and verses, written by two of these same men,--Reynolds and Young, in which they did not stop at charging us with error merely, but roundly denounced us as the designing enemies of human liberty, itself., If it be the will of Heaven that such men shall politically live, be it so; but never, never again permit them to draw a particle of their sustenance from us., The sixth resolution recommends the adoption of the convention system for the nomination of candidates., This we believe to be of the very first importance., Whether the system is right in itself we do not stop to inquire; contenting ourselves with trying to show that, while our opponents use it, it is madness in us not to defend ourselves with it., Experience has shown that we cannot successfully defend ourselves without it., For examples, look at the elections of last year., Our candidate for governor, with the approbation of a large portion of the party, took the field without a nomination, and in open opposition to the system., Wherever in the counties the Whigs had held conventions and nominated candidates for the Legislature, the aspirants who were not nominated were induced to rebel against the nominations, and to become candidates, as is said, ""on their own hook."", And, go where you would into a large Whig county, you were sure to find the Whigs not contending shoulder to shoulder against the common enemy, but divided into factions, and fighting furiously with one another., The election came, and what was the result?, The governor beaten, the Whig vote being decreased many thousands since 1840, although the Democratic vote had not increased any., Beaten almost everywhere for members of the Legislature,--Tazewell, with her four hundred Whig majority, sending a delegation half Democratic; Vermillion, with her five hundred, doing the same; Coles, with her four hundred, sending two out of three; and Morgan, with her two hundred and fifty, sending three out of four,--and this to say nothing of the numerous other less glaring examples; the whole winding up with the aggregate number of twenty-seven Democratic representatives sent from Whig counties., As to the senators, too, the result was of the same character., And it is most worthy to be remembered that of all the Whigs in the State who ran against the regular nominees, a single one only was elected., Although they succeeded in defeating the nominees almost by scores, they too were defeated, and the spoils chucklingly borne off by the common enemy., We do not mention the fact of many of the Whigs opposing the convention system heretofore for the purpose of censuring them., Far from it., We expressly protest against such a conclusion., We know they were generally, perhaps universally, as good and true Whigs as we ourselves claim to be., We mention it merely to draw attention to the disastrous result it produced, as an example forever hereafter to be avoided., That ""union is strength"" is a truth that has been known, illustrated, and declared in various ways and forms in all ages of the world., That great fabulist and philosopher Aesop illustrated it by his fable of the bundle of sticks; and he whose wisdom surpasses that of all philosophers has declared that ""a house divided against itself cannot stand."", It is to induce our friends to act upon this important and universally acknowledged truth that we urge the adoption of the convention system., Reflection will prove that there is no other way of practically applying it., In its application we know there will be incidents temporarily painful; but, after all, those incidents will be fewer and less intense with than without the system., If two friends aspire to the same office it is certain that both cannot succeed., Would it not, then, be much less painful to have the question decided by mutual friends some time before, than to snarl and quarrel until the day of election, and then both be beaten by the common enemy?, Before leaving this subject, we think proper to remark that we do not understand the resolution as intended to recommend the application of the convention system to the nomination of candidates for the small offices no way connected with politics; though we must say we do not perceive that such an application of it would be wrong., The seventh resolution recommends the holding of district conventions in May next, for the purpose of nominating candidates for Congress., The propriety of this rests upon the same reasons with that of the sixth, and therefore needs no further discussion., The eighth and ninth also relate merely to the practical application of the foregoing, and therefore need no discussion., Before closing, permit us to add a few reflections on the present condition and future prospects of the Whig party., In almost all the States we have fallen into the minority, and despondency seems to prevail universally among us., Is there just cause for this?, In 1840 we carried the nation by more than a hundred and forty thousand majority., Our opponents charged that we did it by fraudulent voting; but whatever they may have believed, we know the charge to be untrue., Where, now, is that mighty host?, Have they gone over to the enemy?, Let the results of the late elections answer., Every State which has fallen off from the Whig cause since 1840 has done so not by giving more Democratic votes than they did then, but by giving fewer Whig., Bouck, who was elected Democratic Governor of New York last fall by more than 15,000 majority, had not then as many votes as he had in 1840, when he was beaten by seven or eight thousand., And so has it been in all the other States which have fallen away from our cause., From this it is evident that tens of thousands in the late elections have not voted at all., Who and what are they?, is an important question, as respects the future., They can come forward and give us the victory again., That all, or nearly all, of them are Whigs is most apparent., Our opponents, stung to madness by the defeat of 1840, have ever since rallied with more than their usual unanimity., It has not been they that have been kept from the polls., These facts show what the result must be, once the people again rally in their entire strength., Proclaim these facts, and predict this result; and although unthinking opponents may smile at us, the sagacious ones will ""believe and tremble."", And why shall the Whigs not all rally again?, Are their principles less dear now than in 1840?, Have any of their doctrines since then been discovered to be untrue?, It is true, the victory of 1840 did not produce the happy results anticipated; but it is equally true, as we believe, that the unfortunate death of General Harrison was the cause of the failure., ...]"|3
10|"[Write me at Springfield how the matter is., Don't show or speak of this letter., Butler informs me that he received a letter from you, in which you expressed some doubt whether the Whigs of Sangamon will support you cordially., You may, at once, dismiss all fears on that subject., We have already resolved to make a particular effort to give you the very largest majority possible in our county., From this, no Whig of the county dissents., We have many objects for doing it., We make it a matter of honor and pride to do it; we do it because we love the Whig cause; we do it because we like you personally; and last, we wish to convince you that we do not bear that hatred to Morgan County that you people have so long seemed to imagine., You will see by the journals of this week that we propose, upon pain of losing a barbecue, to give you twice as great a majority in this county as you shall receive in your own., I got up the proposal., Who of the five appointed is to write the district address?, I did the labor of writing one address this year, and got thunder for my reward., Nothing new here., P. S.--I wish you would measure one of the largest of those swords we took to Alton and write me the length of it, from tip of the point to tip of the hilt, in feet and inches., I have a dispute about the length., ours of the 9th instant is duly received, which I do not meet as a ""bore,"" but as a most welcome visitor., I will answer the business part of it first., In relation to our Congress matter here, you were right in supposing I would support the nominee., Neither Baker nor I, however, is the man, but Hardin, so far as I can judge from present appearances., We shall have no split or trouble about the matter; all will be harmony., In relation to the ""coming events"" about which Butler wrote you, I had not heard one word before I got your letter; but I have so much confidence in the judgment of Butler on such a subject that I incline to think there may be some reality in it., What day does Butler appoint?, By the way, how do ""events"" of the same sort come on in your family?, Are you possessing houses and lands, and oxen and asses, and men-servants and maid-servants, and begetting sons and daughters?, We are not keeping house, but boarding at the Globe Tavern, which is very well kept now by a widow lady of the name of Beck., Our room (the same that Dr. Wallace occupied there) and boarding only costs us four dollars a week., Ann Todd was married something more than a year since to a fellow by the name of Campbell, and who, Mary says, is pretty much of a ""dunce,"" though he has a little money and property., They live in Boonville, Missouri, and have not been heard from lately enough for me to say anything about her health., I reckon it will scarcely be in our power to visit Kentucky this year., Besides poverty and the necessity of attending to business, those ""coming events,"" I suspect, would be somewhat in the way., I most heartily wish you and your Fanny would not fail to come., Just let us know the time, and we will have a room provided for you at our house, and all be merry together for a while., Be sure to give my respects to your mother and family; assure her that if ever I come near her, I will not fail to call and see her., Mary joins in sending love to your Fanny and you., Yours as ever,  Knowing that you have correspondents enough, I have forborne to trouble you heretofore; and I now only do so to get you to set a matter right which has got wrong with one of our best friends., It is old Uncle Thomas Campbell of Spring Creek--(Berlin P.O.)., He has received several documents from you, and he says they are old newspapers and documents, having no sort of interest in them., He is, therefore, getting a strong impression that you treat him with disrespect., This, I know, is a mistaken impression; and you must correct it., The way, I leave to yourself., Rob't W. Canfield says he would like to have a document or two from you., The Locos (Democrats) here are in considerable trouble about Van Buren's letter on Texas, and the Virginia electors., They are growing sick of the Tariff question; and consequently are much confounded at V.B., 's cutting them off from the new Texas question., Nearly half the leaders swear they won't stand it., Of those are Ford, T. Campbell, Ewing, Calhoun and others., They don't exactly say they won't vote for V.B., but they say he will not be the candidate, and that they are for Texas anyhow., I do not wish to join in your proposal of a new plan for the selection of a Whig candidate for Congress because:  1st., I am entirely satisfied with the old system under which you and Baker were successively nominated and elected to Congress; and because the Whigs of the district are well acquainted with the system, and, so far as I know or believe, are well satisfied with it., If the old system be thought to be vague, as to all the delegates of the county voting the same way, or as to instructions to them as to whom they are to vote for, or as to filling vacancies, I am willing to join in a provision to make these matters certain., 2d., As to your proposals that a poll shall be opened in every precinct, and that the whole shall take place on the same day, I do not personally object., They seem to me to be not unfair; and I forbear to join in proposing them only because I choose to leave the decision in each county to the Whigs of the county, to be made as their own judgment and convenience may dictate., 3d., As to your proposed stipulation that all the candidates shall remain in their own counties, and restrain their friends in the same it seems to me that on reflection you will see the fact of your having been in Congress has, in various ways, so spread your name in the district as to give you a decided advantage in such a stipulation., I appreciate your desire to keep down excitement; and I promise you to ""keep cool"" under all circumstances., 4th., I have already said I am satisfied with the old system under which such good men have triumphed and that I desire no departure from its principles., But if there must be a departure from it, I shall insist upon a more accurate and just apportionment of delegates, or representative votes, to the constituent body, than exists by the old, and which you propose to retain in your new plan., If we take the entire population of the counties as shown by the late census, we shall see by the old plan, and by your proposed new plan, And so on in a less degree the matter runs through all the counties, being not only wrong in principle, but the advantage of it being all manifestly in your favor with one slight exception, in the comparison of two counties not here mentioned., Again, if we take the Whig votes of the counties as shown by the late Presidential election as a basis, the thing is still worse., It seems to me most obvious that the old system needs adjustment in nothing so much as in this; and still, by your proposal, no notice is taken of it., I have always been in the habit of acceding to almost any proposal that a friend would make and I am truly sorry that I cannot in this., I perhaps ought to mention that some friends at different places are endeavoring to secure the honor of the sitting of the convention at their towns respectively, and I fear that they would not feel much complimented if we shall make a bargain that it should sit nowhere., The Supreme Court adjourned this morning for the term., Your cases of Reinhardt vs. Schuyler, Bunce vs. Schuyler, Dickhut vs. Dunell, and Sullivan vs. Andrews are continued., Hinman vs. Pope I wrote you concerning some time ago., McNutt et al., vs. Bean and Thompson is reversed and remanded., Fitzpatrick vs. Brady et al., is reversed and remanded with leave to complainant to amend his bill so as to show the real consideration given for the land., Bunce against Graves the court confirmed, wherefore, in accordance with your directions, I moved to have the case remanded to enable you to take a new trial in the court below., The court allowed the motion; of which I am glad, and I guess you are., This, I believe, is all as to court business., The canal men have got their measure through the Legislature pretty much or quite in the shape they desired., Nothing else now., When I saw you at home, it was agreed that I should write to you and your brother Madison., Until I then saw you I was not aware of your being what is generally called an abolitionist, or, as you call yourself, a Liberty man, though I well knew there were many such in your country., I was glad to hear that you intended to attempt to bring about, at the next election in Putnam, a Union of the Whigs proper and such of the Liberty men as are Whigs in principle on all questions save only that of slavery., So far as I can perceive, by such union neither party need yield anything on the point in difference between them., If the Whig abolitionists of New York had voted with us last fall, Mr. Clay would now be President, Whig principles in the ascendant, and Texas not annexed; whereas, by the division, all that either had at stake in the contest was lost., And, indeed, it was extremely probable, beforehand, that such would be the result., As I always understood, the Liberty men deprecated the annexation of Texas extremely; and this being so, why they should refuse to cast their votes [so] as to prevent it, even to me seemed wonderful., What was their process of reasoning, I can only judge from what a single one of them told me., It was this: ""We are not to do evil that good may come."", This general proposition is doubtless correct; but did it apply?, If by your votes you could have prevented the extension, etc., of slavery would it not have been good, and not evil, so to have used your votes, even though it involved the casting of them for a slaveholder?, By the fruit the tree is to be known., An evil tree cannot bring forth good fruit., If the fruit of electing Mr. Clay would have been to prevent the extension of slavery, could the act of electing have been evil?, But I will not argue further., I perhaps ought to say that individually I never was much interested in the Texas question., I never could see much good to come of annexation, inasmuch as they were already a free republican people on our own model., On the other hand, I never could very clearly see how the annexation would augment the evil of slavery., It always seemed to me that slaves would be taken there in about equal numbers, with or without annexation., And if more were taken because of annexation, still there would be just so many the fewer left where they were taken from., It is possibly true, to some extent, that, with annexation, some slaves may be sent to Texas and continued in slavery that otherwise might have been liberated., To whatever extent this may be true, I think annexation an evil., I hold it to be a paramount duty of us in the free States, due to the Union of the States, and perhaps to liberty itself (paradox though it may seem), to let the slavery of the other States alone; while, on the other hand, I hold it to be equally clear that we should never knowingly lend ourselves, directly or indirectly, to prevent that slavery from dying a natural death--to find new places for it to live in when it can no longer exist in the old., Of course I am not now considering what would be our duty in cases of insurrection among the slaves., ...]"|3
11|"[What I want now is to send you the money, to be used accordingly, if any one comes on to start the case, or to be retained by you if no one does., There is nothing of consequence new here., Congress is to organize to-morrow., Last night we held a Whig caucus for the House, and nominated Winthrop of Massachusetts for speaker, Sargent of Pennsylvania for sergeant-at-arms, Homer of New Jersey door-keeper, and McCormick of District of Columbia postmaster., The Whig majority in the House is so small that, together with some little dissatisfaction, [it] leaves it doubtful whether we will elect them all., This paper is too thick to fold, which is the reason I send only a half-sheet., Your letter, advising me of the receipt of our fee in the bank case, is just received, and I don't expect to hear another as good a piece of news from Springfield while I am away., I am under no obligations to the bank; and I therefore wish you to buy bank certificates, and pay my debt there, so as to pay it with the least money possible., I would as soon you should buy them of Mr. Ridgely, or any other person at the bank, as of any one else, provided you can get them as cheaply., I suppose, after the bank debt shall be paid, there will be some money left, out of which I would like to have you pay Lavely and Stout twenty dollars, and Priest and somebody (oil-makers) ten dollars, for materials got for house-painting., If there shall still be any left, keep it till you see or hear from me., I shall begin sending documents so soon as I can get them., I wrote you yesterday about a ""Congressional Globe."", As you are all so anxious for me to distinguish myself, I have concluded to do so before long., Whereas, The President of the United States, in his message of May 11, 1846, has declared that ""the Mexican Government not only refused to receive him [the envoy of the United States], or to listen to his propositions, but, after a long-continued series of menaces, has at last invaded our territory and shed the blood of our fellow-citizens on our own soil"";  And again, in his message of December 8, 1846, that ""we had ample cause of war against Mexico long before the breaking out of hostilities; but even then we forbore to take redress into our own hands until Mexico herself became the aggressor, by invading our soil in hostile array, and shedding the blood of our citizens"";  And yet again, in his message of December 7, 1847, that ""the Mexican Government refused even to hear the terms of adjustment which he [our minister of peace] was authorized to propose, and finally, under wholly unjustifiable pretexts, involved the two countries in war, by invading the territory of the State of Texas, striking the first blow, and shedding the blood of our citizens on our own soil"";  And whereas, This House is desirous to obtain a full knowledge of all the facts which go to establish whether the particular spot on which the blood of our citizens was so shed was or was not at that time our own soil: therefore,  Resolved, By the House of Representatives, that the President of the United States be respectfully requested to inform this House:  First., Whether the spot on which the blood of our citizens was shed, as in his message declared, was or was not within the territory of Spain, at least after the treaty of 1819, until the Mexican revolution., Second., Whether that spot is or is not within the territory which was wrested from Spain by the revolutionary government of Mexico., Third., Whether that spot is or is not within a settlement of people, which settlement has existed ever since long before the Texas revolution, and until its inhabitants fled before the approach of the United States army., Fourth., Whether that settlement is or is not isolated from any and all other settlements by the Gulf and the Rio Grande on the south and west, and by wide uninhabited regions on the north and east., Fifth., Whether the people of that settlement, or a majority of them, or any of them, have ever submitted themselves to the government or laws of Texas or of the United States, by consent or by compulsion, either by accepting office, or voting at elections, or paying tax, or serving on juries, or having process served upon them, or in any other way., Sixth., Whether the people of that settlement did or did not flee from the approach of the United States army, leaving unprotected their homes and their growing crops, before the blood was shed, as in the message stated; and whether the first blood, so shed, was or was not shed within the inclosure of one of the people who had thus fled from it., Seventh., Whether our citizens, whose blood was shed, as in his message declared, were or were not, at that time, armed officers and soldiers, sent into that settlement by the military order of the President, through the Secretary of War., Eighth., Whether the military force of the United States was or was not so sent into that settlement after General Taylor had more than once intimated to the War Department that, in his opinion, no such movement was necessary to the defence or protection of Texas., Mr. Lincoln said he had made an effort, some few days since, to obtain the floor in relation to this measure [resolution to direct Postmaster-General to make arrangements with railroad for carrying the mails--in Committee of the Whole], but had failed., One of the objects he had then had in view was now in a great measure superseded by what had fallen from the gentleman from Virginia who had just taken his seat., He begged to assure his friends on the other side of the House that no assault whatever was meant upon the Postmaster-General, and he was glad that what the gentleman had now said modified to a great extent the impression which might have been created by the language he had used on a previous occasion., He wanted to state to gentlemen who might have entertained such impressions, that the Committee on the Post-office was composed of five Whigs and four Democrats, and their report was understood as sustaining, not impugning, the position taken by the Postmaster-General., That report had met with the approbation of all the Whigs, and of all the Democrats also, with the exception of one, and he wanted to go even further than this., [Intimation was informally given Mr. Lincoln that it was not in order to mention on the floor what had taken place in committee.], He then observed that if he had been out of order in what he had said he took it all back so far as he could., He had no desire, he could assure gentlemen, ever to be out of order--though he never could keep long in order., Mr. Lincoln went on to observe that he differed in opinion, in the present case, from his honorable friend from Richmond [Mr. Botts]., That gentleman, had begun his remarks by saying that if all prepossessions in this matter could be removed out of the way, but little difficulty would be experienced in coming to an agreement., Now, he could assure that gentleman that he had himself begun the examination of the subject with prepossessions all in his favor., He had long and often heard of him, and, from what he had heard, was prepossessed in his favor., Of the Postmaster-General he had also heard, but had no prepossessions in his favor, though certainly none of an opposite kind., He differed, however, with that gentleman in politics, while in this respect he agreed with the gentleman from Virginia [Mr. Botts], whom he wished to oblige whenever it was in his power., That gentleman had referred to the report made to the House by the Postmaster-General, and had intimated an apprehension that gentlemen would be disposed to rely, on that report alone, and derive their views of the case from that document alone., Now it so happened that a pamphlet had been slipped into his [Mr. Lincoln's] hand before he read the report of the Postmaster-General; so that, even in this, he had begun with prepossessions in favor of the gentleman from Virginia., As to the report, he had but one remark to make: he had carefully examined it, and he did not understand that there was any dispute as to the facts therein stated the dispute, if he understood it, was confined altogether to the inferences to be drawn from those facts., It was a difference not about facts, but about conclusions., The facts were not disputed., If he was right in this, he supposed the House might assume the facts to be as they were stated, and thence proceed to draw their own conclusions., The gentleman had said that the Postmaster-General had got into a personal squabble with the railroad company., Of this Mr. Lincoln knew nothing, nor did he need or desire to know anything, because it had nothing whatever to do with a just conclusion from the premises., But the gentleman had gone on to ask whether so great a grievance as the present detention of the Southern mail ought not to be remedied., Mr. Lincoln would assure the gentleman that if there was a proper way of doing it, no man was more anxious than he that it should be done., The report made by the committee had been intended to yield much for the sake of removing that grievance., That the grievance was very great there was no dispute in any quarter., He supposed that the statements made by the gentleman from Virginia to show this were all entirely correct in point of fact., He did suppose that the interruptions of regular intercourse, and all the other inconveniences growing out of it, were all as that gentleman had stated them to be; and certainly, if redress could be rendered, it was proper it should be rendered as soon as possible., The gentleman said that in order to effect this no new legislative action was needed; all that was necessary was that the Postmaster-General should be required to do what the law, as it stood, authorized and required him to do., We come then, said Mr. Lincoln, to the law., Now the Postmaster-General says he cannot give to this company more than two hundred and thirty-seven dollars and fifty cents per railroad mile of transportation, and twelve and a half per cent., less for transportation by steamboats., He considers himself as restricted by law to this amount; and he says, further, that he would not give more if he could, because in his apprehension it would not be fair and just., Your letter of December 27 was received a day or two ago., I am much obliged to you for the trouble you have taken, and promise to take in my little business there., As to speech making, by way of getting the hang of the House I made a little speech two or three days ago on a post-office question of no general interest., I find speaking here and elsewhere about the same thing., I was about as badly scared, and no worse as I am when I speak in court., I expect to make one within a week or two, in which I hope to succeed well enough to wish you to see it., It is very pleasant to learn from you that there are some who desire that I should be reelected., I most heartily thank them for their kind partiality; and I can say, as Mr. Clay said of the annexation of Texas, that ""personally I would not object"" to a reelection, although I thought at the time, and still think, it would be quite as well for me to return to the law at the end of a single term., I made the declaration that I would not be a candidate again, more from a wish to deal fairly with others, to keep peace among our friends, and to keep the district from going to the enemy, than for any cause personal to myself; so that if it should so happen that nobody else wishes to be elected, I could not refuse the people the right of sending me again., But to enter myself as a competitor of others, or to authorize any one so to enter me is what my word and honor forbid., I got some letters intimating a probability of so much difficulty amongst our friends as to lose us the district; but I remember such letters were written to Baker when my own case was under consideration, and I trust there is no more ground for such apprehension now than there was then., Remember I am always glad to receive a letter from you., Some if not all the gentlemen on the other side of the House who have addressed the committee within the last two days have spoken rather complainingly, if I have rightly understood them, of the vote given a week or ten days ago declaring that the war with Mexico was unnecessarily and unconstitutionally commenced by the President., I admit that such a vote should not be given in mere party wantonness, and that the one given is justly censurable if it have no other or better foundation., I am one of those who joined in that vote; and I did so under my best impression of the truth of the case., How I got this impression, and how it may possibly be remedied, I will now try to show., When the war began, it was my opinion that all those who because of knowing too little, or because of knowing too much, could not conscientiously approve the conduct of the President in the beginning of it should nevertheless, as good citizens and patriots, remain silent on that point, at least till the war should be ended., Some leading Democrats, including ex-President Van Buren, have taken this same view, as I understand them; and I adhered to it and acted upon it, until since I took my seat here; and I think I should still adhere to it were it not that the President and his friends will not allow it to be so., Besides the continual effort of the President to argue every silent vote given for supplies into an indorsement of the justice and wisdom of his conduct; besides that singularly candid paragraph in his late message in which he tells us that Congress with great unanimity had declared that ""by the act of the Republic of Mexico, a state of war exists between that government and the United States,"" when the same journals that informed him of this also informed him that when that declaration stood disconnected from the question of supplies sixty-seven in the House, and not fourteen merely, voted against it; besides this open attempt to prove by telling the truth what he could not prove by telling the whole truth-demanding of all who will not submit to be misrepresented, in justice to themselves, to speak out, besides all this, one of my colleagues [Mr. Richardson] at a very early day in the session brought in a set of resolutions expressly indorsing the original justice of the war on the part of the President., Upon these resolutions when they shall be put on their passage I shall be compelled to vote; so that I cannot be silent if I would., Seeing this, I went about preparing myself to give the vote understandingly when it should come., I carefully examined the President's message, to ascertain what he himself had said and proved upon the point., The result of this examination was to make the impression that, taking for true all the President states as facts, he falls far short of proving his justification; and that the President would have gone further with his proof if it had not been for the small matter that the truth would not permit him., Under the impression thus made I gave the vote before mentioned., I propose now to give concisely the process of the examination I made, and how I reached the conclusion I did., The President, in his first war message of May, 1846, declares that the soil was ours on which hostilities were commenced by Mexico, and he repeats that declaration almost in the same language in each successive annual message, thus showing that he deems that point a highly essential one., In the importance of that point I entirely agree with the President., To my judgment it is the very point upon which he should be justified, or condemned., In his message of December, 1846, it seems to have occurred to him, as is certainly true, that title-ownership-to soil or anything else is not a simple fact, but is a conclusion following on one or more simple facts; and that it was incumbent upon him to present the facts from which he concluded the soil was ours on which the first blood of the war was shed., Accordingly, a little below the middle of page twelve in the message last referred to, he enters upon that task; forming an issue and introducing testimony, extending the whole to a little below the middle of page fourteen., Now, I propose to try to show that the whole of this--issue and evidence--is from beginning to end the sheerest deception., The issue, as he presents it, is in these words: ""But there are those who, conceding all this to be true, assume the ground that the true western boundary of Texas is the Nueces, instead of the Rio Grande; and that, therefore, in marching our army to the east bank of the latter river, we passed the Texas line and invaded the territory of Mexico."", Now this issue is made up of two affirmatives and no negative., The main deception of it is that it assumes as true that one river or the other is necessarily the boundary; and cheats the superficial thinker entirely out of the idea that possibly the boundary is somewhere between the two, and not actually at either., A further deception is that it will let in evidence which a true issue would exclude., A true issue made by the President would be about as follows: ""I say the soil was ours, on which the first blood was shed; there are those who say it was not."", I now proceed to examine the President's evidence as applicable to such an issue., ...]"|3
12|"[But if he can not or will not do this,--if on any pretence or no pretence he shall refuse or omit it then I shall be fully convinced of what I more than suspect already that he is deeply conscious of being in the wrong; that he feels the blood of this war, like the blood of Abel, is crying to heaven against him; that originally having some strong motive--what, I will not stop now to give my opinion concerning to involve the two countries in a war, and trusting to escape scrutiny by fixing the public gaze upon the exceeding brightness of military glory,--that attractive rainbow that rises in showers of blood, that serpent's eye that charms to destroy,--he plunged into it, and was swept on and on till, disappointed in his calculation of the ease with which Mexico might be subdued, he now finds himself he knows not where., How like the half insane mumbling of a fever dream is the whole war part of his late message!, At one time telling us that Mexico has nothing whatever that we can get--but territory; at another showing us how we can support the war by levying contributions on Mexico., At one time urging the national honor, the security of the future, the prevention of foreign interference, and even the good of Mexico herself as among the objects of the war; at another telling us that ""to reject indemnity, by refusing to accept a cession of territory, would be to abandon all our just demands, and to wage the war, bearing all its expenses, without a purpose or definite object."", So then this national honor, security of the future, and everything but territorial indemnity may be considered the no-purposes and indefinite objects of the war!, But, having it now settled that territorial indemnity is the only object, we are urged to seize, by legislation here, all that he was content to take a few months ago, and the whole province of Lower California to boot, and to still carry on the war to take all we are fighting for, and still fight on., Again, the President is resolved under all circumstances to have full territorial indemnity for the expenses of the war; but he forgets to tell us how we are to get the excess after those expenses shall have surpassed the value of the whole of the Mexican territory., So again, he insists that the separate national existence of Mexico shall be maintained; but he does not tell us how this can be done, after we shall have taken all her territory., Lest the questions I have suggested be considered speculative merely, let me be indulged a moment in trying to show they are not., The war has gone on some twenty months; for the expenses of which, together with an inconsiderable old score, the President now claims about one half of the Mexican territory, and that by far the better half, so far as concerns our ability to make anything out of it., It is comparatively uninhabited; so that we could establish land-offices in it, and raise some money in that way., But the other half is already inhabited, as I understand it, tolerably densely for the nature of the country, and all its lands, or all that are valuable, already appropriated as private property., How then are we to make anything out of these lands with this encumbrance on them?, or how remove the encumbrance?, I suppose no one would say we should kill the people, or drive them out, or make slaves of them, or confiscate their property., How, then, can we make much out of this part of the territory?, If the prosecution of the war has in expenses already equalled the better half of the country, how long its future prosecution will be in equalling the less valuable half is not a speculative, but a practical, question, pressing closely upon us., And yet it is a question which the President seems never to have thought of., As to the mode of terminating the war and securing peace, the President is equally wandering and indefinite., First, it is to be done by a more vigorous prosecution of the war in the vital parts of the enemy's country; and after apparently talking himself tired on this point, the President drops down into a half-despairing tone, and tells us that ""with a people distracted and divided by contending factions, and a government subject to constant changes by successive revolutions, the continued success of our arms may fail to secure a satisfactory peace."", Then he suggests the propriety of wheedling the Mexican people to desert the counsels of their own leaders, and, trusting in our protestations, to set up a government from which we can secure a satisfactory peace; telling us that ""this may become the only mode of obtaining such a peace."", But soon he falls into doubt of this too; and then drops back on to the already half-abandoned ground of ""more vigorous prosecution."", All this shows that the President is in nowise satisfied with his own positions., First he takes up one, and in attempting to argue us into it he argues himself out of it, then seizes another and goes through the same process, and then, confused at being able to think of nothing new, he snatches up the old one again, which he has some time before cast off., His mind, taxed beyond its power, is running hither and thither, like some tortured creature on a burning surface, finding no position on which it can settle down and be at ease., Again, it is a singular omission in this message that it nowhere intimates when the President expects the war to terminate., At its beginning, General Scott was by this same President driven into disfavor if not disgrace, for intimating that peace could not be conquered in less than three or four months., But now, at the end of about twenty months, during which time our arms have given us the most splendid successes, every department and every part, land and water, officers and privates, regulars and volunteers, doing all that men could do, and hundreds of things which it had ever before been thought men could not do--after all this, this same President gives a long message, without showing us that as to the end he himself has even an imaginary conception., As I have before said, he knows not where he is., He is a bewildered, confounded, and miserably perplexed man., God grant he may be able to show there is not something about his conscience more painful than his mental perplexity., The Committee on the Post-office and Post Roads, to whom was referred the petition of Messrs. Saltmarsh and Fuller, report: That, as proved to their satisfaction, the mail routes from Milledgeville to Athens, and from Warrenton to Decatur, in the State of Georgia (numbered 2366 and 2380), were let to Reeside and Avery at $1300 per annum for the former and $1500 for the latter, for the term of four years, to commence on the first day of January, 1835; that, previous to the time for commencing the service, Reeside sold his interest therein to Avery; that on the 5th of May, 1835, Avery sold the whole to these petitioners, Saltmarsh and Fuller, to take effect from the beginning, January a 1835; that at this time, the Assistant Postmaster-General, being called on for that purpose, consented to the transfer of the contracts from Reeside and Avery to these petitioners, and promised to have proper entries of the transfer made on the books of the department, which, however, was neglected to be done; that the petitioners, supposing all was right, in good faith commenced the transportation of the mail on these routes, and after difficulty arose, still trusting that all would be made right, continued the service till December a 1837; that they performed the service to the entire satisfaction of the department, and have never been paid anything for it except $----; that the difficulty occurred as follows:  Mr. Barry was Postmaster-General at the times of making the contracts and the attempted transfer of them; Mr. Kendall succeeded Mr. Barry, and finding Reeside apparently in debt to the department, and these contracts still standing in the names of Reeside and Avery, refused to pay for the services under them, otherwise than by credits to Reeside; afterward, however, he divided the compensation, still crediting one half to Reeside, and directing the other to be paid to the order of Avery, who disclaimed all right to it., After discontinuing the service, these petitioners, supposing they might have legal redress against Avery, brought suit against him in New Orleans; in which suit they failed, on the ground that Avery had complied with his contract, having done so much toward the transfer as they had accepted and been satisfied with., Still later the department sued Reeside on his supposed indebtedness, and by a verdict of the jury it was determined that the department was indebted to him in a sum much beyond all the credits given him on the account above stated., Under these circumstances, the committee consider the petitioners clearly entitled to relief, and they report a bill accordingly; lest, however, there should be some mistake as to the amount which they have already received, we so frame it as that, by adjustment at the department, they may be paid so much as remains unpaid for services actually performed by them not charging them with the credits given to Reeside., The committee think it not improbable that the petitioners purchased the right of Avery to be paid for the service from the 1st of January, till their purchase on May 11, 1835; but, the evidence on this point being very vague, they forbear to report in favor of allowing it., Inclosed you find a letter of Louis W. Chandler., What is wanted is that you shall ascertain whether the claim upon the note described has received any dividend in the Probate Court of Christian County, where the estate of Mr. Overbon Williams has been administered on., If nothing is paid on it, withdraw the note and send it to me, so that Chandler can see the indorser of it., At all events write me all about it, till I can somehow get it off my hands., I have already been bored more than enough about it; not the least of which annoyance is his cursed, unreadable, and ungodly handwriting., I have made a speech, a copy of which I will send you by next mail., Your letter of the 19th ultimo was received last night, and for which I am much obliged., The only thing in it that I wish to talk to you at once about is that because of my vote for Ashmun's amendment you fear that you and I disagree about the war., I regret this, not because of any fear we shall remain disagreed after you have read this letter, but because if you misunderstand I fear other good friends may also., That vote affirms that the war was unnecessarily and unconstitutionally commenced by the President; and I will stake my life that if you had been in my place you would have voted just as I did., Would you have voted what you felt and knew to be a lie?, I know you would not., Would you have gone out of the House--skulked the vote?, I expect not., If you had skulked one vote, you would have had to skulk many more before the end of the session., Richardson's resolutions, introduced before I made any move or gave any vote upon the subject, make the direct question of the justice of the war; so that no man can be silent if he would., You are compelled to speak; and your only alternative is to tell the truth or a lie., I cannot doubt which you would do., This vote has nothing to do in determining my votes on the questions of supplies., I have always intended, and still intend, to vote supplies; perhaps not in the precise form recommended by the President, but in a better form for all purposes, except Locofoco party purposes., It is in this particular you seem mistaken., The Locos are untiring in their efforts to make the impression that all who vote supplies or take part in the war do of necessity approve the President's conduct in the beginning of it; but the Whigs have from the beginning made and kept the distinction between the two., In the very first act nearly all the Whigs voted against the preamble declaring that war existed by the act of Mexico; and yet nearly all of them voted for the supplies., As to the Whig men who have participated in the war, so far as they have spoken in my hearing they do not hesitate to denounce as unjust the President's conduct in the beginning of the war., They do not suppose that such denunciation is directed by undying hatred to him, as The Register would have it believed., There are two such Whigs on this floor (Colonel Haskell and Major James) The former fought as a colonel by the side of Colonel Baker at Cerro Gordo, and stands side by side with me in the vote that you seem dissatisfied with., The latter, the history of whose capture with Cassius Clay you well know, had not arrived here when that vote was given; but, as I understand, he stands ready to give just such a vote whenever an occasion shall present., Baker, too, who is now here, says the truth is undoubtedly that way; and whenever he shall speak out, he will say so., Colonel Doniphan, too, the favorite Whig of Missouri, and who overran all Northern Mexico, on his return home in a public speech at St. Louis condemned the administration in relation to the war., If I remember, G. T. M. Davis, who has been through almost the whole war, declares in favor of Mr. Clay; from which I infer that he adopts the sentiments of Mr. Clay, generally at least., On the other hand, I have heard of but one Whig who has been to the war attempting to justify the President's conduct., That one was Captain Bishop, editor of the Charleston Courier, and a very clever fellow., I do not mean this letter for the public, but for you., Before it reaches you, you will have seen and read my pamphlet speech, and perhaps been scared anew by it., After you get over your scare, read it over again, sentence by sentence, and tell me honestly what you think of it., I condensed all I could for fear of being cut off by the hour rule, and when I got through I had spoken but forty-five minutes., I just take my pen to say that Mr. Stephens, of Georgia, a little, slim, pale-faced, consumptive man, with a voice like Logan's, has just concluded the very best speech of an hour's length I ever heard., My old withered dry eyes are full of tears yet., If he writes it out anything like he delivered it, our people shall see a good many copies of it., Your letter of the 29th January was received last night., Being exclusively a constitutional argument, I wish to submit some reflections upon it in the same spirit of kindness that I know actuates you., Let me first state what I understand to be your position., It is that if it shall become necessary to repel invasion, the President may, without violation of the Constitution, cross the line and invade the territory of another country, and that whether such necessity exists in any given case the President is the sole judge., Before going further consider well whether this is or is not your position., If it is, it is a position that neither the President himself, nor any friend of his, so far as I know, has ever taken., Their only positions are--first, that the soil was ours when the hostilities commenced; and second, that whether it was rightfully ours or not, Congress had annexed it, and the President for that reason was bound to defend it; both of which are as clearly proved to be false in fact as you can prove that your house is mine., The soil was not ours, and Congress did not annex or attempt to annex it., But to return to your position., Allow the President to invade a neighboring nation whenever he shall deem it necessary to repel an invasion, and you allow him to do so whenever he may choose to say he deems it necessary for such purpose, and you allow him to make war at pleasure., Study to see if you can fix any limit to his power in this respect, after having given him so much as you propose., If to-day he should choose to say he thinks it necessary to invade Canada to prevent the British from invading us, how could you stop him?, You may say to him,--""I see no probability of the British invading us""; but he will say to you, ""Be silent: I see it, if you don't."", The provision of the Constitution giving the war making power to Congress was dictated, as I understand it, by the following reasons: kings had always been involving and impoverishing their people in wars, pretending generally, if not always, that the good of the people was the object., This our convention understood to be the most oppressive of all kingly oppressions, and they resolved to so frame the Constitution that no one man should hold the power of bringing this oppression upon us., But your view destroys the whole matter, and places our President where kings have always stood., Write soon again., The Committee on the Post-office and Post Roads, to whom was referred the resolution of the House of Representatives entitled ""An Act authorizing postmasters at county seats of justice to receive subscriptions for newspapers and periodicals, to be paid through the agency of the Post-office Department, and for other purposes,"" beg leave to submit the following report:  The committee have reason to believe that a general wish pervades the community at large that some such facility as the proposed measure should be granted by express law, for subscribing, through the agency of the Post-office Department, to newspapers and periodicals which diffuse daily, weekly, or monthly intelligence of passing events., Compliance with this general wish is deemed to be in accordance with our republican institutions, which can be best sustained by the diffusion of knowledge and the due encouragement of a universal, national spirit of inquiry and discussion of public events through the medium of the public press., The committee, however, has not been insensible to its duty of guarding the Post-office Department against injurious sacrifices for the accomplishment of this object, whereby its ordinary efficacy might be impaired or embarrassed., It has therefore been a subject of much consideration; but it is now confidently hoped that the bill herewith submitted effectually obviates all objections which might exist with regard to a less matured proposition., The committee learned, upon inquiry, that the Post-office Department, in view of meeting the general wish on this subject, made the experiment through one if its own internal regulations, when the new postage system went into operation on the first of July, 1845, and that it was continued until the thirtieth of September, 1847., But this experiment, for reasons hereafter stated, proved unsatisfactory, and it was discontinued by order of the Postmaster-General., As far as the committee can at present ascertain, the following seem to have been the principal grounds of dissatisfaction in this experiment:  (1) The legal responsibility of postmasters receiving newspaper subscriptions, or of their sureties, was not defined., (2) The authority was open to all postmasters instead of being limited to those of specific offices., ...]"|3
13|"[General Ashley, in the Senate from Arkansas, died yesterday., Nothing else new beyond what you see in the papers., Not in view of all the facts., There are facts which you have kept out of view., It is a fact that the United States army in marching to the Rio Grande marched into a peaceful Mexican settlement, and frightened the inhabitants away from their homes and their growing crops., It is a fact that Fort Brown, opposite Matamoras, was built by that army within a Mexican cotton-field, on which at the time the army reached it a young cotton crop was growing, and which crop was wholly destroyed and the field itself greatly and permanently injured by ditches, embankments, and the like., It is a fact that when the Mexicans captured Captain Thornton and his command, they found and captured them within another Mexican field., Now I wish to bring these facts to your notice, and to ascertain what is the result of your reflections upon them., If you deny that they are facts, I think I can furnish proofs which shall convince you that you are mistaken., If you admit that they are facts, then I shall be obliged for a reference to any law of language, law of States, law of nations, law of morals, law of religions, any law, human or divine, in which an authority can be found for saying those facts constitute ""no aggression."", Possibly you consider those acts too small for notice., Would you venture to so consider them had they been committed by any nation on earth against the humblest of our people?, I know you would not., Then I ask, is the precept ""Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them"" obsolete?, of no force?, of no application?, On my return from Philadelphia, where I had been attending the nomination of ""Old Rough,"" (Zachary Taylor) I found your letter in a mass of others which had accumulated in my absence., By many, and often, it had been said they would not abide the nomination of Taylor; but since the deed has been done, they are fast falling in, and in my opinion we shall have a most overwhelming, glorious triumph., One unmistakable sign is that all the odds and ends are with us--Barnburners, Native Americans, Tyler men, disappointed office-seeking Locofocos, and the Lord knows what., This is important, if in nothing else, in showing which way the wind blows., Some of the sanguine men have set down all the States as certain for Taylor but Illinois, and it as doubtful., Cannot something be done even in Illinois?, Taylor's nomination takes the Locos on the blind side., It turns the war thunder against them., The war is now to them the gallows of Haman, which they built for us, and on which they are doomed to be hanged themselves., Excuse this short letter., I have so many to write that I cannot devote much time to any one., I wish at all times in no way to practise any fraud upon the House or the committee, and I also desire to do nothing which may be very disagreeable to any of the members., I therefore state in advance that my object in taking the floor is to make a speech on the general subject of internal improvements; and if I am out of order in doing so, I give the chair an opportunity of so deciding, and I will take my seat., At an early day of this session the President sent us what may properly be called an internal improvement veto message., The late Democratic convention, which sat at Baltimore, and which nominated General Cass for the Presidency, adopted a set of resolutions, now called the Democratic platform, among which is one in these words:  These things, taken together, show that the question of internal improvements is now more distinctly made--has become more intense--than at any former period., The veto message and the Baltimore resolution I understand to be, in substance, the same thing; the latter being the more general statement, of which the former is the amplification the bill of particulars., While I know there are many Democrats, on this floor and elsewhere, who disapprove that message, I understand that all who voted for General Cass will thereafter be counted as having approved it, as having indorsed all its doctrines., I suppose all, or nearly all, the Democrats will vote for him., Many of them will do so not because they like his position on this question, but because they prefer him, being wrong on this, to another whom they consider farther wrong on other questions., In this way the internal improvement Democrats are to be, by a sort of forced consent, carried over and arrayed against themselves on this measure of policy., General Cass, once elected, will not trouble himself to make a constitutional argument, or perhaps any argument at all, when he shall veto a river or harbor bill; he will consider it a sufficient answer to all Democratic murmurs to point to Mr. Polk's message, and to the Democratic platform., This being the case, the question of improvements is verging to a final crisis; and the friends of this policy must now battle, and battle manfully, or surrender all., In this view, humble as I am, I wish to review, and contest as well as I may, the general positions of this veto message., When I say general positions, I mean to exclude from consideration so much as relates to the present embarrassed state of the treasury in consequence of the Mexican War., Those general positions are: that internal improvements ought not to be made by the General Government--First., Because they would overwhelm the treasury Second., Because, while their burdens would be general, their benefits would be local and partial, involving an obnoxious inequality; and Third., Because they would be unconstitutional., Fourth., Because the States may do enough by the levy and collection of tonnage duties; or if not--Fifth., That the Constitution may be amended., ""Do nothing at all, lest you do something wrong,"" is the sum of these positions is the sum of this message., And this, with the exception of what is said about constitutionality, applying as forcibly to what is said about making improvements by State authority as by the national authority; so that we must abandon the improvements of the country altogether, by any and every authority, or we must resist and repudiate the doctrines of this message., Let us attempt the latter., The first position is, that a system of internal improvements would overwhelm the treasury., That in such a system there is a tendency to undue expansion, is not to be denied., Such tendency is founded in the nature of the subject., A member of Congress will prefer voting for a bill which contains an appropriation for his district, to voting for one which does not; and when a bill shall be expanded till every district shall be provided for, that it will be too greatly expanded is obvious., But is this any more true in Congress than in a State Legislature?, If a member of Congress must have an appropriation for his district, so a member of a Legislature must have one for his county., And if one will overwhelm the national treasury, so the other will overwhelm the State treasury., Go where we will, the difficulty is the same., Allow it to drive us from the halls of Congress, and it will, just as easily, drive us from the State Legislatures., Let us, then, grapple with it, and test its strength., Let us, judging of the future by the past, ascertain whether there may not be, in the discretion of Congress, a sufficient power to limit and restrain this expansive tendency within reasonable and proper bounds., The President himself values the evidence of the past., He tells us that at a certain point of our history more than two hundred millions of dollars had been applied for to make improvements; and this he does to prove that the treasury would be overwhelmed by such a system., Why did he not tell us how much was granted?, Would not that have been better evidence?, Let us turn to it, and see what it proves., In the message the President tells us that ""during the four succeeding years embraced by the administration of President Adams, the power not only to appropriate money, but to apply it, under the direction and authority of the General Government, as well to the construction of roads as to the improvement of harbors and rivers, was fully asserted and exercised."", This, then, was the period of greatest enormity., These, if any, must have been the days of the two hundred millions., And how much do you suppose was really expended for improvements during that four years?, Two hundred millions?, One hundred?, Fifty?, Ten?, Five?, No, sir; less than two millions., As shown by authentic documents, the expenditures on improvements during 1825, 1826, 1827, and 1828 amounted to one million eight hundred and seventy-nine thousand six hundred and twenty-seven dollars and one cent., These four years were the period of Mr. Adams's administration, nearly and substantially., This fact shows that when the power to make improvements ""was fully asserted and exercised,"" the Congress did keep within reasonable limits; and what has been done, it seems to me, can be done again., Now for the second portion of the message--namely, that the burdens of improvements would be general, while their benefits would be local and partial, involving an obnoxious inequality., That there is some degree of truth in this position, I shall not deny., No commercial object of government patronage can be so exclusively general as to not be of some peculiar local advantage., The navy, as I understand it, was established, and is maintained at a great annual expense, partly to be ready for war when war shall come, and partly also, and perhaps chiefly, for the protection of our commerce on the high seas., This latter object is, for all I can see, in principle the same as internal improvements., The driving a pirate from the track of commerce on the broad ocean, and the removing of a snag from its more narrow path in the Mississippi River, cannot, I think, be distinguished in principle., Each is done to save life and property, and for nothing else., The navy, then, is the most general in its benefits of all this class of objects; and yet even the navy is of some peculiar advantage to Charleston, Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York, and Boston, beyond what it is to the interior towns of Illinois., The next most general object I can think of would be improvements on the Mississippi River and its tributaries., They touch thirteen of our States-Pennsylvania, Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee, Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Wisconsin, and Iowa., Now I suppose it will not be denied that these thirteen States are a little more interested in improvements on that great river than are the remaining seventeen., These instances of the navy and the Mississippi River show clearly that there is something of local advantage in the most general objects., But the converse is also true., Nothing is so local as to not be of some general benefit., Take, for instance, the Illinois and Michigan Canal., Considered apart from its effects, it is perfectly local., Every inch of it is within the State of Illinois., That canal was first opened for business last April., In a very few days we were all gratified to learn, among other things, that sugar had been carried from New Orleans through this canal to Buffalo in New York., This sugar took this route, doubtless, because it was cheaper than the old route., Supposing benefit of the reduction in the cost of carriage to be shared between seller and the buyer, result is that the New Orleans merchant sold his sugar a little dearer, and the people of Buffalo sweetened their coffee a little cheaper, than before,--a benefit resulting from the canal, not to Illinois, where the canal is, but to Louisiana and New York, where it is not., ...]"|3
14|"[I wish now to submit a few remarks on the general proposition of amending the Constitution., As a general rule, I think we would much better let it alone., No slight occasion should tempt us to touch it., Better not take the first step, which may lead to a habit of altering it., Better, rather, habituate ourselves to think of it as unalterable., It can scarcely be made better than it is., New provisions would introduce new difficulties, and thus create and increase appetite for further change., No, sir; let it stand as it is., New hands have never touched it., The men who made it have done their work, and have passed away., Who shall improve on what they did?, Mr. Chairman, for the purpose of reviewing this message in the least possible time, as well as for the sake of distinctness, I have analyzed its arguments as well as I could, and reduced them to the propositions I have stated., I have now examined them in detail., I wish to detain the committee only a little while longer with some general remarks upon the subject of improvements., That the subject is a difficult one, cannot be denied., Still it is no more difficult in Congress than in the State Legislatures, in the counties, or in the smallest municipal districts which anywhere exist., All can recur to instances of this difficulty in the case of county roads, bridges, and the like., One man is offended because a road passes over his land, and another is offended because it does not pass over his; one is dissatisfied because the bridge for which he is taxed crosses the river on a different road from that which leads from his house to town; another cannot bear that the county should be got in debt for these same roads and bridges; while not a few struggle hard to have roads located over their lands, and then stoutly refuse to let them be opened until they are first paid the damages., Even between the different wards and streets of towns and cities we find this same wrangling and difficulty., Now these are no other than the very difficulties against which, and out of which, the President constructs his objections of ""inequality,"" ""speculation,"" and ""crushing the treasury."", There is but a single alternative about them: they are sufficient, or they are not., If sufficient, they are sufficient out of Congress as well as in it, and there is the end., We must reject them as insufficient, or lie down and do nothing by any authority., Then, difficulty though there be, let us meet and encounter it., ""Attempt the end, and never stand to doubt; nothing so hard, but search will find it out."", Determine that the thing can and shall be done, and then we shall find the way., The tendency to undue expansion is unquestionably the chief difficulty., How to do something, and still not do too much, is the desideratum., Let each contribute his mite in the way of suggestion., The late Silas Wright, in a letter to the Chicago convention, contributed his, which was worth something; and I now contribute mine, which may be worth nothing., At all events, it will mislead nobody, and therefore will do no harm., I would not borrow money., I am against an overwhelming, crushing system., Suppose that, at each session, Congress shall first determine how much money can, for that year, be spared for improvements; then apportion that sum to the most important objects., So far all is easy; but how shall we determine which are the most important?, On this question comes the collision of interests., I shall be slow to acknowledge that your harbor or your river is more important than mine, and vice versa., To clear this difficulty, let us have that same statistical information which the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. Vinton] suggested at the beginning of this session., In that information we shall have a stern, unbending basis of facts--a basis in no wise subject to whim, caprice, or local interest., The prelimited amount of means will save us from doing too much, and the statistics will save us from doing what we do in wrong places., Adopt and adhere to this course, and, it seems to me, the difficulty is cleared., One of the gentlemen from South Carolina [Mr. Rhett] very much deprecates these statistics., He particularly objects, as I understand him, to counting all the pigs and chickens in the land., I do not perceive much force in the objection., It is true that if everything be enumerated, a portion of such statistics may not be very useful to this object., Such products of the country as are to be consumed where they are produced need no roads or rivers, no means of transportation, and have no very proper connection with this subject., The surplus--that which is produced in one place to be consumed in another; the capacity of each locality for producing a greater surplus; the natural means of transportation, and their susceptibility of improvement; the hindrances, delays, and losses of life and property during transportation, and the causes of each, would be among the most valuable statistics in this connection., From these it would readily appear where a given amount of expenditure would do the most good., These statistics might be equally accessible, as they would be equally useful, to both the nation and the States., In this way, and by these means, let the nation take hold of the larger works, and the States the smaller ones; and thus, working in a meeting direction, discreetly, but steadily and firmly, what is made unequal in one place may be equalized in another, extravagance avoided, and the whole country put on that career of prosperity which shall correspond with its extent of territory, its natural resources, and the intelligence and enterprise of its people., Last night I was attending a sort of caucus of the Whig members, held in relation to the coming Presidential election., The whole field of the nation was scanned, and all is high hope and confidence., Illinois is expected to better her condition in this race., Under these circumstances, judge how heartrending it was to come to my room and find and read your discouraging letter of the 15th., We have made no gains, but have lost ""H. R. Robinson, Turner, Campbell, and four or five more."", Tell Arney to reconsider, if he would be saved., Baker and I used to do something, but I think you attach more importance to our absence than is just., There is another cause., In 1840, for instance, we had two senators and five representatives in Sangamon; now we have part of one senator and two representatives., With quite one third more people than we had then, we have only half the sort of offices which are sought by men of the speaking sort of talent., This, I think, is the chief cause., Now, as to the young men., You must not wait to be brought forward by the older men., For instance, do you suppose that I should ever have got into notice if I had waited to be hunted up and pushed forward by older men?, You young men get together and form a ""Rough and Ready Club,"" and have regular meetings and speeches., Take in everybody you can get., Harrison Grimsley, L. A. Enos, Lee Kimball, and C. W. Matheny will do to begin the thing; but as you go along gather up all the shrewd, wild boys about town, whether just of age, or a little under age, Chris., Logan, Reddick Ridgely, Lewis Zwizler, and hundreds such., Let every one play the part he can play best,--some speak, some sing, and all ""holler."", Your meetings will be of evenings; the older men, and the women, will go to hear you; so that it will not only contribute to the election of ""Old Zach,"" but will be an interesting pastime, and improving to the intellectual faculties of all engaged., Don't fail to do this., You ask me to send you all the speeches made about ""Old Zach,"" the war, etc., Now this makes me a little impatient., I have regularly sent you the Congressional Globe and Appendix, and you cannot have examined them, or you would have discovered that they contain every speech made by every man in both houses of Congress, on every subject, during the session., Can I send any more?, Can I send speeches that nobody has made?, Thinking it would be most natural that the newspapers would feel interested to give at least some of the speeches to their readers, I at the beginning of the session made arrangements to have one copy of the Globe and Appendix regularly sent to each Whig paper of the district., And yet, with the exception of my own little speech, which was published in two only of the then five, now four, Whig papers, I do not remember having seen a single speech, or even extract from one, in any single one of those papers., With equal and full means on both sides, I will venture that the State Register has thrown before its readers more of Locofoco speeches in a month than all the Whig papers of the district have done of Whig speeches during the session., If you wish a full understanding of the war, I repeat what I believe I said to you in a letter once before, that the whole, or nearly so, is to be found in the speech of Dixon of Connecticut., This I sent you in pamphlet as well as in the Globe., Examine and study every sentence of that speech thoroughly, and you will understand the whole subject., You ask how Congress came to declare that war had existed by the act of Mexico., Is it possible you don't understand that yet?, You have at least twenty speeches in your possession that fully explain it., I will, however, try it once more., The news reached Washington of the commencement of hostilities on the Rio Grande, and of the great peril of General Taylor's army., Everybody, Whigs and Democrats, was for sending them aid, in men and money., It was necessary to pass a bill for this., The Locos had a majority in both houses, and they brought in a bill with a preamble saying: Whereas, War exists by the act of Mexico, therefore we send General Taylor money., The Whigs moved to strike out the preamble, so that they could vote to send the men and money, without saying anything about how the war commenced; but being in the minority, they were voted down, and the preamble was retained., Then, on the passage of the bill, the question came upon them, Shall we vote for preamble and bill together, or against both together?, They did not want to vote against sending help to General Taylor, and therefore they voted for both together., Is there any difficulty in understanding this?, Even my little speech shows how this was; and if you will go to the library, you may get the Journal of 1845-46, in which you will find the whole for yourself., We have nothing published yet with special reference to the Taylor race; but we soon will have, and then I will send them to everybody., I made an internal-improvement speech day before yesterday, which I shall send home as soon as I can get it written out and printed,--and which I suppose nobody will read., I feel nwilling to be either unjust or ungenerous, and he wanted to understand the real case of this judicial officer., The gentleman from Virginia had stated that he had to hold eleven courts., Now everybody knew that it was not the habit of the district judges of the United States in other States to hold anything like that number of courts; and he therefore took it for granted that this must happen under a peculiar law which required that large number of courts to be holden every year; and these laws, he further supposed, were passed at the request of the people of that judicial district., ...]"|3
15|"[I understand your idea that if a Presidential candidate avow his opinion upon a given question, or rather upon all questions, and the people, with full knowledge of this, elect him, they thereby distinctly approve all those opinions., By means of it, measures are adopted or rejected contrary to the wishes of the whole of one party, and often nearly half of the other., Three, four, or half a dozen questions are prominent at a given time; the party selects its candidate, and he takes his position on each of these questions., On all but one his positions have already been indorsed at former elections, and his party fully committed to them; but that one is new, and a large portion of them are against it., But what are they to do?, The whole was strung together; and they must take all, or reject all., They cannot take what they like, and leave the rest., What they are already committed to being the majority, they shut their eyes, and gulp the whole., Next election, still another is introduced in the same way., If we run our eyes along the line of the past, we shall see that almost if not quite all the articles of the present Democratic creed have been at first forced upon the party in this very way., And just now, and just so, opposition to internal improvements is to be established if General Cass shall be elected., Almost half the Democrats here are for improvements; but they will vote for Cass, and if he succeeds, their vote will have aided in closing the doors against improvements., Now this is a process which we think is wrong., We prefer a candidate who, like General Taylor, will allow the people to have their own way, regardless of his private opinions; and I should think the internal-improvement Democrats, at least, ought to prefer such a candidate., He would force nothing on them which they don't want, and he would allow them to have improvements which their own candidate, if elected, will not., Mr. Speaker, I have said General Taylor's position is as well defined as is that of General Cass., In saying this, I admit I do not certainly know what he would do on the Wilmot Proviso., I am a Northern man or rather a Western Free-State man, with a constituency I believe to be, and with personal feelings I know to be, against the extension of slavery., As such, and with what information I have, I hope and believe General Taylor, if elected, would not veto the proviso., But I do not know it., Yet if I knew he would, I still would vote for him., I should do so because, in my judgment, his election alone can defeat General Cass; and because, should slavery thereby go to the territory we now have, just so much will certainly happen by the election of Cass, and in addition a course of policy leading to new wars, new acquisitions of territory and still further extensions of slavery., One of the two is to be President., Which is preferable?, But there is as much doubt of Cass on improvements as there is of Taylor on the proviso., I have no doubt myself of General Cass on this question; but I know the Democrats differ among themselves as to his position., My internal-improvement colleague [Mr. Wentworth] stated on this floor the other day that he was satisfied Cass was for improvements, because he had voted for all the bills that he [Mr. Wentworth] had., So far so good., But Mr. Polk vetoed some of these very bills., The Baltimore convention passed a set of resolutions, among other things, approving these vetoes, and General Cass declares, in his letter accepting the nomination, that he has carefully read these resolutions, and that he adheres to them as firmly as he approves them cordially., In other words, General Cass voted for the bills, and thinks the President did right to veto them; and his friends here are amiable enough to consider him as being on one side or the other, just as one or the other may correspond with their own respective inclinations., My colleague admits that the platform declares against the constitutionality of a general system of improvements, and that General Cass indorses the platform; but he still thinks General Cass is in favor of some sort of improvements., Well, what are they?, As he is against general objects, those he is for must be particular and local., Now this is taking the subject precisely by the wrong end., Particularity expending the money of the whole people for an object which will benefit only a portion of them--is the greatest real objection to improvements, and has been so held by General Jackson, Mr. Polk, and all others, I believe, till now., But now, behold, the objects most general--nearest free from this objection--are to be rejected, while those most liable to it are to be embraced., To return: I cannot help believing that General Cass, when he wrote his letter of acceptance, well understood he was to be claimed by the advocates of both sides of this question, and that he then closed the door against all further expressions of opinion purposely to retain the benefits of that double position., His subsequent equivocation at Cleveland, to my mind, proves such to have been the case., One word more, and I shall have done with this branch of the subject., You Democrats, and your candidate, in the main are in favor of laying down in advance a platform--a set of party positions--as a unit, and then of forcing the people, by every sort of appliance, to ratify them, however unpalatable some of them may be., We and our candidate are in favor of making Presidential elections and the legislation of the country distinct matters; so that the people can elect whom they please, and afterward legislate just as they please, without any hindrance, save only so much as may guard against infractions of the Constitution, undue haste, and want of consideration., The difference between us is clear as noonday., That we are right we cannot doubt., We hold the true Republican position., In leaving the people's business in their hands, we cannot be wrong., We are willing, and even anxious, to go to the people on this issue., But I suppose I cannot reasonably hope to convince you that we have any principles., The most I can expect is to assure you that we think we have and are quite contented with them., The other day one of the gentlemen from Georgia [Mr. Iverson], an eloquent man, and a man of learning, so far as I can judge, not being learned myself, came down upon us astonishingly., He spoke in what the 'Baltimore American' calls the ""scathing and withering style."", At the end of his second severe flash I was struck blind, and found myself feeling with my fingers for an assurance of my continued existence., A little of the bone was left, and I gradually revived., He eulogized Mr. Clay in high and beautiful terms, and then declared that we had deserted all our principles, and had turned Henry Clay out, like an old horse, to root., This is terribly severe., It cannot be answered by argument--at least I cannot so answer it., I merely wish to ask the gentleman if the Whigs are the only party he can think of who sometimes turn old horses out to root., Is not a certain Martin Van Buren an old horse which your own party have turned out to root?, and is he not rooting a little to your discomfort about now?, But in not nominating Mr. Clay we deserted our principles, you say., Ah!, In what?, Tell us, ye men of principle, what principle we violated., We say you did violate principle in discarding Van Buren, and we can tell you how., You violated the primary, the cardinal, the one great living principle of all democratic representative government--the principle that the representative is bound to carry out the known will of his constituents., A large majority of the Baltimore convention of 1844 were, by their constituents, instructed to procure Van Buren 's nomination if they could., In violation--in utter glaring contempt of this, you rejected him; rejected him, as the gentleman from New York [Mr. Birdsall] the other day expressly admitted, for availability--that same ""general availability"" which you charge upon us, and daily chew over here, as something exceedingly odious and unprincipled., But the gentleman from Georgia [Mr. Iverson] gave us a second speech yesterday, all well considered and put down in writing, in which Van Buren was scathed and withered a ""few"" for his present position and movements., I cannot remember the gentleman's precise language; but I do remember he put Van Buren down, down, till he got him where he was finally to ""stink"" and ""rot."", Mr. Speaker, it is no business or inclination of mine to defend Martin Van Buren in the war of extermination now waging between him and his old admirers., I say, ""Devil take the hindmost""--and the foremost., But there is no mistaking the origin of the breach; and if the curse of ""stinking"" and ""rotting"" is to fall on the first and greatest violators of principle in the matter, I disinterestedly suggest that the gentleman from Georgia and his present co-workers are bound to take it upon themselves., But the gentleman from Georgia further says we have deserted all our principles, and taken shelter under General Taylor's military coat-tail, and he seems to think this is exceedingly degrading., Well, as his faith is, so be it unto him., But can he remember no other military coat-tail under which a certain other party have been sheltering for near a quarter of a century?, Has he no acquaintance with the ample military coat tail of General Jackson?, Does he not know that his own party have run the five last Presidential races under that coat-tail, and that they are now running the sixth under the same cover?, Yes, sir, that coat-tail was used not only for General Jackson himself, but has been clung to, with the grip of death, by every Democratic candidate since., You have never ventured, and dare not now venture, from under it., Your campaign papers have constantly been ""Old Hickories,"" with rude likenesses of the old general upon them; hickory poles and hickory brooms your never-ending emblems; Mr. Polk himself was ""Young Hickory,"" or something so; and even now your campaign paper here is proclaiming that Cass and Butler are of the true ""Hickory stripe."", Now, sir, you dare not give it up., Like a horde of hungry ticks you have stuck to the tail of the Hermitage Lion to the end of his life; and you are still sticking to it, and drawing a loathsome sustenance from it, after he is dead., A fellow once advertised that he had made a discovery by which he could make a new man out of an old one, and have enough of the stuff left to make a little yellow dog., Just such a discovery has General Jackson's popularity been to you., You not only twice made President of him out of it, but you have had enough of the stuff left to make Presidents of several comparatively small men since; and it is your chief reliance now to make still another., Mr. Speaker, old horses and military coat-tails, or tails of any sort, are not figures of speech such as I would be the first to introduce into discussions here; but as the gentleman from Georgia has thought fit to introduce them, he and you are welcome to all you have made, or can make by them., If you have any more old horses, trot them out; any more tails, just cock them and come at us., I repeat, I would not introduce this mode of discussion here; but I wish gentlemen on the other side to understand that the use of degrading figures is a game at which they may not find themselves able to take all the winnings., Aye, you give it up, and well you may; but for a very different reason from that which you would have us understand., The point--the power to hurt--of all figures consists in the truthfulness of their application; and, understanding this, you may well give it up., They are weapons which hit you, but miss us., But in my hurry I was very near closing this subject of military tails before I was done with it., There is one entire article of the sort I have not discussed yet,--I mean the military tail you Democrats are now engaged in dovetailing into the great Michigander [Cass]., Yes, sir; all his biographies (and they are legion) have him in hand, tying him to a military tail, like so many mischievous boys tying a dog to a bladder of beans., True, the material they have is very limited, but they drive at it might and main., He invaded Canada without resistance, and he outvaded it without pursuit., As he did both under orders, I suppose there was to him neither credit nor discredit in them; but they constitute a large part of the tail., He was not at Hull's surrender, but he was close by; he was volunteer aid to General Harrison on the day of the battle of the Thames; and as you said in 1840 Harrison was picking huckleberries two miles off while the battle was fought, I suppose it is a just conclusion with you to say Cass was aiding Harrison to pick huckleberries., This is about all, except the mooted question of the broken sword., Some authors say he broke it, some say he threw it away, and some others, who ought to know, say nothing about it., ...]"|3
16|"[On other occasions, and among the lower officers and privates on that occasion, I doubt not the proportion was different., I wish to do justice to all., I think of all those brave men as Americans, in whose proud fame, as an American, I too have a share., Many of them, Whigs and Democrats are my constituents and personal friends; and I thank them,--more than thank them,--one and all, for the high imperishable honor they have conferred on our common State., But the distinction between the cause of the President in beginning the war, and the cause of the country after it was begun, is a distinction which you cannot perceive., To you the President and the country seem to be all one., You are interested to see no distinction between them; and I venture to suggest that probably your interest blinds you a little., We see the distinction, as we think, clearly enough; and our friends who have fought in the war have no difficulty in seeing it also., What those who have fallen would say, were they alive and here, of course we can never know; but with those who have returned there is no difficulty., Colonel Haskell and Major Gaines, members here, both fought in the war, and both of them underwent extraordinary perils and hardships; still they, like all other Whigs here, vote, on the record, that the war was unnecessarily and unconstitutionally commenced by the President., And even General Taylor himself, the noblest Roman of them all, has declared that as a citizen, and particularly as a soldier, it is sufficient for him to know that his country is at war with a foreign nation, to do all in his power to bring it to a speedy and honorable termination by the most vigorous and energetic operations, without inquiry about its justice, or anything else connected with it., Mr. Speaker, let our Democratic friends be comforted with the assurance that we are content with our position, content with our company, and content with our candidate; and that although they, in their generous sympathy, think we ought to be miserable, we really are not, and that they may dismiss the great anxiety they have on our account., Mr. Speaker, I see I have but three minutes left, and this forces me to throw out one whole branch of my subject., A single word on still another., The Democrats are keen enough to frequently remind us that we have some dissensions in our ranks., Our good friend from Baltimore immediately before me [Mr. McLane] expressed some doubt the other day as to which branch of our party General Taylor would ultimately fall into the hands of., That was a new idea to me., I knew we had dissenters, but I did not know they were trying to get our candidate away from us., I would like to say a word to our dissenters, but I have not the time., Some such we certainly have; have you none, gentlemen Democrats?, Is it all union and harmony in your ranks?, no bickerings?, no divisions?, If there be doubt as to which of our divisions will get our candidate, is there no doubt as to which of your candidates will get your party?, I have heard some things from New York; and if they are true, one might well say of your party there, as a drunken fellow once said when he heard the reading of an indictment for hog-stealing., The clerk read on till he got to and through the words, ""did steal, take, and carry away ten boars, ten sows, ten shoats, and ten pigs,"" at which he exclaimed, ""Well, by golly, that is the most equally divided gang of hogs I ever did hear of!"", If there is any other gang of hogs more equally divided than the Democrats of New York are about this time, I have not heard of it., Mr. Lincoln has a very tall and thin figure, with an intellectual face, showing a searching mind, and a cool judgment., He spoke in a clear and cool and very eloquent manner, for an hour and a half, carrying the audience with him in his able arguments and brilliant illustrations--only interrupted by warm and frequent applause., He began by expressing a real feeling of modesty in addressing an audience ""this side of the mountains,"" a part of the country where, in the opinion of the people of his section, everybody was supposed to be instructed and wise., But he had devoted his attention to the question of the coming Presidential election, and was not unwilling to exchange with all whom he might the ideas to which he had arrived., He then began to show the fallacy of some of the arguments against Gen. Taylor, making his chief theme the fashionable statement of all those who oppose him (""the old Locofocos as well as the new"") that he has no principles, and that the Whig party have abandoned their principles by adopting him as their candidate., He maintained that Gen. Taylor occupied a high and unexceptionable Whig ground, and took for his first instance and proof of this the statement in the Allison letter--with regard to the bank, tariff, rivers and harbors, etc.--that the will of the people should produce its own results, without executive influence., The principle that the people should do what--under the Constitution--as they please, is a Whig principle., All that Gen. Taylor is not only to consent to, but appeal to the people to judge and act for themselves., And this was no new doctrine for Whigs., It was the ""platform"" on which they had fought all their battles, the resistance of executive influence, and the principle of enabling the people to frame the government according to their will., Gen. Taylor consents to be the candidate, and to assist the people to do what they think to be their duty, and think to be best in their national affairs, but because he don't want to tell what we ought to do, he is accused of having no principles., The Whigs here maintained for years that neither the influence, the duress, or the prohibition of the executive should control the legitimately expressed will of the people; and now that, on that very ground, Gen. Taylor says that he should use the power given him by the people to do, to the best of his judgment, the will of the people, he is accused of want of principle, and of inconsistency in position., Mr. Lincoln proceeded to examine the absurdity of an attempt to make a platform or creed for a national party, to all parts of which all must consent and agree, when it was clearly the intention and the true philosophy of our government, that in Congress all opinions and principles should be represented, and that when the wisdom of all had been compared and united, the will of the majority should be carried out., On this ground he conceived (and the audience seemed to go with him) that Gen. Taylor held correct, sound republican principles., Mr. Lincoln then passed to the subject of slavery in the States, saying that the people of Illinois agreed entirely with the people of Massachusetts on this subject, except perhaps that they did not keep so constantly thinking about it., All agreed that slavery was an evil, but that we were not responsible for it and cannot affect it in States of this Union where we do not live., But the question of the extension of slavery to new territories of this country is a part of our responsibility and care, and is under our control., In opposition to this Mr. L. believed that the self-named ""Free Soil"" party was far behind the Whigs., Both parties opposed the extension., As he understood it the new party had no principle except this opposition., If their platform held any other, it was in such a general way that it was like the pair of pantaloons the Yankee pedlar offered for sale, ""large enough for any man, small enough for any boy."", They therefore had taken a position calculated to break down their single important declared object., They were working for the election of either Gen. Cass or Gen. Taylor., The speaker then went on to show, clearly and eloquently, the danger of extension of slavery, likely to result from the election of Gen. Cass., To unite with those who annexed the new territory to prevent the extension of slavery in that territory seemed to him to be in the highest degree absurd and ridiculous., Suppose these gentlemen succeed in electing Mr. Van Buren, they had no specific means to prevent the extension of slavery to New Mexico and California, and Gen. Taylor, he confidently believed, would not encourage it, and would not prohibit its restriction., But if Gen. Cass was elected, he felt certain that the plans of farther extension of territory would be encouraged, and those of the extension of slavery would meet no check., The ""Free Soil"" mart in claiming that name indirectly attempts a deception, by implying that Whigs were not Free Soil men., Declaring that they would ""do their duty and leave the consequences to God"" merely gave an excuse for taking a course they were not able to maintain by a fair and full argument., To make this declaration did not show what their duty was., If it did we should have no use for judgment, we might as well be made without intellect; and when divine or human law does not clearly point out what is our duty, we have no means of finding out what it is but by using our most intelligent judgment of the consequences., If there were divine law or human law for voting for Martin Van Buren, or if a fair examination of the consequences and just reasoning would show that voting for him would bring about the ends they pretended to wish--then he would give up the argument., But since there was no fixed law on the subject, and since the whole probable result of their action would be an assistance in electing Gen. Cass, he must say that they were behind the Whigs in their advocacy of the freedom of the soil., Mr. Lincoln proceeded to rally the Buffalo convention for forbearing to say anything--after all the previous declarations of those members who were formerly Whigs--on the subject of the Mexican War, because the Van Burens had been known to have supported it., He declared that of all the parties asking the confidence of the country, this new one had less of principle than any other., He wondered whether it was still the opinion of these Free Soil gentlemen, as declared in the ""whereas"" at Buffalo, that the Whig and Democratic parties were both entirely dissolved and absorbed into their own body., Had the Vermont election given them any light?, They had calculated on making as great an impression in that State as in any part of the Union, and there their attempts had been wholly ineffectual., Their failure was a greater success than they would find in any other part of the Union., Mr. Lincoln went on to say that he honestly believed that all those who wished to keep up the character of the Union; who did not believe in enlarging our field, but in keeping our fences where they are and cultivating our present possessions, making it a garden, improving the morals and education of the people, devoting the administrations to this purpose; all real Whigs, friends of good honest government--the race was ours., He had opportunities of hearing from almost every part of the Union from reliable sources and had not heard of a county in which we had not received accessions from other parties., If the true Whigs come forward and join these new friends, they need not have a doubt., We had a candidate whose personal character and principles he had already described, whom he could not eulogize if he would., Gen. Taylor had been constantly, perseveringly, quietly standing up, doing his duty and asking no praise or reward for it., He was and must be just the man to whom the interests, principles, and prosperity of the country might be safely intrusted., He had never failed in anything he had undertaken, although many of his duties had been considered almost impossible., Mr. Lincoln then went into a terse though rapid review of the origin of the Mexican War and the connection of the administration and General Taylor with it, from which he deduced a strong appeal to the Whigs present to do their duty in the support of General Taylor, and closed with the warmest aspirations for and confidence in a deserved success., At the close of his truly masterly and convincing speech, the audience gave three enthusiastic cheers for Illinois, and three more for the eloquent Whig member from the State., Your letter of the 7th was received night before last., I very cheerfully send you the twenty dollars, which sum you say is necessary to save your land from sale., It is singular that you should have forgotten a judgment against you; and it is more singular that the plaintiff should have let you forget it so long; particularly as I suppose you always had property enough to satisfy a judgment of that amount., Before you pay it, it would be well to be sure you have not paid, or at least, that you cannot prove you have paid it., Give my love to mother and all the connections., Affectionately your son,  Resolved, That the Committee on the District of Columbia be instructed to report a bill in substance as follows:  Sec., 1., Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States, in Congress assembled, That no person not now within the District of Columbia, nor now owned by any person or persons now resident within it, nor hereafter born within it, shall ever be held in slavery within said District., Sec., 2., That no person now within said District, or now owned by any person or persons now resident within the same, or hereafter born within it, shall ever be held in slavery without the limits of said District: Provided, That officers of the Government of the United States, being citizens of the slaveholding States, coming into said District on public business, and remaining only so long as may be reasonably necessary for that object, may be attended into and out of said District, and while there, by the necessary servants of themselves and their families, without their right to hold such servants in service being thereby impaired., Sec., 3., That all children born of slave mothers within said District, on or after the first day of January, in the year of our Lord eighteen hundred and fifty, shall be free;

17|"[This office is not confined to my district, but pertains to the whole State; so that Colonel Baker has an equal right with myself to be heard concerning it., However, the office is located here; and I think it is not probable that any one would desire to remove from a distance to take it., A tirade is still kept up against me here for recommending T. R. King., This morning it is openly avowed that my supposed influence at Washington shall be broken down generally, and King's prospects defeated in particular., Now, what I have done in this matter I have done at the request of you and some other friends in Tazewell; and I therefore ask you to either admit it is wrong or come forward and sustain me., If the truth will permit, I propose that you sustain me in the following manner: copy the inclosed scrap in your own handwriting and get everybody (not three or four, but three or four hundred) to sign it, and then send it to me., Also, have six, eight or ten of our best known Whig friends there write to me individual letters, stating the truth in this matter as they understand it., Don't neglect or delay in the matter., I understand information of an indictment having been found against him about three years ago, for gaming or keeping a gaming house, has been sent to the department., I shall try to take care of it at the department till your action can be had and forwarded on., I regret troubling you so often in relation to the land-offices here, but I hope you will perceive the necessity of it, and excuse me., On the 7th of April I wrote you recommending Turner R. King for register, and Walter Davis for receiver., Subsequently I wrote you that, for a private reason, I had concluded to transpose them., That private reason was the request of an old personal friend who himself desired to be receiver, but whom I felt it my duty to refuse a recommendation., He said if I would transpose King and Davis he would be satisfied., I thought it a whim, but, anxious to oblige him, I consented., Immediately he commenced an assault upon King's character, intending, as I suppose, to defeat his appointment, and thereby secure another chance for himself., This double offence of bad faith to me and slander upon a good man is so totally outrageous that I now ask to have King and Davis placed as I originally recommended,--that is, King for register and Davis for receiver., An effort is being made now to have Mr. Barret, the present register, retained., I have already said he has done the duties of the office well, and I now add he is a gentleman in the true sense., Still, he submits to be the instrument of his party to injure us., His high character enables him to do it more effectually., Last year he presided at the convention which nominated the Democratic candidate for Congress in this district, and afterward ran for the State Senate himself, not desiring the seat, but avowedly to aid and strengthen his party., He made speech after speech with a degree of fierceness and coarseness against General Taylor not quite consistent with his habitually gentlemanly deportment., At least one (and I think more) of those who are now trying to have him retained was himself an applicant for this very office, and, failing to get my recommendation, now takes this turn., In writing you a third time in relation to these offices, I stated that I supposed charges had been forwarded to you against King, and that I would inquire into the truth of them., I now send you herewith what I suppose will be an ample defense against any such charges., I ask attention to all the papers, but particularly to the letters of Mr. David Mack, and the paper with the long list of names., There is no mistake about King's being a good man., After the unjust assault upon him, and considering the just claims of Tazewell County, as indicated in the letters I inclose you, it would in my opinion be injustice, and withal a blunder, not to appoint him, at least as soon as any one is appointed to either of the offices here., Butterfield will be commissioner of the Gen'l Land Office, unless prevented by strong and speedy efforts., Ewing is for him, and he is only not appointed yet because Old Zach., hangs fire., I have reliable information of this., Now, if you agree with me that this appointment would dissatisfy rather than gratify the Whigs of this State, that it would slacken their energies in future contests, that his appointment in '41 is an old sore with them which they will not patiently have reopened,--in a word that his appointment now would be a fatal blunder to the administration and our political men here in Illinois, write Crittenden to that effect., He can control the matter., Were you to write Ewing I fear the President would never hear of your letter., This may be mere suspicion., You might write directly to Old Zach., You will be the best judge of the propriety of that., Not a moment's time is to be lost., Let this be confidential except with Mr. Edwards and a few others whom you know I would trust just as I do you., I am about to ask a favor of you, one which I hope will not cost you much., I understand the General Land-Office is about to be given to Illinois, and that Mr. Ewing desires Justin Butterfield, of Chicago, to be the man., I give you my word, the appointment of Mr. Butterfield will be an egregious political blunder., It will give offence to the whole Whig party here, and be worse than a dead loss to the administration of so much of its patronage., Now, if you can conscientiously do so, I wish you to write General Taylor at once, saying that either I or the man I recommend should in your opinion be appointed to that office, if any one from Illinois shall be., I restrict my request to Illinois because you may have a man from your own State, and I do not ask to interfere with that., What I claim as my invention, and desire to secure by letters patent, is the combination of expansible buoyant chambers placed at the sides of a vessel with the main shaft or shafts by means of the sliding spars, which pass down through the buoyant chambers and are made fast to their bottoms and the series of ropes and pulleys or their equivalents in such a manner that by turning the main shaft or shafts in one direction the buoyant chambers will be forced downward into the water, and at the same time expanded and filled with air for buoying up the vessel by the displacement of water, and by turning the shafts in an opposite direction the buoyant chambers will be contracted into a small space and secured against injury., Vandalia, the receiver's office at which place is the subject of the within, is not in my district; and I have been much perplexed to express any preference between Dr. Stapp and Mr. Remann., If any one man is better qualified for such an office than all others, Dr. Stapp is that man; still, I believe a large majority of the Whigs of the district prefer Mr. Remann, who also is a good man., Perhaps the papers on file will enable you to judge better than I can., The writers of the within are good men, residing within the land district., Your two letters were received last night., I have a great many letters to write, and so cannot write very long ones., There must be some mistake about Walter Davis saying I promised him the post-office., I did not so promise him., I did tell him that if the distribution of the offices should fall into my hands, he should have something; and if I shall be convinced he has said any more than this, I shall be disappointed., I said this much to him because, as I understand, he is of good character, is one of the young men, is of the mechanics, and always faithful and never troublesome; a Whig, and is poor, with the support of a widow mother thrown almost exclusively on him by the death of his brother., If these are wrong reasons, then I have been wrong; but I have certainly not been selfish in it, because in my greatest need of friends he was against me, and for Baker., Mr. Edwards is unquestionably offended with me in connection with the matter of the General Land-Office., He wrote a letter against me which was filed at the department., The better part of one's life consists of his friendships; and, of them, mine with Mr. Edwards was one of the most cherished., I have not been false to it., At a word I could have had the office any time before the department was committed to Mr. Butterfield, at least Mr. Ewing and the President say as much., That word I forbore to speak, partly for other reasons, but chiefly for Mr. Edwards' sake, losing the office (that he might gain it) I was always for; but to lose his friendship, by the effort for him, would oppress me very much, were I not sustained by the utmost consciousness of rectitude., I first determined to be an applicant, unconditionally, on the 2nd of June; and I did so then upon being informed by a telegraphic despatch that the question was narrowed down to Mr. B and myself, and that the Cabinet had postponed the appointment three weeks, for my benefit., Not doubting that Mr. Edwards was wholly out of the question I, nevertheless, would not then have become an applicant had I supposed he would thereby be brought to suspect me of treachery to him., Two or three days afterwards a conversation with Levi Davis convinced me Mr. Edwards was dissatisfied; but I was then too far in to get out., His own letter, written on the 25th of April, after I had fully informed him of all that had passed, up to within a few days of that time, gave assurance I had that entire confidence from him which I felt my uniform and strong friendship for him entitled me to., Among other things it says, ""Whatever course your judgment may dictate as proper to be pursued, shall never be excepted to by me."", I also had had a letter from Washington, saying Chambers, of the Republic, had brought a rumor then, that Mr. E had declined in my favor, which rumor I judged came from Mr. E himself, as I had not then breathed of his letter to any living creature., In saying I had never, before the 2nd of June, determined to be an applicant, unconditionally, I mean to admit that, before then, I had said substantially I would take the office rather than it should be lost to the State, or given to one in the State whom the Whigs did not want; but I aver that in every instance in which I spoke of myself, I intended to keep, and now believe I did keep, Mr. E above myself., Mr. Edwards' first suspicion was that I had allowed Baker to overreach me, as his friend, in behalf of Don Morrison., I knew this was a mistake; and the result has proved it., I understand his view now is, that if I had gone to open war with Baker I could have ridden him down, and had the thing all my own way., I believe no such thing., With Baker and some strong man from the Military tract & elsewhere for Morrison, and we and some strong man from the Wabash & elsewhere for Mr. E, it was not possible for either to succeed., I believed this in March, and I know it now., The only thing which gave either any chance was the very thing Baker & I proposed,--an adjustment with themselves., You may wish to know how Butterfield finally beat me., I can not tell you particulars now, but will when I see you., In the meantime let it be understood I am not greatly dissatisfied,--I wish the offer had been so bestowed as to encourage our friends in future contests, and I regret exceedingly Mr. Edwards' feelings towards me., These two things away, I should have no regrets,--at least I think I would not., Resolved, That, in their present glorious struggle for liberty, the Hungarians command our highest admiration and have our warmest sympathy., Resolved, That they have our most ardent prayers for their speedy triumph and final success., Resolved, That the Government of the United States should acknowledge the independence of Hungary as a nation of freemen at the very earliest moment consistent with our amicable relations with the government against which they are contending., Resolved, That, in the opinion of this meeting, the immediate acknowledgment of the independence of Hungary by our government is due from American freemen to their struggling brethren, to the general cause of republican liberty, and not violative of the just rights of any nation or people., Your letter of the 9th was received a day or two ago., The notes and mortgages you enclosed me were duly received., I also got the original Blanchard mortgage from Antrim Campbell, with whom Blanchard had left it for you., I got a decree of foreclosure on the whole; but, owing to there being no redemption on the sale to be under the Blanchard mortgage, the court allowed Mobley till the first of March to pay the money, before advertising for sale., Stuart was empowered by Mobley to appear for him, and I had to take such decree as he would consent to, or none at all., I cast the matter about in my mind and concluded that as I could not get a decree we would put the accrued interest at interest, and thereby more than match the fact of throwing the Blanchard debt back from twelve to six per cent., it was better to do it., This is the present state of the case., I can well enough understand and appreciate your suggestions about the Land-Office at Danville; but in my present condition, I can do nothing., On my return from Kentucky I found your letter of the 7th of November, and have delayed answering it till now for the reason I now briefly state., From the beginning of our acquaintance I had felt the greatest kindness for you and had supposed it was reciprocated on your part., Last summer, under circumstances which I mentioned to you, I was painfully constrained to withhold a recommendation which you desired, and shortly afterwards I learned, in such a way as to believe it, that you were indulging in open abuse of me., Of course my feelings were wounded., ...]"|3
18|"[Your Petitioner further states that the reasons of his not being present at said trial, as he was not, and of its not being in his power to take an appeal in the ordinary way, as it was not, were that your Petitioner then resided in Edgar County about one hundred and twenty miles from where defendants resided; that a very short time before the suit was commenced your Petitioner was in Sangamon County for the purpose of collecting debts due him, and with the rest, the note in question, which note had then been given more than a year, that your Petitioner then saw the defendant J. L. Gerard who is the principal in said note, and solicited payment of the same; that said defendant then made no pretense that he did not owe the same, but on the contrary expressly promised that he would come into Springfield, in a very few days and either pay the money, or give a new note, payable by the then next Christmas; that your Petitioner accordingly left said note with said J. C. Spugg, with directions to give defendant full time to pay the money or give the new note as above, and if he did neither to sue; and then affiant came home to Edgar County, not having the slightest suspicion that if suit should be brought, the defendants would make any defense whatever; and your Petitioner never did in any way learn that said suit had been commenced until more than twenty days after it had been decided against him., He therefore prays for a writ of Certiorari., Inclosed is the deed for the land., We are all well, and have nothing in the way of news., We have had no Cholera here for about two weeks., Give my love to all, and especially to Mother., When I came into Charleston day before yesterday I learned that you are anxious to sell the land where you live, and move to Missouri., I have been thinking of this ever since, and cannot but think such a notion is utterly foolish., What can you do in Missouri better than here?, Is the land richer?, Can you there, any more than here, raise corn and wheat and oats without work?, Will anybody there, any more than here, do your work for you?, If you intend to go to work, there is no better place than right where you are; if you do not intend to go to work you cannot get along anywhere., Squirming and crawling about from place to place can do no good., You have raised no crop this year, and what you really want is to sell the land, get the money and spend it., Part with the land you have, and, my life upon it, you will never after own a spot big enough to bury you in., Half you will get for the land you spend in moving to Missouri, and the other half you will eat and drink and wear out, and no foot of land will be bought., Now I feel it is my duty to have no hand in such a piece of foolery., I feel that it is so even on your own account, and particularly on Mother's account., The eastern forty acres I intend to keep for Mother while she lives; if you will not cultivate it, it will rent for enough to support her; at least it will rent for something., Her dower in the other two forties she can let you have, and no thanks to me., Now do not misunderstand this letter., I do not write it in any unkindness., I write it in order, if possible, to get you to face the truth, which truth is, you are destitute because you have idled away all your time., Your thousand pretenses for not getting along better are all nonsense; they deceive nobody but yourself., Go to work is the only cure for your case., A word for Mother: Chapman tells me he wants you to go and live with him., If I were you I would try it awhile., If you get tired of it (as I think you will not) you can return to your own home., Chapman feels very kindly to you; and I have no doubt he will make your situation very pleasant., Chapman tells me he wants you to go and live with him., If I were you I would try it awhile., If you get tired of it (as I think you will not) you can return to your own home., Chapman feels very kindly to you; and I have no doubt he will make your situation very pleasant., When I wrote you before, I had not received your letter., I still think as I did, but if the land can be sold so that I get three hundred dollars to put to interest for Mother, I will not object, if she does not., But before I will make a deed, the money must be had, or secured beyond all doubt, at ten per cent., As to Abram, I do not want him, on my own account; but I understand he wants to live with me, so that he can go to school and get a fair start in the world, which I very much wish him to have., When I reach home, if I can make it convenient to take, I will take him, provided there is no mistake between us as to the object and terms of my taking him., In haste, as ever,   Your letter of the 22d is just received., Your proposal about selling the east forty acres of land is all that I want or could claim for myself; but I am not satisfied with it on Mother's account--I want her to have her living, and I feel that it is my duty, to some extent, to see that she is not wronged., She had a right of dower (that is, the use of one-third for life) in the other two forties; but, it seems, she has already let you take that, hook and line., She now has the use of the whole of the east forty, as long as she lives; and if it be sold, of course she is entitled to the interest on all the money it brings, as long as she lives; but you propose to sell it for three hundred dollars, take one hundred away with you, and leave her two hundred at 8 per cent., making her the enormous sum of 16 dollars a year., Now, if you are satisfied with treating her in that way, I am not., It is true that you are to have that forty for two hundred dollars, at Mother's death, but you are not to have it before., I am confident that land can be made to produce for Mother at least $30 a year, and I can not, to oblige any living person, consent that she shall be put on an allowance of sixteen dollars a year., On the fourth day of July, 1776, the people of a few feeble and oppressed colonies of Great Britain, inhabiting a portion of the Atlantic coast of North America, publicly declared their national independence, and made their appeal to the justice of their cause and to the God of battles for the maintenance of that declaration., That people were few in number and without resources, save only their wise heads and stout hearts., Within the first year of that declared independence, and while its maintenance was yet problematical, while the bloody struggle between those resolute rebels and their haughty would-be masters was still waging,--of undistinguished parents and in an obscure district of one of those colonies Henry Clay was born., The infant nation and the infant child began the race of life together., For three quarters of a century they have travelled hand in hand., They have been companions ever., The nation has passed its perils, and it is free, prosperous, and powerful., The child has reached his manhood, his middle age, his old age, and is dead., In all that has concerned the nation the man ever sympathized; and now the nation mourns the man., The day after his death one of the public journals, opposed to him politically, held the following pathetic and beautiful language, which I adopt partly because such high and exclusive eulogy, originating with a political friend, might offend good taste, but chiefly because I could not in any language of my own so well express my thoughts:  ""Alas, who can realize that Henry Clay is dead!, Who can realize that never again that majestic form shall rise in the council-chambers of his country to beat back the storms of anarchy which may threaten, or pour the oil of peace upon the troubled billows as they rage and menace around!, Who can realize that the workings of that mighty mind have ceased, that the throbbings of that gallant heart are stilled, that the mighty sweep of that graceful arm will be felt no more, and the magic of that eloquent tongue, which spake as spake no other tongue besides, is hushed hushed for ever!, Who can realize that freedom's champion, the champion of a civilized world and of all tongues and kindreds of people, has indeed fallen!, Alas, in those dark hours of peril and dread which our land has experienced, and which she may be called to experience again, to whom now may her people look up for that counsel and advice which only wisdom and experience and patriotism can give, and which only the undoubting confidence of a nation will receive?, Perchance in the whole circle of the great and gifted of our land there remains but one on whose shoulders the mighty mantle of the departed statesman may fall; one who while we now write is doubtless pouring his tears over the bier of his brother and friend brother, friend, ever, yet in political sentiment as far apart as party could make them., Ah, it is at times like these that the petty distinctions of mere party disappear., We see only the great, the grand, the noble features of the departed statesman; and we do not even beg permission to bow at his feet and mingle our tears with those who have ever been his political adherents--we do [not] beg this permission, we claim it as a right, though we feel it as a privilege., Henry Clay belonged to his country--to the world; mere party cannot claim men like him., His career has been national, his fame has filled the earth, his memory will endure to the last syllable of recorded time., ""Henry Clay is dead!, He breathed his last on yesterday, at twenty minutes after eleven, in his chamber at Washington., To those who followed his lead in public affairs, it more appropriately belongs to pronounce his eulogy and pay specific honors to the memory of the illustrious dead., But all Americans may show the grief which his death inspires, for his character and fame are national property., As on a question of liberty he knew no North, no South, no East, no West, but only the Union which held them all in its sacred circle, so now his countrymen will know no grief that is not as wide-spread as the bounds of the confederacy., The career of Henry Clay was a public career., From his youth he has been devoted to the public service, at a period, too, in the world's history justly regarded as a remarkable era in human affairs., He witnessed in the beginning the throes of the French Revolution., He saw the rise and fall of Napoleon., He was called upon to legislate for America and direct her policy when all Europe was the battlefield of contending dynasties, and when the struggle for supremacy imperilled the rights of all neutral nations., His voice spoke war and peace in the contest with Great Britain., ""When Greece rose against the Turks and struck for liberty, his name was mingled with the battle-cry of freedom., When South America threw off the thraldom of Spain, his speeches were read at the head of her armies by Bolivar., His name has been, and will continue to be, hallowed in two hemispheres, for it is       ""'One of the few, the immortal names       That were not born to die!', ""To the ardent patriot and profound statesman he added a quality possessed by few of the gifted on earth., His eloquence has not been surpassed., In the effective power to move the heart of man, Clay was without an equal, and the heaven-born endowment, in the spirit of its origin, has been most conspicuously exhibited against intestine feud., On at least three important occasions he has quelled our civil commotions by a power and influence which belonged to no other statesman of his age and times., And in our last internal discord, when this Union trembled to its centre, in old age he left the shades of private life, and gave the death-blow to fraternal strife, with the vigor of his earlier years, in a series of senatorial efforts which in themselves would bring immortality by challenging comparison with the efforts of any statesman in any age., He exorcised the demon which possessed the body politic, and gave peace to a distracted land., Alas!, the achievement cost him his life., He sank day by day to the tomb his pale but noble brow bound with a triple wreath, put there by a grateful country., May his ashes rest in peace, while his spirit goes to take its station among the great and good men who preceded him."", While it is customary and proper upon occasions like the present to give a brief sketch of the life of the deceased, in the case of Mr. Clay it is less necessary than most others; for his biography has been written and rewritten and read and reread for the last twenty-five years; so that, with the exception of a few of the latest incidents of his life, all is as well known as it can be., The short sketch which I give is, therefore, merely to maintain the connection of this discourse., Henry Clay was born on the twelfth day of April, 1777, in Hanover County, Virginia., Of his father, who died in the fourth or fifth year of Henry's age, little seems to be known, except that he was a respectable man and a preacher of the Baptist persuasion., Mr. Clay's education to the end of life was comparatively limited., I say ""to the end of life,"" because I have understood that from time to time he added something to his education during the greater part of his whole life., Mr. Clay's lack of a more perfect early education, however it may be regretted generally, teaches at least one profitable lesson: it teaches that in this country one can scarcely be so poor but that, if he will, he can acquire sufficient education to get through the world respectably., In his twenty-third year Mr. Clay was licensed to practise law, and emigrated to Lexington, Kentucky., Here he commenced and continued the practice till the year 1803, when he was first elected to the Kentucky Legislature., By successive elections he was continued in the Legislature till the latter part of 1806, when he was elected to fill a vacancy of a single session in the United States Senate., In 1807 he was again elected to the Kentucky House of Representatives, and by that body chosen Speaker., ...]"|3
19|"[But this is a reprieve only, not a final sentence., A geographical line coinciding with a marked principle, moral and political, once conceived and held up to the angry passions of men, will never be obliterated, and every irritation will mark it deeper and deeper., I can say with conscious truth that there is not a man on earth who would sacrifice more than I would to relieve us from this heavy reproach in any practicable way., ""The cession of that kind of property--for it is so misnamed--is a bagatelle which would not cost me a second thought if in that way a general emancipation and expatriation could be effected, and gradually and with due sacrifices I think it might be., But as it is, we have the wolf by the ears, and we can neither hold him nor safely let him go., Justice is in one scale, and self-preservation in the other."", Mr. Clay was in Congress, and, perceiving the danger, at once engaged his whole energies to avert it., It began, as I have said, in 1819; and it did not terminate till 1821., Missouri would not yield the point; and Congress that is, a majority in Congress--by repeated votes showed a determination not to admit the State unless it should yield., After several failures, and great labor on the part of Mr. Clay to so present the question that a majority could consent to the admission, it was by a vote rejected, and, as all seemed to think, finally., A sullen gloom hung over the nation., All felt that the rejection of Missouri was equivalent to a dissolution of the Union, because those States which already had what Missouri was rejected for refusing to relinquish would go with Missouri., All deprecated and deplored this, but none saw how to avert it., For the judgment of members to be convinced of the necessity of yielding was not the whole difficulty; each had a constituency to meet and to answer to., Mr. Clay, though worn down and exhausted, was appealed to by members to renew his efforts at compromise., He did so, and by some judicious modifications of his plan, coupled with laborious efforts with individual members and his own overmastering eloquence upon that floor, he finally secured the admission of the State., Brightly and captivating as it had previously shown, it was now perceived that his great eloquence was a mere embellishment, or at most but a helping hand to his inventive genius and his devotion to his country in the day of her extreme peril., After the settlement of the Missouri question, although a portion of the American people have differed with Mr. Clay, and a majority even appear generally to have been opposed to him on questions of ordinary administration, he seems constantly to have been regarded by all as the man for the crisis., Accordingly, in the days of nullification, and more recently in the reappearance of the slavery question connected with our territory newly acquired of Mexico, the task of devising a mode of adjustment seems to have been cast upon Mr. Clay by common consent--and his performance of the task in each case was little else than a literal fulfilment of the public expectation., Mr. Clay's efforts in behalf of the South Americans, and afterward in behalf of the Greeks, in the times of their respective struggles for civil liberty, are among the finest on record, upon the noblest of all themes, and bear ample corroboration of what I have said was his ruling passion--a love of liberty and right, unselfishly, and for their own sakes., Having been led to allude to domestic slavery so frequently already, I am unwilling to close without referring more particularly to Mr. Clay's views and conduct in regard to it., He ever was on principle and in feeling opposed to slavery., The very earliest, and one of the latest, public efforts of his life, separated by a period of more than fifty years, were both made in favor of gradual emancipation., He did not perceive that on a question of human right the negroes were to be excepted from the human race., And yet Mr. Clay was the owner of slaves., Cast into life when slavery was already widely spread and deeply seated, he did not perceive, as I think no wise man has perceived, how it could be at once eradicated without producing a greater evil even to the cause of human liberty itself., His feeling and his judgment, therefore, ever led him to oppose both extremes of opinion on the subject., Those who would shiver into fragments the Union of these States, tear to tatters its now venerated Constitution, and even burn the last copy of the Bible, rather than slavery should continue a single hour, together with all their more halting sympathizers, have received, and are receiving, their just execration; and the name and opinions and influence of Mr. Clay are fully and, as I trust, effectually and enduringly arrayed against them., But I would also, if I could, array his name, opinions, and influence against the opposite extreme--against a few but an increasing number of men who, for the sake of perpetuating slavery, are beginning to assail and to ridicule the white man's charter of freedom, the declaration that ""all men are created free and equal."", So far as I have learned, the first American of any note to do or attempt this was the late John C. Calhoun; and if I mistake not, it soon after found its way into some of the messages of the Governor of South Carolina., We, however, look for and are not much shocked by political eccentricities and heresies in South Carolina., But only last year I saw with astonishment what purported to be a letter of a very distinguished and influential clergyman of Virginia, copied, with apparent approbation, into a St. Louis newspaper, containing the following to me very unsatisfactory language:  ""I am fully aware that there is a text in some Bibles that is not in mine., Professional abolitionists have made more use of it than of any passage in the Bible., It came, however, as I trace it, from Saint Voltaire, and was baptized by Thomas Jefferson, and since almost universally regarded as canonical authority`All men are born free and equal.', ""This is a genuine coin in the political currency of our generation., I am sorry to say that I have never seen two men of whom it is true., But I must admit I never saw the Siamese Twins, and therefore will not dogmatically say that no man ever saw a proof of this sage aphorism."", This sounds strangely in republican America., The like was not heard in the fresher days of the republic., Let us contrast with it the language of that truly national man whose life and death we now commemorate and lament: I quote from a speech of Mr. Clay delivered before the American Colonization Society in 1827:  ""We are reproached with doing mischief by the agitation of this question., The society goes into no household to disturb its domestic tranquillity., It addresses itself to no slaves to weaken their obligations of obedience., It seeks to affect no man's property., It neither has the power nor the will to affect the property of any one contrary to his consent., The execution of its scheme would augment instead of diminishing the value of property left behind., The society, composed of free men, conceals itself only with the free., Collateral consequences we are not responsible for., It is not this society which has produced the great moral revolution which the age exhibits., What would they who thus reproach us have done?, If they would repress all tendencies toward liberty and ultimate emancipation, they must do more than put down the benevolent efforts of this society., They must go back to the era of our liberty and independence, and muzzle the cannon which thunders its annual joyous return., They must renew the slave trade, with all its train of atrocities., They must suppress the workings of British philanthropy, seeking to meliorate the condition of the unfortunate West Indian slave., They must arrest the career of South American deliverance from thraldom., They must blow out the moral lights around us and extinguish that greatest torch of all which America presents to a benighted world--pointing the way to their rights, their liberties, and their happiness., And when they have achieved all those purposes their work will be yet incomplete., They must penetrate the human soul, and eradicate the light of reason and the love of liberty., Then, and not till then, when universal darkness and despair prevail, can you perpetuate slavery and repress all sympathy and all humane and benevolent efforts among free men in behalf of the unhappy portion of our race doomed to bondage."", The American Colonization Society was organized in 1816., Mr. Clay, though not its projector, was one of its earliest members; and he died, as for many preceding years he had been, its president., It was one of the most cherished objects of his direct care and consideration, and the association of his name with it has probably been its very greatest collateral support., He considered it no demerit in the society that it tended to relieve the slave-holders from the troublesome presence of the free negroes; but this was far from being its whole merit in his estimation., In the same speech from which we have quoted he says:  ""There is a moral fitness in the idea of returning to Africa her children, whose ancestors have been torn from her by the ruthless hand of fraud and violence., Transplanted in a foreign land, they will carry back to their native soil the rich fruits of religion, civilization, law, and liberty., May it not be one of the great designs of the Ruler of the universe, whose ways are often inscrutable by short-sighted mortals, thus to transform an original crime into a signal blessing to that most unfortunate portion of the globe?"", This suggestion of the possible ultimate redemption of the African race and African continent was made twenty-five years ago., Every succeeding year has added strength to the hope of its realization., May it indeed be realized., Pharaoh's country was cursed with plagues, and his hosts were lost in the Red Sea, for striving to retain a captive people who had already served them more than four hundred years., May like disasters never befall us!, If, as the friends of colonization hope, the present and coming generations of our countrymen shall by any means succeed in freeing our land from the dangerous presence of slavery, and at the same time in restoring a captive people to their long-lost fatherland with bright prospects for the future, and this too so gradually that neither races nor individuals shall have suffered by the change, it will indeed be a glorious consummation., And if to such a consummation the efforts of Mr. Clay shall have contributed, it will be what he most ardently wished, and none of his labors will have been more valuable to his country and his kind., But Henry Clay is dead., His long and eventful life is closed., Our country is prosperous and powerful; but could it have been quite all it has been, and is, and is to be, without Henry Clay?, Such a man the times have demanded, and such in the providence of God was given us., But he is gone., Let us strive to deserve, as far as mortals may, the continued care of Divine Providence, trusting that in future national emergencies He will not fail to provide us the instruments of safety and security., A leading article in the Daily Register of this morning has induced some of our friends to request our opinion on the election laws as applicable to challenged voters., We have examined the present constitution of the State, the election law of 1849, and the unrepealed parts of the election law in the revised code of 1845; and we are of the opinion that any person taking the oath prescribed in the act of 1849 is entitled to vote unless counter-proof be made satisfactory to a majority of the judges that such oath is untrue; and that for the purpose of obtaining such counter-proof, the proposed voter may be asked questions in the way of cross-examination, and other independent testimony may be received., We base our opinion as to receiving counter-proof upon the unrepealed Section nineteen of the election law in the revised code., I hope the subject-matter of this letter will appear a sufficient apology to you for the liberty I, a total stranger, take in addressing you., The persons here holding two lots under a conveyance made by you, as the attorney of Daniel M. Baily, now nearly twenty-two years ago, are in great danger of losing the lots, and very much, perhaps all, is to depend on the testimony you give as to whether you did or did not account to Baily for the proceeds received by you on this sale of the lots., I, therefore, as one of the counsel, beg of you to fully refresh your recollection by any means in your power before the time you may be called on to testify., If persons should come about you, and show a disposition to pump you on the subject, it may be no more than prudent to remember that it may be possible they design to misrepresent you and embarrass the real testimony you may ultimately give., It may be six months or a year before you are called on to testify., You, no doubt, remember the enclosed memorandum being handed me in your office., I have just made the desired search, and find that no such deed has ever been here., Campbell, the auditor, says that if it were here, it would be in his office, and that he has hunted for it a dozen times, and could never find it., He says that one time and another, he has heard much about the matter, that it was not a deed for Right of Way, but a deed, outright, for Depot-ground--at least, a sale for Depot-ground, and there may never have been a deed., He says, if there is a deed, it is most probable General Alexander, of Paris, has it., You know how anxious I am that this Nebraska measure shall be rebuked and condemned everywhere., Of course I hope something from your position; yet I do not expect you to do anything which may be wrong in your own judgment; nor would I have you do anything personally injurious to yourself., You are, and always have been, honestly and sincerely a Democrat; and I know how painful it must be to an honest, sincere man to be urged by his party to the support of a measure which in his conscience he believes to be wrong., You have had a severe struggle with yourself, and you have determined not to swallow the wrong., Is it not just to yourself that you should, in a few public speeches, state your reasons, and thus justify yourself?, I wish you would; and yet I say, don't do it, if you think it will injure you., You may have given your word to vote for Major Harris; and if so, of course you will stick to it., But allow me to suggest that you should avoid speaking of this; for it probably would induce some of your friends in like manner to cast their votes., You understand., ...]"|3
20|"[Texas, principally south of the line, and west of Arkansas, though originally within the purchase from France, had, in 1819, been traded off to Spain in our treaty for the acquisition of Florida., It had thus become a part of Mexico., Mexico revolutionized and became independent of Spain., American citizens began settling rapidly with their slaves in the southern part of Texas., Soon they revolutionized against Mexico, and established an independent government of their own, adopting a constitution with slavery, strongly resembling the constitutions of our slave States., By still another rapid move, Texas, claiming a boundary much farther west than when we parted with her in 1819, was brought back to the United States, and admitted into the Union as a slave State., Then there was little or no settlement in the northern part of Texas, a considerable portion of which lay north of the Missouri line; and in the resolutions admitting her into the Union, the Missouri restriction was expressly extended westward across her territory., This was in 1845, only nine years ago., Thus originated the Missouri Compromise; and thus has it been respected down to 1845., And even four years later, in 1849, our distinguished Senator, in a public address, held the following language in relation to it:  ""The Missouri Compromise has been in practical operation for about a quarter of a century, and has received the sanction and approbation of men of all parties in every section of the Union., It has allayed all sectional jealousies and irritations growing out of this vexed question, and harmonized and tranquillized the whole country., It has given to Henry Clay, as its prominent champion, the proud sobriquet of the 'Great Pacificator,' and by that title, and for that service, his political friends had repeatedly appealed to the people to rally under his standard as a Presidential candidate, as the man who had exhibited the patriotism and power to suppress an unholy and treasonable agitation, and preserve the Union., He was not aware that any man or any party, from any section of the Union, had ever urged as an objection to Mr. Clay that he was the great champion of the Missouri Compromise., On the contrary, the effort was made by the opponents of Mr. Clay to prove that he was not entitled to the exclusive merit of that great patriotic measure, and that the honor was equally due to others, as well as to him, for securing its adoption; that it had its origin in the hearts of all patriotic men, who desired to preserve and perpetuate the blessings of our glorious Union--an origin akin to that of the Constitution of the United States, conceived in the same spirit of fraternal affection, and calculated to remove forever the only danger which seemed to threaten, at some distant day, to sever the social bond of union., All the evidences of public opinion at that day seemed to indicate that this compromise had been canonized in the hearts of the American people, as a sacred thing which no ruthless hand would ever be reckless enough to disturb."", I do not read this extract to involve Judge Douglas in an inconsistency., If he afterward thought he had been wrong, it was right for him to change., I bring this forward merely to show the high estimate placed on the Missouri Compromise by all parties up to so late as the year 1849., But going back a little in point of time., Our war with Mexico broke out in 1846., When Congress was about adjourning that session, President Polk asked them to place two millions of dollars under his control, to be used by him in the recess, if found practicable and expedient, in negotiating a treaty of peace with Mexico, and acquiring some part of her territory., A bill was duly gotten up for the purpose, and was progressing swimmingly in the House of Representatives, when a member by the name of David Wilmot, a Democrat from Pennsylvania, moved as an amendment, ""Provided, that in any territory thus acquired there never shall be slavery."", This is the origin of the far-famed Wilmot Proviso., It created a great flutter; but it stuck like wax, was voted into the bill, and the bill passed with it through the House., The Senate, however, adjourned without final action on it, and so both appropriation and proviso were lost for the time., The war continued, and at the next session the President renewed his request for the appropriation, enlarging the amount, I think, to three millions., Again came the proviso, and defeated the measure., Congress adjourned again, and the war went on., In December, 1847, the new Congress assembled., I was in the lower House that term., The Wilmot Proviso, or the principle of it, was constantly coming up in some shape or other, and I think I may venture to say I voted for it at least forty times during the short time I was there., The Senate, however, held it in check, and it never became a law., In the spring of 1848 a treaty of peace was made with Mexico, by which we obtained that portion of her country which now constitutes the Territories of New Mexico and Utah and the present State of California., By this treaty the Wilmot Proviso was defeated, in so far as it was intended to be a condition of the acquisition of territory., Its friends, however, were still determined to find some way to restrain slavery from getting into the new country., This new acquisition lay directly west of our old purchase from France, and extended west to the Pacific Ocean, and was so situated that if the Missouri line should be extended straight west, the new country would be divided by such extended line, leaving some north and some south of it., On Judge Douglas's motion, a bill, or provision of a bill, passed the Senate to so extend the Missouri line., The proviso men in the House, including myself, voted it down, because, by implication, it gave up the southern part to slavery, while we were bent on having it all free., In the fall of 1848 the gold-mines were discovered in California., This attracted people to it with unprecedented rapidity, so that on, or soon after, the meeting of the new Congress in December, 1849, she already had a population of nearly a hundred thousand, had called a convention, formed a State constitution excluding slavery, and was knocking for admission into the Union., The proviso men, of course, were for letting her in, but the Senate, always true to the other side, would not consent to her admission, and there California stood, kept out of the Union because she would not let slavery into her borders., Under all the circumstances, perhaps, this was not wrong., There were other points of dispute connected with the general question of Slavery, which equally needed adjustment., The South clamored for a more efficient fugitive slave law., The North clamored for the abolition of a peculiar species of slave trade in the District of Columbia, in connection with which, in view from the windows of the Capitol, a sort of negro livery-stable, where droves of negroes were collected, temporarily kept, and finally taken to Southern markets, precisely like droves of horses, had been openly maintained for fifty years., Utah and New Mexico needed territorial governments; and whether slavery should or should not be prohibited within them was another question., The indefinite western boundary of Texas was to be settled., She was a slave State, and consequently the farther west the slavery men could push her boundary, the more slave country they secured; and the farther east the slavery opponents could thrust the boundary back, the less slave ground was secured., Thus this was just as clearly a slavery question as any of the others., These points all needed adjustment, and they were held up, perhaps wisely, to make them help adjust one another., The Union now, as in 1820, was thought to be in danger, and devotion to the Union rightfully inclined men to yield somewhat in points where nothing else could have so inclined them., A compromise was finally effected., The South got their new fugitive slave law, and the North got California, (by far the best part of our acquisition from Mexico) as a free State., The South got a provision that New Mexico and Utah, when admitted as States, may come in with or without slavery as they may then choose; and the North got the slave trade abolished in the District of Columbia.., The North got the western boundary of Texas thrown farther back eastward than the South desired; but, in turn, they gave Texas ten millions of dollars with which to pay her old debts., This is the Compromise of 1850., Preceding the Presidential election of 1852, each of the great political parties, Democrats and Whigs, met in convention and adopted resolutions indorsing the Compromise of '50, as a ""finality,"" a final settlement, so far as these parties could make it so, of all slavery agitation., Previous to this, in 1851, the Illinois Legislature had indorsed it., During this long period of time, Nebraska (the Nebraska Territory, not the State of as we know it now) had remained substantially an uninhabited country, but now emigration to and settlement within it began to take place., It is about one third as large as the present United States, and its importance, so long overlooked, begins to come into view., The restriction of slavery by the Missouri Compromise directly applies to it--in fact was first made, and has since been maintained expressly for it., In 1853, a bill to give it a territorial government passed the House of Representatives, and, in the hands of Judge Douglas, failed of passing only for want of time., This bill contained no repeal of the Missouri Compromise., Indeed, when it was assailed because it did not contain such repeal, Judge Douglas defended it in its existing form., On January 4, 1854, Judge Douglas introduces a new bill to give Nebraska territorial government., He accompanies this bill with a report, in which last he expressly recommends that the Missouri Compromise shall neither be affirmed nor repealed., Before long the bill is so modified as to make two territories instead of one, calling the southern one Kansas., Also, about a month after the introduction of the bill, on the Judge's own motion it is so amended as to declare the Missouri Compromise inoperative and void; and, substantially, that the people who go and settle there may establish slavery, or exclude it, as they may see fit., In this shape the bill passed both branches of Congress and became a law., This is the repeal of the Missouri Compromise., The foregoing history may not be precisely accurate in every particular, but I am sure it is sufficiently so for all the use I shall attempt to make of it, and in it we have before us the chief material enabling us to judge correctly whether the repeal of the Missouri Compromise is right or wrong., I think, and shall try to show, that it is wrong--wrong in its direct effect, letting slavery into Kansas and Nebraska, and wrong in its prospective principle, allowing it to spread to every other part of the wide world where men can be found inclined to take it., This declared indifference, but, as I must think, covert real zeal, for the spread of slavery, I cannot but hate., I hate it because of the monstrous injustice of slavery itself., I hate it because it deprives our republican example of its just influence in the world; enables the enemies of free institutions with plausibility to taunt us as hypocrites; causes the real friends of freedom to doubt our sincerity; and especially because it forces so many good men among ourselves into an open war with the very fundamental principles of civil liberty, criticizing the Declaration of Independence, and insisting that there is no right principle of action but self-interest., Before proceeding let me say that I think I have no prejudice against the Southern people., They are just what we would be in their situation., If slavery did not now exist among them, they would not introduce it., If it did now exist among us, we should not instantly give it up., This I believe of the masses North and South., Doubtless there are individuals on both sides who would not hold slaves under any circumstances, and others who would gladly introduce slavery anew if it were out of existence., We know that some Southern men do free their slaves, go North and become tip-top abolitionists, while some Northern ones go South and become most cruel slave masters., When Southern people tell us that they are no more responsible for the origin of slavery than we are, I acknowledge the fact., When it is said that the institution exists, and that it is very difficult to get rid of it in any satisfactory way, I can understand and appreciate the saying., I surely will not blame them for not doing what I should not know how to do myself., If all earthly power were given me, I should not know what to do as to the existing institution., My first impulse would be to free all the slaves, and send them to Liberia, to their own native land., But a moment's reflection would convince me that whatever of high hope (as I think there is) there may be in this in the long run, its sudden execution is impossible., If they were all landed there in a day, they would all perish in the next ten days; and there are not surplus shipping and surplus money enough to carry them there in many times ten days., What then?, Free them all, and keep them among us as underlings?, Is it quite certain that this betters their condition?, I think I would not hold one in slavery at any rate, yet the point is not clear enough for me to denounce people upon., What next?, Free them, and make them politically and socially our equals?, My own feelings will not admit of this, and if mine would, we well know that those of the great mass of whites will not., Whether this feeling accords with justice and sound judgment is not the sole question, if indeed it is any part of it., A universal feeling, whether well or ill founded, cannot be safely disregarded., We cannot then make them equals., It does seem to me that systems of gradual emancipation might be adopted, but for their tardiness in this I will not undertake to judge our brethren of the South., ...]"|3
21|"[It was frequently spoken of by members of Congress, and by citizens of Washington, six years ago; and I heard no one express a doubt that a system of gradual emancipation, with compensation to owners, would meet the approbation of a large majority of the white people of the District., But without the action of Congress they could say nothing; and Congress said ""No."", In the measures of 1850, Congress had the subject of slavery in the District expressly on hand., If they were then establishing the principle of allowing the people to do as they please with slavery, why did they not apply the principle to that people?, Again it is claimed that by the resolutions of the Illinois Legislature, passed in 1851, the repeal of the Missouri Compromise was demanded., This I deny also., Whatever may be worked out by a criticism of the language of those resolutions, the people have never understood them as being any more than an indorsement of the compromises of 1850, and a release of our senators from voting for the Wilmot Proviso., The whole people are living witnesses that this only was their view., Finally, it is asked, ""If we did not mean to apply the Utah and New Mexico provision to all future territories, what did we mean when we, in 1852, indorsed the compromises of 1850?"", For myself I can answer this question most easily., I meant not to ask a repeal or modification of the Fugitive Slave law., I meant not to ask for the abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia., I meant not to resist the admission of Utah and New Mexico, even should they ask to come in as slave States., I meant nothing about additional Territories, because, as I understood, we then had no Territory whose character as to slavery was not already settled., As to Nebraska, I regarded its character as being fixed by the Missouri Compromise for thirty years--as unalterably fixed as that of my own home in Illinois., As to new acquisitions, I said, ""Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof."", When we make new acquisitions, we will, as heretofore, try to manage them somehow., That is my answer; that is what I meant and said; and I appeal to the people to say each for himself whether that is not also the universal meaning of the free States., And now, in turn, let me ask a few questions., If, by any or all these matters, the repeal of the Missouri Compromise was commanded, why was not the command sooner obeyed?, Why was the repeal omitted in the Nebraska Bill of 1853?, Why was it omitted in the original bill of 1854?, Why in the accompanying report was such a repeal characterized as a departure from the course pursued in 1850 and its continued omission recommended?, I am aware Judge Douglas now argues that the subsequent express repeal is no substantial alteration of the bill., This argument seems wonderful to me., It is as if one should argue that white and black are not different., He admits, however, that there is a literal change in the bill, and that he made the change in deference to other senators who would not support the bill without., This proves that those other senators thought the change a substantial one, and that the Judge thought their opinions worth deferring to., His own opinions, therefore, seem not to rest on a very firm basis, even in his own mind; and I suppose the world believes, and will continue to believe, that precisely on the substance of that change this whole agitation has arisen., I conclude, then, that the public never demanded the repeal of the Missouri Compromise., I now come to consider whether the appeal with its avowed principles, is intrinsically right., I insist that it is not., Take the particular case., A controversy had arisen between the advocates and opponents of slavery, in relation to its establishment within the country we had purchased of France., The southern, and then best, part of the purchase was already in as a slave State., The controversy was settled by also letting Missouri in as a slave State; but with the agreement that within all the remaining part of the purchase, north of a certain line, there should never be slavery., As to what was to be done with the remaining part, south of the line, nothing was said; but perhaps the fair implication was, it should come in with slavery if it should so choose., The southern part, except a portion heretofore mentioned, afterward did come in with slavery, as the State of Arkansas., All these many years, since 1820, the northern part had remained a wilderness., At length settlements began in it also., In due course Iowa came in as a free State, and Minnesota was given a territorial government, without removing the slavery restriction., Finally, the sole remaining part north of the line--Kansas and Nebraska--was to be organized; and it is proposed, and carried, to blot out the old dividing line of thirty-four years' standing, and to open the whole of that country to the introduction of slavery., Now this, to my mind, is manifestly unjust., After an angry and dangerous controversy, the parties made friends by dividing the bone of contention., The one party first appropriates her own share, beyond all power to be disturbed in the possession of it, and then seizes the share of the other party., It is as if two starving men had divided their only loaf, the one had hastily swallowed his half, and then grabbed the other's half just as he was putting it to his mouth., Let me here drop the main argument, to notice what I consider rather an inferior matter., It is argued that slavery will not go to Kansas and Nebraska, in any event., This is a palliation, a lullaby., I have some hope that it will not; but let us not be too confident., As to climate, a glance at the map shows that there are five slave States--Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, Kentucky, and Missouri, and also the District of Columbia, all north of the Missouri Compromise line., The census returns of 1850 show that within these there are eight hundred and sixty-seven thousand two hundred and seventy-six slaves, being more than one fourth of all the slaves in the nation., It is not climate, then, that will keep slavery out of these Territories., Is there anything in the peculiar nature of the country?, Missouri adjoins these Territories by her entire western boundary, and slavery is already within every one of her western counties., I have even heard it said that there are more slaves in proportion to whites in the northwestern county of Missouri than within any other county in the State., Slavery pressed entirely up to the old western boundary of the State, and when rather recently a part of that boundary at the northwest was moved out a little farther west, slavery followed on quite up to the new line., Now, when the restriction is removed, what is to prevent it from going still farther?, Climate will not, no peculiarity of the country will, nothing in nature will., Will the disposition of the people prevent it?, Those nearest the scene are all in favor of the extension., The Yankees who are opposed to it may be most flumerous; but, in military phrase, the battlefield is too far from their base of operations., But it is said there now is no law in Nebraska on the subject of slavery, and that, in such case, taking a slave there operates his freedom., That is good book-law, but it is not the rule of actual practice., Wherever slavery is it has been first introduced without law., The oldest laws we find concerning it are not laws introducing it, but regulating it as an already existing thing., A white man takes his slave to Nebraska now., Who will inform the negro that he is free?, Who will take him before court to test the question of his freedom?, In ignorance of his legal emancipation he is kept chopping, splitting, and plowing., Others are brought, and move on in the same track., At last, if ever the time for voting comes on the question of slavery the institution already, in fact, exists in the country, and cannot well be removed., The fact of its presence, and the difficulty of its removal, will carry the vote in its favor., Keep it out until a vote is taken, and a vote in favor of it cannot be got in any population of forty thousand on earth, who have been drawn together by the ordinary motives of emigration and settlement., To get slaves into the Territory simultaneously with the whites in the incipient stages of settlement is the precise stake played for and won in this Nebraska measure., The question is asked us: ""If slaves will go in notwithstanding the general principle of law liberates them, why would they not equally go in against positive statute law--go in, even if the Missouri restriction were maintained!"", I answer, because it takes a much bolder man to venture in with his property in the latter case than in the former; because the positive Congressional enactment is known to and respected by all, or nearly all, whereas the negative principle that no law is free law is not much known except among lawyers., We have some experience of this practical difference., In spite of the Ordinance of '87, a few negroes were brought into Illinois, and held in a state of quasi-slavery, not enough, however, to carry a vote of the people in favor of the institution when they came to form a constitution., But into the adjoining Missouri country, where there was no Ordinance of '87,--was no restriction,--they were carried ten times, nay, a hundred times, as fast, and actually made a slave State., This is fact-naked fact., Another lullaby argument is that taking slaves to new countries does not increase their number, does not make any one slave who would otherwise be free., There is some truth in this, and I am glad of it; but it is not wholly true., The African slave trade is not yet effectually suppressed; and, if we make a reasonable deduction for the white people among us who are foreigners and the descendants of foreigners arriving here since 1808, we shall find the increase of the black population outrunning that of the white to an extent unaccountable, except by supposing that some of them, too, have been coming from Africa., If this be so, the opening of new countries to the institution increases the demand for and augments the price of slaves, and so does, in fact, make slaves of freemen, by causing them to be brought from Africa and sold into bondage., But however this may be, we know the opening of new countries to slavery tends to the perpetuation of the institution, and so does keep men in slavery who would otherwise be free., This result we do not feel like favoring, and we are under no legal obligation to suppress our feelings in this respect., Equal justice to the South, it is said, requires us to consent to the extension of slavery to new countries., That is to say, inasmuch as you do not object to my taking my hog to Nebraska, therefore I must not object to your taking your slave., Now, I admit that this is perfectly logical if there is no difference between hogs and negroes., But while you thus require me to deny the humanity of the negro, I wish to ask whether you of the South, yourselves, have ever been willing to do as much?, It is kindly provided that of all those who come into the world only a small percentage are natural tyrants., That percentage is no larger in the slave States than in the free., The great majority South, as well as North, have human sympathies, of which they can no more divest themselves than they can of their sensibility to physical pain., These sympathies in the bosoms of the Southern people manifest, in many ways, their sense of the wrong of slavery, and their consciousness that, after all, there is humanity in the negro., If they deny this, let me address them a few plain questions., In 1820 you (the South) joined the North, almost unanimously, in declaring the African slave trade piracy, and in annexing to it the punishment of death., Why did you do this?, If you did not feel that it was wrong, why did you join in providing that men should be hung for it?, The practice was no more than bringing wild negroes from Africa to such as would buy them., ...]"|3
22|"[If this be the rule, you must leave it to each individual to say for himself whether he will have slaves., What better moral right have thirty-one citizens of Nebraska to say that the thirty-second shall not hold slaves than the people of the thirty-one States have to say that slavery shall not go into the thirty-second State at all?, But if it is a sacred right for the people of Nebraska to take and hold slaves there, it is equally their sacred right to buy them where they can buy them cheapest; and that, undoubtedly, will be on the coast of Africa, provided you will consent not to hang them for going there to buy them., You must remove this restriction, too, from the sacred right of self-government., I am aware you say that taking slaves from the States to Nebraska does not make slaves of freemen; but the African slave-trader can say just as much., He does not catch free negroes and bring them here., He finds them already slaves in the hands of their black captors, and he honestly buys them at the rate of a red cotton handkerchief a head., This is very cheap, and it is a great abridgment of the sacred right of self-government to hang men for engaging in this profitable trade., Another important objection to this application of the right of self-government is that it enables the first few to deprive the succeeding many of a free exercise of the right of self-government., The first few may get slavery in, and the subsequent many cannot easily get it out., How common is the remark now in the slave States, ""If we were only clear of our slaves, how much better it would be for us."", They are actually deprived of the privilege of governing themselves as they would, by the action of a very few in the beginning., The same thing was true of the whole nation at the time our Constitution was formed., Whether slavery shall go into Nebraska, or other new Territories, is not a matter of exclusive concern to the people who may go there., The whole nation is interested that the best use shall be made of these Territories., We want them for homes of free white people., This they cannot be, to any considerable extent, if slavery shall be planted within them., Slave States are places for poor white people to remove from, not to remove to., New free States are the places for poor people to go to, and better their condition., For this use the nation needs these Territories., Still further: there are constitutional relations between the slave and free States which are degrading to the latter., We are under legal obligations to catch and return their runaway slaves to them: a sort of dirty, disagreeable job, which, I believe, as a general rule, the slaveholders will not perform for one another., Then again, in the control of the government--the management of the partnership affairs--they have greatly the advantage of us., By the Constitution each State has two senators, each has a number of representatives in proportion to the number of its people, and each has a number of Presidential electors equal to the whole number of its senators and representatives together., But in ascertaining the number of the people for this purpose, five slaves are counted as being equal to three whites., The slaves do not vote; they are only counted and so used as to swell the influence of the white people's votes., The practical effect of this is more aptly shown by a comparison of the States of South Carolina and Maine., South Carolina has six representatives, and so has Maine; South Carolina has eight Presidential electors, and so has Maine., This is precise equality so far; and of course they are equal in senators, each having two., Thus in the control of the government the two States are equals precisely., But how are they in the number of their white people?, Maine has 581,813, while South Carolina has 274,567; Maine has twice as many as South Carolina, and 32,679 over., Thus, each white man in South Carolina is more than the double of any man in Maine., This is all because South Carolina, besides her free people, has 384,984 slaves., The South Carolinian has precisely the same advantage over the white man in every other free State as well as in Maine., He is more than the double of any one of us in this crowd., The same advantage, but not to the same extent, is held by all the citizens of the slave States over those of the free; and it is an absolute truth, without an exception, that there is no voter in any slave State but who has more legal power in the government than any voter in any free State., There is no instance of exact equality; and the disadvantage is against us the whole chapter through., This principle, in the aggregate, gives the slave States in the present Congress twenty additional representatives, being seven more than the whole majority by which they passed the Nebraska Bill., Now all this is manifestly unfair; yet I do not mention it to complain of it, in so far as it is already settled., It is in the Constitution, and I do not for that cause, or any other cause, propose to destroy, or alter, or disregard the Constitution., I stand to it, fairly, fully, and firmly., But when I am told I must leave it altogether to other people to say whether new partners are to be bred up and brought into the firm, on the same degrading terms against me, I respectfully demur., I insist that whether I shall be a whole man or only the half of one, in comparison with others is a question in which I am somewhat concerned, and one which no other man can have a sacred right of deciding for me., If I am wrong in this, if it really be a sacred right of self-government in the man who shall go to Nebraska to decide whether he will be the equal of me or the double of me, then, after he shall have exercised that right, and thereby shall have reduced me to a still smaller fraction of a man than I already am, I should like for some gentleman, deeply skilled in the mysteries of sacred rights, to provide himself with a microscope, and peep about, and find out, if he can, what has become of my sacred rights., They will surely be too small for detection with the naked eye., Finally, I insist that if there is anything which it is the duty of the whole people to never intrust to any hands but their own, that thing is the preservation and perpetuity of their own liberties and institutions., And if they shall think as I do, that the extension of slavery endangers them more than any or all other causes, how recreant to themselves if they submit The question, and with it the fate of their country, to a mere handful of men bent only on self-interest., If this question of slavery extension were an insignificant one, one having no power to do harm--it might be shuffled aside in this way; and being, as it is, the great Behemoth of danger, shall the strong grip of the nation be loosened upon him, to intrust him to the hands of such feeble keepers?, I have done with this mighty argument of self-government., Go, sacred thing!, Go in peace., But Nebraska is urged as a great Union-saving measure., Well, I too go for saving the Union., Much as I hate slavery, I would consent to the extension of it rather than see the Union dissolved, just as I would consent to any great evil to avoid a greater one., But when I go to Union-saving, I must believe, at least, that the means I employ have some adaptation to the end., To my mind, Nebraska has no such adaptation., ""It hath no relish of salvation in it."", It is an aggravation, rather, of the only one thing which ever endangers the Union., When it came upon us, all was peace and quiet., The nation was looking to the forming of new bends of union, and a long course of peace and prosperity seemed to lie before us., In the whole range of possibility, there scarcely appears to me to have been anything out of which the slavery agitation could have been revived, except the very project of repealing the Missouri Compromise., Every inch of territory we owned already had a definite settlement of the slavery question, by which all parties were pledged to abide., Indeed, there was no uninhabited country on the continent which we could acquire, if we except some extreme northern regions which are wholly out of the question., In this state of affairs the Genius of Discord himself could scarcely have invented a way of again setting us by the ears but by turning back and destroying the peace measures of the past., The counsels of that Genius seem to have prevailed., The Missouri Compromise was repealed; and here we are in the midst of a new slavery agitation, such, I think, as we have never seen before., Who is responsible for this?, Is it those who resist the measure, or those who causelessly brought it forward, and pressed it through, having reason to know, and in fact knowing, it must and would be so resisted?, It could not but be expected by its author that it would be looked upon as a measure for the extension of slavery, aggravated by a gross breach of faith., Argue as you will and long as you will, this is the naked front and aspect of the measure., And in this aspect it could not but produce agitation., Slavery is founded in the selfishness of man's nature--opposition to it in his love of justice., These principles are at eternal antagonism, and when brought into collision so fiercely as slavery extension brings them, shocks and throes and convulsions must ceaselessly follow., Repeal the Missouri Compromise, repeal all compromises, repeal the Declaration of Independence, repeal all past history, you still cannot repeal human nature., It still will be the abundance of man's heart that slavery extension is wrong, and out of the abundance of his heart his mouth will continue to speak., The structure, too, of the Nebraska Bill is very peculiar., The people are to decide the question of slavery for themselves; but when they are to decide, or how they are to decide, or whether, when the question is once decided, it is to remain so or is to be subject to an indefinite succession of new trials, the law does not say., Is it to be decided by the first dozen settlers who arrive there, or is it to await the arrival of a hundred?, Is it to be decided by a vote of the people or a vote of the Legislature, or, indeed, by a vote of any sort?, To these questions the law gives no answer., There is a mystery about this; for when a member proposed to give the Legislature express authority to exclude slavery, it was hooted down by the friends of the bill., This fact is worth remembering., Some Yankees in the East are sending emigrants to Nebraska to exclude slavery from it; and, so far as I can judge, they expect the question to be decided by voting in some way or other., But the Missourians are awake, too., They are within a stone's-throw of the contested ground., They hold meetings and pass resolutions, in which not the slightest allusion to voting is made., They resolve that slavery already exists in the Territory; that more shall go there; that they, remaining in Missouri, will protect it, and that abolitionists shall be hung or driven away., Through all this bowie knives and six-shooters are seen plainly enough, but never a glimpse of the ballot-box., And, really, what is the result of all this?, Each party within having numerous and determined backers without, is it not probable that the contest will come to blows and bloodshed?, Could there be a more apt invention to bring about collision and violence on the slavery question than this Nebraska project is?, I do not charge or believe that such was intended by Congress; but if they had literally formed a ring and placed champions within it to fight out the controversy, the fight could be no more likely to come off than it is., And if this fight should begin, is it likely to take a very peaceful, Union-saving turn?, Will not the first drop of blood so shed be the real knell of the Union?, The Missouri Compromise ought to be restored., For the sake of the Union, it ought to be restored., We ought to elect a House of Representatives which will vote its restoration., If by any means we omit to do this, what follows?, Slavery may or may not be established in Nebraska., ...]"|3
23|"[Henceforth it is to be the chief jewel of the nation the very figure-head of the ship of state., Little by little, but steadily as man's march to the grave, we have been giving up the old for the new faith., Near eighty years ago we began by declaring that all men are created equal; but now from that beginning we have run down to the other declaration, that for some men to enslave others is a ""sacred right of self-government."", These principles cannot stand together., They are as opposite as God and Mammon; and who ever holds to the one must despise the other., When Pettit, in connection with his support of the Nebraska Bill, called the Declaration of Independence ""a self-evident lie,"" he only did what consistency and candor require all other Nebraska men to do., Of the forty-odd Nebraska senators who sat present and heard him, no one rebuked him., Nor am I apprised that any Nebraska newspaper, or any Nebraska orator, in the whole nation has ever yet rebuked him., If this had been said among Marion's men, Southerners though they were, what would have become of the man who said it?, If this had been said to the men who captured Andre, the man who said it would probably have been hung sooner than Andre was., If it had been said in old Independence Hall seventy-eight years ago, the very doorkeeper would have throttled the man and thrust him into the street., Let no one be deceived., The spirit of seventy-six and the spirit of Nebraska are utter antagonisms; and the former is being rapidly displaced by the latter., Fellow-countrymen, Americans, South as well as North, shall we make no effort to arrest this?, Already the liberal party throughout the world express the apprehension that ""the one retrograde institution in America is undermining the principles of progress, and fatally violating the noblest political system the world ever saw."", This is not the taunt of enemies, but the warning of friends., Is it quite safe to disregard it--to despise it?, Is there no danger to liberty itself in discarding the earliest practice and first precept of our ancient faith?, In our greedy chase to make profit of the negro, let us beware lest we ""cancel and tear in pieces"" even the white man's charter of freedom., Our republican robe is soiled and trailed in the dust., Let us repurify it., Let us turn and wash it white in the spirit, if not the blood, of the Revolution., Let us turn slavery from its claims of ""moral right,"" back upon its existing legal rights and its arguments of ""necessity."", Let us return it to the position our fathers gave it, and there let it rest in peace., Let us readopt the Declaration of Independence, and with it the practices and policy which harmonize with it., Let North and South, let all Americans--let all lovers of liberty everywhere join in the great and good work., If we do this, we shall not only have saved the Union, but we shall have so saved it as to make and to keep it forever worthy of the saving., We shall have so saved it that the succeeding millions of free happy people the world over shall rise up and call us blessed to the latest generations., At Springfield, twelve days ago, where I had spoken substantially as I have here, Judge Douglas replied to me; and as he is to reply to me here, I shall attempt to anticipate him by noticing some of the points he made there., He commenced by stating I had assumed all the way through that the principle of the Nebraska Bill would have the effect of extending slavery., He denied that this was intended or that this effect would follow., I will not reopen the argument upon this point., That such was the intention the world believed at the start, and will continue to believe., This was the countenance of the thing, and both friends and enemies instantly recognized it as such., That countenance cannot now be changed by argument., You can as easily argue the color out of the negro's skin., Like the ""bloody hand,"" you may wash it and wash it, the red witness of guilt still sticks and stares horribly at you., Next he says that Congressional intervention never prevented slavery anywhere; that it did not prevent it in the Northwestern Territory, nor in Illinois; that, in fact, Illinois came into the Union as a slave State; that the principle of the Nebraska Bill expelled it from Illinois, from several old States, from everywhere., Now this is mere quibbling all the way through., If the Ordinance of '87 did not keep slavery out of the Northwest Territory, how happens it that the northwest shore of the Ohio River is entirely free from it, while the southeast shore, less than a mile distant, along nearly the whole length of the river, is entirely covered with it?, If that ordinance did not keep it out of Illinois, what was it that made the difference between Illinois and Missouri?, They lie side by side, the Mississippi River only dividing them, while their early settlements were within the same latitude., Between 1810 and 1820 the number of slaves in Missouri increased 7211, while in Illinois in the same ten years they decreased 51., This appears by the census returns., During nearly all of that ten years both were Territories, not States., During this time the ordinance forbade slavery to go into Illinois, and nothing forbade it to go into Missouri., It did go into Missouri, and did not go into Illinois., That is the fact., Can any one doubt as to the reason of it?, But he says Illinois came into the Union as a slave State., Silence, perhaps, would be the best answer to this flat contradiction of the known history of the country., What are the facts upon which this bold assertion is based?, When we first acquired the country, as far back as 1787, there were some slaves within it held by the French inhabitants of Kaskaskia., The territorial legislation admitted a few negroes from the slave States as indentured servants., One year after the adoption of the first State constitution, the whole number of them was--what do you think?, Just one hundred and seventeen, while the aggregate free population was 55,094,--about four hundred and seventy to one., Upon this state of facts the people framed their constitution prohibiting the further introduction of slavery, with a sort of guaranty to the owners of the few indentured servants, giving freedom to their children to be born thereafter, and making no mention whatever of any supposed slave for life., Out of this small matter the Judge manufactures his argument that Illinois came into the Union as a slave State., Let the facts be the answer to the argument., The principles of the Nebraska Bill, he says, expelled slavery from Illinois., The principle of that bill first planted it here--that is, it first came because there was no law to prevent it, first came before we owned the country; and finding it here, and having the Ordinance of '87 to prevent its increasing, our people struggled along, and finally got rid of it as best they could., But the principle of the Nebraska Bill abolished slavery in several of the old States., Well, it is true that several of the old States, in the last quarter of the last century, did adopt systems of gradual emancipation by which the institution has finally become extinct within their limits; but it may or may not be true that the principle of the Nebraska Bill was the cause that led to the adoption of these measures., It is now more than fifty years since the last of these States adopted its system of emancipation., If the Nebraska Bill is the real author of the benevolent works, it is rather deplorable that it has for so long a time ceased working altogether., Is there not some reason to suspect that it was the principle of the Revolution, and not the principle of the Nebraska Bill, that led to emancipation in these old States?, Leave it to the people of these old emancipating States, and I am quite certain they will decide that neither that nor any other good thing ever did or ever will come of the Nebraska Bill., In the course of my main argument, Judge Douglas interrupted me to say that the principle of the Nebraska Bill was very old; that it originated when God made man, and placed good and evil before him, allowing him to choose for himself, being responsible for the choice he should make., At the time I thought this was merely playful, and I answered it accordingly., But in his reply to me he renewed it as a serious argument., In seriousness, then, the facts of this proposition are not true as stated., God did not place good and evil before man, telling him to make his choice., On the contrary, he did tell him there was one tree of the fruit of which he should not eat, upon pain of certain death., I should scarcely wish so strong a prohibition against slavery in Nebraska., But this argument strikes me as not a little remarkable in another particular--in its strong resemblance to the old argument for the ""divine right of kings."", By the latter, the king is to do just as he pleases with his white subjects, being responsible to God alone., By the former, the white man is to do just as he pleases with his black slaves, being responsible to God alone., The two things are precisely alike, and it is but natural that they should find similar arguments to sustain them., I had argued that the application of the principle of self-government, as contended for, would require the revival of the African slave trade; that no argument could be made in favor of a man's right to take slaves to Nebraska which could not be equally well made in favor of his right to bring them from the coast of Africa., The Judge replied that the Constitution requires the suppression of the foreign slave trade, but does not require the prohibition of slavery in the Territories., That is a mistake in point of fact., The Constitution does not require the action of Congress in either case, and it does authorize it in both., And so there is still no difference between the cases., In regard to what I have said of the advantage the slave States have over the free in the matter of representation, the Judge replied that we in the free States count five free negroes as five white people, while in the slave States they count five slaves as three whites only; and that the advantage, at last, was on the side of the free States., Now, in the slave States they count free negroes just as we do; and it so happens that, besides their slaves, they have as many free negroes as we have, and thirty thousand over., Thus, their free negroes more than balance ours; and their advantage over us, in consequence of their slaves, still remains as I stated it., In reply to my argument that the compromise measures of 1850 were a system of equivalents, and that the provisions of no one of them could fairly be carried to other subjects without its corresponding equivalent being carried with it, the Judge denied outright that these measures had any connection with or dependence upon each other., This is mere desperation., If they had no connection, why are they always spoken of in connection?, Why has he so spoken of them a thousand times?, Why has he constantly called them a series of measures?, Why does everybody call them a compromise?, Why was California kept out of the Union six or seven months, if it was not because of its connection with the other measures?, Webster's leading definition of the verb ""to compromise"" is ""to adjust and settle a difference, by mutual agreement, with concessions of claims by the parties."", This conveys precisely the popular understanding of the word ""compromise."", We knew, before the Judge told us, that these measures passed separately, and in distinct bills, and that no two of them were passed by the votes of precisely the same members., But we also know, and so does he know, that no one of them could have passed both branches of Congress but for the understanding that the others were to pass also., Upon this understanding, each got votes which it could have got in no other way., It is this fact which gives to the measures their true character; and it is the universal knowledge of this fact that has given them the name of ""compromises,"" so expressive of that true character., I had asked: ""If, in carrying the Utah and New Mexico laws to Nebraska, you could clear away other objection, how could you leave Nebraska 'perfectly free' to introduce slavery before she forms a constitution, during her territorial government, while the Utah and New Mexico laws only authorize it when they form constitutions and are admitted into the Union?"", ...]"|3
24|"[William J., Black is also an applicant for the appointment, and I write this at the solicitation of his friends to say that he is every way worthy of the office, and that I doubt not the conferring it upon him will give great satisfaction., Yours of the 11th was received last night, and for which I thank you., Of course I prefer myself to all others; yet it is neither in my heart nor my conscience to say I am any better man than Mr. Williams., We shall have a terrible struggle with our adversaries., They are desperate and bent on desperate deeds., I accidentally learned of one of the leaders here writing to a member south of here, in about the following language:  We are beaten., They have a clean majority of at least nine, on joint ballot., They outnumber us, but we must outmanage them., Douglas must be sustained., We must elect the Speaker; and we must elect a Nebraska United States Senator, or ""elect none at all."", Similar letters, no doubt, are written to every Nebraska member., Be considering how we can best meet, and foil, and beat them., I send you, by mail, a copy of my Peoria speech., You may have seen it before, or you may not think it worth seeing now., Do not speak of the Nebraska letter mentioned above; I do not wish it to become public, that I received such information., I began with 44 votes, Shields 41, and Trumbull 5,--yet Trumbull was elected., In fact 47 different members voted for me,--getting three new ones on the second ballot, and losing four old ones., How came my 47 to yield to Trumbull's 5?, It was Governor Matteson's work., He has been secretly a candidate ever since (before, even) the fall election., All the members round about the canal were Anti-Nebraska, but were nevertheless nearly all Democrats and old personal friends of his., His plan was to privately impress them with the belief that he was as good Anti-Nebraska as any one else--at least could be secured to be so by instructions, which could be easily passed., The Nebraska men, of course, were not for Matteson; but when they found they could elect no avowed Nebraska man, they tardily determined to let him get whomever of our men he could, by whatever means he could, and ask him no questions., The Nebraska men were very confident of the election of Matteson, though denying that he was a candidate, and we very much believing also that they would elect him., But they wanted first to make a show of good faith to Shields by voting for him a few times, and our secret Matteson men also wanted to make a show of good faith by voting with us a few times., So we led off., On the seventh ballot, I think, the signal was given to the Nebraska men to turn to Matteson, which they acted on to a man, with one exception., ., ., Next ballot the remaining Nebraska man and one pretended Anti went over to him, giving him 46., The next still another, giving him 47, wanting only three of an election., In the meantime our friends, with a view of detaining our expected bolters, had been turning from me to Trumbull till he had risen to 35 and I had been reduced to 15., These would never desert me except by my direction; but I became satisfied that if we could prevent Matteson's election one or two ballots more, we could not possibly do so a single ballot after my friends should begin to return to me from Trumbull., So I determined to strike at once, and accordingly advised my remaining friends to go for him, which they did and elected him on the tenth ballot., Such is the way the thing was done., I think you would have done the same under the circumstances., I could have headed off every combination and been elected, had it not been for Matteson's double game--and his defeat now gives me more pleasure than my own gives me pain., On the whole, it is perhaps as well for our general cause that Trumbull is elected., The Nebraska men confess that they hate it worse than anything that could have happened., It is a great consolation to see them worse whipped than I am., Yours of the 5th is received, as also was that of 15th Dec, last, inclosing bond of Clift to Pray., When I received the bond I was dabbling in politics, and of course neglecting business., Having since been beaten out I have gone to work again., As I do not practice in Rushville, I to-day open a correspondence with Henry E. Dummer, Esq., of Beardstown, Ill., with the view of getting the job into his hands., He is a good man if he will undertake it., Write me whether I shall do this or return the bond to you., Your letter to Judge Logan has been shown to us by him; and, with his consent, we answer it., When it became probable that there would be a vacancy on the Supreme Bench, public opinion, on this side of the river, seemed to be universally directed to Logan as the proper man to fill it., I mean public opinion on our side in politics, with very small manifestation in any different direction by the other side., The result is, that he has been a good deal pressed to allow his name to be used, and he has consented to it, provided it can be done with perfect cordiality and good feeling on the part of all our own friends., We, the undersigned, are very anxious for it; and the more so now that he has been urged, until his mind is turned upon the matter., We, therefore are very glad of your letter, with the information it brings us, mixed only with a regret that we can not elect Logan and Walker both., We shall be glad, if you will hoist Logan's name, in your Quincy papers., Very truly your friends,  Your note containing election news is received; and for which I thank you., It is all of no use, however., Logan is worse beaten than any other man ever was since elections were invented--beaten more than twelve hundred in this county., It is conceded on all hands that the Prohibitory law is also beaten., You know what a poor correspondent I am., Ever since I received your very agreeable letter of the 22d of May, I have been intending to write you an answer to it., You suggest that in political action, now, you and I would differ., I suppose we would; not quite as much, however, as you may think., You know I dislike slavery, and you fully admit the abstract wrong of it., So far there is no cause of difference., But you say that sooner than yield your legal right to the slave, especially at the bidding of those who are not themselves interested, you would see the Union dissolved., I am not aware that any one is bidding you yield that right; very certainly I am not., I leave that matter entirely to yourself., I also acknowledge your rights and my obligations under the Constitution in regard to your slaves., I confess I hate to see the poor creatures hunted down and caught and carried back to their stripes and unrequited toil; but I bite my lips and keep quiet., In 1841 you and I had together a tedious low-water trip on a steamboat from Louisville to St. Louis., You may remember, as I well do, that from Louisville to the mouth of the Ohio there were on board ten or a dozen slaves shackled together with irons., That sight was a continued torment to me, and I see something like it every time I touch the Ohio or any other slave border., It is not fair for you to assume that I have no interest in a thing which has, and continually exercises, the power of making me miserable., You ought rather to appreciate how much the great body of the Northern people do crucify their feelings, in order to maintain their loyalty to the Constitution and the Union., I do oppose the extension of slavery because my judgment and feeling so prompt me, and I am under no obligations to the contrary., If for this you and I must differ, differ we must., You say, if you were President, you would send an army and hang the leaders of the Missouri outrages upon the Kansas elections; still, if Kansas fairly votes herself a slave State she must be admitted or the Union must be dissolved., But how if she votes herself a slave State unfairly, that is, by the very means for which you say you would hang men?, Must she still be admitted, or the Union dissolved?, That will be the phase of the question when it first becomes a practical one., In your assumption that there may be a fair decision of the slavery question in Kansas, I plainly see you and I would differ about the Nebraska law., I look upon that enactment not as a law, but as a violence from the beginning., It was conceived in violence, is maintained in violence, and is being executed in violence., I say it was conceived in violence, because the destruction of the Missouri Compromise, under the circumstances, was nothing less than violence., It was passed in violence because it could not have passed at all but for the votes of many members in violence of the known will of their constituents., It is maintained in violence, because the elections since clearly demand its repeal; and the demand is openly disregarded., You say men ought to be hung for the way they are executing the law; I say the way it is being executed is quite as good as any of its antecedents., It is being executed in the precise way which was intended from the first, else why does no Nebraska man express astonishment or condemnation?, Poor Reeder is the only public man who has been silly enough to believe that anything like fairness was ever intended, and he has been bravely undeceived., That Kansas will form a slave constitution, and with it will ask to be admitted into the Union, I take to be already a settled question, and so settled by the very means you so pointedly condemn., By every principle of law ever held by any court North or South, every negro taken to Kansas is free; yet, in utter disregard of this,--in the spirit of violence merely,--that beautiful Legislature gravely passes a law to hang any man who shall venture to inform a negro of his legal rights., This is the subject and real object of the law., If, like Haman, they should hang upon the gallows of their own building, I shall not be among the mourners for their fate., In my humble sphere, I shall advocate the restoration of the Missouri Compromise so long as Kansas remains a Territory, and when, by all these foul means, it seeks to come into the Union as a slave State, I shall oppose it., I am very loath in any case to withhold my assent to the enjoyment of property acquired or located in good faith; but I do not admit that good faith in taking a negro to Kansas to be held in slavery is a probability with any man., Any man who has sense enough to be the controller of his own property has too much sense to misunderstand the outrageous character of the whole Nebraska business., But I digress., In my opposition to the admission of Kansas I shall have some company, but we may be beaten., If we are, I shall not on that account attempt to dissolve the Union., I think it probable, however, we shall be beaten., ...]"|3
25|"[., ., any book, paper, magazine, pamphlet, or circular containing any denial of the right of persons to hold slaves in this Territory such person shall be deemed guilty of felony, and punished by imprisonment at hard labor for a term of not less than two years., Sec., 13., No person who is conscientiously opposed to holding slaves, or who does not admit the right to hold slaves in this Territory, shall sit as a juror on the trial of any prosecution for any violation of any Sections of this Act., The party lash and the fear of ridicule will overawe justice and liberty; for it is a singular fact, but none the less a fact, and well known by the most common experience, that men will do things under the terror of the party lash that they would not on any account or for any consideration do otherwise; while men who will march up to the mouth of a loaded cannon without shrinking will run from the terrible name of ""Abolitionist,"" even when pronounced by a worthless creature whom they, with good reason, despise., For instance--to press this point a little--Judge Douglas introduced his Nebraska Bill in January; and we had an extra session of our Legislature in the succeeding February, in which were seventy-five Democrats; and at a party caucus, fully attended, there were just three votes, out of the whole seventy-five, for the measure., But in a few days orders came on from Washington, commanding them to approve the measure; the party lash was applied, and it was brought up again in caucus, and passed by a large majority., The masses were against it, but party necessity carried it; and it was passed through the lower house of Congress against the will of the people, for the same reason., Here is where the greatest danger lies that, while we profess to be a government of law and reason, law will give way to violence on demand of this awful and crushing power., Like the great Juggernaut--I think that is the name--the great idol, it crushes everything that comes in its way, and makes a [?], --or, as I read once, in a blackletter law book, ""a slave is a human being who is legally not a person but a thing."", And if the safeguards to liberty are broken down, as is now attempted, when they have made things of all the free negroes, how long, think you, before they will begin to make things of poor white men?, [Applause.], Be not deceived., Revolutions do not go backward., The founder of the Democratic party declared that all men were created equal., His successor in the leadership has written the word ""white"" before men, making it read ""all white men are created equal."", Pray, will or may not the Know-Nothings, if they should get in power, add the word ""Protestant,"" making it read ""all Protestant white men...?"", Meanwhile the hapless negro is the fruitful subject of reprisals in other quarters., John Pettit, whom Tom Benton paid his respects to, you will recollect, calls the immortal Declaration ""a self-evident lie""; while at the birthplace of freedom--in the shadow of Bunker Hill and of the ""cradle of liberty,"" at the home of the Adamses and Warren and Otis--Choate, from our side of the house, dares to fritter away the birthday promise of liberty by proclaiming the Declaration to be ""a string of glittering generalities""; and the Southern Whigs, working hand in hand with proslavery Democrats, are making Choate's theories practical., Thomas Jefferson, a slaveholder, mindful of the moral element in slavery, solemnly declared that he trembled for his country when he remembered that God is just; while Judge Douglas, with an insignificant wave of the hand, ""don't care whether slavery is voted up or voted down."", Now, if slavery is right, or even negative, he has a right to treat it in this trifling manner., But if it is a moral and political wrong, as all Christendom considers it to be, how can he answer to God for this attempt to spread and fortify it?, But no man, and Judge Douglas no more than any other, can maintain a negative, or merely neutral, position on this question; and, accordingly, he avows that the Union was made by white men and for white men and their descendants., As matter of fact, the first branch of the proposition is historically true; the government was made by white men, and they were and are the superior race., This I admit., But the corner-stone of the government, so to speak, was the declaration that ""all men are created equal,"" and all entitled to ""life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."", And not only so, but the framers of the Constitution were particular to keep out of that instrument the word ""slave,"" the reason being that slavery would ultimately come to an end, and they did not wish to have any reminder that in this free country human beings were ever prostituted to slavery., Nor is it any argument that we are superior and the negro inferior--that he has but one talent while we have ten., Let the negro possess the little he has in independence; if he has but one talent, he should be permitted to keep the little he has., [Applause:] But slavery will endure no test of reason or logic; and yet its advocates, like Douglas, use a sort of bastard logic, or noisy assumption it might better be termed, like the above, in order to prepare the mind for the gradual, but none the less certain, encroachments of the Moloch of slavery upon the fair domain of freedom., But however much you may argue upon it, or smother it in soft phrase, slavery can only be maintained by force--by violence., The repeal of the Missouri Compromise was by violence., It was a violation of both law and the sacred obligations of honor, to overthrow and trample under foot a solemn compromise, obtained by the fearful loss to freedom of one of the fairest of our Western domains., Congress violated the will and confidence of its constituents in voting for the bill; and while public sentiment, as shown by the elections of 1854, demanded the restoration of this compromise, Congress violated its trust by refusing simply because it had the force of numbers to hold on to it., And murderous violence is being used now, in order to force slavery on to Kansas; for it cannot be done in any other way., The necessary result was to establish the rule of violence--force, instead of the rule of law and reason; to perpetuate and spread slavery, and in time to make it general., We see it at both ends of the line., In Washington, on the very spot where the outrage was started, the fearless Sumner is beaten to insensibility, and is now slowly dying; while senators who claim to be gentlemen and Christians stood by, countenancing the act, and even applauding it afterward in their places in the Senate., Even Douglas, our man, saw it all and was within helping distance, yet let the murderous blows fall unopposed., Then, at the other end of the line, at the very time Sumner was being murdered, Lawrence was being destroyed for the crime of freedom., It was the most prominent stronghold of liberty in Kansas, and must give way to the all-dominating power of slavery., Only two days ago, Judge Trumbull found it necessary to propose a bill in the Senate to prevent a general civil war and to restore peace in Kansas., We live in the midst of alarms; anxiety beclouds the future; we expect some new disaster with each newspaper we read., Are we in a healthful political state?, Are not the tendencies plain?, Do not the signs of the times point plainly the way in which we are going?, In the early days of the Constitution slavery was recognized, by South and North alike, as an evil, and the division of sentiment about it was not controlled by geographical lines or considerations of climate, but by moral and philanthropic views., Petitions for the abolition of slavery were presented to the very first Congress by Virginia and Massachusetts alike., To show the harmony which prevailed, I will state that a fugitive slave law was passed in 1793, with no dissenting voice in the Senate, and but seven dissenting votes in the House., It was, however, a wise law, moderate, and, under the Constitution, a just one., Twenty-five years later, a more stringent law was proposed and defeated; and thirty-five years after that, the present law, drafted by Mason of Virginia, was passed by Northern votes., I am not, just now, complaining of this law, but I am trying to show how the current sets; for the proposed law of 1817 was far less offensive than the present one., In 1774 the Continental Congress pledged itself, without a dissenting vote, to wholly discontinue the slave trade, and to neither purchase nor import any slave; and less than three months before the passage of the Declaration of Independence, the same Congress which adopted that declaration unanimously resolved ""that no slave be imported into any of the thirteen United Colonies."", On the second day of July, 1776, the draft of a Declaration of Independence was reported to Congress by the committee, and in it the slave trade was characterized as ""an execrable commerce,"" as ""a piratical warfare,"" as the ""opprobrium of infidel powers,"" and as ""a cruel war against human nature."", All agreed on this except South Carolina and Georgia, and in order to preserve harmony, and from the necessity of the case, these expressions were omitted., Indeed, abolition societies existed as far south as Virginia; and it is a well-known fact that Washington, Jefferson, Madison, Lee, Henry, Mason, and Pendleton were qualified abolitionists, and much more radical on that subject than we of the Whig and Democratic parties claim to be to-day., On March 1, 1784, Virginia ceded to the confederation all its lands lying northwest of the Ohio River., Jefferson, Chase of Maryland, and Howell of Rhode Island, as a committee on that and territory thereafter to be ceded, reported that no slavery should exist after the year 1800., Had this report been adopted, not only the Northwest, but Kentucky, Tennessee, Alabama, and Mississippi also would have been free; but it required the assent of nine States to ratify it., North Carolina was divided, and thus its vote was lost; and Delaware, Georgia, and New Jersey refused to vote., In point of fact, as it was, it was assented to by six States., Three years later on a square vote to exclude slavery from the Northwest, only one vote, and that from New York, was against it., And yet, thirty-seven years later, five thousand citizens of Illinois, out of a voting mass of less than twelve thousand, deliberately, after a long and heated contest, voted to introduce slavery in Illinois; and, to-day, a large party in the free State of Illinois are willing to vote to fasten the shackles of slavery on the fair domain of Kansas, notwithstanding it received the dowry of freedom long before its birth as a political community., I repeat, therefore, the question: Is it not plain in what direction we are tending?, [Sensation.], In the colonial time, Mason, Pendleton, and Jefferson were as hostile to slavery in Virginia as Otis, Ames, and the Adamses were in Massachusetts; and Virginia made as earnest an effort to get rid of it as old Massachusetts did., But circumstances were against them and they failed; but not that the good will of its leading men was lacking., Yet within less than fifty years Virginia changed its tune, and made negro-breeding for the cotton and sugar States one of its leading industries., In the Constitutional Convention, George Mason of Virginia made a more violent abolition speech than my friends Lovejoy or Codding would desire to make here to-day--a speech which could not be safely repeated anywhere on Southern soil in this enlightened year., But, while there were some differences of opinion on this subject even then, discussion was allowed; but as you see by the Kansas slave code, which, as you know, is the Missouri slave code, merely ferried across the river, it is a felony to even express an opinion hostile to that foul blot in the land of Washington and the Declaration of Independence., In Kentucky--my State--in 1849, on a test vote, the mighty influence of Henry Clay and many other good then there could not get a symptom of expression in favor of gradual emancipation on a plain issue of marching toward the light of civilization with Ohio and Illinois; but the State of Boone and Hardin and Henry Clay, with a nigger under each arm, took the black trail toward the deadly swamps of barbarism., Is there--can there be--any doubt about this thing?, And is there any doubt that we must all lay aside our prejudices and march, shoulder to shoulder, in the great army of Freedom?, Every Fourth of July our young orators all proclaim this to be ""the land of the free and the home of the brave!"", Well, now, when you orators get that off next year, and, may be, this very year, how would you like some old grizzled farmer to get up in the grove and deny it?, [Laughter.], How would you like that?, But suppose Kansas comes in as a slave State, and all the ""border ruffians"" have barbecues about it, and free-State men come trailing back to the dishonored North, like whipped dogs with their tails between their legs, it is--ain't it?--evident that this is no more the ""land of the free""; and if we let it go so, we won't dare to say ""home of the brave"" out loud., Can any man doubt that, even in spite of the people's will, slavery will triumph through violence, unless that will be made manifest and enforced?, Even Governor Reeder claimed at the outset that the contest in Kansas was to be fair, but he got his eyes open at last; and I believe that, as a result of this moral and physical violence, Kansas will soon apply for admission as a slave State., And yet we can't mistake that the people don't want it so, and that it is a land which is free both by natural and political law., No law, is free law!, Such is the understanding of all Christendom., In the Somerset case, decided nearly a century ago, the great Lord Mansfield held that slavery was of such a nature that it must take its rise in positive (as distinguished from natural) law; and that in no country or age could it be traced back to any other source., Will some one please tell me where is the positive law that establishes slavery in Kansas?, Aye, the bogus laws!, And, on the same principle, a gang of Missouri horse-thieves could come into Illinois and declare horse-stealing to be legal [Laughter], and it would be just as legal as slavery is in Kansas., But by express statute, in the land of Washington and Jefferson, we may soon be brought face to face with the discreditable fact of showing to the world by our acts that we prefer slavery to freedom--darkness to light!, It is, I believe, a principle in law that when one party to a contract violates it so grossly as to chiefly destroy the object for which it is made, the other party may rescind it., I will ask Browning if that ain't good law., Well, now if that be right, I go for rescinding the whole, entire Missouri Compromise and thus turning Missouri into a free State; and I should like to know the difference--should like for any one to point out the difference--between our making a free State of Missouri and their making a slave State of Kansas., There ain't one bit of difference, except that our way would be a great mercy to humanity., But I have never said, and the Whig party has never said, and those who oppose the Nebraska Bill do not as a body say, that they have any intention of interfering with slavery in the slave States., Our platform says just the contrary., We allow slavery to exist in the slave States, not because slavery is right or good, but from the necessities of our Union., We grant a fugitive slave law because it is so ""nominated in the bond""; because our fathers so stipulated--had to--and we are bound to carry out this agreement., But they did not agree to introduce slavery in regions where it did not previously exist., ...]"|3
26|"[It was by that policy that here in Illinois the early fathers fought the good fight and gained the victory., In 1824 the free men of our State, led by Governor Coles (who was a native of Maryland and President Madison's private secretary), determined that those beautiful groves should never re-echo the dirge of one who has no title to himself., By their resolute determination, the winds that sweep across our broad prairies shall never cool the parched brow, nor shall the unfettered streams that bring joy and gladness to our free soil water the tired feet, of a slave; but so long as those heavenly breezes and sparkling streams bless the land, or the groves and their fragrance or memory remain, the humanity to which they minister SHALL BE FOREVER FREE!, Palmer, Yates, Williams, Browning, and some more in this convention came from Kentucky to Illinois (instead of going to Missouri), not only to better their conditions, but also to get away from slavery., They have said so to me, and it is understood among us Kentuckians that we don't like it one bit., Now, can we, mindful of the blessings of liberty which the early men of Illinois left to us, refuse a like privilege to the free men who seek to plant Freedom's banner on our Western outposts?, Should we not stand by our neighbors who seek to better their conditions in Kansas and Nebraska?, Can we as Christian men, and strong and free ourselves, wield the sledge or hold the iron which is to manacle anew an already oppressed race?, ""Woe unto them,"" it is written, ""that decree unrighteous decrees and that write grievousness which they have prescribed."", Can we afford to sin any more deeply against human liberty?, One great trouble in the matter is, that slavery is an insidious and crafty power, and gains equally by open violence of the brutal as well as by sly management of the peaceful., Even after the Ordinance of 1787, the settlers in Indiana and Illinois (it was all one government then) tried to get Congress to allow slavery temporarily, and petitions to that end were sent from Kaskaskia, and General Harrison, the Governor, urged it from Vincennes, the capital., If that had succeeded, good-bye to liberty here., But John Randolph of Virginia made a vigorous report against it; and although they persevered so well as to get three favorable reports for it, yet the United States Senate, with the aid of some slave States, finally squelched if for good., And that is why this hall is to-day a temple for free men instead of a negro livery-stable., Once let slavery get planted in a locality, by ever so weak or doubtful a title, and in ever so small numbers, and it is like the Canada thistle or Bermuda grass--you can't root it out., You yourself may detest slavery; but your neighbor has five or six slaves, and he is an excellent neighbor, or your son has married his daughter, and they beg you to help save their property, and you vote against your interests and principle to accommodate a neighbor, hoping that your vote will be on the losing side., And others do the same; and in those ways slavery gets a sure foothold., And when that is done the whole mighty Union--the force of the nation--is committed to its support., And that very process is working in Kansas to-day., And you must recollect that the slave property is worth a billion of dollars; while free-State men must work for sentiment alone., Then there are ""blue lodges""--as they call them--everywhere doing their secret and deadly work., It is a very strange thing, and not solvable by any moral law that I know of, that if a man loses his horse, the whole country will turn out to help hang the thief; but if a man but a shade or two darker than I am is himself stolen, the same crowd will hang one who aids in restoring him to liberty., Such are the inconsistencies of slavery, where a horse is more sacred than a man; and the essence of squatter or popular sovereignty--I don't care how you call it--is that if one man chooses to make a slave of another, no third man shall be allowed to object., And if you can do this in free Kansas, and it is allowed to stand, the next thing you will see is shiploads of negroes from Africa at the wharf at Charleston, for one thing is as truly lawful as the other; and these are the bastard notions we have got to stamp out, else they will stamp us out., Two years ago, at Springfield, Judge Douglas avowed that Illinois came into the Union as a slave State, and that slavery was weeded out by the operation of his great, patent, everlasting principle of ""popular sovereignty."", Well, now, that argument must be answered, for it has a little grain of truth at the bottom., I do not mean that it is true in essence, as he would have us believe., It could not be essentially true if the Ordinance of '87 was valid., But, in point of fact, there were some degraded beings called slaves in Kaskaskia and the other French settlements when our first State constitution was adopted; that is a fact, and I don't deny it., Slaves were brought here as early as 1720, and were kept here in spite of the Ordinance of 1787 against it., But slavery did not thrive here., On the contrary, under the influence of the ordinance the number decreased fifty-one from 1810 to 1820; while under the influence of squatter sovereignty, right across the river in Missouri, they increased seven thousand two hundred and eleven in the same time; and slavery finally faded out in Illinois, under the influence of the law of freedom, while it grew stronger and stronger in Missouri, under the law or practice of ""popular sovereignty."", In point of fact there were but one hundred and seventeen slaves in Illinois one year after its admission, or one to every four hundred and seventy of its population; or, to state it in another way, if Illinois was a slave State in 1820, so were New York and New Jersey much greater slave States from having had greater numbers, slavery having been established there in very early times., But there is this vital difference between all these States and the Judge's Kansas experiment: that they sought to disestablish slavery which had been already established, while the Judge seeks, so far as he can, to disestablish freedom, which had been established there by the Missouri Compromise., The Union is under-going a fearful strain; but it is a stout old ship, and has weathered many a hard blow, and ""the stars in their courses,"" aye, an invisible Power, greater than the puny efforts of men, will fight for us., But we ourselves must not decline the burden of responsibility, nor take counsel of unworthy passions., Whatever duty urges us to do or to omit must be done or omitted; and the recklessness with which our adversaries break the laws, or counsel their violation, should afford no example for us., Therefore, let us revere the Declaration of Independence; let us continue to obey the Constitution and the laws; let us keep step to the music of the Union., Let us draw a cordon, so to speak, around the slave States, and the hateful institution, like a reptile poisoning itself, will perish by its own infamy., But we cannot be free men if this is, by our national choice, to be a land of slavery., Those who deny freedom to others deserve it not for themselves; and, under the rule of a just God, cannot long retain it., Did you ever, my friends, seriously reflect upon the speed with which we are tending downwards?, Within the memory of men now present the leading statesman of Virginia could make genuine, red-hot abolitionist speeches in old Virginia!, and, as I have said, now even in ""free Kansas"" it is a crime to declare that it is ""free Kansas."", The very sentiments that I and others have just uttered would entitle us, and each of us, to the ignominy and seclusion of a dungeon; and yet I suppose that, like Paul, we were ""free born."", But if this thing is allowed to continue, it will be but one step further to impress the same rule in Illinois., The conclusion of all is, that we must restore the Missouri Compromise., We must highly resolve that Kansas must be free!We must reinstate the birthday promise of the Republic; we must reaffirm the Declaration of Independence; we must make good in essence as well as in form Madison's avowal that ""the word slave ought not to appear in the Constitution""; and we must even go further, and decree that only local law, and not that time-honored instrument, shall shelter a slaveholder., We must make this a land of liberty in fact, as it is in name., But in seeking to attain these results--so indispensable if the liberty which is our pride and boast shall endure--we will be loyal to the Constitution and to the ""flag of our Union,"" and no matter what our grievance--even though Kansas shall come in as a slave State; and no matter what theirs--even if we shall restore the compromise--WE WILL SAY TO THE SOUTHERN DISUNIONISTS, WE WON'T GO OUT OF THE UNION, AND YOU SHAN'T!, But let us, meanwhile, appeal to the sense and patriotism of the people, and not to their prejudices; let us spread the floods of enthusiasm here aroused all over these vast prairies, so suggestive of freedom., Let us commence by electing the gallant soldier Governor (Colonel) Bissell who stood for the honor of our State alike on the plains and amidst the chaparral of Mexico and on the floor of Congress, while he defied the Southern Hotspur; and that will have a greater moral effect than all the border ruffians can accomplish in all their raids on Kansas., There is both a power and a magic in popular opinion., To that let us now appeal; and while, in all probability, no resort to force will be needed, our moderation and forbearance will stand US in good stead when, if ever, WE MUST MAKE AN APPEAL TO BATTLE AND TO THE GOD OF HOSTS!, One can realize with this ability to move people's minds that the Southern Conspiracy were right to hate this man., He, better than any at the time was able to uncover their stratagems and tear down their sophisms and contradictions., I now expect to go to Chicago on the 15th, and I probably shall remain there or thereabouts for about two weeks., It turned me blind when I first heard Swett was beaten and Lovejoy nominated; but, after much reflection, I really believe it is best to let it stand., This, of course, I wish to be confidential., Lamon did get your deeds., I went with him to the office, got them, and put them in his hands myself., Your's of the 29th of June was duly received., I did not answer it because it plagued me., This morning I received another from Judd and Peck, written by consultation with you., Now let me tell you why I am plagued:  1., I can hardly spare the time., 2., I am superstitious., I have scarcely known a party preceding an election to call in help from the neighboring States but they lost the State., Last fall, our friends had Wade, of Ohio, and others, in Maine; and they lost the State., Last spring our adversaries had New Hampshire full of South Carolinians, and they lost the State., And so, generally, it seems to stir up more enemies than friends., Have the enemy called in any foreign help?, If they have a foreign champion there I should have no objection to drive a nail in his track., I shall reach Chicago on the night of the 15th, to attend to a little business in court., Consider the things I have suggested, and write me at Chicago., Especially write me whether Browning consents to visit you., You further charge us with being disunionists., If you mean that it is our aim to dissolve the Union, I for myself answer that it is untrue; for those who act with me I answer that it is untrue., Have you heard us assert that as our aim?, Do you really believe that such is our aim?, Do you find it in our platform, our speeches, our conventions, or anywhere?, If not, withdraw the charge., But you may say that, though it is not our aim, it will be the result if we succeed, and that we are therefore disunionists in fact., This is a grave charge you make against us, and we certainly have a right to demand that you specify in what way we are to dissolve the Union., How are we to effect this?, The only specification offered is volunteered by Mr. Fillmore in his Albany speech., His charge is that if we elect a President and Vice-President both from the free States, it will dissolve the Union., This is open folly., The Constitution provides that the President and Vice-President of the United States shall be of different States, but says nothing as to the latitude and longitude of those States., In 1828 Andrew Jackson, of Tennessee, and John C. Calhoun, of South Carolina, were elected President and Vice-President, both from slave States; but no one thought of dissolving the Union then on that account., In 1840 Harrison, of Ohio, and Tyler, of Virginia, were elected., In 1841 Harrison died and John Tyler succeeded to the Presidency, and William R. King, of Alabama, was elected acting Vice-President by the Senate; but no one supposed that the Union was in danger., In fact, at the very time Mr. Fillmore uttered this idle charge, the state of things in the United States disproved it., Mr. Pierce, of New Hampshire, and Mr., Bright, of Indiana, both from free States, are President and Vice-President, and the Union stands and will stand., You do not pretend that it ought to dissolve the Union, and the facts show that it won't; therefore the charge may be dismissed without further consideration., No other specification is made, and the only one that could be made is that the restoration of the restriction of 1820, making the United States territory free territory, would dissolve the Union., Gentlemen, it will require a decided majority to pass such an act., ...]"|3
27|"[Less than a year ago the Richmond Enquirer, an avowed advocate of slavery, regardless of color, in order to favor his views, invented the phrase ""State equality,"" and now the President, in his message, adopts the Enquirer's catch-phrase, telling us the people ""have asserted the constitutional equality of each and all of the States of the Union as States."", The President flatters himself that the new central idea is completely inaugurated; and so indeed it is, so far as the mere fact of a Presidential election can inaugurate it., To us it is left to know that the majority of the people have not yet declared for it, and to hope that they never will., All of us who did not vote for Mr. Buchanan, taken together, are a majority of four hundred thousand., But in the late contest we were divided between Fremont and Fillmore., Can we not come together for the future?, Let every one who really believes and is resolved that free society is not and shall not be a failure, and who can conscientiously declare that in the last contest he has done only what he thought best--let every such one have charity to believe that every other one can say as much., Thus let bygones be bygones; let past differences as nothing be; and with steady eye on the real issue let us reinaugurate the good old ""central idea"" of the republic., We can do it., The human heart is with us; God is with us., We shall again be able, not to declare that ""all States as States are equal,"" nor yet that ""all citizens as citizens are equal,"" but to renew the broader, better declaration, including both these and much more, that ""all men are created equal."", When I was at Chicago two weeks ago I saw Mr. Arnold, and from a remark of his I inferred he was thinking of the speakership, though I think he was not anxious about it., He seemed most anxious for harmony generally, and particularly that the contested seats from Peoria and McDonough might be rightly determined., Since I came home I had a talk with Cullom, one of our American representatives here, and he says he is for you for Speaker and also that he thinks all the Americans will be for you, unless it be Gorin, of Macon, of whom he cannot speak., If you would like to be Speaker go right up and see Arnold., He is talented, a practised debater, and, I think, would do himself more credit on the floor than in the Speaker's seat., Go and see him; and if you think fit, show him this letter., Your note about the little paragraph in the Republican was received yesterday, since which time I have been too unwell to notice it., I had not supposed you wrote or approved it., The whole originated in mistake., You know by the conversation with me that I thought the establishment of the paper unfortunate, but I always expected to throw no obstacle in its way, and to patronize it to the extent of taking and paying for one copy., When the paper was brought to my house, my wife said to me, ""Now are you going to take another worthless little paper?"", I said to her evasively, ""I have not directed the paper to be left."", From this, in my absence, she sent the message to the carrier., This is the whole story., I am here to-night partly by the invitation of some of you, and partly by my own inclination., Two weeks ago Judge Douglas spoke here on the several subjects of Kansas, the Dred Scott decision, and Utah., I listened to the speech at the time, and have the report of it since., It was intended to controvert opinions which I think just, and to assail (politically, not personally) those men who, in common with me, entertain those opinions., For this reason I wished then, and still wish, to make some answer to it, which I now take the opportunity of doing., I begin with Utah., If it prove to be true, as is probable, that the people of Utah are in open rebellion to the United States, then Judge Douglas is in favor of repealing their territorial organization, and attaching them to the adjoining States for judicial purposes., I say, too, if they are in rebellion, they ought to be somehow coerced to obedience; and I am not now prepared to admit or deny that the Judge's mode of coercing them is not as good as any., The Republicans can fall in with it without taking back anything they have ever said., To be sure, it would be a considerable backing down by Judge Douglas from his much-vaunted doctrine of self-government for the Territories; but this is only additional proof of what was very plain from the beginning, that that doctrine was a mere deceitful pretense for the benefit of slavery., Those who could not see that much in the Nebraska act itself, which forced governors, and secretaries, and judges on the people of the Territories without their choice or consent, could not be made to see, though one should rise from the dead., But in all this it is very plain the Judge evades the only question the Republicans have ever pressed upon the Democracy in regard to Utah., That question the Judge well knew to be this: ""If the people of Utah peacefully form a State constitution tolerating polygamy, will the Democracy admit them into the Union?"", There is nothing in the United States Constitution or law against polygamy; and why is it not a part of the Judge's ""sacred right of self-government"" for the people to have it, or rather to keep it, if they choose?, These questions, so far as I know, the Judge never answers., It might involve the Democracy to answer them either way, and they go unanswered., As to Kansas., The substance of the Judge's speech on Kansas is an effort to put the free-State men in the wrong for not voting at the election of delegates to the constitutional convention., He says:  ""There is every reason to hope and believe that the law will be fairly interpreted and impartially executed, so as to insure to every bona fide inhabitant the free and quiet exercise of the elective franchise."", It appears extraordinary that Judge Douglas should make such a statement., He knows that, by the law, no one can vote who has not been registered; and he knows that the free-State men place their refusal to vote on the ground that but few of them have been registered., It is possible that this is not true, but Judge Douglas knows it is asserted to be true in letters, newspapers, and public speeches, and borne by every mail and blown by every breeze to the eyes and ears of the world., He knows it is boldly declared that the people of many whole counties, and many whole neighborhoods in others, are left unregistered; yet he does not venture to contradict the declaration, or to point out how they can vote without being registered; but he just slips along, not seeming to know there is any such question of fact, and complacently declares:   ""There is every reason to hope and believe that the law will be fairly and impartially executed, so as to insure to every bona fide inhabitant the free and quiet exercise of the elective franchise."", I readily agree that if all had a chance to vote they ought to have voted., If, on the contrary, as they allege, and Judge Douglas ventures not to particularly contradict, few only of the free-State men had a chance to vote, they were perfectly right in staying from the polls in a body., By the way, since the Judge spoke, the Kansas election has come off., The Judge expressed his confidence that all the Democrats in Kansas would do their duty-including ""free-State Democrats,"" of course., The returns received here as yet are very incomplete; but so far as they go, they indicate that only about one sixth of the registered voters have really voted; and this, too, when not more, perhaps, than one half of the rightful voters have been registered, thus showing the thing to have been altogether the most exquisite farce ever enacted., I am watching with considerable interest to ascertain what figure ""the free-State Democrats"" cut in the concern., Of course they voted,--all Democrats do their duty,--and of course they did not vote for slave-State candidates., We soon shall know how many delegates they elected, how many candidates they had pledged to a free State, and how many votes were cast for them., Allow me to barely whisper my suspicion that there were no such things in Kansas as ""free-State Democrats""--that they were altogether mythical, good only to figure in newspapers and speeches in the free States., If there should prove to be one real living free-State Democrat in Kansas, I suggest that it might be well to catch him, and stuff and preserve his skin as an interesting specimen of that soon-to-be extinct variety of the genus Democrat., And now as to the Dred Scott decision., That decision declares two propositions--first, that a negro cannot sue in the United States courts; and secondly, that Congress cannot prohibit slavery in the Territories., It was made by a divided court dividing differently on the different points., Judge Douglas does not discuss the merits of the decision, and in that respect I shall follow his example, believing I could no more improve on McLean and Curtis than he could on Taney., He denounces all who question the correctness of that decision, as offering violent resistance to it., But who resists it?, Who has, in spite of the decision, declared Dred Scott free, and resisted the authority of his master over him?, Judicial decisions have two uses--first, to absolutely determine the case decided, and secondly, to indicate to the public how other similar cases will be decided when they arise., For the latter use, they are called ""precedents"" and ""authorities."", We believe as much as Judge Douglas (perhaps more) in obedience to, and respect for, the judicial department of government., We think its decisions on constitutional questions, when fully settled, should control not only the particular cases decided, but the general policy of the country, subject to be disturbed only by amendments of the Constitution as provided in that instrument itself., More than this would be revolution., But we think the Dred Scott decision is erroneous., We know the court that made it has often overruled its own decisions, and we shall do what we can to have it to overrule this., We offer no resistance to it., Judicial decisions are of greater or less authority as precedents according to circumstances., That this should be so accords both with common sense and the customary understanding of the legal profession., If this important decision had been made by the unanimous concurrence of the judges, and without any apparent partisan bias, and in accordance with legal public expectation and with the steady practice of the departments throughout our history, and had been in no part based on assumed historical facts which are not really true; or, if wanting in some of these, it had been before the court more than once, and had there been affirmed and reaffirmed through a course of years, it then might be, perhaps would be, factious, nay, even revolutionary, not to acquiesce in it as a precedent., But when, as is true, we find it wanting in all these claims to the public confidence, it is not resistance, it is not factious, it is not even disrespectful, to treat it as not having yet quite established a settled doctrine for the country., But Judge Douglas considers this view awful., Hear him:  ""The courts are the tribunals prescribed by the Constitution and created by the authority of the people to determine, expound, and enforce the law., Hence, whoever resists the final decision of the highest judicial tribunal aims a deadly blow at our whole republican system of government--a blow which, if successful, would place all our rights and liberties at the mercy of passion, anarchy, and violence., I repeat, therefore, that if resistance to the decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States, in a matter like the points decided in the Dred Scott case, clearly within their jurisdiction as defined by the Constitution, shall be forced upon the country as a political issue, it will become a distinct and naked issue between the friends and enemies of the Constitution--the friends and the enemies of the supremacy of the laws."", Why, this same Supreme Court once decided a national bank to be constitutional; but General Jackson, as President of the United States, disregarded the decision, and vetoed a bill for a recharter, partly on constitutional ground, declaring that each public functionary must support the Constitution ""as he understands it."", But hear the General's own words., Here they are, taken from his veto message:  I drop the quotations merely to remark that all there ever was in the way of precedent up to the Dred Scott decision, on the points therein decided, had been against that decision., But hear General Jackson further:  Again and again have I heard Judge Douglas denounce that bank decision and applaud General Jackson for disregarding it., It would be interesting for him to look over his recent speech, and see how exactly his fierce philippics against us for resisting Supreme Court decisions fall upon his own head., It will call to mind a long and fierce political war in this country, upon an issue which, in his own language, and, of course, in his own changeless estimation, ""was a distinct issue between the friends and the enemies of the Constitution,"" and in which war he fought in the ranks of the enemies of the Constitution., I have said, in substance, that the Dred Scott decision was in part based on assumed historical facts which were not really true, and I ought not to leave the subject without giving some reasons for saying this; I therefore give an instance or two, which I think fully sustain me., Chief Justice Taney, in delivering the opinion of the majority of the court, insists at great length that negroes were no part of the people who made, or for whom was made, the Declaration of Independence, or the Constitution of the United States., On the contrary, Judge Curtis, in his dissenting opinion, shows that in five of the then thirteen States--to wit, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, and North Carolina--free negroes were voters, and in proportion to their numbers had the same part in making the Constitution that the white people had., He shows this with so much particularity as to leave no doubt of its truth; and as a sort of conclusion on that point, holds the following language:  Again, Chief Justice Taney says:  And again, after quoting from the Declaration, he says:  In these the Chief Justice does not directly assert, but plainly assumes as a fact, that the public estimate of the black man is more favorable now than it was in the days of the Revolution., This assumption is a mistake., In some trifling particulars the condition of that race has been ameliorated; but as a whole, in this country, the change between then and now is decidedly the other way, and their ultimate destiny has never appeared so hopeless as in the last three or four years., In two of the five States--New Jersey and North Carolina--that then gave the free negro the right of voting, the right has since been taken away, and in a third--New York--it has been greatly abridged; while it has not been extended, so far as I know, to a single additional State, though the number of the States has more than doubled., In those days, as I understand, masters could, at their own pleasure, emancipate their slaves; but since then such legal restraints have been made upon emancipation as to amount almost to prohibition., In those days Legislatures held the unquestioned power to abolish slavery in their respective States, but now it is becoming quite fashionable for State constitutions to withhold that power from the Legislatures., In those days, by common consent, the spread of the black man's bondage to the new countries was prohibited, but now Congress decides that it will not continue the prohibition, and the Supreme Court decides that it could not if it would., In those days our Declaration of Independence was held sacred by all, and thought to include all; but now, to aid in making the bondage of the negro universal and eternal, it is assailed and sneered at and construed and hawked at and torn, till, if its framers could rise from their graves, they could not at all recognize it., All the powers of earth seem rapidly combining against him., Mammon is after him, ambition follows, philosophy follows, and the theology of the day fast joining the cry., ...]"|3
28|"[I have said that the separation of the races is the only perfect preventive of amalgamation., I have no right to say all the members of the Republican party are in favor of this, nor to say that as a party they are in favor of it., There is nothing in their platform directly on the subject., But I can say a very large proportion of its members are for it, and that the chief plank in their platform--opposition to the spread of slavery--is most favorable to that separation., Such separation, if ever effected at all, must be effected by colonization; and no political party, as such, is now doing anything directly for colonization., Party operations at present only favor or retard colonization incidentally., The enterprise is a difficult one; but ""where there is a will there is a way,"" and what colonization needs most is a hearty will., Will springs from the two elements of moral sense and self-interest., Let us be brought to believe it is morally right, and at the same time favorable to, or at least not against, our interest to transfer the African to his native clime, and we shall find a way to do it, however great the task may be., The children of Israel, to such numbers as to include four hundred thousand fighting men, went out of Egyptian bondage in a body., How differently the respective courses of the Democratic and Republican parties incidentally, bear on the question of forming a will--a public sentiment--for colonization, is easy to see., The Republicans inculcate, with whatever of ability they can, that the negro is a man, that his bondage is cruelly wrong, and that the field of his oppression ought not to be enlarged., The Democrats deny his manhood; deny, or dwarf to insignificance, the wrong of his bondage; so far as possible crush all sympathy for him, and cultivate and excite hatred and disgust against him; compliment themselves as Union-savers for doing so; and call the indefinite outspreading of his bondage ""a sacred right of self-government."", The plainest print cannot be read through a gold eagle; and it will be ever hard to find many men who will send a slave to Liberia, and pay his passage, while they can send him to a new country--Kansas, for instance--and sell him for fifteen hundred dollars, and the rise., Yours of the 14th is received, and I am much obliged for the legal information you give., You can scarcely be more anxious than I that the next election in Iowa should result in favor of the Republicans., I lost nearly all the working part of last year, giving my time to the canvass; and I am altogether too poor to lose two years together., I am engaged in a suit in the United States Court at Chicago, in which the Rock Island Bridge Company is a party., The trial is to commence on the 8th of September, and probably will last two or three weeks., During the trial it is not improbable that all hands may come over and take a look at the bridge, and, if it were possible to make it hit right, I could then speak at Davenport., My courts go right on without cessation till late in November., Write me again, pointing out the more striking points of difference between your old and new constitutions, and also whether Democratic and Republican party lines were drawn in the adoption of it, and which were for and which were against it., If, by possibility, I could get over among you it might be of some advantage to know these things in advance., Mr. A. Lincoln addressed the jury., He said he did not purpose to assail anybody, that he expected to grow earnest as he proceeded but not ill-natured., ""There is some conflict of testimony in the case,"" he said, ""but one quarter of such a number of witnesses seldom agree, and even if all were on one side some discrepancy might be expected., We are to try and reconcile them, and to believe that they are not intentionally erroneous as long as we can."", He had no prejudice, he said, against steamboats or steamboat men nor any against St. Louis, for he supposed they went about this matter as other people would do in their situation., ""St. Louis,"" he continued, ""as a commercial place may desire that this bridge should not stand, as it is adverse to her commerce, diverting a portion of it from the river; and it may be that she supposes that the additional cost of railroad transportation upon the productions of Iowa will force them to go to St. Louis if this bridge is removed., The meetings in St. Louis are connected with this case only as some witnesses are in it, and thus has some prejudice added color to their testimony."", The last thing that would be pleasing to him, Mr. Lincoln said, would be to have one of these great channels, extending almost from where it never freezes to where it never thaws, blocked up, but there is a travel from east to west whose demands are not less important than those of the river., It is growing larger and larger, building up new countries with a rapidity never before seen in the history of the world., He alluded to the astonishing growth of Illinois, having grown within his memory to a population of a million and a half; to Iowa and the other young rising communities of the Northwest., ""This current of travel,"" said he, ""has its rights as well as that of north and south., If the river had not the advantage in priority and legislation we could enter into free competition with it and we could surpass it., This particular railroad line has a great importance and the statement of its business during a little less than a year shows this importance., It is in evidence that from September 8, 1856, to August 8, 1857, 12,586 freight cars and 74,179 passengers passed over this bridge., Navigation was closed four days short of four months last year, and during this time while the river was of no use this road and bridge were valuable., There is, too, a considerable portion of time when floating or thin ice makes the river useless while the bridge is as useful as ever., This shows that this bridge must be treated with respect in this court and is not to be kicked about with contempt., The other day Judge Wead alluded to the strike of the contending interest and even a dissolution of the Union., The proper mode for all parties in this affair is to 'live and let live,' and then we will find a cessation of this trouble about the bridge., What mood were the steamboat men in when this bridge was burned?, Why, there was a shouting and ringing of bells and whistling on all the boats as it fell., It was a jubilee, a greater celebration than follows an excited election., The first thing I will proceed to is the record of Mr. Gurney and the complaint of Judge Wead that the record did not extend back over all the time from the completion of the bridge., The principal part of the navigation after the bridge was burned passed through the span., When the bridge was repaired and the boats were a second time confined to the draw it was provided that this record should be kept., That is the simple history of that book., ""From April 19th, 1856, to May 6th--seventeen days--there were twenty accidents and all the time since then there have been but twenty hits, including seven accidents, so that the dangers of this place are tapering off and as the boatmen get cool the accidents get less., We may soon expect if this ratio is kept up that there will be no accidents at all., ""Judge Wead said, while admitting that the floats went straight through, there was a difference between a float and a boat, but I do not remember that he indulged us with an argument in support of this statement., Is it because there is a difference in size?, Will not a small body and a large one float the same way under the same influence?, True a flatboat will float faster than an egg shell and the egg shell might be blown away by the wind, but if under the same influence they would go the same way., Logs, floats, boards, various things the witnesses say all show the same current., Then is not this test reliable?, At all depths too the direction of the current is the same., A series of these floats would make a line as long as a boat and would show any influence upon any part and all parts of the boat., ""I will now speak of the angular position of the piers., What is the amount of the angle?, The course of the river is a curve and the pier is straight., If a line is produced from the upper end of the long pier straight with the pier to a distance of 350 feet, and a line is drawn from a point in the channel opposite this point to the head of the pier, Colonel Nason says they will form an angle of twenty degrees., But the angle if measured at the pier is seven degrees; that is, we would have to move the pier seven degrees to make it exactly straight with the current., Would that make the navigation better or worse?, The witnesses of the plaintiff seem to think it was only necessary to say that the pier formed an angle with the current and that settled the matter., Our more careful and accurate witnesses say that, though they had been accustomed to seeing the piers placed straight with the current, yet they could see that here the current had been made straight by us in having made this slight angle; that the water now runs just right, that it is straight and cannot be improved., They think that if the pier was changed the eddy would be divided and the navigation improved., ""I am not now going to discuss the question what is a material obstruction., We do not greatly differ about the law., The cases produced here are, I suppose, proper to be taken into consideration by the court in instructing a jury., Some of them I think are not exactly in point, but I am still willing to trust his honor, Judge McLean, and take his instructions as law., What is reasonable skill and care?, This is a thing of which the jury are to judge., I differ from the other side when it says that they are bound to exercise no more care than was taken before the building of the bridge., If we are allowed by the Legislature to build the bridge which will require them to do more than before, when a pilot comes along, it is unreasonable for him to dash on heedless of this structure which has been legally put there., The Afton came there on the 5th and lay at Rock Island until next morning., When a boat lies up the pilot has a holiday, and would not any of these jurors have then gone around to the bridge and gotten acquainted with the place?, Pilot Parker has shown here that he does not understand the draw., I heard him say that the fall from the head to the foot of the pier was four feet; he needs information., He could have gone there that day and seen there was no such fall., He should have discarded passion and the chances are that he would have had no disaster at all., He was bound to make himself acquainted with the place., ""McCammon says that the current and the swell coming from the long pier drove her against the long pier., In other words drove her toward the very pier from which the current came!, It is an absurdity, an impossibility., The only recollection I can find for this contradiction is in a current which White says strikes out from the long pier and then like a ram's horn turns back, and this might have acted somehow in this manner., ""It is agreed by all that the plaintiff's boat was destroyed and that it was destroyed upon the head of the short pier; that she moved from the channel where she was with her bow above the head of the long pier, till she struck the short one, swung around under the bridge and there was crowded and destroyed., ""I shall try to prove that the average velocity of the current through the draw with the boat in it should be five and a half miles an hour; that it is slowest at the head of the pier and swiftest at the foot of the pier., Their lowest estimate in evidence is six miles an hour, their highest twelve miles., This was the testimony of men who had made no experiment, only conjecture., We have adopted the most exact means., The water runs swiftest in high water and we have taken the point of nine feet above low water., The water when the Afton was lost was seven feet above low water, or at least a foot lower than our time., Brayton and his assistants timed the instruments, the best instruments known in measuring currents., They timed them under various circumstances and they found the current five miles an hour and no more., They found that the water at the upper end ran slower than five miles; that below it was swifter than five miles, but that the average was five miles., Shall men who have taken no care, who conjecture, some of whom speak of twenty miles an hour, be believed against those who have had such a favorable and well improved opportunity?, They should not even qualify the result., Several men have given their opinion as to the distance of the steamboat Carson, and I suppose if one should go and measure that distance you would believe him in preference to all of them., ...]"|3
29|"[Douglas says they cannot pay more, and I believe him., I do not write this as a lawyer seeking an advantage for a client; but only as a friend, only urging you to do what I think I would do if I were in your situation., I mean this as private and confidential only, but I feel a good deal of anxiety about it., This morning Col. McClernand showed me a petition for a mandamus against the Secretary of State to compel him to certify the apportionment act of last session; and he says it will be presented to the court to-morrow morning., We shall be allowed three or four days to get up a return, and I, for one, want the benefit of consultation with you., Please come right up., Yesterday morning the court overruled the demurrer to Hatches return in the mandamus case., McClernand was present; said nothing about pleading over; and so I suppose the matter is ended., The court gave no reason for the decision; but Peck tells me confidentially that they were unanimous in the opinion that even if the Gov'r had signed the bill purposely, he had the right to scratch his name off so long as the bill remained in his custody and control., Coming home from Bloomington last night I found your letter of the 15th., I know of no express statute or decisions as to what a J. P. upon the expiration of his term shall do with his docket books, papers, unfinished business, etc., but so far as I know, the practice has been to hand over to the successor, and to cease to do anything further whatever, in perfect analogy to Sections 110 and 112, and I have supposed and do suppose this is the law., I think the successor may forthwith do whatever the retiring J. P. might have done., As to the proviso to Section 114 I think it was put in to cover possible cases, by way of caution, and not to authorize the J. P. to go forward and finish up whatever might have been begun by him., The view I take, I believe, is the Common law principle, as to retiring officers and their successors, to which I remember but one exception, which is the case of Sheriff and ministerial officers of that class., I have not had time to examine this subject fully, but I have great confidence I am right., You must not think of offering me pay for this., Mr. John O. Johnson is my friend; I gave your name to him., He is doing the work of trying to get up a Republican organization., I do not suppose ""Long John"" ever saw or heard of him., Let me say to you confidentially, that I do not entirely appreciate what the Republican papers of Chicago are so constantly saying against ""Long John."", I consider those papers truly devoted to the Republican cause, and not unfriendly to me; but I do think that more of what they say against ""Long John"" is dictated by personal malice than themselves are conscious of., We can not afford to lose the services of ""Long John"" and I do believe the unrelenting warfare made upon him is injuring our cause., I mean this to be confidential., If you quietly co-operate with Mr. J. O. Johnson on getting up an organization, I think it will be right., Mr. G. A. Sutton is an applicant for superintendent of the addition of the Insane Asylum, and I understand it partly depends on you whether he gets it., Sutton is my fellow-townsman and friend, and I therefore wish to say for him that he is a man of sterling integrity and as a master mechanic and builder not surpassed by any in our city, or any I have known anywhere, as far as I can judge., I hope you will consider me as being really interested for Mr. Sutton and not as writing merely to relieve myself of importunity., Please show this to Col. William Ross and let him consider it as much intended for him as for yourself., Yours of the 9th written at Joliet is just received., Two or three days ago I learned that McLean had appointed delegates in favor of Lovejoy, and thenceforward I have considered his renomination a fixed fact., My opinion--if my opinion is of any consequence in this case, in which it is no business of mine to interfere--remains unchanged, that running an independent candidate against Lovejoy will not do; that it will result in nothing but disaster all round., In the first place, whosoever so runs will be beaten and will be spotted for life; in the second place, while the race is in progress, he will be under the strongest temptation to trade with the Democrats, and to favor the election of certain of their friends to the Legislature; thirdly, I shall be held responsible for it, and Republican members of the Legislature who are partial to Lovejoy will for that purpose oppose us; and lastly, it will in the end lose us the district altogether., There is no safe way but a convention; and if in that convention, upon a common platform which all are willing to stand upon, one who has been known as an abolitionist, but who is now occupying none but common ground, can get the majority of the votes to which all look for an election, there is no safe way but to submit., As to the inclination of some Republicans to favor Douglas, that is one of the chances I have to run, and which I intend to run with patience., I write in the court room., Court has opened, and I must close., If we could first know where we are, and whither we are tending, we could better judge what to do, and how to do it., We are now far into the fifth year since a policy was initiated with the avowed object and confident promise of putting an end to slavery agitation., Under the operation of that policy, that agitation has not only not ceased, but has constantly augmented., In my opinion, it will not cease until a crisis shall have been reached and passed., ""A house divided against itself cannot stand."", I believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free., I do not expect the Union to be dissolved; I do not expect the house to fall; but I do expect it will cease to be divided., It will become all one thing, or all the other., Either the opponents of slavery will arrest the further spread of it, and place it where the public mind shall rest in the belief that it is in the course of ultimate extinction, or its advocates will push it forward till it shall become alike lawful in all the States, old as well as new, North as well as South., Have we no tendency to the latter condition?, Let any one who doubts, carefully contemplate that now almost complete legal combination-piece of machinery, so to speak compounded of the Nebraska doctrine and the Dred Scott decision., Let him consider, not only what work the machinery is adapted to do, and how well adapted, but also let him study the history of its construction, and trace, if he can, or rather fail, if he can, to trace the evidences of design, and concert of action, among its chief architects, from the beginning., The new year of 1854 found slavery excluded from more than half the States by State Constitutions, and from most of the National territory by Congressional prohibition., Four days later, commenced the struggle which ended in repealing that Congressional prohibition., This opened all the National territory to slavery, and was the first point gained., But, so far, Congress only had acted, and an indorsement by the people, real or apparent, was indispensable to save the point already gained, and give chance for more., This necessity had not been overlooked, but had been provided for, as well as might be, in the notable argument of ""squatter sovereignty,"" otherwise called ""sacred right of self-government,"" which latter phrase, though expressive of the only rightful basis of any government, was so perverted in this attempted use of it as to amount to just this: That if any one man choose to enslave another, no third man shall be allowed to object., That argument was incorporated into the Nebraska Bill itself, in the language which follows:  ""It being the true intent and meaning of this Act not to legislate slavery into any Territory or State, nor to exclude it therefrom, but to leave the people thereof perfectly free to form and regulate their domestic institutions in their own way, subject only to the Constitution of the United States."", Then opened the roar of loose declamation in favor of ""squatter sovereignty,"" and ""sacred right of self-government."", ""But,"" said opposition members, ""let us amend the bill so as to expressly declare that the people of the Territory may exclude slavery."", ""Not we,"" said the friends of the measure, and down they voted the amendment., While the Nebraska Bill was passing through Congress, a law case, involving the question of a negro's freedom, by reason of his owner having voluntarily taken him first into a free State, and then into a territory covered by the Congressional Prohibition, and held him as a slave for a long time in each, was passing through the United States Circuit Court for the District of Missouri; and both Nebraska Bill and lawsuit were brought to a decision in the same month of May, 1854., The negro's name was ""Dred Scott,"" which name now designates the decision finally made in the case., Before the then next Presidential election, the law case came to, and was argued in, the Supreme Court of the United States; but the decision of it was deferred until after the election., Still, before the election, Senator Trumbull, on the floor of the Senate, requested the leading advocate of the Nebraska Bill to state his opinion whether the people of a territory can constitutionally exclude slavery from their limits; and the latter answers: ""That is a question for the Supreme Court."", The election came., Mr. Buchanan was elected, and the indorsement, such as it was, secured., That was the second point gained., The indorsement, however, fell short of a clear popular majority by nearly four hundred thousand votes,(approximately 10% of the vote) and so, perhaps, was not overwhelmingly reliable and satisfactory., The outgoing President, in his last annual message, as impressively as possible echoed back upon the people the weight and authority of the indorsement., The Supreme Court met again, did not announce their decision, but ordered a reargument., The Presidential inauguration came, and still no decision of the court; but the incoming President, in his inaugural address, fervently exhorted the people to abide by the forth-coming decision, whatever it might be., Then, in a few days, came the decision., The reputed author of the Nebraska Bill finds an early occasion to make a speech at this capital indorsing the Dred Scott decision, and vehemently denouncing all opposition to it., The new President, too, seizes the early occasion of the Silliman letter to indorse and strongly construe that decision, and to express his astonishment that any different view had ever been entertained!, At length a squabble springs up between the President and the author of the Nebraska Bill, on the mere question of fact, whether the Lecompton Constitution was or was not in any just sense made by the people of Kansas; and in that quarrel the latter declares that all he wants is a fair vote for the people, and that he cares not whether slavery be voted down or voted up., I do not understand his declaration, that he cares not whether slavery be voted down or voted up, to be intended by him other than as an apt definition of the policy he would impress upon the public mind,--the principle for which he declares he has suffered so much, and is ready to suffer to the end., And well may he cling to that principle!, If he has any parental feeling, well may he cling to it., That principle is the only shred left of his original Nebraska doctrine., Under the Dred Scott decision ""squatter sovereignty"" squatted out of existence, tumbled down like temporary scaffolding; like the mould at the foundry, served through one blast, and fell back into loose sand; helped to carry an election, and then was kicked to the winds., His late joint struggle with the Republicans, against the Lecompton Constitution, involves nothing of the original Nebraska doctrine., That struggle was made on a point--the right of a people to make their own constitution--upon which he and the Republicans have never differed., The several points of the Dred Scott decision, in connection with Senator Douglas's ""care not"" policy, constitute the piece of machinery, in its present state of advancement., This was the third point gained., The working points of that machinery are:  Firstly, That no negro slave, imported as such from Africa, and no descendant of such slave, can ever be a citizen of any State, in the sense of that term as used in the Constitution of the United States., This point is made in order to deprive the negro, in every possible event, of the benefit of that provision of the United States Constitution which declares that ""The citizens of each State shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in the several States."", Secondly, That, ""subject to the Constitution of the United States,"" neither Congress nor a Territorial Legislature can exclude slavery from any United States Territory., This point is made in order that individual men may fill up the Territories with slaves, without danger of losing them as property, and thus to enhance the chances of permanency to the institution through all the future., Thirdly, That whether the holding a negro in actual slavery in a free State makes him free, as against the holder, the United States courts will not decide, but will leave to be decided by the courts of any slave State the negro may be forced into by the master., This point is made, not to be pressed immediately; but, if acquiesced in for a while, and apparently indorsed by the people at an election, then to sustain the logical conclusion that what Dred Scott's master might lawfully do with Dred Scott, in the free State of Illinois, every other master may lawfully do with any other one, or one thousand slaves, in Illinois, or in any other free State., Auxiliary to all this, and working hand in hand with it, the Nebraska doctrine, or what is left of it, is to educate and mould public opinion, at least Northern public opinion, not to care whether slavery is voted down or voted up., This shows exactly where we now are; and partially, also, wither we are tending., It will throw additional light on the latter, to go back and run the mind over the string of historical facts already stated., Several things will now appear less dark and mysterious than they did when they were transpiring., The people were to be left ""perfectly free,"" ""subject only to the Constitution."", What the Constitution had to do with it, outsiders could not then see., Plainly enough now,--it was an exactly fitted niche, for the Dred Scott decision to afterward come in, and declare the perfect freedom of the people to be just no freedom at all., Why was the amendment, expressly declaring the right of the people, voted down?, Plainly enough now,--the adoption of it would have spoiled the niche for the Dred Scott decision., Why was the court decision held up?, Why even a Senator's individual opinion withheld, till after the Presidential election?, Plainly enough now,--the speaking out then would have damaged the ""perfectly free"" argument upon which the election was to be carried., Why the outgoing President's felicitation on the indorsement?, ...]"|3
30|"[He said that a friend of our Senator Douglas had been talking to him, and had, among other things, said to him:  ""...why, you don't want to beat Douglas?"", ""Yes,"" said he, ""I do want to beat him, and I will tell you why., I believe his original Nebraska Bill was right in the abstract, but it was wrong in the time that it was brought forward., It was wrong in the application to a Territory in regard to which the question had been settled; it was brought forward at a time when nobody asked him; it was tendered to the South when the South had not asked for it, but when they could not well refuse it; and for this same reason he forced that question upon our party., It has sunk the best men all over the nation, everywhere; and now, when our President, struggling with the difficulties of this man's getting up, has reached the very hardest point to turn in the case, he deserts him and I am for putting him where he will trouble us no more."", Now, gentlemen, that is not my argument; that is not my argument at all., I have only been stating to you the argument of a Buchanan man., You will judge if there is any force in it., Popular sovereignty!, Everlasting popular sovereignty!, Let us for a moment inquire into this vast matter of popular sovereignty., What is popular sovereignty?, We recollect that at an early period in the history of this struggle there was another name for the same thing,--""squatter sovereignty."", It was not exactly popular sovereignty, but squatter sovereignty., What do those terms mean?, What do those terms mean when used now?, And vast credit is taken by our friend the Judge in regard to his support of it, when he declares the last years of his life have been, and all the future years of his life shall be, devoted to this matter of popular sovereignty., What is it?, Why, it is the sovereignty of the people!, What was squatter sovereignty?, I suppose, if it had any significance at all, it was the right of the people to govern themselves, to be sovereign in their own affairs while they were squatted down in a country not their own, while they had squatted on a Territory that did not belong to them, in the sense that a State belongs to the people who inhabit it, when it belonged to the nation; such right to govern themselves was called ""squatter sovereignty."", Now, I wish you to mark: What has become of that squatter sovereignty?, what has become of it?, Can you get anybody to tell you now that the people of a Territory have any authority to govern themselves, in regard to this mooted question of slavery, before they form a State constitution?, No such thing at all; although there is a general running fire, and although there has been a hurrah made in every speech on that side, assuming that policy had given the people of a Territory the right to govern themselves upon this question, yet the point is dodged., To-day it has been decided--no more than a year ago it was decided--by the Supreme Court of the United States, and is insisted upon to-day that the people of a Territory have no right to exclude slavery from a Territory; that if any one man chooses to take slaves into a Territory, all the rest of the people have no right to keep them out., This being so, and this decision being made one of the points that the Judge approved, and one in the approval of which he says he means to keep me down,--put me down I should not say, for I have never been up,--he says he is in favor of it, and sticks to it, and expects to win his battle on that decision, which says that there is no such thing as squatter sovereignty, but that any one man may take slaves into a Territory, and all the other men in the Territory may be opposed to it, and yet by reason of the Constitution they cannot prohibit it., When that is so, how much is left of this vast matter of squatter sovereignty, I should like to know?, When we get back, we get to the point of the right of the people to make a constitution., Kansas was settled, for example, in 1854., It was a Territory yet, without having formed a constitution, in a very regular way, for three years., All this time negro slavery could be taken in by any few individuals, and by that decision of the Supreme Court, which the Judge approves, all the rest of the people cannot keep it out; but when they come to make a constitution, they may say they will not have slavery., But it is there; they are obliged to tolerate it some way, and all experience shows it will be so, for they will not take the negro slaves and absolutely deprive the owners of them., All experience shows this to be so., All that space of time that runs from the beginning of the settlement of the Territory until there is sufficiency of people to make a State constitution,--all that portion of time popular sovereignty is given up., The seal is absolutely put down upon it by the court decision, and Judge Douglas puts his own upon the top of that; yet he is appealing to the people to give him vast credit for his devotion to popular sovereignty., Again, when we get to the question of the right of the people to form a State constitution as they please, to form it with slavery or without slavery, if that is anything new, I confess I don't know it., Has there ever been a time when anybody said that any other than the people of a Territory itself should form a constitution?, What is now in it that Judge Douglas should have fought several years of his life, and pledge himself to fight all the remaining years of his life for?, Can Judge Douglas find anybody on earth that said that anybody else should form a constitution for a people?, [A voice, ""Yes.""], Well, I should like you to name him; I should like to know who he was., [Same voice, ""John Calhoun.""], No, sir, I never heard of even John Calhoun saying such a thing., He insisted on the same principle as Judge Douglas; but his mode of applying it, in fact, was wrong., It is enough for my purpose to ask this crowd whenever a Republican said anything against it., They never said anything against it, but they have constantly spoken for it; and whoever will undertake to examine the platform, and the speeches of responsible men of the party, and of irresponsible men, too, if you please, will be unable to find one word from anybody in the Republican ranks opposed to that popular sovereignty which Judge Douglas thinks that he has invented., I suppose that Judge Douglas will claim, in a little while, that he is the inventor of the idea that the people should govern themselves; that nobody ever thought of such a thing until he brought it forward., We do not remember that in that old Declaration of Independence it is said that:  ""We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness; that to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed."", There is the origin of popular sovereignty., Who, then, shall come in at this day and claim that he invented it?, The Lecompton Constitution connects itself with this question, for it is in this matter of the Lecompton Constitution that our friend Judge Douglas claims such vast credit., I agree that in opposing the Lecompton Constitution, so far as I can perceive, he was right., I do not deny that at all; and, gentlemen, you will readily see why I could not deny it, even if I wanted to., But I do not wish to; for all the Republicans in the nation opposed it, and they would have opposed it just as much without Judge Douglas's aid as with it., They had all taken ground against it long before he did., Why, the reason that he urges against that constitution I urged against him a year before., I have the printed speech in my hand., The argument that he makes, why that constitution should not be adopted, that the people were not fairly represented nor allowed to vote, I pointed out in a speech a year ago, which I hold in my hand now, that no fair chance was to be given to the people., [""Read it, Read it.""], I shall not waste your time by trying to read it., [""Read it, Read it.""], Gentlemen, reading from speeches is a very tedious business, particularly for an old man that has to put on spectacles, and more so if the man be so tall that he has to bend over to the light., A little more, now, as to this matter of popular sovereignty and the Lecompton Constitution., The Lecompton Constitution, as the Judge tells us, was defeated., The defeat of it was a good thing or it was not., He thinks the defeat of it was a good thing, and so do I, and we agree in that., Who defeated it?, Yes, he furnished himself, and if you suppose he controlled the other Democrats that went with him, he furnished three votes; while the Republicans furnished twenty., That is what he did to defeat it., In the House of Representatives he and his friends furnished some twenty votes, and the Republicans furnished ninety odd., Now, who was it that did the work?, Why, yes, Douglas did it!, To be sure he did., Let us, however, put that proposition another way., The Republicans could not have done it without Judge Douglas., Could he have done it without them?, Which could have come the nearest to doing it without the other?, Ground was taken against it by the Republicans long before Douglas did it., The proportion of opposition to that measure is about five to one., You don't know what you are talking about, my friend., I am quite willing to answer any gentleman in the crowd who asks an intelligent question., Now, who in all this country has ever found any of our friends of Judge Douglas's way of thinking, and who have acted upon this main question, that has ever thought of uttering a word in behalf of Judge Trumbull?, I defy you to show a printed resolution passed in a Democratic meeting--I take it upon myself to defy any man to show a printed resolution of a Democratic meeting, large or small--in favor of Judge Trumbull, or any of the five to one Republicans who beat that bill., Everything must be for the Democrats!, They did everything, and the five to the one that really did the thing they snub over, and they do not seem to remember that they have an existence upon the face of the earth., Gentlemen, I fear that I shall become tedious., I leave this branch of the subject to take hold of another., I take up that part of Judge Douglas's speech in which he respectfully attended to me., Judge Douglas made two points upon my recent speech at Springfield., He says they are to be the issues of this campaign., The first one of these points he bases upon the language in a speech which I delivered at Springfield, which I believe I can quote correctly from memory., I said there that ""we are now far into the fifth year since a policy was instituted for the avowed object, and with the confident promise, of putting an end to slavery agitation; under the operation of that policy, that agitation has not only not ceased, but has constantly augmented."", ""I believe it will not cease until a crisis shall have been reached and passed., 'A house divided against itself cannot stand.', I believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free."", ""I do not expect the Union to be dissolved,""--I am quoting from my speech, ""--I do not expect the house to fall, but I do expect it will cease to be divided., It will become all one thing or all the other., Either the opponents of slavery will arrest the spread of it and place it where the public mind shall rest in the belief that it is in the course of ultimate extinction, or its advocates will push it forward until it shall become alike lawful in all the States, north as well as south."", What is the paragraph?, ...]"|3
31|"[That is, they say that when a question comes up upon another person, it will be so decided again, unless the court decides in another way, unless the court overrules its decision., Well, we mean to do what we can to have the court decide the other way., That is one thing we mean to try to do., The sacredness that Judge Douglas throws around this decision is a degree of sacredness that has never been before thrown around any other decision., I have never heard of such a thing., Why, decisions apparently contrary to that decision, or that good lawyers thought were contrary to that decision, have been made by that very court before., It is the first of its kind; it is an astonisher in legal history., It is a new wonder of the world., It is based upon falsehood in the main as to the facts; allegations of facts upon which it stands are not facts at all in many instances, and no decision made on any question--the first instance of a decision made under so many unfavorable circumstances--thus placed, has ever been held by the profession as law, and it has always needed confirmation before the lawyers regarded it as settled law., But Judge Douglas will have it that all hands must take this extraordinary decision, made under these extraordinary circumstances, and give their vote in Congress in accordance with it, yield to it, and obey it in every possible sense., Circumstances alter cases., Do not gentlemen here remember the case of that same Supreme Court some twenty-five or thirty years ago deciding that a National Bank was constitutional?, I ask, if somebody does not remember that a National Bank was declared to be constitutional?, Such is the truth, whether it be remembered or not., The Bank charter ran out, and a recharter was granted by Congress., That recharter was laid before General Jackson., It was urged upon him, when he denied the constitutionality of the Bank, that the Supreme Court had decided that it was constitutional; and General Jackson then said that the Supreme Court had no right to lay down a rule to govern a coordinate branch of the government, the members of which had sworn to support the Constitution; that each member had sworn to support that Constitution as he understood it., I will venture here to say that I have heard Judge Douglas say that he approved of General Jackson for that act., What has now become of all his tirade about ""resistance of the Supreme Court""?, My fellow-citizens, getting back a little,--for I pass from these points,--when Judge Douglas makes his threat of annihilation upon the ""alliance,"" he is cautious to say that that warfare of his is to fall upon the leaders of the Republican party., Almost every word he utters, and every distinction he makes, has its significance., He means for the Republicans who do not count themselves as leaders, to be his friends; he makes no fuss over them; it is the leaders that he is making war upon., He wants it understood that the mass of the Republican party are really his friends., It is only the leaders that are doing something that are intolerant, and that require extermination at his hands., As this is dearly and unquestionably the light in which he presents that matter, I want to ask your attention, addressing myself to the Republicans here, that I may ask you some questions as to where you, as the Republican party, would be placed if you sustained Judge Douglas in his present position by a re-election?, I do not claim, gentlemen, to be unselfish; I do not pretend that I would not like to go to the United States Senate,--I make no such hypocritical pretense; but I do say to you that in this mighty issue it is nothing to you--nothing to the mass of the people of the nation,--whether or not Judge Douglas or myself shall ever be heard of after this night; it may be a trifle to either of us, but in connection with this mighty question, upon which hang the destinies of the nation, perhaps, it is absolutely nothing: but where will you be placed if you reindorse Judge Douglas?, Don't you know how apt he is, how exceedingly anxious he is at all times, to seize upon anything and everything to persuade you that something he has done you did yourselves?, Why, he tried to persuade you last night that our Illinois Legislature instructed him to introduce the Nebraska Bill., There was nobody in that Legislature ever thought of such a thing; and when he first introduced the bill, he never thought of it; but still he fights furiously for the proposition, and that he did it because there was a standing instruction to our Senators to be always introducing Nebraska bills., He tells you he is for the Cincinnati platform, he tells you he is for the Dred Scott decision., He tells you, not in his speech last night, but substantially in a former speech, that he cares not if slavery is voted up or down; he tells you the struggle on Lecompton is past; it may come up again or not, and if it does, he stands where he stood when, in spite of him and his opposition, you built up the Republican party., If you indorse him, you tell him you do not care whether slavery be voted up or down, and he will close or try to close your mouths with his declaration, repeated by the day, the week, the month, and the year., Is that what you mean?, [Cries of ""No,"" one voice ""Yes.""], Yes, I have no doubt you who have always been for him, if you mean that., No doubt of that, soberly I have said, and I repeat it., I think, in the position in which Judge Douglas stood in opposing the Lecompton Constitution, he was right; he does not know that it will return, but if it does we may know where to find him, and if it does not, we may know where to look for him, and that is on the Cincinnati platform., Now, I could ask the Republican party, after all the hard names that Judge Douglas has called them by all his repeated charges of their inclination to marry with and hug negroes; all his declarations of Black Republicanism,--by the way, we are improving, the black has got rubbed off,--but with all that, if he be indorsed by Republican votes, where do you stand?, Plainly, you stand ready saddled, bridled, and harnessed, and waiting to be driven over to the slavery extension camp of the nation,--just ready to be driven over, tied together in a lot, to be driven over, every man with a rope around his neck, that halter being held by Judge Douglas., That is the question., If Republican men have been in earnest in what they have done, I think they had better not do it; but I think that the Republican party is made up of those who, as far as they can peaceably, will oppose the extension of slavery, and who will hope for its ultimate extinction., If they believe it is wrong in grasping up the new lands of the continent and keeping them from the settlement of free white laborers, who want the land to bring up their families upon; if they are in earnest, although they may make a mistake, they will grow restless, and the time will come when they will come back again and reorganize, if not by the same name, at least upon the same principles as their party now has., It is better, then, to save the work while it is begun., You have done the labor; maintain it, keep it., If men choose to serve you, go with them; but as you have made up your organization upon principle, stand by it; for, as surely as God reigns over you, and has inspired your mind, and given you a sense of propriety, and continues to give you hope, so surely will you still cling to these ideas, and you will at last come back again after your wanderings, merely to do your work over again., We were often,--more than once, at least,--in the course of Judge Douglas's speech last night, reminded that this government was made for white men; that he believed it was made for white men., Well, that is putting it into a shape in which no one wants to deny it; but the Judge then goes into his passion for drawing inferences that are not warranted., I protest, now and forever, against that counterfeit logic which presumes that because I did not want a negro woman for a slave, I do necessarily want her for a wife., My understanding is that I need not have her for either, but, as God made us separate, we can leave one another alone, and do one another much good thereby., There are white men enough to marry all the white women, and enough black men to marry all the black women; and in God's name let them be so married., The Judge regales us with the terrible enormities that take place by the mixture of races; that the inferior race bears the superior down., Why, Judge, if we do not let them get together in the Territories, they won't mix there., I should say at least that that is a self-evident truth., Now, it happens that we meet together once every year, sometimes about the 4th of July, for some reason or other., These 4th of July gatherings I suppose have their uses., If you will indulge me, I will state what I suppose to be some of them., We are now a mighty nation; we are thirty or about thirty millions of people, and we own and inhabit about one fifteenth part of the dry land of the whole earth., We run our memory back over the pages of history for about eighty-two years, and we discover that we were then a very small people in point of numbers, vastly inferior to what we are now, with a vastly less extent of country, with vastly less of everything we deem desirable among men; we look upon the change as exceedingly advantageous to us and to our posterity, and we fix upon something that happened away back, as in some way or other being connected with this rise of prosperity., We find a race of men living in that day whom we claim as our fathers and grandfathers; they were iron men; they fought for the principle that they were contending for; and we understood that by what they then did it has followed that the degree of prosperity which we now enjoy has come to us., We hold this annual celebration to remind ourselves of all the good done in this process of time, of how it was done and who did it, and how we are historically connected with it; and we go from these meetings in better humor with ourselves, we feel more attached the one to the other, and more firmly bound to the country we inhabit., In every way we are better men in the age and race and country in which we live, for these celebrations., But after we have done all this we have not yet reached the whole., There is something else connected with it., We have--besides these, men descended by blood from our ancestors--among us perhaps half our people who are not descendants at all of these men; they are men who have come from Europe, German, Irish, French, and Scandinavian,--men that have come from Europe themselves, or whose ancestors have come hither and settled here, finding themselves our equals in all things., If they look back through this history to trace their connection with those days by blood, they find they have none, they cannot carry themselves back into that glorious epoch and make themselves feel that they are part of us; but when they look through that old Declaration of Independence, they find that those old men say that ""We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal""; and then they feel that that moral sentiment, taught in that day, evidences their relation to those men, that it is the father of all moral principle in them, and that they have a right to claim it as though they were blood of the blood, and flesh of the flesh, of the men who wrote that Declaration; and so they are., That is the electric cord in that Declaration that links the hearts of patriotic and liberty-loving men together, that will link those patriotic hearts as long as the love of freedom exists in the minds of men throughout the world., Now, sirs, for the purpose of squaring things with this idea of ""don't care if slavery is voted up or voted down,"" for sustaining the Dred Scott decision, for holding that the Declaration of Independence did not mean anything at all, we have Judge Douglas giving his exposition of what the Declaration of Independence means, and we have him saying that the people of America are equal to the people of England., According to his construction, you Germans are not connected with it., Now, I ask you in all soberness if all these things, if indulged in, if ratified, if confirmed and indorsed, if taught to our children, and repeated to them, do not tend to rub out the sentiment of liberty in the country, and to transform this government into a government of some other form., Those arguments that are made, that the inferior race are to be treated with as much allowance as they are capable of enjoying; that as much is to be done for them as their condition will allow,--what are these arguments?, They are the arguments that kings have made for enslaving the people in all ages of the world., You will find that all the arguments in favor of kingcraft were of this class; they always bestrode the necks of the people not that they wanted to do it, but because the people were better off for being ridden., That is their argument, and this argument of the Judge is the same old serpent that says, You work, and I eat; you toil, and I will enjoy the fruits of it., Turn in whatever way you will, whether it come from the mouth of a king, an excuse for enslaving the people of his country, or from the mouth of men of one race as a reason for enslaving the men of another race, it is all the same old serpent; and I hold, if that course of argumentation that is made for the purpose of convincing the public mind that we should not care about this should be granted, it does not stop with the negro., I should like to know, if taking this old Declaration of Independence, which declares that all men are equal upon principle, and making exceptions to it, where will it stop?, If one man says it does not mean a negro, why not another say it does not mean some other man?, If that Declaration is not the truth, let us get the statute book, in which we find it, and tear it out!, Who is so bold as to do it?, If it is not true, let us tear it out!, [Cries of ""No, no.""], Let us stick to it, then; let us stand firmly by it, then., It may be argued that there are certain conditions that make necessities and impose them upon us; and to the extent that a necessity is imposed upon a man, he must submit to it., I think that was the condition in which we found ourselves when we established this government., We had slavery among us, we could not get our Constitution unless we permitted them to remain in slavery, we could not secure the good we did secure if we grasped for more; and having by necessity submitted to that much, it does not destroy the principle that is the charter of our liberties., Let that charter stand as our standard., My friend has said to me that I am a poor hand to quote Scripture., I will try it again, however., It is said in one of the admonitions of our Lord, ""As your Father in heaven is perfect, be ye also perfect."", The Savior, I suppose, did not expect that any human creature could be perfect as the Father in heaven; but he said, ""As your Father in heaven is perfect, be ye also perfect."", He set that up as a standard; and he who did most towards reaching that standard attained the highest degree of moral perfection., So I say in relation to the principle that all men are created equal, let it be as nearly reached as we can., If we cannot give freedom to every creature, let us do nothing that will impose slavery upon any other creature., Let us then turn this government back into the channel in which the framers of the Constitution originally placed it., Let us stand firmly by each other., If we do not do so, we are turning in the contrary direction, that our friend Judge Douglas proposes--not intentionally--as working in the traces tends to make this one universal slave nation., He is one that runs in that direction, and as such I resist him., My friends, I have detained you about as long as I desired to do, and I have only to say: Let us discard all this quibbling about this man and the other man, this race and that race and the other race being inferior, and therefore they must be placed in an inferior position; discarding our standard that we have left us., Let us discard all these things, and unite as one people throughout this land, until we shall once more stand up declaring that all men are created equal., My friends, I could not, without launching off upon some new topic, which would detain you too long, continue to-night., I thank you for this most extensive audience that you have furnished me to-night., ...]"|3
32|"[They have insisted that whatever of small irregularities existed in getting up the Lecompton Constitution were such as happen in the settlement of all new Territories., The question was, Was it a fair emanation of the people?, It was a question of fact, and not of principle., As to the principle, all were agreed., Judge Douglas voted with the Republicans upon that matter of fact., He and they, by their voices and votes, denied that it was a fair emanation of the people., The Administration affirmed that it was., With respect to the evidence bearing upon that question of fact, I readily agree that Judge Douglas and the Republicans had the right on their side, and that the Administration was wrong., But I state again that, as a matter of principle, there is no dispute upon the right of a people in a Territory, merging into a State, to form a constitution for themselves without outside interference from any quarter., This being so, what is Judge Douglas going to spend his life for?, Is he going to spend his life in maintaining a principle that nobody on earth opposes?, Does he expect to stand up in majestic dignity, and go through his apotheosis and become a god in the maintaining of a principle which neither man nor mouse in all God's creation is opposing?, Now something in regard to the Lecompton Constitution more specially; for I pass from this other question of popular sovereignty as the most arrant humbug that has ever been attempted on an intelligent community., As to the Lecompton Constitution, I have already said that on the question of fact, as to whether it was a fair emanation of the people or not, Judge Douglas, with the Republicans and some Americans, had greatly the argument against the Administration; and while I repeat this, I wish to know what there is in the opposition of Judge Douglas to the Lecompton Constitution that entitles him to be considered the only opponent to it,--as being par excellence the very quintessence of that opposition., I agree to the rightfulness of his opposition., He in the Senate and his class of men there formed the number three and no more., In the House of Representatives his class of men--the Anti-Lecompton Democrats--formed a number of about twenty., It took one hundred and twenty to defeat the measure, against one hundred and twelve., Of the votes of that one hundred and twenty, Judge Douglas's friends furnished twenty, to add to which there were six Americans and ninety-four Republicans., I do not say that I am precisely accurate in their numbers, but I am sufficiently so for any use I am making of it., Why is it that twenty shall be entitled to all the credit of doing that work, and the hundred none of it?, Why, if, as Judge Douglas says, the honor is to be divided and due credit is to be given to other parties, why is just so much given as is consonant with the wishes, the interests, and advancement of the twenty?, My understanding is, when a common job is done, or a common enterprise prosecuted, if I put in five dollars to your one, I have a right to take out five dollars to your one., But he does not so understand it., He declares the dividend of credit for defeating Lecompton upon a basis which seems unprecedented and incomprehensible., Let us see., Lecompton in the raw was defeated., It afterward took a sort of cooked-up shape, and was passed in the English bill., It is said by the Judge that the defeat was a good and proper thing., If it was a good thing, why is he entitled to more credit than others for the performance of that good act, unless there was something in the antecedents of the Republicans that might induce every one to expect them to join in that good work, and at the same time something leading them to doubt that he would?, Does he place his superior claim to credit on the ground that he performed a good act which was never expected of him?, He says I have a proneness for quoting Scripture., If I should do so now, it occurs that perhaps he places himself somewhat upon the ground of the parable of the lost sheep which went astray upon the mountains, and when the owner of the hundred sheep found the one that was lost, and threw it upon his shoulders and came home rejoicing, it was said that there was more rejoicing over the one sheep that was lost and had been found than over the ninety and nine in the fold., The application is made by the Saviour in this parable, thus: ""Verily, I say unto you, there is more rejoicing in heaven over one sinner that repenteth, than over ninety and nine just persons that need no repentance."", And now, if the Judge claims the benefit of this parable, let him repent., Let him not come up here and say: ""I am the only just person; and you are the ninety-nine sinners!"", Repentance before forgiveness is a provision of the Christian system, and on that condition alone will the Republicans grant his forgiveness., How will he prove that we have ever occupied a different position in regard to the Lecompton Constitution or any principle in it?, He says he did not make his opposition on the ground as to whether it was a free or slave constitution, and he would have you understand that the Republicans made their opposition because it ultimately became a slave constitution., To make proof in favor of himself on this point, he reminds us that he opposed Lecompton before the vote was taken declaring whether the State was to be free or slave., But he forgets to say that our Republican Senator, Trumbull, made a speech against Lecompton even before he did., Why did he oppose it?, Partly, as he declares, because the members of the convention who framed it were not fairly elected by the people; that the people were not allowed to vote unless they had been registered; and that the people of whole counties, some instances, were not registered., For these reasons he declares the Constitution was not an emanation, in any true sense, from the people., He also has an additional objection as to the mode of submitting the Constitution back to the people., But bearing on the question of whether the delegates were fairly elected, a speech of his, made something more than twelve months ago, from this stand, becomes important., It was made a little while before the election of the delegates who made Lecompton., In that speech he declared there was every reason to hope and believe the election would be fair; and if any one failed to vote, it would be his own culpable fault., I, a few days after, made a sort of answer to that speech., In that answer I made, substantially, the very argument with which he combated his Lecompton adversaries in the Senate last winter., I pointed to the facts that the people could not vote without being registered, and that the time for registering had gone by., I commented on it as wonderful that Judge Douglas could be ignorant of these facts which every one else in the nation so well knew., I now pass from popular sovereignty and Lecompton., I may have occasion to refer to one or both., When he was preparing his plan of campaign, Napoleon-like, in New York, as appears by two speeches I have heard him deliver since his arrival in Illinois, he gave special attention to a speech of mine, delivered here on the 16th of June last., He says that he carefully read that speech., He told us that at Chicago a week ago last night and he repeated it at Bloomington last night., Doubtless, he repeated it again to-day, though I did not hear him., In the first two places--Chicago and Bloomington I heard him; to-day I did not., He said he had carefully examined that speech,--when, he did not say; but there is no reasonable doubt it was when he was in New York preparing his plan of campaign., I am glad he did read it carefully., He says it was evidently prepared with great care., I freely admit it was prepared with care., I claim not to be more free from errors than others,--perhaps scarcely so much; but I was very careful not to put anything in that speech as a matter of fact, or make any inferences, which did not appear to me to be true and fully warrantable., If I had made any mistake, I was willing to be corrected; if I had drawn any inference in regard to Judge Douglas or any one else which was not warranted, I was fully prepared to modify it as soon as discovered., I planted myself upon the truth and the truth only, so far as I knew it, or could be brought to know it., Having made that speech with the most kindly feelings toward Judge Douglas, as manifested therein, I was gratified when I found that he had carefully examined it, and had detected no error of fact, nor any inference against him, nor any misrepresentations of which he thought fit to complain., In neither of the two speeches I have mentioned did he make any such complaint., I will thank any one who will inform me that he, in his speech to-day, pointed out anything I had stated respecting him as being erroneous., I presume there is no such thing., I have reason to be gratified that the care and caution used in that speech left it so that he, most of all others interested in discovering error, has not been able to point out one thing against him which he could say was wrong., He seizes upon the doctrines he supposes to be included in that speech, and declares that upon them will turn the issues of this campaign., He then quotes, or attempts to quote, from my speech., I will not say that he wilfully misquotes, but he does fail to quote accurately., His attempt at quoting is from a passage which I believe I can quote accurately from memory., I shall make the quotation now, with some comments upon it, as I have already said, in order that the Judge shall be left entirely without excuse for misrepresenting me., I do so now, as I hope, for the last time., I do this in great caution, in order that if he repeats his misrepresentation it shall be plain to all that he does so wilfully., If, after all, he still persists, I shall be compelled to reconstruct the course I have marked out for myself, and draw upon such humble resources, as I have, for a new course, better suited to the real exigencies of the case., I set out in this campaign with the intention of conducting it strictly as a gentleman, in substance at least, if not in the outside polish., The latter I shall never be; but that which constitutes the inside of a gentleman I hope I understand, and am not less inclined to practice than others., It was my purpose and expectation that this canvass would be conducted upon principle, and with fairness on both sides, and it shall not be my fault if this purpose and expectation shall be given up., He charges, in substance, that I invite a war of sections; that I propose all the local institutions of the different States shall become consolidated and uniform., What is there in the language of that speech which expresses such purpose or bears such construction?, I have again and again said that I would not enter into any of the States to disturb the institution of slavery., Judge Douglas said, at Bloomington, that I used language most able and ingenious for concealing what I really meant; and that while I had protested against entering into the slave States, I nevertheless did mean to go on the banks of the Ohio and throw missiles into Kentucky, to disturb them in their domestic institutions., I said in that speech, and I meant no more, that the institution of slavery ought to be placed in the very attitude where the framers of this government placed it and left it., I do not understand that the framers of our Constitution left the people of the free States in the attitude of firing bombs or shells into the slave States., I was not using that passage for the purpose for which he infers I did use it., I said:  ""We are now far advanced into the fifth year since a policy was created for the avowed object and with the confident promise of putting an end to slavery agitation., Under the operation of that policy that agitation has not only not ceased, but has constantly augmented., In my opinion it will not cease till a crisis shall have been reached and passed., 'A house divided against itself cannot stand.', I believe that this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free; it will become all one thing or all the other., Either the opponents of slavery will arrest the further spread of it, and place it where the public mind shall rest in the belief that it is in the course of ultimate extinction, or its advocates will push it forward till it shall become alike lawful in all the States, old as well as new, North as well as South."", Now, you all see, from that quotation, I did not express my wish on anything., In that passage I indicated no wish or purpose of my own; I simply expressed my expectation., Cannot the Judge perceive a distinction between a purpose and an expectation?, I have often expressed an expectation to die, but I have never expressed a wish to die., I said at Chicago, and now repeat, that I am quite aware this government has endured, half slave and half free, for eighty-two years., ...]"|3
33|"[It so happens, singularly enough, that I never stood opposed to a decision of the Supreme Court till this, on the contrary, I have no recollection that he was ever particularly in favor of one till this., He never was in favor of any nor opposed to any, till the present one, which helps to nationalize slavery., Free men of Sangamon, free men of Illinois, free men everywhere, judge ye between him and me upon this issue., He says this Dred Scott case is a very small matter at most,--that it has no practical effect; that at best, or rather, I suppose, at worst, it is but an abstraction., I submit that the proposition that the thing which determines whether a man is free or a slave is rather concrete than abstract., I think you would conclude that it was, if your liberty depended upon it, and so would Judge Douglas, if his liberty depended upon it., But suppose it was on the question of spreading slavery over the new Territories that he considers it as being merely an abstract matter, and one of no practical importance., How has the planting of slavery in new countries always been effected?, It has now been decided that slavery cannot be kept out of our new Territories by any legal means., In what do our new Territories now differ in this respect from the old Colonies when slavery was first planted within them?, It was planted, as Mr. Clay once declared, and as history proves true, by individual men, in spite of the wishes of the people; the Mother Government refusing to prohibit it, and withholding from the people of the Colonies the authority to prohibit it for themselves., Mr. Clay says this was one of the great and just causes of complaint against Great Britain by the Colonies, and the best apology we can now make for having the institution amongst us., In that precise condition our Nebraska politicians have at last succeeded in placing our own new Territories; the government will not prohibit slavery within them, nor allow the people to prohibit it., I defy any man to find any difference between the policy which originally planted slavery in these Colonies and that policy which now prevails in our new Territories., If it does not go into them, it is only because no individual wishes it to go., The Judge indulged himself doubtless to-day with the question as to what I am going to do with or about the Dred Scott decision., Well, Judge, will you please tell me what you did about the bank decision?, Will you not graciously allow us to do with the Dred Scott decision precisely as you did with the bank decision?, You succeeded in breaking down the moral effect of that decision: did you find it necessary to amend the Constitution, or to set up a court of negroes in order to do it?, There is one other point., Judge Douglas has a very affectionate leaning toward the Americans and Old Whigs., Last evening, in a sort of weeping tone, he described to us a death-bed scene., He had been called to the side of Mr. Clay, in his last moments, in order that the genius of ""popular sovereignty"" might duly descend from the dying man and settle upon him, the living and most worthy successor., He could do no less than promise that he would devote the remainder of his life to ""popular sovereignty""; and then the great statesman departs in peace., By this part of the ""plan of the campaign"" the Judge has evidently promised himself that tears shall be drawn down the cheeks of all Old Whigs, as large as half-grown apples., Mr. Webster, too, was mentioned; but it did not quite come to a death-bed scene as to him., It would be amusing, if it were not disgusting, to see how quick these compromise-breakers administer on the political effects of their dead adversaries, trumping up claims never before heard of, and dividing the assets among themselves., If I should be found dead to-morrow morning, nothing but my insignificance could prevent a speech being made on my authority, before the end of next week., It so happens that in that ""popular sovereignty"" with which Mr. Clay was identified, the Missouri Compromise was expressly reversed; and it was a little singular if Mr. Clay cast his mantle upon Judge Douglas on purpose to have that compromise repealed., Again, the Judge did not keep faith with Mr. Clay when he first brought in his Nebraska Bill., He left the Missouri Compromise unrepealed, and in his report accompanying the bill he told the world he did it on purpose., The manes of Mr. Clay must have been in great agony till thirty days later, when ""popular sovereignty"" stood forth in all its glory., One more thing., Last night Judge Douglas tormented himself with horrors about my disposition to make negroes perfectly equal with white men in social and political relations., He did not stop to show that I have said any such thing, or that it legitimately follows from anything I have said, but he rushes on with his assertions., I adhere to the Declaration of Independence., If Judge Douglas and his friends are not willing to stand by it, let them come up and amend it., Let them make it read that all men are created equal except negroes., Let us have it decided whether the Declaration of Independence, in this blessed year of 1858, shall be thus amended., In his construction of the Declaration last year, he said it only meant that Americans in America were equal to Englishmen in England., Then, when I pointed out to him that by that rule he excludes the Germans, the Irish, the Portuguese, and all the other people who have come among us since the revolution, he reconstructs his construction., In his last speech he tells us it meant Europeans., I press him a little further, and ask if it meant to include the Russians in Asia; or does he mean to exclude that vast population from the principles of our Declaration of Independence?, I expect ere long he will introduce another amendment to his definition., He is not at all particular., He is satisfied with anything which does not endanger the nationalizing of negro slavery., It may draw white men down, but it must not lift negroes up., Who shall say, ""I am the superior, and you are the inferior""?, My declarations upon this subject of negro slavery may be misrepresented, but cannot be misunderstood., I have said that I do not understand the Declaration to mean that all men were created equal in all respects., They are not our equal in color; but I suppose that it does mean to declare that all men are equal in some respects; they are equal in their right to ""life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."", Certainly the negro is not our equal in color, perhaps not in many other respects; still, in the right to put into his mouth the bread that his own hands have earned, he is the equal of every other man, white or black., In pointing out that more has been given you, you cannot be justified in taking away the little which has been given him., All I ask for the negro is that if you do not like him, let him alone., If God gave him but little, that little let him enjoy., When our government was established we had the institution of slavery among us., We were in a certain sense compelled to tolerate its existence., It was a sort of necessity., We had gone through our struggle and secured our own independence., The framers of the Constitution found the institution of slavery amongst their own institutions at the time., They found that by an effort to eradicate it they might lose much of what they had already gained., They were obliged to bow to the necessity., They gave power to Congress to abolish the slave trade at the end of twenty years., They also prohibited it in the Territories where it did not exist., They did what they could, and yielded to the necessity for the rest., I also yield to all which follows from that necessity., What I would most desire would be the separation of the white and black races., One more point on this Springfield speech which Judge Douglas says he has read so carefully., I expressed my belief in the existence of a conspiracy to perpetuate and nationalize slavery., I did not profess to know it, nor do I now., I showed the part Judge Douglas had played in the string of facts constituting to my mind the proof of that conspiracy., I showed the parts played by others., I charged that the people had been deceived into carrying the last Presidential election, by the impression that the people of the Territories might exclude slavery if they chose, when it was known in advance by the conspirators that the court was to decide that neither Congress nor the people could so exclude slavery., These charges are more distinctly made than anything else in the speech., Judge Douglas has carefully read and reread that speech., He has not, so far as I know, contradicted those charges., In the two speeches which I heard he certainly did not., On this own tacit admission, I renew that charge., I charge him with having been a party to that conspiracy and to that deception for the sole purpose of nationalizing slavery., Will it be agreeable to you to make an arrangement for you and myself to divide time, and address the same audiences the present canvass?, Mr. Judd, who will hand you this, is authorized to receive your answer; and, if agreeable to you, to enter into the terms of such arrangement., Yours of yesterday, naming places, times, and terms for joint discussions between us, was received this morning., Although, by the terms, as you propose, you take four openings and closes, to my three, I accede, and thus close the arrangement., I direct this to you at Hillsborough, and shall try to have both your letter and this appear in the Journal and Register of Monday morning., When a man hears himself somewhat misrepresented, it provokes him, at least, I find it so with myself; but when misrepresentation becomes very gross and palpable, it is more apt to amuse him., The first thing I see fit to notice is the fact that Judge Douglas alleges, after running through the history of the old Democratic and the old Whig parties, that Judge Trumbull and myself made an arrangement in 1854, by which I was to have the place of General Shields in the United States Senate, and Judge Trumbull was to have the place of Judge Douglas., Now, all I have to say upon that subject is that I think no man not even Judge Douglas can prove it, because it is not true., I have no doubt he is ""conscientious"" in saying it., As to those resolutions that he took such a length of time to read, as being the platform of the Republican party in 1854, I say I never had anything to do with them, and I think Trumbull never had., Judge Douglas cannot show that either of us ever did have anything to do with them., I believe this is true about those resolutions: There was a call for a convention to form a Republican party at Springfield, and I think that my friend Mr. Lovejoy, who is here upon this stand, had a hand in it., I think this is true, and I think if he will remember accurately he will be able to recollect that he tried to get me into it, and I would not go in., I believe it is also true that I went away from Springfield when the convention was in session, to attend court in Tazewell county., It is true they did place my name, though without authority, upon the committee, and afterward wrote me to attend the meeting of the committee; but I refused to do so, and I never had anything to do with that organization., This is the plain truth about all that matter of the resolutions., Now, about this story that Judge Douglas tells of Trumbull bargaining to sell out the old Democratic party, and Lincoln agreeing to sell out the old Whig party, I have the means of knowing about that: Judge Douglas cannot have; and I know there is no substance to it whatever., Yet I have no doubt he is ""conscientious"" about it., I know that after Mr. Lovejoy got into the Legislature that winter, he complained of me that I had told all the old Whigs of his district that the old Whig party was good enough for them, and some of them voted against him because I told them so., Now, I have no means of totally disproving such charges as this which the Judge makes., A man cannot prove a negative; but he has a right to claim that when a man makes an affirmative charge, he must offer some proof to show the truth of what he says., ...]"|3
34|"[I leave it to you to say whether, in the history of our government, this institution of slavery has not always failed to be a bond of union, and, on the contrary, been an apple of discord and an element of division in the house., I ask you to consider whether, so long as the moral constitution of men's minds shall continue to be the same, after this generation and assemblage shall sink into the grave, and another race shall arise, with the same moral and intellectual development we have, whether, if that institution is standing in the same irritating position in which it now is, it will not continue an element of division?, If so, then I have a right to say that, in regard to this question, the Union is a house divided against itself; and when the Judge reminds me that I have often said to him that the institution of slavery has existed for eighty years in some States, and yet it does not exist in some others, I agree to the fact, and I account for it by looking at the position in which our fathers originally placed it--restricting it from the new Territories where it had not gone, and legislating to cut off its source by the abrogation of the slave trade, thus putting the seal of legislation against its spread., The public mind did rest in the belief that it was in the course of ultimate extinction., But lately, I think--and in this I charge nothing on the Judge's motives--lately, I think that he, and those acting with him, have placed that institution on a new basis, which looks to the perpetuity and nationalization of slavery., And while it is placed upon this new basis, I say, and I have said, that I believe we shall not have peace upon the question until the opponents of slavery arrest the further spread of it, and place it where the public mind shall rest in the belief that it is in the course of ultimate extinction; or, on the other hand, that its advocates will push it forward until it shall become alike lawful in all the States, old as well as new, North as well as South., Now, I believe if we could arrest the spread, and place it where Washington and Jefferson and Madison placed it, it would be in the course of ultimate extinction, and the public mind would, as for eighty years past, believe that it was in the course of ultimate extinction., The crisis would be past, and the institution might be let alone for a hundred years, if it should live so long, in the States where it exists; yet it would be going out of existence in the way best for both the black and the white races., Well, then, let us talk about popular sovereignty!, what is popular sovereignty?, Is it the right of the people to have slavery or not have it, as they see fit, in the Territories?, I will state--and I have an able man to watch me--my understanding is that popular sovereignty, as now applied to the question of slavery, does allow the people of a Territory to have slavery if they want to, but does not allow them not to have it if they do not want it., I do not mean that if this vast concourse of people were in a Territory of the United States, any one of them would be obliged to have a slave if he did not want one; but I do say that, as I understand the Dred Scott decision, if any one man wants slaves, all the rest have no way of keeping that one man from holding them., When I made my speech at Springfield, of which the Judge complains, and from which he quotes, I really was not thinking of the things which he ascribes to me at all., I had no thought in the world that I was doing anything to bring about a war between the free and slave states., I had no thought in the world that I was doing anything to bring about a political and social equality of the black and white races., It never occurred to me that I was doing anything or favoring anything to reduce to a dead uniformity all the local institutions of the various States., But I must say, in all fairness to him, if he thinks I am doing something which leads to these bad results, it is none the better that I did not mean it., It is just as fatal to the country, if I have any influence in producing it, whether I intend it or not., But can it be true that placing this institution upon the original basis--the basis upon which our fathers placed it--can have any tendency to set the Northern and the Southern States at war with one another, or that it can have any tendency to make the people of Vermont raise sugar-cane, because they raise it in Louisiana, or that it can compel the people of Illinois to cut pine logs on the Grand Prairie, where they will not grow, because they cut pine logs in Maine, where they do grow?, The Judge says this is a new principle started in regard to this question., Does the Judge claim that he is working on the plan of the founders of government?, I think he says in some of his speeches indeed, I have one here now--that he saw evidence of a policy to allow slavery to be south of a certain line, while north of it it should be excluded, and he saw an indisposition on the part of the country to stand upon that policy, and therefore he set about studying the subject upon original principles, and upon original principles he got up the Nebraska Bill!, I am fighting it upon these ""original principles,"" fighting it in the Jeffersonian, Washingtonian, and Madisonian fashion., Now, my friends, I wish you to attend for a little while to one or two other things in that Springfield speech., My main object was to show, so far as my humble ability was capable of showing, to the people of this country what I believed was the truth,--that there was a tendency, if not a conspiracy, among those who have engineered this slavery question for the last four or five years, to make slavery perpetual and universal in this nation., Having made that speech principally for that object, after arranging the evidences that I thought tended to prove my proposition, I concluded with this bit of comment:  ""We cannot absolutely know that these exact adaptations are the result of preconcert; but when we see a lot of framed timbers, different portions of which we know have been gotten out at different times and places, and by different workmen--Stephen, Franklin, Roger, and James, for instance,--and when we see these timbers joined together, and see they exactly make the frame of a house or a mill, all the tenons and mortises exactly fitting, and all the lengths and proportions of the different pieces exactly adapted to their respective places, and not a piece too many or too few,--not omitting even the scaffolding,--or if a single piece be lacking, we see the place in the frame exactly fitted and prepared yet to bring such piece in,--in such a case we feel it impossible not to believe that Stephen and Franklin and Roger and James all understood one another from the beginning, and all worked upon a common plan or draft drawn before the first blow was struck."", When my friend Judge Douglas came to Chicago on the 9th of July, this speech having been delivered on the 16th of June, he made an harangue there, in which he took hold of this speech of mine, showing that he had carefully read it; and while he paid no attention to this matter at all, but complimented me as being a ""kind, amiable, and intelligent gentleman,"" notwithstanding I had said this, he goes on and eliminates, or draws out, from my speech this tendency of mine to set the States at war with one another, to make all the institutions uniform, and set the niggers and white people to marrying together., Then, as the Judge had complimented me with these pleasant titles (I must confess to my weakness), I was a little ""taken,"" for it came from a great man., I was not very much accustomed to flattery, and it came the sweeter to me., I was rather like the Hoosier, with the gingerbread, when he said he reckoned he loved it better than any other man, and got less of it., As the Judge had so flattered me, I could not make up my mind that he meant to deal unfairly with me; so I went to work to show him that he misunderstood the whole scope of my speech, and that I really never intended to set the people at war with one another., As an illustration, the next time I met him, which was at Springfield, I used this expression, that I claimed no right under the Constitution, nor had I any inclination, to enter into the slave States and interfere with the institutions of slavery., He says upon that: Lincoln will not enter into the slave States, but will go to the banks of the Ohio, on this side, and shoot over!, He runs on, step by step, in the horse-chestnut style of argument, until in the Springfield speech he says: ""Unless he shall be successful in firing his batteries until he shall have extinguished slavery in all the States the Union shall be dissolved."", Now, I don't think that was exactly the way to treat ""a kind, amiable, intelligent gentleman."", I know if I had asked the Judge to show when or where it was I had said that, if I didn't succeed in firing into the slave States until slavery should be extinguished, the Union should be dissolved, he could not have shown it., I understand what he would do., He would say: I don't mean to quote from you, but this was the result of what you say., But I have the right to ask, and I do ask now, Did you not put it in such a form that an ordinary reader or listener would take it as an expression from me?, In a speech at Springfield, on the night of the 17th, I thought I might as well attend to my own business a little, and I recalled his attention as well as I could to this charge of conspiracy to nationalize slavery., I called his attention to the fact that he had acknowledged in my hearing twice that he had carefully read the speech, and, in the language of the lawyers, as he had twice read the speech, and still had put in no plea or answer, I took a default on him., I insisted that I had a right then to renew that charge of conspiracy., Ten days afterward I met the Judge at Clinton,--that is to say, I was on the ground, but not in the discussion,--and heard him make a speech., Then he comes in with his plea to this charge, for the first time; and his plea when put in, as well as I can recollect it, amounted to this: that he never had any talk with Judge Taney or the President of the United States with regard to the Dred Scott decision before it was made., I (Lincoln) ought to know that the man who makes a charge without knowing it to be true falsifies as much as he who knowingly tells a falsehood; and, lastly, that he would pronounce the whole thing a falsehood; but, he would make no personal application of the charge of falsehood, not because of any regard for the ""kind, amiable, intelligent gentleman,"" but because of his own personal self-respect!, I have understood since then (but [turning to Judge Douglas] will not hold the Judge to it if he is not willing) that he has broken through the ""self-respect,"" and has got to saying the thing out., The Judge nods to me that it is so., It is fortunate for me that I can keep as good-humored as I do, when the Judge acknowledges that he has been trying to make a question of veracity with me., I know the Judge is a great man, while I am only a small man, but I feel that I have got him., I demur to that plea., I waive all objections that it was not filed till after default was taken, and demur to it upon the merits., What if Judge Douglas never did talk with Chief Justice Taney and the President before the Dred Scott decision was made, does it follow that he could not have had as perfect an understanding without talking as with it?, I am not disposed to stand upon my legal advantage., I am disposed to take his denial as being like an answer in chancery, that he neither had any knowledge, information, or belief in the existence of such a conspiracy., I am disposed to take his answer as being as broad as though he had put it in these words., And now, I ask, even if he had done so, have not I a right to prove it on him, and to offer the evidence of more than two witnesses, by whom to prove it; and if the evidence proves the existence of the conspiracy, does his broader answer denying all knowledge, information, or belief, disturb the fact?, It can only show that he was used by conspirators, and was not a leader of them., Now, in regard to his reminding me of the moral rule that persons who tell what they do not know to be true falsify as much as those who knowingly tell falsehoods., I remember the rule, and it must be borne in mind that in what I have read to you, I do not say that I know such a conspiracy to exist., To that I reply, I believe it., If the Judge says that I do not believe it, then he says what he does not know, and falls within his own rule, that he who asserts a thing which he does not know to be true, falsifies as much as he who knowingly tells a falsehood., I want to call your attention to a little discussion on that branch of the case, and the evidence which brought my mind to the conclusion which I expressed as my belief., If, in arraying that evidence I had stated anything which was false or erroneous, it needed but that Judge Douglas should point it out, and I would have taken it back, with all the kindness in the world., I do not deal in that way., If I have brought forward anything not a fact, if he will point it out, it will not even ruffle me to take it back., But if he will not point out anything erroneous in the evidence, is it not rather for him to show, by a comparison of the evidence, that I have reasoned falsely, than to call the ""kind, amiable, intelligent gentleman"" a liar?, If I have reasoned to a false conclusion, it is the vocation of an able debater to show by argument that I have wandered to an erroneous conclusion., I want to ask your attention to a portion of the Nebraska Bill, which Judge Douglas has quoted:  Thereupon Judge Douglas and others began to argue in favor of ""popular sovereignty,"" the right of the people to have slaves if they wanted them, and to exclude slavery if they did not want them., ""But,"" said, in substance, a Senator from Ohio (Mr. Chase, I believe), ""we more than suspect that you do not mean to allow the people to exclude slavery if they wish to; and if you do mean it, accept an amendment which I propose, expressly authorizing the people to exclude slavery."", I believe I have the amendment here before me, which was offered, and under which the people of the Territory, through their representatives, might, if they saw fit, prohibit the existence of slavery therein., And now I state it as a fact, to be taken back if there is any mistake about it, that Judge Douglas and those acting with him voted that amendment down., I now think that those men who voted it down had a real reason for doing so., They know what that reason was., It looks to us, since we have seen the Dred Scott decision pronounced, holding that ""under the Constitution"" the people cannot exclude slavery, I say it looks to outsiders, poor, simple, ""amiable, intelligent gentlemen,"" as though the niche was left as a place to put that Dred Scott decision in,--a niche which would have been spoiled by adopting the amendment., And now, I say again, if this was not the reason, it will avail the Judge much more to calmly and good-humoredly point out to these people what that other reason was for voting the amendment down, than, swelling himself up, to vociferate that he may be provoked to call somebody a liar., Again: There is in that same quotation from the Nebraska Bill this clause: ""It being the true intent and meaning of this bill not to legislate slavery into any Territory or State."", I have always been puzzled to know what business the word ""State"" had in that connection., Judge Douglas knows., He put it there., He knows what he put it there for., We outsiders cannot say what he put it there for., The law they were passing was not about States, and was not making provisions for States., What was it placed there for?, After seeing the Dred Scott decision, which holds that the people cannot exclude slavery from a Territory, if another Dred Scott decision shall come, holding that they cannot exclude it from a State, we shall discover that when the word was originally put there, it was in view of something which was to come in due time, we shall see that it was the other half of something., I now say again, if there is any different reason for putting it there, Judge Douglas, in a good-humored way, without calling anybody a liar, can tell what the reason was., When the Judge spoke at Clinton, he came very near making a charge of falsehood against me., He used, as I found it printed in a newspaper, which, I remember, was very nearly like the real speech, the following language: I confess this is rather a curious view, that out of respect for me he should consider I was making what I deemed rather a grave charge in fun., I confess it strikes me rather strangely., But I let it pass., As the Judge did not for a moment believe that there was a man in America whose heart was so ""corrupt"" as to make such a charge, and as he places me among the ""men in America"" who have hearts base enough to make such a charge, I hope he will excuse me if I hunt out another charge very like this; and if it should turn out that in hunting I should find that other, and it should turn out to be Judge Douglas himself who made it, I hope he will reconsider this question of the deep corruption of heart he has thought fit to ascribe to me., In Judge Douglas's speech of March 22, 1858, which I hold in my hand, he says: This is a part of the speech., You must excuse me from reading the entire article of the Washington Union, as Mr. Stuart read it for Mr. Douglas., The Judge goes on and sums up, as I think, correctly:  And a column nearly of the same sort., Then, when you come to look into the Lecompton Constitution, you find the same doctrine incorporated in it which was put forth editorially in the Union., What is it?, Then in the schedule is a provision that the Constitution may be amended after 1864 by a two-thirds vote:  I pass over some portions of the speech, and I hope that any one who feels interested in this matter will read the entire section of the speech, and see whether I do the Judge injustice., He proceeds:  I stop the quotation there, again requesting that it may all be read., I have read all of the portion I desire to comment upon., What is this charge that the Judge thinks I must have a very corrupt heart to make?, ...]"|3
35|"[In my speech of an hour and a half, I attended to some other parts of his speech, and incidentally, as I thought, intimated to him that I would answer the rest of his interrogatories on condition only that he should agree to answer as many for me., He made no intimation at the time of the proposition, nor did he in his reply allude at all to that suggestion of mine., I do him no injustice in saying that he occupied at least half of his reply in dealing with me as though I had refused to answer his interrogatories., I now propose that I will answer any of the interrogatories, upon condition that he will answer questions from me not exceeding the same number., I give him an opportunity to respond., The Judge remains silent., I now say that I will answer his interrogatories, whether he answers mine or not; and that after I have done so, I shall propound mine to him., I have supposed myself, since the organization of the Republican party at Bloomington, in May, 1856, bound as a party man by the platforms of the party, then and since., If in any interrogatories which I shall answer I go beyond the scope of what is within these platforms, it will be perceived that no one is responsible but myself., Having said thus much, I will take up the Judge's interrogatories as I find them printed in the Chicago Times, and answer them seriatim., In order that there may be no mistake about it, I have copied the interrogatories in writing, and also my answers to them., The first one of these interrogatories is in these words:  Question 1.--""I desire to know whether Lincoln to-day stands, as he did in 1854, in favor of the unconditional repeal of the Fugitive Slave law?"", Answer:--I do not now, nor ever did, stand in favor of the unconditional repeal of the Fugitive Slave law., Q., 2.--""I desire him to answer whether he stands pledged to-day, as he did in 1854, against the admission of any more slave States into the Union, even if the people want them?"", Answer:--I do not now, nor ever did, stand pledged against the admission of any more slave States into the Union., Q., 3.--""I want to know whether he stands pledged against the admission of a new State into the Union with such a constitution as the people of that State may see fit to make?"", Answer:--I do not stand pledged against the admission of a new State into the Union, with such a constitution as the people of that State may see fit to make., Q., 4.--""I want to know whether he stands to-day pledged to the abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia?"", Answer:--I do not stand to-day pledged to the abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia., Q., 5.--""I desire him to answer whether he stands pledged to the prohibition of the slave-trade between the different States?"", Answer:--I do not stand pledged to the prohibition of the slave-trade between the different States., Q., 6.--""I desire to know whether he stands pledged to prohibit slavery in all the Territories of the United States, north as well as south of the Missouri Compromise line?"", Answer:--I am impliedly, if not expressly, pledged to a belief in the right and duty of Congress to prohibit slavery in all the United States 'Territories., Q., 7.--""I desire him to answer whether he is opposed to the acquisition of any new territory unless slavery is first prohibited therein?"", Answer:--I am not generally opposed to honest acquisition of territory; and, in any given case, I would or would not oppose such acquisition, accordingly as I might think such acquisition would or would not aggravate the slavery question among ourselves., Now, my friends, it will be perceived, upon an examination of these questions and answers, that so far I have only answered that I was not pledged to this, that, or the other., The Judge has not framed his interrogatories to ask me anything more than this, and I have answered in strict accordance with the interrogatories, and have answered truly, that I am not pledged at all upon any of the points to which I have answered., But I am not disposed to hang upon the exact form of his interrogatory., I am rather disposed to take up at least some of these questions, and state what I really think upon them., As to the first one, in regard to the Fugitive Slave law, I have never hesitated to say, and I do not now hesitate to say, that I think, under the Constitution of the United States, the people of the Southern States are entitled to a Congressional Fugitive Slave law., Having said that, I have had nothing to say in regard to the existing Fugitive Slave law, further than that I think it should have been framed so as to be free from some of the objections that pertain to it, without lessening its efficiency., And inasmuch as we are not now in an agitation in regard to an alteration or modification of that law, I would not be the man to introduce it as a new subject of agitation upon the general question of slavery., In regard to the other question, of whether I am pledged to the admission of any more slave States into the Union, I state to you very frankly that I would be exceedingly sorry ever to be put in a position of having to pass upon that question., I should be exceedingly glad to know that there would never be another slave State admitted into the Union; but I must add that if slavery shall be kept out of the Territories during the territorial existence of any one given Territory, and then the people shall, having a fair chance and a clear field, when they come to adopt the constitution, do such an extraordinary thing as to adopt a slave constitution, uninfluenced by the actual presence of the institution among them, I see no alternative, if we own the country, but to admit them into the Union., The third interrogatory is answered by the answer to the second, it being, as I conceive, the same as the second., The fourth one is in regard to the abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia., In relation to that, I have my mind very distinctly made up., I should be exceedingly glad to see slavery abolished in the District of Columbia., I believe that Congress possesses the constitutional power to abolish it., Yet as a member of Congress, I should not, with my present views, be in favor of endeavoring to abolish slavery in the District of Columbia, unless it would be upon these conditions: First, that the abolition should be gradual; second, that it should be on a vote of the majority of qualified voters in the District; and third, that compensation should be made to unwilling owners., With these three conditions, I confess I would be exceedingly glad to see Congress abolish slavery in the District of Columbia, and, in the language of Henry Clay, ""sweep from our capital that foul blot upon our nation."", In regard to the fifth interrogatory, I must say here that, as to the question of the abolition of the slave-trade between the different States, I can truly answer, as I have, that I am pledged to nothing about it., It is a subject to which I have not given that mature consideration that would make me feel authorized to state a position so as to hold myself entirely bound by it., In other words, that question has never been prominently enough before me to induce me to investigate whether we really have the constitutional power to do it., I could investigate it if I had sufficient time to bring myself to a conclusion upon that subject; but I have not done so, and I say so frankly to you here, and to Judge Douglas., I must say, however, that if I should be of opinion that Congress does possess the constitutional power to abolish the slave-trade among the different States, I should still not be in favor of the exercise of that power, unless upon some conservative principle as I conceive it, akin to what I have said in relation to the abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia., My answer as to whether I desire that slavery should be prohibited in all the Territories of the United States is full and explicit within itself, and cannot be made clearer by any comments of mine., So I suppose in regard to the question whether I am opposed to the acquisition of any more territory unless slavery is first prohibited therein, my answer is such that I could add nothing by way of illustration, or making myself better understood, than the answer which I have placed in writing., Now in all this the Judge has me, and he has me on the record., I suppose he had flattered himself that I was really entertaining one set of opinions for one place, and another set for another place; that I was afraid to say at one place what I uttered at another., What I am saying here I suppose I say to a vast audience as strongly tending to Abolitionism as any audience in the State of Illinois, and I believe I am saying that which, if it would be offensive to any persons and render them enemies to myself, would be offensive to persons in this audience., I now proceed to propound to the Judge the interrogatories, so far as I have framed them., I will bring forward a new installment when I get them ready., I will bring them forward now only reaching to number four., The first one is:  Question 1.--If the people of Kansas shall, by means entirely unobjectionable in all other respects, adopt a State constitution, and ask admission into the Union under it, before they have the requisite number of inhabitants according to the English bill,--some ninety-three thousand,--will you vote to admit them?, Q., 2.--Can the people of a United States Territory, in any lawful way, against the wish of any citizen of the United States, exclude slavery from its limits prior to the formation of a State constitution?, Q., 3., If the Supreme Court of the United States shall decide that States cannot exclude slavery from their limits, are you in favor of acquiescing in, adopting, and following such decision as a rule of political action?, Q., 4., Are you in favor of acquiring additional territory, in disregard of how such acquisition may affect the nation on the slavery question?, As introductory to these interrogatories which Judge Douglas propounded to me at Ottawa, he read a set of resolutions which he said Judge Trumbull and myself had participated in adopting, in the first Republican State Convention, held at Springfield in October, 1854., He insisted that I and Judge Trumbull, and perhaps the entire Republican party, were responsible for the doctrines contained in the set of resolutions which he read, and I understand that it was from that set of resolutions that he deduced the interrogatories which he propounded to me, using these resolutions as a sort of authority for propounding those questions to me., Now, I say here to-day that I do not answer his interrogatories because of their springing at all from that set of resolutions which he read., I answered them because Judge Douglas thought fit to ask them., I do not now, nor ever did, recognize any responsibility upon myself in that set of resolutions., When I replied to him on that occasion, I assured him that I never had anything to do with them., I repeat here to today that I never in any possible form had anything to do with that set of resolutions It turns out, I believe, that those resolutions were never passed in any convention held in Springfield., It turns out that they were never passed at any convention or any public meeting that I had any part in., I believe it turns out, in addition to all this, that there was not, in the fall of 1854, any convention holding a session in Springfield, calling itself a Republican State Convention; yet it is true there was a convention, or assemblage of men calling themselves a convention, at Springfield, that did pass some resolutions., But so little did I really know of the proceedings of that convention, or what set of resolutions they had passed, though having a general knowledge that there had been such an assemblage of men there, that when Judge Douglas read the resolutions, I really did not know but they had been the resolutions passed then and there., I did not question that they were the resolutions adopted., For I could not bring myself to suppose that Judge Douglas could say what he did upon this subject without knowing that it was true., I contented myself, on that occasion, with denying, as I truly could, all connection with them, not denying or affirming whether they were passed at Springfield., Now, it turns out that he had got hold of some resolutions passed at some convention or public meeting in Kane County., I wish to say here, that I don't conceive that in any fair and just mind this discovery relieves me at all., I had just as much to do with the convention in Kane County as that at Springfield., I am as much responsible for the resolutions at Kane County as those at Springfield,--the amount of the responsibility being exactly nothing in either case; no more than there would be in regard to a set of resolutions passed in the moon., I allude to this extraordinary matter in this canvass for some further purpose than anything yet advanced., Judge Douglas did not make his statement upon that occasion as matters that he believed to be true, but he stated them roundly as being true, in such form as to pledge his veracity for their truth., When the whole matter turns out as it does, and when we consider who Judge Douglas is, that he is a distinguished Senator of the United States; that he has served nearly twelve years as such; that his character is not at all limited as an ordinary Senator of the United States, but that his name has become of world-wide renown,--it is most extraordinary that he should so far forget all the suggestions of justice to an adversary, or of prudence to himself, as to venture upon the assertion of that which the slightest investigation would have shown him to be wholly false., I can only account for his having done so upon the supposition that that evil genius which has attended him through his life, giving to him an apparent astonishing prosperity, such as to lead very many good men to doubt there being any advantage in virtue over vice,--I say I can only account for it on the supposition that that evil genius has as last made up its mind to forsake him., And I may add that another extraordinary feature of the Judge's conduct in this canvass--made more extraordinary by this incident--is, that he is in the habit, in almost all the speeches he makes, of charging falsehood upon his adversaries, myself and others., I now ask whether he is able to find in anything that Judge Trumbull, for instance, has said, or in anything that I have said, a justification at all compared with what we have, in this instance, for that sort of vulgarity., I have been in the habit of charging as a matter of belief on my part that, in the introduction of the Nebraska Bill into Congress, there was a conspiracy to make slavery perpetual and national., I have arranged from time to time the evidence which establishes and proves the truth of this charge., I recurred to this charge at Ottawa., I shall not now have time to dwell upon it at very great length; but inasmuch as Judge Douglas, in his reply of half an hour, made some points upon me in relation to it, I propose noticing a few of them., The Judge insists that, in the first speech I made, in which I very distinctly made that charge, he thought for a good while I was in fun!, that I was playful; that I was not sincere about it; and that he only grew angry and somewhat excited when he found that I insisted upon it as a matter of earnestness., He says he characterized it as a falsehood so far as I implicated his moral character in that transaction., Well, I did not know, till he presented that view, that I had implicated his moral character., ...]"|3
36|"[The people in the north end of the State were for stronger measures of opposition than we of the central and southern portions of the State, but we were all opposed to the Nebraska doctrine., We had that one feeling and that one sentiment in common., You at the north end met in your conventions and passed your resolutions., We in the middle of the State and farther south did not hold such conventions and pass the same resolutions, although we had in general a common view and a common sentiment., So that these meetings which the Judge has alluded to, and the resolutions he has read from, were local, and did not spread over the whole State., We at last met together in 1886, from all parts of the State, and we agreed upon a common platform., You, who held more extreme notions, either yielded those notions, or, if not wholly yielding them, agreed to yield them practically, for the sake of embodying the opposition to the measures which the opposite party were pushing forward at that time., We met you then, and if there was anything yielded, it was for practical purposes., We agreed then upon a platform for the party throughout the entire State of Illinois, and now we are all bound, as a party, to that platform., And I say here to you, if any one expects of me--in case of my election--that I will do anything not signified by our Republican platform and my answers here to-day, I tell you very frankly that person will be deceived., I do not ask for the vote of any one who supposes that I have secret purposes or pledges that I dare not speak out., Cannot the Judge be satisfied?, If he fears, in the unfortunate case of my election, that my going to Washington will enable me to advocate sentiments contrary to those which I expressed when you voted for and elected me, I assure him that his fears are wholly needless and groundless., Is the Judge really afraid of any such thing?, I'll tell you what he is afraid of., He is afraid we'll all pull together., This is what alarms him more than anything else., For my part, I do hope that all of us, entertaining a common sentiment in opposition to what appears to us a design to nationalize and perpetuate slavery, will waive minor differences on questions which either belong to the dead past or the distant future, and all pull together in this struggle., What are your sentiments?, If it be true that on the ground which I occupy--ground which I occupy as frankly and boldly as Judge Douglas does his,--my views, though partly coinciding with yours, are not as perfectly in accordance with your feelings as his are, I do say to you in all candor, go for him, and not for me., I hope to deal in all things fairly with Judge Douglas, and with the people of the State, in this contest., And if I should never be elected to any office, I trust I may go down with no stain of falsehood upon my reputation, notwithstanding the hard opinions Judge Douglas chooses to entertain of me., The Judge has again addressed himself to the Abolition tendencies of a speech of mine made at Springfield in June last., I have so often tried to answer what he is always saying on that melancholy theme that I almost turn with disgust from the discussion,--from the repetition of an answer to it., I trust that nearly all of this intelligent audience have read that speech., If you have, I may venture to leave it to you to inspect it closely, and see whether it contains any of those ""bugaboos"" which frighten Judge Douglas., The Judge complains that I did not fully answer his questions., If I have the sense to comprehend and answer those questions, I have done so fairly., If it can be pointed out to me how I can more fully and fairly answer him, I aver I have not the sense to see how it is to be done., He says I do not declare I would in any event vote for the admission of a slave State into the Union., If I have been fairly reported, he will see that I did give an explicit answer to his interrogatories; I did not merely say that I would dislike to be put to the test, but I said clearly, if I were put to the test, and a Territory from which slavery had been excluded should present herself with a State constitution sanctioning slavery,--a most extraordinary thing, and wholly unlikely to happen,--I did not see how I could avoid voting for her admission., But he refuses to understand that I said so, and he wants this audience to understand that I did not say so., Yet it will be so reported in the printed speech that he cannot help seeing it., He says if I should vote for the admission of a slave State I would be voting for a dissolution of the Union, because I hold that the Union cannot permanently exist half slave and half free., I repeat that I do not believe this government can endure permanently half slave and half free; yet I do not admit, nor does it at all follow, that the admission of a single slave State will permanently fix the character and establish this as a universal slave nation., The Judge is very happy indeed at working up these quibbles., Before leaving the subject of answering questions, I aver as my confident belief, when you come to see our speeches in print, that you will find every question which he has asked me more fairly and boldly and fully answered than he has answered those which I put to him., Is not that so?, The two speeches may be placed side by side, and I will venture to leave it to impartial judges whether his questions have not been more directly and circumstantially answered than mine., Judge Douglas says he made a charge upon the editor of the Washington Union, alone, of entertaining a purpose to rob the States of their power to exclude slavery from their limits., I undertake to say, and I make the direct issue, that he did not make his charge against the editor of the Union alone., I will undertake to prove by the record here that he made that charge against more and higher dignitaries than the editor of the Washington Union., I am quite aware that he was shirking and dodging around the form in which he put it, but I can make it manifest that he leveled his ""fatal blow"" against more persons than this Washington editor., Will he dodge it now by alleging that I am trying to defend Mr. Buchanan against the charge?, Not at all., Am I not making the same charge myself?, I am trying to show that you, Judge Douglas, are a witness on my side., I am not defending Buchanan, and I will tell Judge Douglas that in my opinion, when he made that charge, he had an eye farther north than he has to-day., He was then fighting against people who called him a Black Republican and an Abolitionist., It is mixed all through his speech, and it is tolerably manifest that his eye was a great deal farther north than it is to-day., The Judge says that though he made this charge, Toombs got up and declared there was not a man in the United States, except the editor of the Union, who was in favor of the doctrines put forth in that article., And thereupon I understand that the Judge withdrew the charge., Although he had taken extracts from the newspaper, and then from the Lecompton Constitution, to show the existence of a conspiracy to bring about a ""fatal blow,"" by which the States were to be deprived of the right of excluding slavery, it all went to pot as soon as Toombs got up and told him it was not true., It reminds me of the story that John Phoenix, the California railroad surveyor, tells., He says they started out from the Plaza to the Mission of Dolores., They had two ways of determining distances., One was by a chain and pins taken over the ground., The other was by a ""go-it-ometer,""--an invention of his own,--a three-legged instrument, with which he computed a series of triangles between the points., At night he turned to the chain-man to ascertain what distance they had come, and found that by some mistake he had merely dragged the chain over the ground, without keeping any record., By the ""go-it-ometer,"" he found he had made ten miles., Being skeptical about this, he asked a drayman who was passing how far it was to the Plaza., The drayman replied it was just half a mile; and the surveyor put it down in his book,--just as Judge Douglas says, after he had made his calculations and computations, he took Toombs's statement., I have no doubt that after Judge Douglas had made his charge, he was as easily satisfied about its truth as the surveyor was of the drayman's statement of the distance to the Plaza., Yet it is a fact that the man who put forth all that matter which Douglas deemed a ""fatal blow"" at State sovereignty was elected by the Democrats as public printer., Now, gentlemen, you may take Judge Douglas's speech of March 22, 1858, beginning about the middle of page 21, and reading to the bottom of page 24, and you will find the evidence on which I say that he did not make his charge against the editor of the Union alone., I cannot stop to read it, but I will give it to the reporters., Judge Douglas said:  Remember that this article was published in the Union on the 17th of November, and on the 18th appeared the first article giving the adhesion of the Union to the Lecompton Constitution., It was in these words:  I ask him if all this fuss was made over the editor of this newspaper., It would be a terribly ""fatal blow"" indeed which a single man could strike, when no President, no Cabinet officer, no member of Congress, was giving strength and efficiency to the movement., Out of respect to Judge Douglas's good sense I must believe he did n't manufacture his idea of the ""fatal"" character of that blow out of such a miserable scapegrace as he represents that editor to be., But the Judge's eye is farther south now., Then, it was very peculiarly and decidedly north., His hope rested on the idea of visiting the great ""Black Republican"" party, and making it the tail of his new kite., He knows he was then expecting from day to day to turn Republican, and place himself at the head of our organization., He has found that these despised ""Black Republicans"" estimate him by a standard which he has taught them none too well., Hence he is crawling back into his old camp, and you will find him eventually installed in full fellowship among those whom he was then battling, and with whom he now pretends to be at such fearful variance., There is very much in the principles that Judge Douglas has here enunciated that I most cordially approve, and over which I shall have no controversy with him., In so far as he has insisted that all the States have the right to do exactly as they please about all their domestic relations, including that of slavery, I agree entirely with him., He places me wrong in spite of all I can tell him, though I repeat it again and again, insisting that I have no difference with him upon this subject., I have made a great many speeches, some of which have been printed, and it will be utterly impossible for him to find anything that I have ever put in print contrary to what I now say upon this subject., I hold myself under constitutional obligations to allow the people in all the States, without interference, direct or indirect, to do exactly as they please; and I deny that I have any inclination to interfere with them, even if there were no such constitutional obligation., I can only say again that I am placed improperly--altogether improperly, in spite of all I can say--when it is insisted that I entertain any other view or purposes in regard to that matter., While I am upon this subject, I will make some answers briefly to certain propositions that Judge Douglas has put., He says, ""Why can't this Union endure permanently half slave and half free?"", I have said that I supposed it could not, and I will try, before this new audience, to give briefly some of the reasons for entertaining that opinion., Another form of his question is, ""Why can't we let it stand as our fathers placed it?"", That is the exact difficulty between us., I say that Judge Douglas and his friends have changed it from the position in which our fathers originally placed it., I say, in the way our father's originally left the slavery question, the institution was in the course of ultimate extinction, and the public mind rested in the belief that it was in the course of ultimate extinction., I say when this government was first established it was the policy of its founders to prohibit the spread of slavery into the new Territories of the United States, where it had not existed., But Judge Douglas and his friends have broken up that policy, and placed it upon a new basis, by which it is to become national and perpetual., All I have asked or desired anywhere is that it should be placed back again upon the basis that the fathers of our government originally placed it upon., I have no doubt that it would become extinct, for all time to come, if we but readopted the policy of the fathers, by restricting it to the limits it has already covered, restricting it from the new Territories., I do not wish to dwell at great length on this branch of the subject at this time, but allow me to repeat one thing that I have stated before., Brooks--the man who assaulted Senator Sumner on the floor of the Senate, and who was complimented with dinners, and silver pitchers, and gold-headed canes, and a good many other things for that feat--in one of his speeches declared that when this government was originally established, nobody expected that the institution of slavery would last until this day., That was but the opinion of one man, but it was such an opinion as we can never get from Judge Douglas or anybody in favor of slavery, in the North, at all., You can sometimes get it from a Southern man., He said at the same time that the framers of our government did not have the knowledge that experience has taught us; that experience and the invention of the cotton-gin have taught us that the perpetuation of slavery is a necessity., He insisted, therefore, upon its being changed from the basis upon which the fathers of the government left it to the basis of its perpetuation and nationalization., I insist that this is the difference between Judge Douglas and myself,--that Judge Douglas is helping that change along., ...]"|3
37|"[What right have we then to hope that the trouble will cease,--that the agitation will come to an end,--until it shall either be placed back where it originally stood, and where the fathers originally placed it, or, on the other hand, until it shall entirely master all opposition?, This is the view I entertain, and this is the reason why I entertained it, as Judge Douglas has read from my Springfield speech., Now, my friends, there is one other thing that I feel myself under some sort of obligation to mention., Judge Douglas has here to-day--in a very rambling way, I was about saying--spoken of the platforms for which he seeks to hold me responsible., He says, ""Why can't you come out and make an open avowal of principles in all places alike?"", and he reads from an advertisement that he says was used to notify the people of a speech to be made by Judge Trumbull at Waterloo., In commenting on it he desires to know whether we cannot speak frankly and manfully, as he and his friends do., How, I ask, do his friends speak out their own sentiments?, A Convention of his party in this State met on the 21st of April at Springfield, and passed a set of resolutions which they proclaim to the country as their platform., This does constitute their platform, and it is because Judge Douglas claims it is his platform--that these are his principles and purposes--that he has a right to declare he speaks his sentiments ""frankly and manfully."", On the 9th of June Colonel John Dougherty, Governor Reynolds, and others, calling themselves National Democrats, met in Springfield and adopted a set of resolutions which are as easily understood, as plain and as definite in stating to the country and to the world what they believed in and would stand upon, as Judge Douglas's platform Now, what is the reason that Judge Douglas is not willing that Colonel Dougherty and Governor Reynolds should stand upon their own written and printed platform as well as he upon his?, Why must he look farther than their platform when he claims himself to stand by his platform?, Again, in reference to our platform: On the 16th of June the Republicans had their Convention and published their platform, which is as clear and distinct as Judge Douglas's., In it they spoke their principles as plainly and as definitely to the world., What is the reason that Judge Douglas is not willing I should stand upon that platform?, Why must he go around hunting for some one who is supporting me or has supported me at some time in his life, and who has said something at some time contrary to that platform?, Does the Judge regard that rule as a good one?, If it turn out that the rule is a good one for me--that I am responsible for any and every opinion that any man has expressed who is my friend,--then it is a good rule for him., I ask, is it not as good a rule for him as it is for me?, In my opinion, it is not a good rule for either of us., Do you think differently, Judge?, Judge Douglas says he does not think differently., I am glad of it., Then can he tell me why he is looking up resolutions of five or six years ago, and insisting that they were my platform, notwithstanding my protest that they are not, and never were my platform, and my pointing out the platform of the State Convention which he delights to say nominated me for the Senate?, I cannot see what he means by parading these resolutions, if it is not to hold me responsible for them in some way., If he says to me here that he does not hold the rule to be good, one way or the other, I do not comprehend how he could answer me more fully if he answered me at greater length., I will therefore put in as my answer to the resolutions that he has hunted up against me, what I, as a lawyer, would call a good plea to a bad declaration., I understand that it is an axiom of law that a poor plea may be a good plea to a bad declaration., I think that the opinions the Judge brings from those who support me, yet differ from me, is a bad declaration against me; but if I can bring the same things against him, I am putting in a good plea to that kind of declaration, and now I propose to try it., At Freeport, Judge Douglas occupied a large part of his time in producing resolutions and documents of various sorts, as I understood, to make me somehow responsible for them; and I propose now doing a little of the same sort of thing for him., In 1850 a very clever gentleman by the name of Thompson Campbell, a personal friend of Judge Douglas and myself, a political friend of Judge Douglas and opponent of mine, was a candidate for Congress in the Galena District., He was interrogated as to his views on this same slavery question., I have here before me the interrogatories, and Campbell's answers to them--I will read them:  I want to say here that Thompson Campbell was elected to Congress on that platform, as the Democratic candidate in the Galena District, against Martin P. Sweet., The time Campbell ran was in 1850., I have not the exact date here., It was some time in 1850 that these interrogatories were put and the answer given., Campbell was elected to Congress, and served out his term., I think a second election came up before he served out his term, and he was not re-elected., Whether defeated or not nominated, I do not know., [Mr. Campbell was nominated for re-election by the Democratic party, by acclamation.], At the end of his term his very good friend Judge Douglas got him a high office from President Pierce, and sent him off to California., Is not that the fact?, Just at the end of his term in Congress it appears that our mutual friend Judge Douglas got our mutual friend Campbell a good office, and sent him to California upon it., And not only so, but on the 27th of last month, when Judge Douglas and myself spoke at Freeport in joint discussion, there was his same friend Campbell, come all the way from California, to help the Judge beat me; and there was poor Martin P. Sweet standing on the platform, trying to help poor me to be elected., That is true of one of Judge Douglas's friends., So again, in that same race of 1850, there was a Congressional Convention assembled at Joliet, and it nominated R. S. Molony for Congress, and unanimously adopted the following resolution:  Subsequently the same interrogatories were propounded to Dr. Molony which had been addressed to Campbell as above, with the exception of the 6th, respecting the interstate slave trade, to which Dr. Molony, the Democratic nominee for Congress, replied as follows:  All I have to say in regard to Dr. Molony is that he was the regularly nominated Democratic candidate for Congress in his district; was elected at that time; at the end of his term was appointed to a land-office at Danville., (I never heard anything of Judge Douglas's instrumentality in this.), He held this office a considerable time, and when we were at Freeport the other day there were handbills scattered about notifying the public that after our debate was over R. S. Molony would make a Democratic speech in favor of Judge Douglas., That is all I know of my own personal knowledge., It is added here to this resolution, and truly I believe, that among those who participated in the Joliet Convention, and who supported its nominee, with his platform as laid down in the resolution of the Convention and in his reply as above given, we call at random the following names, all of which are recognized at this day as leading Democrats:  On the 28th of February of the same year a Democratic District Convention was held at Naperville to nominate a candidate for Circuit Judge., Among the delegates were Bowen and Kelly of Will; Captain Naper, H. H. Cody, Nathan Allen, of Du Page; W. M. Jackson, J. M. Strode, P. W. Platt, and Enos W. Smith of McHenry; J. Horssnan and others of Winnebago., Colonel Strode presided over the Convention., The following resolutions were unanimously adopted,--the first on motion of P. W. Platt, the second on motion of William M. Jackson:  I understand it was in 1850, but I do not know it., I do not state a thing and say I know it, when I do not., But I have the highest belief that this is so., I know of no way to arrive at the conclusion that there is an error in it., I mean to put a case no stronger than the truth will allow., But what I was going to comment upon is an extract from a newspaper in De Kalb County; and it strikes me as being rather singular, I confess, under the circumstances., There is a Judge Mayo in that county, who is a candidate for the Legislature, for the purpose, if he secures his election, of helping to re-elect Judge Douglas., He is the editor of a newspaper [De Kalb County Sentinel], and in that paper I find the extract I am going to read., It is part of an editorial article in which he was electioneering as fiercely as he could for Judge Douglas and against me., It was a curious thing, I think, to be in such a paper., I will agree to that, and the Judge may make the most of it:  That is one of Judge Douglas's friends., Now, I do not want to leave myself in an attitude where I can be misrepresented, so I will say I do not think the Judge is responsible for this article; but he is quite as responsible for it as I would be if one of my friends had said it., I think that is fair enough., I have here also a set of resolutions passed by a Democratic State Convention in Judge Douglas's own good State of Vermont, that I think ought to be good for him too:  At Freeport I answered several interrogatories that had been propounded to me by Judge Douglas at the Ottawa meeting., The Judge has not yet seen fit to find any fault with the position that I took in regard to those seven interrogatories, which were certainly broad enough, in all conscience, to cover the entire ground., In my answers, which have been printed, and all have had the opportunity of seeing, I take the ground that those who elect me must expect that I will do nothing which will not be in accordance with those answers., I have some right to assert that Judge Douglas has no fault to find with them., But he chooses to still try to thrust me upon different ground, without paying any attention to my answers, the obtaining of which from me cost him so much trouble and concern., At the same time I propounded four interrogatories to him, claiming it as a right that he should answer as many interrogatories for me as I did for him, and I would reserve myself for a future instalment when I got them ready., The Judge, in answering me upon that occasion, put in what I suppose he intends as answers to all four of my interrogatories., The first one of these interrogatories I have before me, and it is in these words:  As I read the Judge's answer in the newspaper, and as I remember it as pronounced at the time, he does not give any answer which is equivalent to yes or no,--I will or I won't., He answers at very considerable length, rather quarreling with me for asking the question, and insisting that Judge Trumbull had done something that I ought to say something about, and finally getting out such statements as induce me to infer that he means to be understood he will, in that supposed case, vote for the admission of Kansas., I only bring this forward now for the purpose of saying that if he chooses to put a different construction upon his answer, he may do it., But if he does not, I shall from this time forward assume that he will vote for the admission of Kansas in disregard of the English bill., He has the right to remove any misunderstanding I may have., I only mention it now, that I may hereafter assume this to be the true construction of his answer, if he does not now choose to correct me., The second interrogatory that I propounded to him was this:  To this Judge Douglas answered that they can lawfully exclude slavery from the Territory prior to the formation of a constitution., He goes on to tell us how it can be done., As I understand him, he holds that it can be done by the Territorial Legislature refusing to make any enactments for the protection of slavery in the Territory, and especially by adopting unfriendly legislation to it., For the sake of clearness, I state it again: that they can exclude slavery from the Territory, 1st, by withholding what he assumes to be an indispensable assistance to it in the way of legislation; and, 2d, by unfriendly legislation., If I rightly understand him, I wish to ask your attention for a while to his position., In the first place, the Supreme Court of the United States has decided that any Congressional prohibition of slavery in the Territories is unconstitutional; that they have reached this proposition as a conclusion from their former proposition, that the Constitution of the United States expressly recognizes property in slaves, and from that other Constitutional provision, that no person shall be deprived of property without due process of law., Hence they reach the conclusion that as the Constitution of the United States expressly recognizes property in slaves, and prohibits any person from being deprived of property without due process of law, to pass an Act of Congress by which a man who owned a slave on one side of a line would be deprived of him if he took him on the other side, is depriving him of that property without due process of law., That I understand to be the decision of the Supreme Court., I understand also that Judge Douglas adheres most firmly to that decision; and the difficulty is, how is it possible for any power to exclude slavery from the Territory, unless in violation of that decision?, That is the difficulty., In the Senate of the United States, in 1850, Judge Trumbull, in a speech substantially, if not directly, put the same interrogatory to Judge Douglas, as to whether the people of a Territory had the lawful power to exclude slavery prior to the formation of a constitution., Judge Douglas then answered at considerable length, and his answer will be found in the Congressional Globe, under date of June 9th, 1856., The Judge said that whether the people could exclude slavery prior to the formation of a constitution or not was a question to be decided by the Supreme Court., He put that proposition, as will be seen by the Congressional Globe, in a variety of forms, all running to the same thing in substance,--that it was a question for the Supreme Court., I maintain that when he says, after the Supreme Court have decided the question, that the people may yet exclude slavery by any means whatever, he does virtually say that it is not a question for the Supreme Court., He shifts his ground., I appeal to you whether he did not say it was a question for the Supreme Court?, Has not the Supreme Court decided that question?, when he now says the people may exclude slavery, does he not make it a question for the people?, Does he not virtually shift his ground and say that it is not a question for the Court, but for the people?, This is a very simple proposition,--a very plain and naked one., It seems to me that there is no difficulty in deciding it., ...]"|3
38|"[And then again ""He laid up seven days."", He put this in print for the people of the country to read as a serious document., I think if he had been in his sober senses he would not have risked that barefacedness in the presence of thousands of his own friends who knew that I made speeches within six of the seven days at Henry, Marshall County, Augusta, Hancock County, and Macomb, McDonough County, including all the necessary travel to meet him again at Freeport at the end of the six days., Now I say there is no charitable way to look at that statement, except to conclude that he is actually crazy., There is another thing in that statement that alarmed me very greatly as he states it, that he was going to ""trot me down to Egypt."", Thereby he would have you infer that I would not come to Egypt unless he forced me--that I could not be got here unless he, giant-like, had hauled me down here., That statement he makes, too, in the teeth of the knowledge that I had made the stipulation to come down here and that he himself had been very reluctant to enter into the stipulation., More than all this: Judge Douglas, when he made that statement, must have been crazy and wholly out of his sober senses, or else he would have known that when he got me down here, that promise--that windy promise--of his powers to annihilate me, would n't amount to anything., Now, how little do I look like being carried away trembling?, Let the Judge go on; and after he is done with his half-hour, I want you all, if I can't go home myself, to let me stay and rot here; and if anything happens to the Judge, if I cannot carry him to the hotel and put him to bed, let me stay here and rot., I say, then, here is something extraordinary in this statement., I ask you if you know any other living man who would make such a statement?, I will ask my friend Casey, over there, if he would do such a thing?, Would he send that out and have his men take it as the truth?, Did the Judge talk of trotting me down to Egypt to scare me to death?, Why, I know this people better than he does., I was raised just a little east of here., I am a part of this people., But the Judge was raised farther north, and perhaps he has some horrid idea of what this people might be induced to do., But really I have talked about this matter perhaps longer than I ought, for it is no great thing; and yet the smallest are often the most difficult things to deal with., The Judge has set about seriously trying to make the impression that when we meet at different places I am literally in his clutches--that I am a poor, helpless, decrepit mouse, and that I can do nothing at all., This is one of the ways he has taken to create that impression., I don't know any other way to meet it except this., I don't want to quarrel with him--to call him a liar; but when I come square up to him I don't know what else to call him if I must tell the truth out., I want to be at peace, and reserve all my fighting powers for necessary occasions., My time now is very nearly out, and I give up the trifle that is left to the Judge, to let him set my knees trembling again, if he can., set my knees trembling again, if he can., It will be very difficult for an audience so large as this to hear distinctly what a speaker says, and consequently it is important that as profound silence be preserved as possible., While I was at the hotel to-day, an elderly gentleman called upon me to know whether I was really in favor of producing a perfect equality between the negroes and white people., While I had not proposed to myself on this occasion to say much on that subject, yet as the question was asked me I thought I would occupy perhaps five minutes in saying something in regard to it., I will say, then, that I am not, nor ever have been, in favor of bringing about in any way the social and political equality of the white and black races; that I am not, nor ever have been, in favor of making voters or jurors of negroes, nor of qualifying them to hold office, nor to intermarry with white people; and I will say, in addition to this, that there is a physical difference between the white and black races which I believe will forever forbid the two races living together on terms of social and political equality., And in as much as they cannot so live, while they do remain together there must be the position of superior and inferior, and I as much as any other man am in favor of having the superior position assigned to the white race., I say upon this occasion I do not perceive that because the white man is to have the superior position the negro should be denied everything., I do not understand that because I do not want a negro woman for a slave I must necessarily want her for a wife., My understanding is that I can just let her alone., I am now in my fiftieth year, and I certainly never have had a black woman for either a slave or a wife., So it seems to me quite possible for us to get along without making either slaves or wives of negroes., I will add to this that I have never seen, to my knowledge, a man, woman, or child who was in favor of producing a perfect equality, social and political, between negroes and white men., I recollect of but one distinguished instance that I ever heard of so frequently as to be entirely satisfied of its correctness, and that is the case of Judge Douglas's old friend Colonel Richard M. Johnson., I will also add to the remarks I have made (for I am not going to enter at large upon this subject), that I have never had the least apprehension that I or my friends would marry negroes if there was no law to keep them from it; but as Judge Douglas and his friends seem to be in great apprehension that they might, if there were no law to keep them from it, I give him the most solemn pledge that I will to the very last stand by the law of this State which forbids the marrying of white people with negroes., I will add one further word, which is this: that I do not understand that there is any place where an alteration of the social and political relations of the negro and the white man can be made, except in the State Legislature,--not in the Congress of the United States; and as I do not really apprehend the approach of any such thing myself, and as Judge Douglas seems to be in constant horror that some such danger is rapidly approaching, I propose as the best means to prevent it that the Judge be kept at home, and placed in the State Legislature to fight the measure., I do not propose dwelling longer at this time on this subject., When Judge Trumbull, our other Senator in Congress, returned to Illinois in the month of August, he made a speech at Chicago, in which he made what may be called a charge against Judge Douglas, which I understand proved to be very offensive to him., The Judge was at that time out upon one of his speaking tours through the country, and when the news of it reached him, as I am informed, he denounced Judge Trumbull in rather harsh terms for having said what he did in regard to that matter., I was traveling at that time, and speaking at the same places with Judge Douglas on subsequent days, and when I heard of what Judge Trumbull had said of Douglas, and what Douglas had said back again, I felt that I was in a position where I could not remain entirely silent in regard to the matter., Consequently, upon two or three occasions I alluded to it, and alluded to it in no other wise than to say that in regard to the charge brought by Trumbull against Douglas, I personally knew nothing, and sought to say nothing about it; that I did personally know Judge Trumbull; that I believed him to be a man of veracity; that I believed him to be a man of capacity sufficient to know very well whether an assertion he was making, as a conclusion drawn from a set of facts, was true or false; and as a conclusion of my own from that, I stated it as my belief if Trumbull should ever be called upon, he would prove everything he had said., I said this upon two or three occasions., Upon a subsequent occasion, Judge Trumbull spoke again before an audience at Alton, and upon that occasion not only repeated his charge against Douglas, but arrayed the evidence he relied upon to substantiate it., This speech was published at length; and subsequently at Jacksonville Judge Douglas alluded to the matter., In the course of his speech, and near the close of it, he stated in regard to myself what I will now read:  I have done simply what I have told you, to subject me to this invitation to notice the charge., I now wish to say that it had not originally been my purpose to discuss that matter at all But in-as-much as it seems to be the wish of Judge Douglas to hold me responsible for it, then for once in my life I will play General Jackson, and to the just extent I take the responsibility., I wish to say at the beginning that I will hand to the reporters that portion of Judge Trumbull's Alton speech which was devoted to this matter, and also that portion of Judge Douglas's speech made at Jacksonville in answer to it., I shall thereby furnish the readers of this debate with the complete discussion between Trumbull and Douglas., I cannot now read them, for the reason that it would take half of my first hour to do so., I can only make some comments upon them., Trumbull's charge is in the following words:  I will state, without quoting further, for all will have an opportunity of reading it hereafter, that Judge Trumbull brings forward what he regards as sufficient evidence to substantiate this charge., It will be perceived Judge Trumbull shows that Senator Bigler, upon the floor of the Senate, had declared there had been a conference among the senators, in which conference it was determined to have an enabling act passed for the people of Kansas to form a constitution under, and in this conference it was agreed among them that it was best not to have a provision for submitting the constitution to a vote of the people after it should be formed., He then brings forward to show, and showing, as he deemed, that Judge Douglas reported the bill back to the Senate with that clause stricken out., He then shows that there was a new clause inserted into the bill, which would in its nature prevent a reference of the constitution back for a vote of the people,--if, indeed, upon a mere silence in the law, it could be assumed that they had the right to vote upon it., These are the general statements that he has made., I propose to examine the points in Judge Douglas's speech in which he attempts to answer that speech of Judge Trumbull's., When you come to examine Judge Douglas's speech, you will find that the first point he makes is:  His striking out such a provision, if there was such a one in the bill, he argues, does not establish the proof that it was stricken out for the purpose of robbing the people of that right., I would say, in the first place, that that would be a most manifest reason for it., It is true, as Judge Douglas states, that many Territorial bills have passed without having such a provision in them., I believe it is true, though I am not certain, that in some instances constitutions framed under such bills have been submitted to a vote of the people with the law silent upon the subject; but it does not appear that they once had their enabling acts framed with an express provision for submitting the constitution to be framed to a vote of the people, then that they were stricken out when Congress did not mean to alter the effect of the law., That there have been bills which never had the provision in, I do not question; but when was that provision taken out of one that it was in?, More especially does the evidence tend to prove the proposition that Trumbull advanced, when we remember that the provision was stricken out of the bill almost simultaneously with the time that Bigler says there was a conference among certain senators, and in which it was agreed that a bill should be passed leaving that out., Judge Douglas, in answering Trumbull, omits to attend to the testimony of Bigler, that there was a meeting in which it was agreed they should so frame the bill that there should be no submission of the constitution to a vote of the people., The Judge does not notice this part of it., If you take this as one piece of evidence, and then ascertain that simultaneously Judge Douglas struck out a provision that did require it to be submitted, and put the two together, I think it will make a pretty fair show of proof that Judge Douglas did, as Trumbull says, enter into a plot to put in force a constitution for Kansas, without giving the people any opportunity of voting upon it., But I must hurry on., The next proposition that Judge Douglas puts is this:  This is a mere question of fact, and can be determined by evidence., I only want to ask this question: Why did not Judge Douglas say that these words were not stricken out of the Toomb's bill, or this bill from which it is alleged the provision was stricken out,--a bill which goes by the name of Toomb's, because he originally brought it forward?, I ask why, if the Judge wanted to make a direct issue with Trumbull, did he not take the exact proposition Trumbull made in his speech, and say it was not stricken out?, Trumbull has given the exact words that he says were in the Toomb's bill, and he alleges that when the bill came back, they were stricken out., Judge Douglas does not say that the words which Trumbull says were stricken out were not so stricken out, but he says there was no provision in the Toomb's bill to submit the constitution to a vote of the people., We see at once that he is merely making an issue upon the meaning of the words., He has not undertaken to say that Trumbull tells a lie about these words being stricken out, but he is really, when pushed up to it, only taking an issue upon the meaning of the words., Now, then, if there be any issue upon the meaning of the words, or if there be upon the question of fact as to whether these words were stricken out, I have before me what I suppose to be a genuine copy of the Toomb's bill, in which it can be shown that the words Trumbull says were in it were, in fact, originally there., If there be any dispute upon the fact, I have got the documents here to show they were there., If there be any controversy upon the sense of the words,--whether these words which were stricken out really constituted a provision for submitting the matter to a vote of the people,--as that is a matter of argument, I think I may as well use Trumbull's own argument., He says that the proposition is in these words:  ""That the following propositions be and the same are hereby offered to the said Convention of the people of Kansas when formed, for their free acceptance or rejection; which, if accepted by the Convention and ratified by the people at the election for the adoption of the constitution, shall be obligatory upon the United States and the said State of Kansas."", Now, Trumbull alleges that these last words were stricken out of the bill when it came back, and he says this was a provision for submitting the constitution to a vote of the people; and his argument is this:  ""Would it have been possible to ratify the land propositions at the election for the adoption of the constitution, unless such an election was to be held?"", This is Trumbull's argument., Now, Judge Douglas does not meet the charge at all, but he stands up and says there was no such proposition in that bill for submitting the constitution to be framed to a vote of the people., Trumbull admits that the language is not a direct provision for submitting it, but it is a provision necessarily implied from another provision., He asks you how it is possible to ratify the land proposition at the election for the adoption of the constitution, if there was no election to be held for the adoption of the constitution., And he goes on to show that it is not any less a law because the provision is put in that indirect shape than it would be if it were put directly., But I presume I have said enough to draw attention to this point, and I pass it by also., Another one of the points that Judge Douglas makes upon Trumbull, and at very great length, is, that Trumbull, while the bill was pending, said in a speech in the Senate that he supposed the constitution to be made would have to be submitted to the people., He asks, if Trumbull thought so then, what ground is there for anybody thinking otherwise now?, Fellow-citizens, this much may be said in reply: That bill had been in the hands of a party to which Trumbull did not belong., It had been in the hands of the committee at the head of which Judge Douglas stood., Trumbull perhaps had a printed copy of the original Toomb's bill., I have not the evidence on that point except a sort of inference I draw from the general course of business there., What alterations, or what provisions in the way of altering, were going on in committee, Trumbull had no means of knowing, until the altered bill was reported back., Soon afterwards, when it was reported back, there was a discussion over it, and perhaps Trumbull in reading it hastily in the altered form did not perceive all the bearings of the alterations., He was hastily borne into the debate, and it does not follow that because there was something in it Trumbull did not perceive, that something did not exist., More than this, is it true that what Trumbull did can have any effect on what Douglas did?, Suppose Trumbull had been in the plot with these other men, would that let Douglas out of it?, ...]"|3
39|"[Is it a forgery?, Is it there or not?, It may not be there, but I want the Judge to take these pieces of evidence, and distinctly say they are forgeries if he dare do it., Well, sir, you had better not commit him., He gives other quotations,--another from Judge Douglas., He says:  Judge Trumbull says Douglas made that speech, and it is recorded., Does Judge Douglas say it is a forgery, and was not true?, Trumbull says somewhere, and I propose to skip it, but it will be found by any one who will read this debate, that he did distinctly bring it to the notice of those who were engineering the bill, that it lacked that provision; and then he goes on to give another quotation from Judge Douglas, where Judge Trumbull uses this language:  So I say., I do not know whether Judge Douglas will dispute this, and yet maintain his position that Trumbull's evidence ""was forged from beginning to end."", I will remark that I have not got these Congressional Globes with me., They are large books, and difficult to carry about, and if Judge Douglas shall say that on these points where Trumbull has quoted from them there are no such passages there, I shall not be able to prove they are there upon this occasion, but I will have another chance., Whenever he points out the forgery and says, ""I declare that this particular thing which Trumbull has uttered is not to be found where he says it is,"" then my attention will be drawn to that, and I will arm myself for the contest, stating now that I have not the slightest doubt on earth that I will find every quotation just where Trumbull says it is., Then the question is, How can Douglas call that a forgery?, How can he make out that it is a forgery?, What is a forgery?, It is the bringing forward something in writing or in print purporting to be of certain effect when it is altogether untrue., If you come forward with my note for one hundred dollars when I have never given such a note, there is a forgery., If you come forward with a letter purporting to be written by me which I never wrote, there is another forgery., If you produce anything in writing or in print saying it is so and so, the document not being genuine, a forgery has been committed., How do you make this forgery when every piece of the evidence is genuine?, If Judge Douglas does say these documents and quotations are false and forged, he has a full right to do so; but until he does it specifically, we don't know how to get at him., If he does say they are false and forged, I will then look further into it, and presume I can procure the certificates of the proper officers that they are genuine copies., I have no doubt each of these extracts will be found exactly where Trumbull says it is., Then I leave it to you if Judge Douglas, in making his sweeping charge that Judge Trumbull's evidence is forged from beginning to end, at all meets the case,--if that is the way to get at the facts., I repeat again, if he will point out which one is a forgery, I will carefully examine it, and if it proves that any one of them is really a forgery, it will not be me who will hold to it any longer., I have always wanted to deal with everyone I meet candidly and honestly., If I have made any assertion not warranted by facts, and it is pointed out to me, I will withdraw it cheerfully., But I do not choose to see Judge Trumbull calumniated, and the evidence he has brought forward branded in general terms ""a forgery from beginning to end."", This is not the legal way of meeting a charge, and I submit it to all intelligent persons, both friends of Judge Douglas and of myself, whether it is., The point upon Judge Douglas is this: The bill that went into his hands had the provision in it for a submission of the constitution to the people; and I say its language amounts to an express provision for a submission, and that he took the provision out., He says it was known that the bill was silent in this particular; but I say, Judge Douglas, it was not silent when you got it., It was vocal with the declaration, when you got it, for a submission of the constitution to the people., And now, my direct question to Judge Douglas is, to answer why, if he deemed the bill silent on this point, he found it necessary to strike out those particular harmless words., If he had found the bill silent and without this provision, he might say what he does now., If he supposes it was implied that the constitution would be submitted to a vote of the people, how could these two lines so encumber the statute as to make it necessary to strike them out?, How could he infer that a submission was still implied, after its express provision had been stricken from the bill?, I find the bill vocal with the provision, while he silenced it., He took it out, and although he took out the other provision preventing a submission to a vote of the people, I ask, Why did you first put it in?, I ask him whether he took the original provision out, which Trumbull alleges was in the bill., If he admits that he did take it, I ask him what he did it for., It looks to us as if he had altered the bill., If it looks differently to him,--if he has a different reason for his action from the one we assign him--he can tell it., I insist upon knowing why he made the bill silent upon that point when it was vocal before he put his hands upon it., I was told, before my last paragraph, that my time was within three minutes of being out., I presume it is expired now; I therefore close., It follows as a matter of course that a half-hour answer to a speech of an hour and a half can be but a very hurried one., I shall only be able to touch upon a few of the points suggested by Judge Douglas, and give them a brief attention, while I shall have to totally omit others for the want of time., Judge Douglas has said to you that he has not been able to get from me an answer to the question whether I am in favor of negro citizenship., So far as I know the Judge never asked me the question before., He shall have no occasion to ever ask it again, for I tell him very frankly that I am not in favor of negro citizenship., This furnishes me an occasion for saying a few words upon the subject., I mentioned in a certain speech of mine, which has been printed, that the Supreme Court had decided that a negro could not possibly be made a citizen; and without saying what was my ground of complaint in regard to that, or whether I had any ground of complaint, Judge Douglas has from that thing manufactured nearly everything that he ever says about my disposition to produce an equality between the negroes and the white people., If any one will read my speech, he will find I mentioned that as one of the points decided in the course of the Supreme Court opinions, but I did not state what objection I had to it., But Judge Douglas tells the people what my objection was when I did not tell them myself., Now, my opinion is that the different States have the power to make a negro a citizen under the Constitution of the United States if they choose., The Dred Scott decision decides that they have not that power., If the State of Illinois had that power, I should be opposed to the exercise of it., That is all I have to say about it., Judge Douglas has told me that he heard my speeches north and my speeches south; that he had heard me at Ottawa and at Freeport in the north and recently at Jonesboro in the south, and there was a very different cast of sentiment in the speeches made at the different points., I will not charge upon Judge Douglas that he wilfully misrepresents me, but I call upon every fair-minded man to take these speeches and read them, and I dare him to point out any difference between my speeches north and south., While I am here perhaps I ought to say a word, if I have the time, in regard to the latter portion of the Judge's speech, which was a sort of declamation in reference to my having said I entertained the belief that this government would not endure half slave and half free., I have said so, and I did not say it without what seemed to me to be good reasons., It perhaps would require more time than I have now to set forth these reasons in detail; but let me ask you a few questions., Have we ever had any peace on this slavery question?, When are we to have peace upon it, if it is kept in the position it now occupies?, How are we ever to have peace upon it?, That is an important question., To be sure, if we will all stop, and allow Judge Douglas and his friends to march on in their present career until they plant the institution all over the nation, here and wherever else our flag waves, and we acquiesce in it, there will be peace., But let me ask Judge Douglas how he is going to get the people to do that?, They have been wrangling over this question for at least forty years., This was the cause of the agitation resulting in the Missouri Compromise; this produced the troubles at the annexation of Texas, in the acquisition of the territory acquired in the Mexican War., Again, this was the trouble which was quieted by the Compromise of 1850, when it was settled ""forever"" as both the great political parties declared in their National Conventions., That ""forever"" turned out to be just four years, when Judge Douglas himself reopened it., When is it likely to come to an end?, He introduced the Nebraska Bill in 1854 to put another end to the slavery agitation., He promised that it would finish it all up immediately, and he has never made a speech since, until he got into a quarrel with the President about the Lecompton Constitution, in which he has not declared that we are just at the end of the slavery agitation., But in one speech, I think last winter, he did say that he did n't quite see when the end of the slavery agitation would come., Now he tells us again that it is all over and the people of Kansas have voted down the Lecompton Constitution., How is it over?, That was only one of the attempts at putting an end to the slavery agitation--one of these ""final settlements."", Is Kansas in the Union?, Has she formed a constitution that she is likely to come in under?, Is not the slavery agitation still an open question in that Territory?, Has the voting down of that constitution put an end to all the trouble?, Is that more likely to settle it than every one of these previous attempts to settle the slavery agitation?, Now, at this day in the history of the world we can no more foretell where the end of this slavery agitation will be than we can see the end of the world itself., The Nebraska-Kansas Bill was introduced four years and a half ago, and if the agitation is ever to come to an end we may say we are four years and a half nearer the end., So, too, we can say we are four years and a half nearer the end of the world, and we can just as clearly see the end of the world as we can see the end of this agitation., The Kansas settlement did not conclude it., If Kansas should sink to-day, and leave a great vacant space in the earth's surface, this vexed question would still be among us., I say, then, there is no way of putting an end to the slavery agitation amongst us but to put it back upon the basis where our fathers placed it; no way but to keep it out of our new Territories,--to restrict it forever to the old States where it now exists., Then the public mind will rest in the belief that it is in the course of ultimate extinction., That is one way of putting an end to the slavery agitation., The other way is for us to surrender and let Judge Douglas and his friends have their way and plant slavery over all the States; cease speaking of it as in any way a wrong; regard slavery as one of the common matters of property, and speak of negroes as we do of our horses and cattle., But while it drives on in its state of progress as it is now driving, and as it has driven for the last five years, I have ventured the opinion, and I say to-day, that we will have no end to the slavery agitation until it takes one turn or the other., I do not mean that when it takes a turn toward ultimate extinction it will be in a day, nor in a year, nor in two years., I do not suppose that in the most peaceful way ultimate extinction would occur in less than a hundred years at least; but that it will occur in the best way for both races, in God's own good time, I have no doubt., But, my friends, I have used up more of my time than I intended on this point., Now, in regard to this matter about Trumbull and myself having made a bargain to sell out the entire Whig and Democratic parties in 1854: Judge Douglas brings forward no evidence to sustain his charge, except the speech Matheny is said to have made in 1856, in which he told a cock-and-bull story of that sort, upon the same moral principles that Judge Douglas tells it here to-day., This is the simple truth., ...]"|3
40|"[We have his own word that these alterations were made by him, and not by the committee., Now, I ask, what is the reason Judge Douglas is so chary about coming to the exact question?, What is the reason he will not tell you anything about How it was made, BY WHOM it was made, or that he remembers it being made at all?, Why does he stand playing upon the meaning of words and quibbling around the edges of the evidence?, If he can explain all this, but leaves it unexplained, I have the right to infer that Judge Douglas understood it was the purpose of his party, in engineering that bill through, to make a constitution, and have Kansas come into the Union with that constitution, without its being submitted to a vote of the people., If he will explain his action on this question, by giving a better reason for the facts that happened than he has done, it will be satisfactory., But until he does that--until he gives a better or more plausible reason than he has offered against the evidence in the case--I suggest to him it will not avail him at all that he swells himself up, takes on dignity, and calls people liars., Why, sir, there is not a word in Trumbull's speech that depends on Trumbull's veracity at all., He has only arrayed the evidence and told you what follows as a matter of reasoning., There is not a statement in the whole speech that depends on Trumbull's word., If you have ever studied geometry, you remember that by a course of reasoning Euclid proves that all the angles in a triangle are equal to two right angles., Euclid has shown you how to work it out., Now, if you undertake to disprove that proposition, and to show that it is erroneous, would you prove it to be false by calling Euclid a liar?, They tell me that my time is out, and therefore I close., A very large portion of the speech which Judge Douglas has addressed to you has previously been delivered and put in print., I do not mean that for a hit upon the Judge at all.---If I had not been interrupted, I was going to say that such an answer as I was able to make to a very large portion of it had already been more than once made and published., There has been an opportunity afforded to the public to see our respective views upon the topics discussed in a large portion of the speech which he has just delivered., I make these remarks for the purpose of excusing myself for not passing over the entire ground that the Judge has traversed., I however desire to take up some of the points that he has attended to, and ask your attention to them, and I shall follow him backwards upon some notes which I have taken, reversing the order, by beginning where he concluded., The Judge has alluded to the Declaration of Independence, and insisted that negroes are not included in that Declaration; and that it is a slander upon the framers of that instrument to suppose that negroes were meant therein; and he asks you: Is it possible to believe that Mr. Jefferson, who penned the immortal paper, could have supposed himself applying the language of that instrument to the negro race, and yet held a portion of that race in slavery?, Would he not at once have freed them?, I only have to remark upon this part of the Judge's speech (and that, too, very briefly, for I shall not detain myself, or you, upon that point for any great length of time), that I believe the entire records of the world, from the date of the Declaration of Independence up to within three years ago, may be searched in vain for one single affirmation, from one single man, that the negro was not included in the Declaration of Independence; I think I may defy Judge Douglas to show that he ever said so, that Washington ever said so, that any President ever said so, that any member of Congress ever said so, or that any living man upon the whole earth ever said so, until the necessities of the present policy of the Democratic party, in regard to slavery, had to invent that affirmation., And I will remind Judge Douglas and this audience that while Mr. Jefferson was the owner of slaves, as undoubtedly he was, in speaking upon this very subject he used the strong language that ""he trembled for his country when he remembered that God was just""; and I will offer the highest premium in my power to Judge Douglas if he will show that he, in all his life, ever uttered a sentiment at all akin to that of Jefferson., The next thing to which I will ask your attention is the Judge's comments upon the fact, as he assumes it to be, that we cannot call our public meetings as Republican meetings; and he instances Tazewell County as one of the places where the friends of Lincoln have called a public meeting and have not dared to name it a Republican meeting., He instances Monroe County as another, where Judge Trumbull and Jehu Baker addressed the persons whom the Judge assumes to be the friends of Lincoln calling them the ""Free Democracy."", I have the honor to inform Judge Douglas that he spoke in that very county of Tazewell last Saturday, and I was there on Tuesday last; and when he spoke there, he spoke under a call not venturing to use the word ""Democrat."", [Turning to Judge Douglas.], what think you of this?, So, again, there is another thing to which I would ask the Judge's attention upon this subject., In the contest of 1856 his party delighted to call themselves together as the ""National Democracy""; but now, if there should be a notice put up anywhere for a meeting of the ""National Democracy,"" Judge Douglas and his friends would not come., They would not suppose themselves invited., They would understand that it was a call for those hateful postmasters whom he talks about., Now a few words in regard to these extracts from speeches of mine which Judge Douglas has read to you, and which he supposes are in very great contrast to each other., Those speeches have been before the public for a considerable time, and if they have any inconsistency in them, if there is any conflict in them, the public have been able to detect it., When the Judge says, in speaking on this subject, that I make speeches of one sort for the people of the northern end of the State, and of a different sort for the southern people, he assumes that I do not understand that my speeches will be put in print and read north and south., I knew all the while that the speech that I made at Chicago, and the one I made at Jonesboro and the one at Charleston, would all be put in print, and all the reading and intelligent men in the community would see them and know all about my opinions., And I have not supposed, and do not now suppose, that there is any conflict whatever between them., But the Judge will have it that if we do not confess that there is a sort of inequality between the white and black races which justifies us in making them slaves, we must then insist that there is a degree of equality that requires us to make them our wives., Now, I have all the while taken a broad distinction in regard to that matter; and that is all there is in these different speeches which he arrays here; and the entire reading of either of the speeches will show that that distinction was made., Perhaps by taking two parts of the same speech he could have got up as much of a conflict as the one he has found., I have all the while maintained that in so far as it should be insisted that there was an equality between the white and black races that should produce a perfect social and political equality, it was an impossibility., This you have seen in my printed speeches, and with it I have said that in their right to ""life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness,"" as proclaimed in that old Declaration, the inferior races are our equals., And these declarations I have constantly made in reference to the abstract moral question, to contemplate and consider when we are legislating about any new country which is not already cursed with the actual presence of the evil,--slavery., I have never manifested any impatience with the necessities that spring from the actual presence of black people amongst us, and the actual existence of slavery amongst us where it does already exist; but I have insisted that, in legislating for new countries where it does not exist there is no just rule other than that of moral and abstract right!, With reference to those new countries, those maxims as to the right of a people to ""life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness"" were the just rules to be constantly referred to., There is no misunderstanding this, except by men interested to misunderstand it., I take it that I have to address an intelligent and reading community, who will peruse what I say, weigh it, and then judge whether I advanced improper or unsound views, or whether I advanced hypocritical, and deceptive, and contrary views in different portions of the country., I believe myself to be guilty of no such thing as the latter, though, of course, I cannot claim that I am entirely free from all error in the opinions I advance., The Judge has also detained us awhile in regard to the distinction between his party and our party., His he assumes to be a national party, ours a sectional one., He does this in asking the question whether this country has any interest in the maintenance of the Republican party., He assumes that our party is altogether sectional, that the party to which he adheres is national; and the argument is, that no party can be a rightful party--and be based upon rightful principles--unless it can announce its principles everywhere., I presume that Judge Douglas could not go into Russia and announce the doctrine of our national Democracy; he could not denounce the doctrine of kings and emperors and monarchies in Russia; and it may be true of this country that in some places we may not be able to proclaim a doctrine as clearly true as the truth of democracy, because there is a section so directly opposed to it that they will not tolerate us in doing so., Is it the true test of the soundness of a doctrine that in some places people won't let you proclaim it?, Is that the way to test the truth of any doctrine?, Why, I understood that at one time the people of Chicago would not let Judge Douglas preach a certain favorite doctrine of his., I commend to his consideration the question whether he takes that as a test of the unsoundness of what he wanted to preach., There is another thing to which I wish to ask attention for a little while on this occasion., What has always been the evidence brought forward to prove that the Republican party is a sectional party?, The main one was that in the Southern portion of the Union the people did not let the Republicans proclaim their doctrines amongst them., That has been the main evidence brought forward,--that they had no supporters, or substantially none, in the Slave States., The South have not taken hold of our principles as we announce them; nor does Judge Douglas now grapple with those principles., We have a Republican State Platform, laid down in Springfield in June last stating our position all the way through the questions before the country., We are now far advanced in this canvass., Judge Douglas and I have made perhaps forty speeches apiece, and we have now for the fifth time met face to face in debate, and up to this day I have not found either Judge Douglas or any friend of his taking hold of the Republican platform, or laying his finger upon anything in it that is wrong., I ask you all to recollect that., Judge Douglas turns away from the platform of principles to the fact that he can find people somewhere who will not allow us to announce those principles., If he had great confidence that our principles were wrong, he would take hold of them and demonstrate them to be wrong., But he does not do so., The only evidence he has of their being wrong is in the fact that there are people who won't allow us to preach them., I ask again, is that the way to test the soundness of a doctrine?, I ask his attention also to the fact that by the rule of nationality he is himself fast becoming sectional., I ask his attention to the fact that his speeches would not go as current now south of the Ohio River as they have formerly gone there I ask his attention to the fact that he felicitates himself to-day that all the Democrats of the free States are agreeing with him, while he omits to tell us that the Democrats of any slave State agree with him., If he has not thought of this, I commend to his consideration the evidence in his own declaration, on this day, of his becoming sectional too., I see it rapidly approaching., Whatever may be the result of this ephemeral contest between Judge Douglas and myself, I see the day rapidly approaching when his pill of sectionalism, which he has been thrusting down the throats of Republicans for years past, will be crowded down his own throat., Now, in regard to what Judge Douglas said (in the beginning of his speech) about the Compromise of 1850 containing the principles of the Nebraska Bill, although I have often presented my views upon that subject, yet as I have not done so in this canvass, I will, if you please, detain you a little with them., I have always maintained, so far as I was able, that there was nothing of the principle of the Nebraska Bill in the Compromise of 1850 at all,--nothing whatever., Where can you find the principle of the Nebraska Bill in that Compromise?, If anywhere, in the two pieces of the Compromise organizing the Territories of New Mexico and Utah., It was expressly provided in these two acts that when they came to be admitted into the Union they should be admitted with or without slavery, as they should choose, by their own constitutions., Nothing was said in either of those acts as to what was to be done in relation to slavery during the Territorial existence of those Territories, while Henry Clay constantly made the declaration (Judge Douglas recognizing him as a leader) that, in his opinion, the old Mexican laws would control that question during the Territorial existence, and that these old Mexican laws excluded slavery., How can that be used as a principle for declaring that during the Territorial existence as well as at the time of framing the constitution the people, if you please, might have slaves if they wanted them?, I am not discussing the question whether it is right or wrong; but how are the New Mexican and Utah laws patterns for the Nebraska Bill?, I maintain that the organization of Utah and New Mexico did not establish a general principle at all., It had no feature of establishing a general principle., The acts to which I have referred were a part of a general system of Compromises., They did not lay down what was proposed as a regular policy for the Territories, only an agreement in this particular case to do in that way, because other things were done that were to be a compensation for it., They were allowed to come in in that shape, because in another way it was paid for, considering that as a part of that system of measures called the Compromise of 1850, which finally included half-a-dozen acts., It included the admission of California as a free State, which was kept out of the Union for half a year because it had formed a free constitution., It included the settlement of the boundary of Texas, which had been undefined before, which was in itself a slavery question; for if you pushed the line farther west, you made Texas larger, and made more slave territory; while, if you drew the line toward the east, you narrowed the boundary and diminished the domain of slavery, and by so much increased free territory., It included the abolition of the slave trade in the District of Columbia., It included the passage of a new Fugitive Slave law., All these things were put together, and, though passed in separate acts, were nevertheless, in legislation (as the speeches at the time will show), made to depend upon each other., Each got votes with the understanding that the other measures were to pass, and by this system of compromise, in that series of measures, those two bills--the New Mexico and Utah bills--were passed: and I say for that reason they could not be taken as models, framed upon their own intrinsic principle, for all future Territories., And I have the evidence of this in the fact that Judge Douglas, a year afterward, or more than a year afterward, perhaps, when he first introduced bills for the purpose of framing new Territories, did not attempt to follow these bills of New Mexico and Utah; and even when he introduced this Nebraska Bill, I think you will discover that he did not exactly follow them., But I do not wish to dwell at great length upon this branch of the discussion., My own opinion is, that a thorough investigation will show most plainly that the New Mexico and Utah bills were part of a system of compromise, and not designed as patterns for future Territorial legislation; and that this Nebraska Bill did not follow them as a pattern at all., The Judge tells, in proceeding, that he is opposed to making any odious distinctions between free and slave States., I am altogether unaware that the Republicans are in favor of making any odious distinctions between the free and slave States., ...]"|3
41|"[Now, remembering the provision of the Constitution which I have read--affirming that that instrument is the supreme law of the land; that the judges of every State shall be bound by it, any law or constitution of any State to the contrary notwithstanding; that the right of property in a slave is affirmed in that Constitution, is made, formed into, and cannot be separated from it without breaking it; durable as the instrument; part of the instrument;--what follows as a short and even syllogistic argument from it?, I think it follows, and I submit to the consideration of men capable of arguing whether, as I state it, in syllogistic form, the argument has any fault in it:  Nothing in the Constitution or laws of any State can destroy a right distinctly and expressly affirmed in the Constitution of the United States., The right of property in a slave is distinctly and expressly affirmed in the Constitution of the United States., Therefore, nothing in the Constitution or laws of any State can destroy the right of property in a slave., I believe that no fault can be pointed out in that argument; assuming the truth of the premises, the conclusion, so far as I have capacity at all to understand it, follows inevitably., There is a fault in it as I think, but the fault is not in the reasoning; but the falsehood in fact is a fault of the premises., I believe that the right of property in a slave is not distinctly and expressly affirmed in the Constitution, and Judge Douglas thinks it is., I believe that the Supreme Court and the advocates of that decision may search in vain for the place in the Constitution where the right of property in a slave is distinctly and expressly affirmed I say, therefore, that I think one of the premises is not true in fact., But it is true with Judge Douglas., It is true with the Supreme Court who pronounced it., They are estopped from denying it, and being estopped from denying it, the conclusion follows that, the Constitution of the United States being the supreme law, no constitution or law can interfere with it., It being affirmed in the decision that the right of property in a slave is distinctly and expressly affirmed in the Constitution, the conclusion inevitably follows that no State law or constitution can destroy that right., I then say to Judge Douglas and to all others that I think it will take a better answer than a sneer to show that those who have said that the right of property in a slave is distinctly and expressly affirmed in the Constitution, are not prepared to show that no constitution or law can destroy that right., I say I believe it will take a far better argument than a mere sneer to show to the minds of intelligent men that whoever has so said is not prepared, whenever public sentiment is so far advanced as to justify it, to say the other., This is but an opinion, and the opinion of one very humble man; but it is my opinion that the Dred Scott decision, as it is, never would have been made in its present form if the party that made it had not been sustained previously by the elections., My own opinion is, that the new Dred Scott decision, deciding against the right of the people of the States to exclude slavery, will never be made if that party is not sustained by the elections., I believe, further, that it is just as sure to be made as to-morrow is to come, if that party shall be sustained., I have said, upon a former occasion, and I repeat it now, that the course of arguement that Judge Douglas makes use of upon this subject (I charge not his motives in this), is preparing the public mind for that new Dred Scott decision., I have asked him again to point out to me the reasons for his first adherence to the Dred Scott decision as it is., I have turned his attention to the fact that General Jackson differed with him in regard to the political obligation of a Supreme Court decision., I have asked his attention to the fact that Jefferson differed with him in regard to the political obligation of a Supreme Court decision., Jefferson said that ""Judges are as honest as other men, and not more so."", And he said, substantially, that whenever a free people should give up in absolute submission to any department of government, retaining for themselves no appeal from it, their liberties were gone., I have asked his attention to the fact that the Cincinnati platform, upon which he says he stands, disregards a time-honored decision of the Supreme Court, in denying the power of Congress to establish a National Bank., I have asked his attention to the fact that he himself was one of the most active instruments at one time in breaking down the Supreme Court of the State of Illinois because it had made a decision distasteful to him,--a struggle ending in the remarkable circumstance of his sitting down as one of the new Judges who were to overslaugh that decision; getting his title of Judge in that very way., So far in this controversy I can get no answer at all from Judge Douglas upon these subjects., Not one can I get from him, except that he swells himself up and says, ""All of us who stand by the decision of the Supreme Court are the friends of the Constitution; all you fellows that dare question it in any way are the enemies of the Constitution."", Now, in this very devoted adherence to this decision, in opposition to all the great political leaders whom he has recognized as leaders, in opposition to his former self and history, there is something very marked., And the manner in which he adheres to it,--not as being right upon the merits, as he conceives (because he did not discuss that at all), but as being absolutely obligatory upon every one simply because of the source from whence it comes, as that which no man can gainsay, whatever it may be,--this is another marked feature of his adherence to that decision., It marks it in this respect, that it commits him to the next decision, whenever it comes, as being as obligatory as this one, since he does not investigate it, and won't inquire whether this opinion is right or wrong., So he takes the next one without inquiring whether it is right or wrong., He teaches men this doctrine, and in so doing prepares the public mind to take the next decision when it comes, without any inquiry., In this I think I argue fairly (without questioning motives at all) that Judge Douglas is most ingeniously and powerfully preparing the public mind to take that decision when it comes; and not only so, but he is doing it in various other ways., In these general maxims about liberty, in his assertions that he ""don't care whether slavery is voted up or voted down,""; that ""whoever wants slavery has a right to have it""; that ""upon principles of equality it should be allowed to go everywhere""; that ""there is no inconsistency between free and slave institutions""--in this he is also preparing (whether purposely or not) the way for making the institution of slavery national!, I repeat again, for I wish no misunderstanding, that I do not charge that he means it so; but I call upon your minds to inquire, if you were going to get the best instrument you could, and then set it to work in the most ingenious way, to prepare the public mind for this movement, operating in the free States, where there is now an abhorrence of the institution of slavery, could you find an instrument so capable of doing it as Judge Douglas, or one employed in so apt a way to do it?, I have said once before, and I will repeat it now, that Mr. Clay, when he was once answering an objection to the Colonization Society, that it had a tendency to the ultimate emancipation of the slaves, said that:  And I do think--I repeat, though I said it on a former occasion--that Judge Douglas and whoever, like him, teaches that the negro has no share, humble though it may be, in the Declaration of Independence, is going back to the era of our liberty and independence, and, so far as in him lies, muzzling the cannon that thunders its annual joyous return; that he is blowing out the moral lights around us, when he contends that whoever wants slaves has a right to hold them; that he is penetrating, so far as lies in his power, the human soul, and eradicating the light of reason and the love of liberty, when he is in every possible way preparing the public mind, by his vast influence, for making the institution of slavery perpetual and national., There is, my friends, only one other point to which I will call your attention for the remaining time that I have left me, and perhaps I shall not occupy the entire time that I have, as that one point may not take me clear through it., Among the interrogatories that Judge Douglas propounded to me at Freeport, there was one in about this language:  I answered, as I thought, in this way: that I am not generally opposed to the acquisition of additional territory, and that I would support a proposition for the acquisition of additional territory according as my supporting it was or was not calculated to aggravate this slavery question amongst us., I then proposed to Judge Douglas another interrogatory, which was correlative to that: ""Are you in favor of acquiring additional territory, in disregard of how it may affect us upon the slavery question?"", Judge Douglas answered,--that is, in his own way he answered it., I believe that, although he took a good many words to answer it, it was a little more fully answered than any other., The substance of his answer was that this country would continue to expand; that it would need additional territory; that it was as absurd to suppose that we could continue upon our present territory, enlarging in population as we are, as it would be to hoop a boy twelve years of age, and expect him to grow to man's size without bursting the hoops., I believe it was something like that., Consequently, he was in favor of the acquisition of further territory as fast as we might need it, in disregard of how it might affect the slavery question., I do not say this as giving his exact language, but he said so substantially; and he would leave the question of slavery, where the territory was acquired, to be settled by the people of the acquired territory., May be it is; let us consider that for a while., This will probably, in the run of things, become one of the concrete manifestations of this slavery question., If Judge Douglas's policy upon this question succeeds, and gets fairly settled down, until all opposition is crushed out, the next thing will be a grab for the territory of poor Mexico, an invasion of the rich lands of South America, then the adjoining islands will follow, each one of which promises additional slave-fields., And this question is to be left to the people of those countries for settlement., When we get Mexico, I don't know whether the Judge will be in favor of the Mexican people that we get with it settling that question for themselves and all others; because we know the Judge has a great horror for mongrels, and I understand that the people of Mexico are most decidedly a race of mongrels., I understand that there is not more than one person there out of eight who is pure white, and I suppose from the Judge's previous declaration that when we get Mexico, or any considerable portion of it, that he will be in favor of these mongrels settling the question, which would bring him somewhat into collision with his horror of an inferior race., It is to be remembered, though, that this power of acquiring additional territory is a power confided to the President and the Senate of the United States., It is a power not under the control of the representatives of the people any further than they, the President and the Senate, can be considered the representatives of the people., Let me illustrate that by a case we have in our history., When we acquired the territory from Mexico in the Mexican War, the House of Representatives, composed of the immediate representatives of the people, all the time insisted that the territory thus to be acquired should be brought in upon condition that slavery should be forever prohibited therein, upon the terms and in the language that slavery had been prohibited from coming into this country., That was insisted upon constantly and never failed to call forth an assurance that any territory thus acquired should have that prohibition in it, so far as the House of Representatives was concerned., But at last the President and Senate acquired the territory without asking the House of Representatives anything about it, and took it without that prohibition., They have the power of acquiring territory without the immediate representatives of the people being called upon to say anything about it, and thus furnishing a very apt and powerful means of bringing new territory into the Union, and, when it is once brought into the country, involving us anew in this slavery agitation., It is therefore, as I think, a very important question for due consideration of the American people, whether the policy of bringing in additional territory, without considering at all how it will operate upon the safety of the Union in reference to this one great disturbing element in our national politics, shall be adopted as the policy of the country., You will bear in mind that it is to be acquired, according to the Judge's view, as fast as it is needed, and the indefinite part of this proposition is that we have only Judge Douglas and his class of men to decide how fast it is needed., We have no clear and certain way of determining or demonstrating how fast territory is needed by the necessities of the country., Whoever wants to go out filibustering, then, thinks that more territory is needed., Whoever wants wider slave-fields feels sure that some additional territory is needed as slave territory., Then it is as easy to show the necessity of additional slave-territory as it is to assert anything that is incapable of absolute demonstration., Whatever motive a man or a set of men may have for making annexation of property or territory, it is very easy to assert, but much less easy to disprove, that it is necessary for the wants of the country., And now it only remains for me to say that I think it is a very grave question for the people of this Union to consider, whether, in view of the fact that this slavery question has been the only one that has ever endangered our Republican institutions, the only one that has ever threatened or menaced a dissolution of the Union, that has ever disturbed us in such a way as to make us fear for the perpetuity of our liberty,--in view of these facts, I think it is an exceedingly interesting and important question for this people to consider whether we shall engage in the policy of acquiring additional territory, discarding altogether from our consideration, while obtaining new territory, the question how it may affect us in regard to this, the only endangering element to our liberties and national greatness., The Judge's view has been expressed., I, in my answer to his question, have expressed mine., I think it will become an important and practical question., Our views are before the public., I am willing and anxious that they should consider them fully; that they should turn it about and consider the importance of the question, and arrive at a just conclusion as to whether it is or is not wise in the people of this Union, in the acquisition of new territory, to consider whether it will add to the disturbance that is existing amongst us--whether it will add to the one only danger that has ever threatened the perpetuity of the Union or our own liberties., I think it is extremely important that they shall decide, and rightly decide, that question before entering upon that policy., And now, my friends, having said the little I wish to say upon this head, whether I have occupied the whole of the remnant of my time or not, I believe I could not enter upon any new topic so as to treat it fully, without transcending my time, which I would not for a moment think of doing., I give way to Judge Douglas., I have had no immediate conference with Judge Douglas, but I will venture to say that he and I will perfectly agree that your entire silence, both when I speak and when he speaks, will be most agreeable to us., In the month of May, 1856, the elements in the State of Illinois which have since been consolidated into the Republican party assembled together in a State Convention at Bloomington., They adopted at that time what, in political language, is called a platform., In June of the same year the elements of the Republican party in the nation assembled together in a National Convention at Philadelphia., They adopted what is called the National Platform., In June, 1858,--the present year,--the Republicans of Illinois reassembled at Springfield, in State Convention, and adopted again their platform, as I suppose not differing in any essential particular from either of the former ones, but perhaps adding something in relation to the new developments of political progress in the country., The Convention that assembled in June last did me the honor, if it be one, and I esteem it such, to nominate me as their candidate for the United States Senate., I have supposed that, in entering upon this canvass, I stood generally upon these platforms., We are now met together on the 13th of October of the same year, only four months from the adoption of the last platform, and I am unaware that in this canvass, from the beginning until to-day, any one of our adversaries has taken hold of our platforms, or laid his finger upon anything that he calls wrong in them., In the very first one of these joint discussions between Senator Douglas and myself, Senator Douglas, without alluding at all to these platforms, or any one of them, of which I have spoken, attempted to hold me responsible for a set of resolutions passed long before the meeting of either one of these conventions of which I have spoken., And as a ground for holding me responsible for these resolutions, he assumed that they had been passed at a State Convention of the Republican party, and that I took part in that Convention., It was discovered afterward that this was erroneous, that the resolutions which he endeavored to hold me responsible for had not been passed by any State Convention anywhere, had not been passed at Springfield, where he supposed they had, or assumed that they had, and that they had been passed in no convention in which I had taken part., The Judge, nevertheless, was not willing to give up the point that he was endeavoring to make upon me, and he therefore thought to still hold me to the point that he was endeavoring to make, by showing that the resolutions that he read had been passed at a local convention in the northern part of the State, although it was not a local convention that embraced my residence at all, nor one that reached, as I suppose, nearer than one hundred and fifty or two hundred miles of where I was when it met, nor one in which I took any part at all., He also introduced other resolutions, passed at other meetings, and by combining the whole, although they were all antecedent to the two State Conventions and the one National Convention I have mentioned, still he insisted, and now insists, as I understand, that I am in some way responsible for them., At Jonesboro, on our third meeting, I insisted to the Judge that I was in no way rightfully held responsible for the proceedings of this local meeting or convention, in which I had taken no part, and in which I was in no way embraced; but I insisted to him that if he thought I was responsible for every man or every set of men everywhere, who happen to be my friends, the rule ought to work both ways, and he ought to be responsible for the acts and resolutions of all men or sets of men who were or are now his supporters and friends, and gave him a pretty long string of resolutions, passed by men who are now his friends, and announcing doctrines for which he does not desire to be held responsible., This still does not satisfy Judge Douglas., He still adheres to his proposition, that I am responsible for what some of my friends in different parts of the State have done, but that he is not responsible for what his have done., At least, so I understand him., But in addition to that, the Judge, at our meeting in Galesburgh, last week, undertakes to establish that I am guilty of a species of double dealing with the public; that I make speeches of a certain sort in the north, among the Abolitionists, which I would not make in the south, and that I make speeches of a certain sort in the south which I would not make in the north., I apprehend, in the course I have marked out for myself, that I shall not have to dwell at very great length upon this subject., As this was done in the Judge's opening speech at Galesburgh, I had an opportunity, as I had the middle speech then, of saying something in answer to it., He brought forward a quotation or two from a speech of mine delivered at Chicago, and then, to contrast with it, he brought forward an extract from a speech of mine at Charleston, in which he insisted that I was greatly inconsistent, and insisted that his conclusion followed, that I was playing a double part, and speaking in one region one way, and in another region another way., I have not time now to dwell on this as long as I would like, and wish only now to requote that portion of my speech at Charleston which the Judge quoted, and then make some comments upon it., This he quotes from me as being delivered at Charleston, and I believe correctly:  ""I will say, then, that I am not, nor ever have been, in favor of bringing about in any way the social and political equality of the white and black races; that I am not, nor ever have been, in favor of making voters or jurors of negroes, nor of qualifying them to hold office, nor to intermarry with white people; and I will say, in addition to this, that there is a physical difference between the white and black races which will forever forbid the two races living together on terms of social and political equality., And inasmuch as they cannot so live while they do remain together, there must be the position of superior and inferior., I am as much as any other man in favor of having the superior position assigned to the white race."", ...]"|3
42|"[The Republican party think it wrong; we think it is a moral, a social, and a political wrong., We think it as a wrong not confining itself merely to the persons or the States where it exists, but that it is a wrong in its tendency, to say the least, that extends itself to the existence of the whole nation., Because we think it wrong, we propose a course of policy that shall deal with it as a wrong., We deal with it as with any other wrong, in so far as we can prevent its growing any larger, and so deal with it that in the run of time there may be some promise of an end to it., We have a due regard to the actual presence of it amongst us, and the difficulties of getting rid of it in any satisfactory way, and all the constitutional obligations thrown about it., I suppose that in reference both to its actual existence in the nation, and to our constitutional obligations, we have no right at all to disturb it in the States where it exists, and we profess that we have no more inclination to disturb it than we have the right to do it., We go further than that: we don't propose to disturb it where, in one instance, we think the Constitution would permit us., We think the Constitution would permit us to disturb it in the District of Columbia., Still, we do not propose to do that, unless it should be in terms which I don't suppose the nation is very likely soon to agree to,--the terms of making the emancipation gradual, and compensating the unwilling owners., Where we suppose we have the constitutional right, we restrain ourselves in reference to the actual existence of the institution and the difficulties thrown about it., We also oppose it as an evil so far as it seeks to spread itself., We insist on the policy that shall restrict it to its present limits., We don't suppose that in doing this we violate anything due to the actual presence of the institution, or anything due to the constitutional guaranties thrown around it., We oppose the Dred Scott decision in a certain way, upon which I ought perhaps to address you a few words., We do not propose that when Dred Scott has been decided to be a slave by the court, we, as a mob, will decide him to be free., We do not propose that, when any other one, or one thousand, shall be decided by that court to be slaves, we will in any violent way disturb the rights of property thus settled; but we nevertheless do oppose that decision as a political rule which shall be binding on the voter to vote for nobody who thinks it wrong, which shall be binding on the members of Congress or the President to favor no measure that does not actually concur with the principles of that decision., We do not propose to be bound by it as a political rule in that way, because we think it lays the foundation, not merely of enlarging and spreading out what we consider an evil, but it lays the foundation for spreading that evil into the States themselves., We propose so resisting it as to have it reversed if we can, and a new judicial rule established upon this subject., I will add this: that if there be any man who does not believe that slavery is wrong in the three aspects which I have mentioned, or in any one of them, that man is misplaced, and ought to leave us; while on the other hand, if there be any man in the Republican party who is impatient over the necessity springing from its actual presence, and is impatient of the constitutional guaranties thrown around it, and would act in disregard of these, he too is misplaced, standing with us., He will find his place somewhere else; for we have a due regard, so far as we are capable of understanding them, for all these things., This, gentlemen, as well as I can give it, is a plain statement of our principles in all their enormity., I will say now that there is a sentiment in the country contrary to me,--a sentiment which holds that slavery is not wrong, and therefore it goes for the policy that does not propose dealing with it as a wrong., That policy is the Democratic policy, and that sentiment is the Democratic sentiment., If there be a doubt in the mind of any one of this vast audience that this is really the central idea of the Democratic party in relation to this subject, I ask him to bear with me while I state a few things tending, as I think, to prove that proposition., In the first place, the leading man--I think I may do my friend Judge Douglas the honor of calling him such advocating the present Democratic policy never himself says it is wrong., He has the high distinction, so far as I know, of never having said slavery is either right or wrong., Almost everybody else says one or the other, but the Judge never does., If there be a man in the Democratic party who thinks it is wrong, and yet clings to that party, I suggest to him, in the first place, that his leader don't talk as he does, for he never says that it is wrong., In the second place, I suggest to him that if he will examine the policy proposed to be carried forward, he will find that he carefully excludes the idea that there is anything wrong in it., If you will examine the arguments that are made on it, you will find that every one carefully excludes the idea that there is anything wrong in slavery., Perhaps that Democrat who says he is as much opposed to slavery as I am will tell me that I am wrong about this., I wish him to examine his own course in regard to this matter a moment, and then see if his opinion will not be changed a little., You say it is wrong; but don't you constantly object to anybody else saying so?, Do you not constantly argue that this is not the right place to oppose it?, You say it must not be opposed in the free States, because slavery is not here; it must not be opposed in the slave States, because it is there; it must not be opposed in politics, because that will make a fuss; it must not be opposed in the pulpit, because it is not religion., Then where is the place to oppose it?, There is no suitable place to oppose it., There is no place in the country to oppose this evil overspreading the continent, which you say yourself is coming., Frank Blair and Gratz Brown tried to get up a system of gradual emancipation in Missouri, had an election in August, and got beat, and you, Mr. Democrat, threw up your hat, and hallooed ""Hurrah for Democracy!"", So I say, again, that in regard to the arguments that are made, when Judge Douglas Says he ""don't care whether slavery is voted up or voted down,"" whether he means that as an individual expression of sentiment, or only as a sort of statement of his views on national policy, it is alike true to say that he can thus argue logically if he don't see anything wrong in it; but he cannot say so logically if he admits that slavery is wrong., He cannot say that he would as soon see a wrong voted up as voted down., When Judge Douglas says that whoever or whatever community wants slaves, they have a right to have them, he is perfectly logical, if there is nothing wrong in the institution; but if you admit that it is wrong, he cannot logically say that anybody has a right to do wrong., When he says that slave property and horse and hog property are alike to be allowed to go into the Territories, upon the principles of equality, he is reasoning truly, if there is no difference between them as property; but if the one is property held rightfully, and the other is wrong, then there is no equality between the right and wrong; so that, turn it in anyway you can, in all the arguments sustaining the Democratic policy, and in that policy itself, there is a careful, studied exclusion of the idea that there is anything wrong in slavery., Let us understand this., I am not, just here, trying to prove that we are right, and they are wrong., I have been stating where we and they stand, and trying to show what is the real difference between us; and I now say that whenever we can get the question distinctly stated, can get all these men who believe that slavery is in some of these respects wrong to stand and act with us in treating it as a wrong,--then, and not till then, I think we will in some way come to an end of this slavery agitation., Since Judge Douglas has said to you in his conclusion that he had not time in an hour and a half to answer all I had said in an hour, it follows of course that I will not be able to answer in half an hour all that he said in an hour and a half., I wish to return to Judge Douglas my profound thanks for his public annunciation here to-day, to be put on record, that his system of policy in regard to the institution of slavery contemplates that it shall last forever., We are getting a little nearer the true issue of this controversy, and I am profoundly grateful for this one sentence., Judge Douglas asks you, Why cannot the institution of slavery, or rather, why cannot the nation, part slave and part free, continue as our fathers made it, forever?, In the first place, I insist that our fathers did not make this nation half slave and half free, or part slave and part free., I insist that they found the institution of slavery existing here., They did not make it so but they left it so because they knew of no way to get rid of it at that time., When Judge Douglas undertakes to say that, as a matter of choice, the fathers of the government made this nation part slave and part free, he assumes what is historically a falsehood., More than that: when the fathers of the government cut off the source of slavery by the abolition of the slave-trade, and adopted a system of restricting it from the new Territories where it had not existed, I maintain that they placed it where they understood, and all sensible men understood, it was in the course of ultimate extinction; and when Judge Douglas asks me why it cannot continue as our fathers made it, I ask him why he and his friends could not let it remain as our fathers made it?, It is precisely all I ask of him in relation to the institution of slavery, that it shall be placed upon the basis that our fathers placed it upon., Mr. Brooks, of South Carolina, once said, and truly said, that when this government was established, no one expected the institution of slavery to last until this day, and that the men who formed this government were wiser and better than the men of these days; but the men of these days had experience which the fathers had not, and that experience had taught them the invention of the cotton-gin, and this had made the perpetuation of the institution of slavery a necessity in this country., Judge Douglas could not let it stand upon the basis which our fathers placed it, but removed it, and put it upon the cotton-gin basis., It is a question, therefore, for him and his friends to answer, why they could not let it remain where the fathers of the government originally placed it., I hope nobody has understood me as trying to sustain the doctrine that we have a right to quarrel with Kentucky, or Virginia, or any of the slave States, about the institution of slavery,--thus giving the Judge an opportunity to be eloquent and valiant against us in fighting for their rights., I expressly declared in my opening speech that I had neither the inclination to exercise, nor the belief in the existence of, the right to interfere with the States of Kentucky or Virginia in doing as they pleased with slavery Or any other existing institution., Then what becomes of all his eloquence in behalf of the rights of States, which are assailed by no living man?, But I have to hurry on, for I have but a half hour., The Judge has informed me, or informed this audience, that the Washington Union is laboring for my election to the United States Senate., This is news to me,--not very ungrateful news either., [Turning to Mr. W. H. Carlin, who was on the stand]--I hope that Carlin will be elected to the State Senate, and will vote for me., [Mr. Carlin shook his head.], Carlin don't fall in, I perceive, and I suppose he will not do much for me; but I am glad of all the support I can get, anywhere, if I can get it without practicing any deception to obtain it., In respect to this large portion of Judge Douglas's speech in which he tries to show that in the controversy between himself and the Administration party he is in the right, I do not feel myself at all competent or inclined to answer him., I say to him, ""Give it to them,--give it to them just all you can!"", and, on the other hand, I say to Carlin, and Jake Davis, and to this man Wogley up here in Hancock, ""Give it to Douglas, just pour it into him!"", Now, in regard to this matter of the Dred Scott decision, I wish to say a word or two., After all, the Judge will not say whether, if a decision is made holding that the people of the States cannot exclude slavery, he will support it or not., He obstinately refuses to say what he will do in that case., The judges of the Supreme Court as obstinately refused to say what they would do on this subject., Before this I reminded him that at Galesburgh he said the judges had expressly declared the contrary, and you remember that in my Opening speech I told him I had the book containing that decision here, and I would thank him to lay his finger on the place where any such thing was said., He has occupied his hour and a half, and he has not ventured to try to sustain his assertion., He never will., But he is desirous of knowing how we are going to reverse that Dred Scott decision., Judge Douglas ought to know how., Did not he and his political friends find a way to reverse the decision of that same court in favor of the constitutionality of the National Bank?, Didn't they find a way to do it so effectually that they have reversed it as completely as any decision ever was reversed, so far as its practical operation is concerned?, And let me ask you, didn't Judge Douglas find a way to reverse the decision of our Supreme Court when it decided that Carlin's father--old Governor Carlin had not the constitutional power to remove a Secretary of State?, Did he not appeal to the ""MOBS,"" as he calls them?, Did he not make speeches in the lobby to show how villainous that decision was, and how it ought to be overthrown?, Did he not succeed, too, in getting an act passed by the Legislature to have it overthrown?, And did n't he himself sit down on that bench as one of the five added judges, who were to overslaugh the four old ones, getting his name of ""judge"" in that way, and no other?, If there is a villainy in using disrespect or making opposition to Supreme Court decisions, I commend it to Judge Douglas's earnest consideration., I know of no man in the State of Illinois who ought to know so well about how much villainy it takes to oppose a decision of the Supreme Court as our honorable friend Stephen A. Douglas., Judge Douglas also makes the declaration that I say the Democrats are bound by the Dred Scott decision, while the Republicans are not., In the sense in which he argues, I never said it; but I will tell you what I have said and what I do not hesitate to repeat to-day., I have said that as the Democrats believe that decision to be correct, and that the extension of slavery is affirmed in the National Constitution, they are bound to support it as such; and I will tell you here that General Jackson once said each man was bound to support the Constitution ""as he understood it."", Now, Judge Douglas understands the Constitution according to the Dred Scott decision, and he is bound to support it as he understands it., I understand it another way, and therefore I am bound to support it in the way in which I understand it., And as Judge Douglas believes that decision to be correct, I will remake that argument if I have time to do so., Let me talk to some gentleman down there among you who looks me in the face., We will say you are a member of the Territorial Legislature, and, like Judge Douglas, you believe that the right to take and hold slaves there is a constitutional right The first thing you do is to swear you will support the Constitution, and all rights guaranteed therein; that you will, whenever your neighbor needs your legislation to support his constitutional rights, not withhold that legislation., If you withhold that necessary legislation for the support of the Constitution and constitutional rights, do you not commit perjury?, I ask every sensible man if that is not so?, That is undoubtedly just so, say what you please., ...]"|3
43|"[I have said that that evidence was very strong in the fact that when Dred Scott was declared to be a slave, the owner of him made him free, showing that he had had the case tried and the question settled for such use as could be made of that decision; he cared nothing about the property thus declared to be his by that decision., But my time is out, and I can say no more., I have been somewhat, in my own mind, complimented by a large portion of Judge Douglas's speech,--I mean that portion which he devotes to the controversy between himself and the present Administration., This is the seventh time Judge Douglas and myself have met in these joint discussions, and he has been gradually improving in regard to his war with the Administration., At Quincy, day before yesterday, he was a little more severe upon the Administration than I had heard him upon any occasion, and I took pains to compliment him for it., I then told him to give it to them with all the power he had; and as some of them were present, I told them I would be very much obliged if they would give it to him in about the same way., I take it he has now vastly improved upon the attack he made then upon the Administration., I flatter myself he has really taken my advice on this subject., All I can say now is to re-commend to him and to them what I then commended,--to prosecute the war against one another in the most vigorous manner., I say to them again: ""Go it, husband!--Go it, bear!"", There is one other thing I will mention before I leave this branch of the discussion,--although I do not consider it much of my business, anyway., I refer to that part of the Judge's remarks where he undertakes to involve Mr. Buchanan in an inconsistency., He reads something from Mr. Buchanan, from which he undertakes to involve him in an inconsistency; and he gets something of a cheer for having done so., I would only remind the Judge that while he is very valiantly fighting for the Nebraska Bill and the repeal of the Missouri Compromise, it has been but a little while since he was the valiant advocate of the Missouri Compromise., I want to know if Buchanan has not as much right to be inconsistent as Douglas has?, Has Douglas the exclusive right, in this country, of being on all sides of all questions?, Is nobody allowed that high privilege but himself?, Is he to have an entire monopoly on that subject?, So far as Judge Douglas addressed his speech to me, or so far as it was about me, it is my business to pay some attention to it., I have heard the Judge state two or three times what he has stated to-day, that in a speech which I made at Springfield, Illinois, I had in a very especial manner complained that the Supreme Court in the Dred Scott case had decided that a negro could never be a citizen of the United States., I have omitted by some accident heretofore to analyze this statement, and it is required of me to notice it now., In point of fact it is untrue., I never have complained especially of the Dred Scott decision because it held that a negro could not be a citizen, and the Judge is always wrong when he says I ever did so complain of it., I have the speech here, and I will thank him or any of his friends to show where I said that a negro should be a citizen, and complained especially of the Dred Scott decision because it declared he could not be one., I have done no such thing; and Judge Douglas, so persistently insisting that I have done so, has strongly impressed me with the belief of a predetermination on his part to misrepresent me., He could not get his foundation for insisting that I was in favor of this negro equality anywhere else as well as he could by assuming that untrue proposition., Let me tell this audience what is true in regard to that matter; and the means by which they may correct me if I do not tell them truly is by a recurrence to the speech itself., I spoke of the Dred Scott decision in my Springfield speech, and I was then endeavoring to prove that the Dred Scott decision was a portion of a system or scheme to make slavery national in this country., I pointed out what things had been decided by the court., I mentioned as a fact that they had decided that a negro could not be a citizen; that they had done so, as I supposed, to deprive the negro, under all circumstances, of the remotest possibility of ever becoming a citizen and claiming the rights of a citizen of the United States under a certain clause of the Constitution., I stated that, without making any complaint of it at all., I then went on and stated the other points decided in the case; namely, that the bringing of a negro into the State of Illinois and holding him in slavery for two years here was a matter in regard to which they would not decide whether it would make him free or not; that they decided the further point that taking him into a United States Territory where slavery was prohibited by Act of Congress did not make him free, because that Act of Congress, as they held, was unconstitutional., I mentioned these three things as making up the points decided in that case., I mentioned them in a lump, taken in connection with the introduction of the Nebraska Bill, and the amendment of Chase, offered at the time, declaratory of the right of the people of the Territories to exclude slavery, which was voted down by the friends of the bill., I mentioned all these things together, as evidence tending to prove a combination and conspiracy to make the institution of slavery national., In that connection and in that way I mentioned the decision on the point that a negro could not be a citizen, and in no other connection., Out of this Judge Douglas builds up his beautiful fabrication of my purpose to introduce a perfect social and political equality between the white and black races., His assertion that I made an ""especial objection"" (that is his exact language) to the decision on this account is untrue in point of fact., Now, while I am upon this subject, and as Henry Clay has been alluded to, I desire to place myself, in connection with Mr. Clay, as nearly right before this people as may be., I am quite aware what the Judge's object is here by all these allusions., He knows that we are before an audience having strong sympathies southward, by relationship, place of birth, and so on., He desires to place me in an extremely Abolition attitude., He read upon a former occasion, and alludes, without reading, to-day to a portion of a speech which I delivered in Chicago., In his quotations from that speech, as he has made them upon former occasions, the extracts were taken in such a way as, I suppose, brings them within the definition of what is called garbling,--taking portions of a speech which, when taken by themselves, do not present the entire sense of the speaker as expressed at the time., I propose, therefore, out of that same speech, to show how one portion of it which he skipped over (taking an extract before and an extract after) will give a different idea, and the true idea I intended to convey., It will take me some little time to read it, but I believe I will occupy the time that way., You have heard him frequently allude to my controversy with him in regard to the Declaration of Independence., I confess that I have had a struggle with Judge Douglas on that matter, and I will try briefly to place myself right in regard to it on this occasion., I said--and it is between the extracts Judge Douglas has taken from this speech, and put in his published speeches:  ""It may be argued that there are certain conditions that make necessities and impose them upon us, and to the extent that a necessity is imposed upon a man he must submit to it., I think that was the condition in which we found ourselves when we established this government., We had slaves among us, we could not get our Constitution unless we permitted them to remain in slavery, we could not secure the good we did secure if we grasped for more; and having by necessity submitted to that much, it does not destroy the principle that is the charter of our liberties., Let the charter remain as our standard."", Now, I have upon all occasions declared as strongly as Judge Douglas against the disposition to interfere with the existing institution of slavery., You hear me read it from the same speech from which he takes garbled extracts for the purpose of proving upon me a disposition to interfere with the institution of slavery, and establish a perfect social and political equality between negroes and white people., Allow me while upon this subject briefly to present one other extract from a speech of mine, more than a year ago, at Springfield, in discussing this very same question, soon after Judge Douglas took his ground that negroes were, not included in the Declaration of Independence:  There again are the sentiments I have expressed in regard to the Declaration of Independence upon a former occasion,--sentiments which have been put in print and read wherever anybody cared to know what so humble an individual as myself chose to say in regard to it., At Galesburgh, the other day, I said, in answer to Judge Douglas, that three years ago there never had been a man, so far as I knew or believed, in the whole world, who had said that the Declaration of Independence did not include negroes in the term ""all men."", I reassert it to-day., I assert that Judge Douglas and all his friends may search the whole records of the country, and it will be a matter of great astonishment to me if they shall be able to find that one human being three years ago had ever uttered the astounding sentiment that the term ""all men"" in the Declaration did not include the negro., Do not let me be misunderstood., I know that more than three years ago there were men who, finding this assertion constantly in the way of their schemes to bring about the ascendency and perpetuation of slavery, denied the truth of it., I know that Mr. Calhoun and all the politicians of his school denied the truth of the Declaration., I know that it ran along in the mouth of some Southern men for a period of years, ending at last in that shameful, though rather forcible, declaration of Pettit of Indiana, upon the floor of the United States Senate, that the Declaration of Independence was in that respect ""a self-evident lie,"" rather than a self-evident truth., But I say, with a perfect knowledge of all this hawking at the Declaration without directly attacking it, that three years ago there never had lived a man who had ventured to assail it in the sneaking way of pretending to believe it, and then asserting it did not include the negro., I believe the first man who ever said it was Chief Justice Taney in the Dred Scott case, and the next to him was our friend Stephen A. Douglas., And now it has become the catchword of the entire party., I would like to call upon his friends everywhere to consider how they have come in so short a time to view this matter in a way so entirely different from their former belief; to ask whether they are not being borne along by an irresistible current,--whither, they know not., In answer to my proposition at Galesburgh last week, I see that some man in Chicago has got up a letter, addressed to the Chicago Times, to show, as he professes, that somebody had said so before; and he signs himself ""An Old-Line Whig,"" if I remember correctly., In the first place, I would say he was not an old-line Whig., I am somewhat acquainted with old-line Whigs from the origin to the end of that party; I became pretty well acquainted with them, and I know they always had some sense, whatever else you could ascribe to them., I know there never was one who had not more sense than to try to show by the evidence he produces that some men had, prior to the time I named, said that negroes were not included in the term ""all men"" in the Declaration of Independence., What is the evidence he produces?, I will bring forward his evidence, and let you see what he offers by way of showing that somebody more than three years ago had said negroes were not included in the Declaration., He brings forward part of a speech from Henry Clay,--the part of the speech of Henry Clay which I used to bring forward to prove precisely the contrary., I guess we are surrounded to some extent to-day by the old friends of Mr. Clay, and they will be glad to hear anything from that authority., While he was in Indiana a man presented a petition to liberate his negroes, and he (Mr. Clay) made a speech in answer to it, which I suppose he carefully wrote out himself and caused to be published., I have before me an extract from that speech which constitutes the evidence this pretended ""Old-Line Whig"" at Chicago brought forward to show that Mr. Clay did n't suppose the negro was included in the Declaration of Independence., Hear what Mr. Clay said:  This is the entire quotation brought forward to prove that somebody previous to three years ago had said the negro was not included in the term ""all men"" in the Declaration., How does it do so?, In what way has it a tendency to prove that?, Mr. Clay says it is true as an abstract principle that all men are created equal, but that we cannot practically apply it in all eases., He illustrates this by bringing forward the cases of females, minors, and insane persons, with whom it cannot be enforced; but he says it is true as an abstract principle in the organization of society as well as in organized society and it should be kept in view as a fundamental principle., Let me read a few words more before I add some comments of my own., Mr. Clay says, a little further on:  Now, here in this same book, in this same speech, in this same extract, brought forward to prove that Mr. Clay held that the negro was not included in the Declaration of Independence, is no such statement on his part, but the declaration that it is a great fundamental truth which should be constantly kept in view in the organization of society and in societies already organized., But if I say a word about it; if I attempt, as Mr. Clay said all good men ought to do, to keep it in view; if, in this ""organized society,"" I ask to have the public eye turned upon it; if I ask, in relation to the organization of new Territories, that the public eye should be turned upon it, forthwith I am vilified as you hear me to-day., What have I done that I have not the license of Henry Clay's illustrious example here in doing?, Have I done aught that I have not his authority for, while maintaining that in organizing new Territories and societies this fundamental principle should be regarded, and in organized society holding it up to the public view and recognizing what he recognized as the great principle of free government?, And when this new principle--this new proposition that no human being ever thought of three years ago--is brought forward, I combat it as having an evil tendency, if not an evil design., I combat it as having a tendency to dehumanize the negro, to take away from him the right of ever striving to be a man., I combat it as being one of the thousand things constantly done in these days to prepare the public mind to make property, and nothing but property, of the negro in all the States of this Union., But there is a point that I wish, before leaving this part of the discussion, to ask attention to., I have read and I repeat the words of Henry Clay:  The principle upon which I have insisted in this canvass is in relation to laying the foundations of new societies., I have never sought to apply these principles to the old States for the purpose of abolishing slavery in those States., It is nothing but a miserable perversion of what I have said, to assume that I have declared Missouri, or any other slave State, shall emancipate her slaves; I have proposed no such thing., But when Mr. Clay says that in laying the foundations of society in our Territories where it does not exist, he would be opposed to the introduction of slavery as an element, I insist that we have his warrant--his license--for insisting upon the exclusion of that element which he declared in such strong and emphatic language was most hurtful to him., Judge Douglas has again referred to a Springfield speech in which I said ""a house divided against itself cannot stand."", The Judge has so often made the entire quotation from that speech that I can make it from memory., I used this language:  ""We are now far into the fifth year since a policy was initiated with the avowed object and confident promise of putting an end to the slavery agitation., Under the operation of this policy, that agitation has not only not ceased, but has constantly augmented., In my opinion it will not cease until a crisis shall have been reached and passed., 'A house divided against itself cannot stand.', ...]"|3
44|"[And I understand as well as Judge Douglas, or anybody else, that these mutual accommodations are the cements which bind together the different parts of this Union; that instead of being a thing to ""divide the house,""--figuratively expressing the Union,--they tend to sustain it; they are the props of the house, tending always to hold it up., But when I have admitted all this, I ask if there is any parallel between these things and this institution of slavery?, I do not see that there is any parallel at all between them., Consider it., When have we had any difficulty or quarrel amongst ourselves about the cranberry laws of Indiana, or the oyster laws of Virginia, or the pine-lumber laws of Maine, or the fact that Louisiana produces sugar, and Illinois flour?, When have we had any quarrels over these things?, When have we had perfect peace in regard to this thing which I say is an element of discord in this Union?, We have sometimes had peace, but when was it?, It was when the institution of slavery remained quiet where it was., We have had difficulty and turmoil whenever it has made a struggle to spread itself where it was not., I ask, then, if experience does not speak in thunder-tones telling us that the policy which has given peace to the country heretofore, being returned to, gives the greatest promise of peace again., You may say, and Judge Douglas has intimated the same thing, that all this difficulty in regard to the institution of slavery is the mere agitation of office-seekers and ambitious Northern politicians., He thinks we want to get ""his place,"" I suppose., I agree that there are office-seekers amongst us., The Bible says somewhere that we are desperately selfish., I think we would have discovered that fact without the Bible., I do not claim that I am any less so than the average of men, but I do claim that I am not more selfish than Judge Douglas., But is it true that all the difficulty and agitation we have in regard to this institution of slavery spring from office-seeking, from the mere ambition of politicians?, Is that the truth?, How many times have we had danger from this question?, Go back to the day of the Missouri Compromise., Go back to the nullification question, at the bottom of which lay this same slavery question., Go back to the time of the annexation of Texas., Go back to the troubles that led to the Compromise of 1850., You will find that every time, with the single exception of the Nullification question, they sprung from an endeavor to spread this institution., There never was a party in the history of this country, and there probably never will be, of sufficient strength to disturb the general peace of the country., Parties themselves may be divided and quarrel on minor questions, yet it extends not beyond the parties themselves., But does not this question make a disturbance outside of political circles?, Does it not enter into the churches and rend them asunder?, What divided the great Methodist Church into two parts, North and South?, What has raised this constant disturbance in every Presbyterian General Assembly that meets?, What disturbed the Unitarian Church in this very city two years ago?, What has jarred and shaken the great American Tract Society recently, not yet splitting it, but sure to divide it in the end?, Is it not this same mighty, deep-seated power that somehow operates on the minds of men, exciting and stirring them up in every avenue of society,--in politics, in religion, in literature, in morals, in all the manifold relations of life?, Is this the work of politicians?, Is that irresistible power, which for fifty years has shaken the government and agitated the people, to be stifled and subdued by pretending that it is an exceedingly simple thing, and we ought not to talk about it?, If you will get everybody else to stop talking about it, I assure you I will quit before they have half done so., But where is the philosophy or statesmanship which assumes that you can quiet that disturbing element in our society which has disturbed us for more than half a century, which has been the only serious danger that has threatened our institutions,--I say, where is the philosophy or the statesmanship based on the assumption that we are to quit talking about it, and that the public mind is all at once to cease being agitated by it?, Yet this is the policy here in the North that Douglas is advocating, that we are to care nothing about it!, I ask you if it is not a false philosophy., Is it not a false statesmanship that undertakes to build up a system of policy upon the basis of caring nothing about the very thing that everybody does care the most about--a thing which all experience has shown we care a very great deal about?, The Judge alludes very often in the course of his remarks to the exclusive right which the States have to decide the whole thing for themselves., I agree with him very readily that the different States have that right., He is but fighting a man of straw when he assumes that I am contending against the right of the States to do as they please about it., Our controversy with him is in regard to the new Territories., We agree that when the States come in as States they have the right and the power to do as they please., We have no power as citizens of the free-States, or in our Federal capacity as members of the Federal Union through the General Government, to disturb slavery in the States where it exists., We profess constantly that we have no more inclination than belief in the power of the government to disturb it; yet we are driven constantly to defend ourselves from the assumption that we are warring upon the rights of the Sates., What I insist upon is, that the new Territories shall be kept free from it while in the Territorial condition., Judge Douglas assumes that we have no interest in them,--that we have no right whatever to interfere., I think we have some interest., I think that as white men we have., Do we not wish for an outlet for our surplus population, if I may so express myself?, Do we not feel an interest in getting to that outlet with such institutions as we would like to have prevail there?, If you go to the Territory opposed to slavery, and another man comes upon the same ground with his slave, upon the assumption that the things are equal, it turns out that he has the equal right all his way, and you have no part of it your way., If he goes in and makes it a slave Territory, and by consequence a slave State, is it not time that those who desire to have it a free State were on equal ground?, Let me suggest it in a different way., How many Democrats are there about here [""A thousand""] who have left slave States and come into the free State of Illinois to get rid of the institution of slavery?, [Another voice: ""A thousand and one.""], I reckon there are a thousand and one., I will ask you, if the policy you are now advocating had prevailed when this country was in a Territorial condition, where would you have gone to get rid of it?, Where would you have found your free State or Territory to go to?, And when hereafter, for any cause, the people in this place shall desire to find new homes, if they wish to be rid of the institution, where will they find the place to go to?, Now, irrespective of the moral aspect of this question as to whether there is a right or wrong in enslaving a negro, I am still in favor of our new Territories being in such a condition that white men may find a home,--may find some spot where they can better their condition; where they can settle upon new soil and better their condition in life., I am in favor of this, not merely (I must say it here as I have elsewhere) for our own people who are born amongst us, but as an outlet for free white people everywhere the world over--in which Hans, and Baptiste, and Patrick, and all other men from all the world, may find new homes and better their conditions in life., I have stated upon former occasions, and I may as well state again, what I understand to be the real issue in this controversy between Judge Douglas and myself., On the point of my wanting to make war between the free and the slave States, there has been no issue between us., So, too, when he assumes that I am in favor of producing a perfect social and political equality between the white and black races., These are false issues, upon which Judge Douglas has tried to force the controversy., There is no foundation in truth for the charge that I maintain either of these propositions., The real issue in this controversy--the one pressing upon every mind--is the sentiment on the part of one class that looks upon the institution of slavery as a wrong, and of another class that does not look upon it as a wrong., The sentiment that contemplates the institution of slavery in this country as a wrong is the sentiment of the Republican party., It is the sentiment around which all their actions, all their arguments, circle, from which all their propositions radiate., They look upon it as being a moral, social, and political wrong; and while they contemplate it as such, they nevertheless have due regard for its actual existence among us, and the difficulties of getting rid of it in any satisfactory way, and to all the constitutional obligations thrown about it., Yet, having a due regard for these, they desire a policy in regard to it that looks to its not creating any more danger., They insist that it should, as far as may be, be treated as a wrong; and one of the methods of treating it as a wrong is to make provision that it shall grow no larger., They also desire a policy that looks to a peaceful end of slavery at some time., These are the views they entertain in regard to it as I understand them; and all their sentiments, all their arguments and propositions, are brought within this range., I have said, and I repeat it here, that if there be a man amongst us who does not think that the institution of slavery is wrong in any one of the aspects of which I have spoken, he is misplaced, and ought not to be with us., And if there be a man amongst us who is so impatient of it as a wrong as to disregard its actual presence among us and the difficulty of getting rid of it suddenly in a satisfactory way, and to disregard the constitutional obligations thrown about it, that man is misplaced if he is on our platform., We disclaim sympathy with him in practical action., He is not placed properly with us., On this subject of treating it as a wrong, and limiting its spread, let me say a word., Has anything ever threatened the existence of this Union save and except this very institution of slavery?, What is it that we hold most dear amongst us?, Our own liberty and prosperity., What has ever threatened our liberty and prosperity, save and except this institution of slavery?, If this is true, how do you propose to improve the condition of things by enlarging slavery, by spreading it out and making it bigger?, You may have a wen or cancer upon your person, and not be able to cut it out, lest you bleed to death; but surely it is no way to cure it, to engraft it and spread it over your whole body., That is no proper way of treating what you regard a wrong., You see this peaceful way of dealing with it as a wrong, restricting the spread of it, and not allowing it to go into new countries where it has not already existed., That is the peaceful way, the old-fashioned way, the way in which the fathers themselves set us the example., On the other hand, I have said there is a sentiment which treats it as not being wrong., That is the Democratic sentiment of this day., I do not mean to say that every man who stands within that range positively asserts that it is right., That class will include all who positively assert that it is right, and all who, like Judge Douglas, treat it as indifferent and do not say it is either right or wrong., These two classes of men fall within the general class of those who do not look upon it as a wrong., And if there be among you anybody who supposes that he, as a Democrat, can consider himself ""as much opposed to slavery as anybody,"" I would like to reason with him., You never treat it as a wrong., What other thing that you consider as a wrong do you deal with as you deal with that?, ...]"|3
45|"[But it cannot be made available to them without Congressional legislation., In the Judge's language, it is a ""barren right,"" which needs legislation before it can become efficient and valuable to the persons to whom it is guaranteed., And as the right is constitutional, I agree that the legislation shall be granted to it, and that not that we like the institution of slavery., We profess to have no taste for running and catching niggers, at least, I profess no taste for that job at all., Why then do I yield support to a Fugitive Slave law?, Because I do not understand that the Constitution, which guarantees that right, can be supported without it., And if I believed that the right to hold a slave in a Territory was equally fixed in the Constitution with the right to reclaim fugitives, I should be bound to give it the legislation necessary to support it., I say that no man can deny his obligation to give the necessary legislation to support slavery in a Territory, who believes it is a constitutional right to have it there., No man can, who does not give the Abolitionists an argument to deny the obligation enjoined by the Constitution to enact a Fugitive State law., Try it now., It is the strongest Abolition argument ever made., I say if that Dred Scott decision is correct, then the right to hold slaves in a Territory is equally a constitutional right with the right of a slaveholder to have his runaway returned., No one can show the distinction between them., The one is express, so that we cannot deny it., The other is construed to be in the Constitution, so that he who believes the decision to be correct believes in the right., And the man who argues that by unfriendly legislation, in spite of that constitutional right, slavery may be driven from the Territories, cannot avoid furnishing an argument by which Abolitionists may deny the obligation to return fugitives, and claim the power to pass laws unfriendly to the right of the slaveholder to reclaim his fugitive., I do not know how such an arguement may strike a popular assembly like this, but I defy anybody to go before a body of men whose minds are educated to estimating evidence and reasoning, and show that there is an iota of difference between the constitutional right to reclaim a fugitive and the constitutional right to hold a slave, in a Territory, provided this Dred Scott decision is correct, I defy any man to make an argument that will justify unfriendly legislation to deprive a slaveholder of his right to hold his slave in a Territory, that will not equally, in all its length, breadth, and thickness, furnish an argument for nullifying the Fugitive Slave law., Why, there is not such an Abolitionist in the nation as Douglas, after all!, such an Abolitionist in the nation as Douglas, after all!, Your letter introducing Mr. Faree was duly received., There was no opening to nominate him for Superintendent of Public Instruction, but through him Egypt made a most valuable contribution to the convention., I think it may be fairly said that he came off the lion of the day--or rather of the night., Can you not elect him to the Legislature?, It seems to me he would be hard to beat., What objection could be made to him?, What is your Senator Martin saying and doing?, What is Webb about?, Your letter enclosing the attack of the Times upon me was received this morning., Give yourself no concern about my voting against the supplies., Unless you are without faith that a lie can be successfully contradicted, there is not a word of truth in the charge, and I am just considering a little as to the best shape to put a contradiction in., Show this to whomever you please, but do not publish it in the paper., Yours of the 22nd, inclosing a draft of two hundred dollars, was duly received., I have paid it on the judgment, and herewith you have the receipt., I do not wish to say anything as to who shall be the Republican candidate for the Legislature in your district, further than that I have full confidence in Dr., Hull., Have you ever got in the way of consulting with McKinley in political matters?, He is true as steel, and his judgment is very good., The last I heard from him, he rather thought Weldon, of De Witt, was our best timber for representative, all things considered., But you there must settle it among yourselves., It may well puzzle older heads than yours to understand how, as the Dred Scott decision holds, Congress can authorize a Territorial Legislature to do everything else, and cannot authorize them to prohibit slavery., That is one of the things the court can decide, but can never give an intelligible reason for., In 1856 you gave me authority to draw on you for any sum not exceeding five hundred dollars., I see clearly that such a privilege would be more available now than it was then., I am aware that times are tighter now than they were then., Please write me at all events, and whether you can now do anything or not I shall continue grateful for the past., I write this to say that from the specimens of Douglas Democracy we occasionally see here from Madison, we learn that they are making very confident calculation of beating you and your friends for the lower house, in that county., They offer to bet upon it., Billings and Job, respectively, have been up here, and were each as I learn, talking largely about it., If they do so, it can only be done by carrying the Fillmore men of 1856 very differently from what they seem to [be] going in the other party., Below is the vote of 1856, in your district:  By this you will see, if you go through the calculation, that if they get one quarter of the Fillmore votes, and you three quarters, they will beat you 125 votes., If they get one fifth, and you four fifths, you beat them 179., In Madison, alone, if our friends get 1000 of the Fillmore votes, and their opponents the remainder, 658, we win by just two votes., This shows the whole field, on the basis of the election of 1856., Whether, since then, any Buchanan, or Fremonters, have shifted ground, and how the majority of new votes will go, you can judge better than I., Of course you, on the ground, can better determine your line of tactics than any one off the ground; but it behooves you to be wide awake and actively working., Don't neglect it; and write me at your first leisure., Yours as ever, Your kind and interesting letter of the 19th was duly received., Your suggestions as to placing one's self on the offensive rather than the defensive are certainly correct., That is a point which I shall not disregard., I spoke here on Saturday night., The speech, not very well reported, appears in the State journal of this morning., You doubtless will see it; and I hope that you will perceive in it that I am already improving., I would mail you a copy now, but have not one [at] hand., I thank you for your letter and shall be pleased to hear from you again., Your doleful letter of the 8th was received on my return from Chicago last night., I do hope you are worse scared than hurt, though you ought to know best., We must not lose the district., We must make a job of it, and save it., Lay hold of the proper agencies, and secure all the Americans you can, at once., I do hope, on closer inspection, you will find they are not half gone., Make a little test., Run down one of the poll-books of the Edwardsville precinct, and take the first hundred known American names., Then quietly ascertain how many of them are actually going for Douglas., I think you will find less than fifty., But even if you find fifty, make sure of the other fifty, that is, make sure of all you can, at all events., We will set other agencies to work which shall compensate for the loss of a good many Americans., Don't fail to check the stampede at once., Trumbull, I think, will be with you before long., There is much he cannot do, and some he can., I have reason to hope there will be other help of an appropriate kind., Write me again., I have a letter from a very true and intelligent man insisting that there is a plan on foot in La Salle and Bureau to run Douglas Republicans for Congress and for the Legislature in those counties, if they can only get the encouragement of our folks nominating pretty extreme abolitionists., It is thought they will do nothing if our folks nominate men who are not very obnoxious to the charge of abolitionism., Please have your eye upon this., Signs are looking pretty fair., Since we parted last evening no new thought has occurred to [me] on the subject of which we talked most yesterday., I have concluded, however, to speak at your town on Tuesday, August 31st, and have promised to have it so appear in the papers of to-morrow., Judge Trumbull has not yet reached here., Yours of the 6th received., If life and health continue I shall pretty likely be at Augusta on the 25th., Things look reasonably well., Will tell you more fully when I see you., Yours of the 18th, signed as secretary of the Republican club, is received., In the matter of making speeches I am a good deal pressed by invitations from almost all quarters, and while I hope to be at Urbana some time during the canvass, I cannot yet say when., Can you not see me at Monticello on the 6th of September?, Douglas and I, for the first time this canvass, crossed swords here yesterday; the fire flew some, and I am glad to know I am yet alive., There was a vast concourse of people--more than could get near enough to hear., As I would not be a slave, so I would not be a master., This expresses my idea of democracy., Whatever differs from this, to the extent of the difference, is no democracy., ...]"|3
46|"[Perhaps I am wrong in saying that he is afraid, so I will correct myself by saying that he pretends to fear that the success of our party will result in the amalgamation of the blacks and whites., I think I can show plainly, from documents now before me, that Judge Douglas's fears are groundless., The census of 1800 tells us that in that year there were over four hundred thousand mulattoes in the United States., Now let us take what is called an Abolition State--the Republican, slavery-hating State of New Hampshire--and see how many mulattoes we can find within her borders., The number amounts to just one hundred and eighty-four., In the Old Dominion--in the Democratic and aristocratic State of Virginia--there were a few more mulattoes than the Census-takers found in New Hampshire., How many do you suppose there were?, Seventy-nine thousand, seven hundred and seventy-five--twenty-three thousand more than there were in all the free States!, In the slave States there were in 1800, three hundred and forty-eight thousand mulattoes all of home production; and in the free States there were less than sixty thousand mulattoes--and a large number of them were imported from the South., I have been requested to give a concise statement of the difference, as I understand it, between the Democratic and Republican parties, on the leading issues of the campaign., This question has been put to me by a gentleman whom I do not know., I do not even know whether he is a friend of mine or a supporter of Judge Douglas in this contest, nor does that make any difference., His question is a proper one., Lest I should forget it, I will give you my answer before proceeding with the line of argument I have marked out for this discussion., The difference between the Republican and the Democratic parties on the leading issues of this contest, as I understand it, is that the former consider slavery a moral, social and political wrong, while the latter do not consider it either a moral, a social or a political wrong; and the action of each, as respects the growth of the country and the expansion of our population, is squared to meet these views., I will not affirm that the Democratic party consider slavery morally, socially and politically right, though their tendency to that view has, in my opinion, been constant and unmistakable for the past five years., I prefer to take, as the accepted maxim of the party, the idea put forth by Judge Douglas, that he ""don't care whether slavery is voted down or voted up."", I am quite willing to believe that many Democrats would prefer that slavery should be always voted down, and I know that some prefer that it be always voted up; but I have a right to insist that their action, especially if it be their constant action, shall determine their ideas and preferences on this subject., Every measure of the Democratic party of late years, bearing directly or indirectly on the slavery question, has corresponded with this notion of utter indifference whether slavery or freedom shall outrun in the race of empire across to the Pacific--every measure, I say, up to the Dred Scott decision, where, it seems to me, the idea is boldly suggested that slavery is better than freedom., The Republican party, on the contrary, hold that this government was instituted to secure the blessings of freedom, and that slavery is an unqualified evil to the negro, to the white man, to the soil, and to the State., Regarding it as an evil, they will not molest it in the States where it exists, they will not overlook the constitutional guards which our fathers placed around it; they will do nothing that can give proper offence to those who hold slaves by legal sanction; but they will use every constitutional method to prevent the evil from becoming larger and involving more negroes, more white men, more soil, and more States in its deplorable consequences., They will, if possible, place it where the public mind shall rest in the belief that it is in course of ultimate peaceable extinction in God's own good time., And to this end they will, if possible, restore the government to the policy of the fathers, the policy of preserving the new Territories from the baneful influence of human bondage, as the Northwestern Territories were sought to be preserved by the Ordinance of 1787, and the Compromise Act of 1820., They will oppose, in all its length and breadth, the modern Democratic idea, that slavery is as good as freedom, and ought to have room for expansion all over the continent, if people can be found to carry it., All, or nearly all, of Judge Douglas's arguments are logical, if you admit that slavery is as good and as right as freedom, and not one of them is worth a rush if you deny it., This is the difference, as I understand it, between the Republican and Democratic parties., My friends, I have endeavored to show you the logical consequences of the Dred Scott decision, which holds that the people of a Territory cannot prevent the establishment of slavery in their midst., I have stated what cannot be gainsaid, that the grounds upon which this decision is made are equally applicable to the free States as to the free Territories, and that the peculiar reasons put forth by Judge Douglas for indorsing this decision commit him, in advance, to the next decision and to all other decisions corning from the same source., And when, by all these means, you have succeeded in dehumanizing the negro; when you have put him down and made it impossible for him to be but as the beasts of the field; when you have extinguished his soul in this world and placed him where the ray of hope is blown out as in the darkness of the damned, are you quite sure that the demon you have roused will not turn and rend you?, What constitutes the bulwark of our own liberty and independence?, It is not our frowning battlements, our bristling sea coasts, our army and our navy., These are not our reliance against tyranny All of those may be turned against us without making us weaker for the struggle., Our reliance is in the love of liberty which God has planted in us., Our defense is in the spirit which prizes liberty as the heritage of all men, in all lands everywhere., Destroy this spirit and you have planted the seeds of despotism at your own doors., Familiarize yourselves with the chains of bondage and you prepare your own limbs to wear them., Accustomed to trample on the rights of others, you have lost the genius of your own independence and become the fit subjects of the first cunning tyrant who rises among you., And let me tell you, that all these things are prepared for you by the teachings of history, if the elections shall promise that the next Dred Scott decision and all future decisions will be quietly acquiesced in by the people., A sweet plaintive song did I hear      And I fancied that she was the singer., May emotions as pure as that song set astir      Be the wont that the future shall bring her., I do not perceive how I can express myself more plainly than I have in the fore-going extracts., In four of them I have expressly disclaimed all intention to bring about social and political equality between the white and black races and in all the rest I have done the same thing by clear implication., I have made it equally plain that I think the negro is included in the word ""men"" used in the Declaration of Independence., I believe the declaration that ""all men are created equal"" is the great fundamental principle upon which our free institutions rest; that negro slavery is violative of that principle; but that, by our frame of government, that principle has not been made one of legal obligation; that by our frame of government, States which have slavery are to retain it, or surrender it at their own pleasure; and that all others--individuals, free States and national Government--are constitutionally bound to leave them alone about it., I believe our Government was thus framed because of the necessity springing from the actual presence of slavery, when it was framed., That such necessity does not exist in the Territories when slavery is not present., In his Mendenhall speech Mr. Clay says: ""Now as an abstract principle there is no doubt of the truth of that declaration (all men created equal), and it is desirable, in the original construction of society, to keep it in view as a great fundamental principle."", Again, in the same speech Mr. Clay says: ""If a state of nature existed and we were about to lay the foundations of society, no man would be more strongly opposed than I should to incorporate the institution of slavery among its elements."", Exactly so., In our new free Territories, a state of nature does exist., In them Congress lays the foundations of society; and in laying those foundations, I say, with Mr. Clay, it is desirable that the declaration of the equality of all men shall be kept in view as a great fundamental principle, and that Congress, which lays the foundations of society, should, like Mr. Clay, be strongly opposed to the incorporation of slavery and its elements., But it does not follow that social and political equality between whites and blacks must be incorporated because slavery must not., The declaration does not so require., -Since parting with you this morning I heard some things which make me believe that Edmunds and Morrill will spend this week among the National Democrats, trying to induce them to content themselves by voting for Jake Davis, and then to vote for the Douglas candidates for senator and representative., Have this headed off, if you can., Call Wagley's attention to it and have him and the National Democrat for Rep. to counteract it as far as they can., Yours of the 15th is just received., I wrote you the same day., As to the pecuniary matter, I am willing to pay according to my ability; but I am the poorest hand living to get others to pay., I have been on expenses so long without earning anything that I am absolutely without money now for even household purposes., Still, if you can put in two hundred and fifty dollars for me toward discharging the debt of the committee, I will allow it when you and I settle the private matter between us., This, with what I have already paid, and with an outstanding note of mine, will exceed my subscription of five hundred dollars., This, too, is exclusive of my ordinary expenses during the campaign, all of which, being added to my loss of time and business, bears pretty heavily upon one no better off in [this] world's goods than I; but as I had the post of honor, it is not for me to be over nice., You are feeling badly,--""And this too shall pass away,"" never fear., Yours of the 13th was received some days ago., The fight must go on., The cause of civil liberty must not be surrendered at the end of one or even one hundred defeats., Douglas had the ingenuity to be supported in the late contest both as the best means to break down and to uphold the slave interest., No ingenuity can keep these antagonistic elements in harmony long., Another explosion will soon come., I wish to preserve a set of the late debates (if they may be called so), between Douglas and myself., To enable me to do so, please get two copies of each number of your paper containing the whole, and send them to me by express; and I will pay you for the papers and for your trouble., I wish the two sets in order to lay one away in the [undecipherable word] and to put the other in a scrapbook., Remember, if part of any debate is on both sides of the sheet it will take two sets to make one scrap-book., I believe, according to a letter of yours to Hatch, you are ""feeling like h-ll yet."", Quit that--you will soon feel better., Another ""blow up"" is coming; and we shall have fun again., Douglas managed to be supported both as the best instrument to down and to uphold the slave power; but no ingenuity can long keep the antagonism in harmony., Being desirous of preserving in some permanent form the late joint discussion between Douglas and myself, ten days ago I wrote to Dr. Ray, requesting him to forward to me by express two sets of the numbers of the Tribune which contain the reports of those discussions., Up to date I have no word from him on the subject., Will you, if in your power, procure them and forward them to me by express?, If you will, I will pay all charges, and be greatly obliged, to boot., Hoping to visit you before long, I remain  Your very kind letter of Nov. 9th was duly received., I do not know that you expected or desired an answer; but glancing over the contents of yours again, I am prompted to say that, while I desired the result of the late canvass to have been different, I still regard it as an exceeding small matter., I think we have fairly entered upon a durable struggle as to whether this nation is to ultimately become all slave or all free, and though I fall early in the contest, it is nothing if I shall have contributed, in the least degree, to the final rightful result., I expect the result of the election went hard with you., So it did with me, too, perhaps not quite so hard as you may have supposed., I have an abiding faith that we shall beat them in the long run., Step by step the objects of the leaders will become too plain for the people to stand them., I write merely to let you know that I am neither dead nor dying., Please give my respects to your good family, and all inquiring friends., Legislation and adjudication must follow and conform to the progress of society., The progress of society now begins to produce cases of the transfer for debts of the entire property of railroad corporations; and to enable transferees to use and enjoy the transferred property, legislation and adjudication begin to be necessary., Shall this class of legislation just now beginning with us be general or special?, Section Ten of our Constitution requires that it should be general,  if possible., Special legislation always trenches upon the judicial department; and in so far violates Section Two of the Constitution., (Read it.), Just reasoning--policy--is in favor of general legislation--else the Legislature will be loaded down with the investigation of smaller cases--a work which the courts ought to perform, and can perform much more perfectly., How can the Legislature rightly decide the facts between P. & B. and S.C., It is said that under a general law, whenever a R. R. Co. gets tired of its debts, it may transfer fraudulently to get rid of them., ...]"|3
47|"[There are three substantial objections to this: First, no party can command respect which sustains this year what it opposed last., Secondly, Douglas (who is the most dangerous enemy of liberty, because the most insidious one) would have little support in the North, and by consequence, no capital to trade on in the South, if it were not for his friends thus magnifying him and his humbug., But lastly, and chiefly, Douglas's popular sovereignty, accepted by the public mind as a just principle, nationalizes slavery, and revives the African slave trade inevitably., Taking slaves into new Territories, and buying slaves in Africa, are identical things, identical rights or identical wrongs, and the argument which establishes one will establish the other., Try a thousand years for a sound reason why Congress shall not hinder the people of Kansas from having slaves, and, when you have found it, it will be an equally good one why Congress should not hinder the people of Georgia from importing slaves from Africa., As to Governor Chase, I have a kind side for him., He was one of the few distinguished men of the nation who gave us, in Illinois, their sympathy last year., I never saw him, but suppose him to be able and right-minded; but still he may not be the most suitable as a candidate for the Presidency., I must say I do not think myself fit for the Presidency., As you propose a correspondence with me, I shall look for your letters anxiously., I have not met Dr. Reynolds since receiving your letter; but when I shall, I will present your respects as requested., Yours of the 3d is just received., There is some mistake about my expected attendance of the U.S. Court in your city on the 3d Tuesday of this month., I have had no thought of being there., It is bad to be poor., I shall go to the wall for bread and meat if I neglect my business this year as well as last., It would please me much to see the city and good people of Keokuk, but for this year it is little less than an impossibility., I am constantly receiving invitations which I am compelled to decline., I was pressingly urged to go to Minnesota; and I now have two invitations to go to Ohio., These last are prompted by Douglas going there; and I am really tempted to make a flying trip to Columbus and Cincinnati., I do hope you will have no serious trouble in Iowa., What thinks Grimes about it?, I have not known him to be mistaken about an election in Iowa., Present my respects to Col. Carter, and any other friends, and believe me  I cannot fail to remember that I appear for the first time before an audience in this now great State,--an audience that is accustomed to hear such speakers as Corwin, and Chase, and Wade, and many other renowned men; and, remembering this, I feel that it will be well for you, as for me, that you should not raise your expectations to that standard to which you would have been justified in raising them had one of these distinguished men appeared before you., You would perhaps be only preparing a disappointment for yourselves, and, as a consequence of your disappointment, mortification to me., I hope, therefore, that you will commence with very moderate expectations; and perhaps, if you will give me your attention, I shall be able to interest you to a moderate degree., Appearing here for the first time in my life, I have been somewhat embarrassed for a topic by way of introduction to my speech; but I have been relieved from that embarrassment by an introduction which the Ohio Statesman newspaper gave me this morning., In this paper I have read an article, in which, among other statements, I find the following:  I mention this now, at the opening of my remarks, for the purpose of making three comments upon it., The first I have already announced,--it furnishes me an introductory topic; the second is to show that the gentleman is mistaken; thirdly, to give him an opportunity to correct it., In the first place, in regard to this matter being a mistake., I have found that it is not entirely safe, when one is misrepresented under his very nose, to allow the misrepresentation to go uncontradicted., I therefore propose, here at the outset, not only to say that this is a misrepresentation, but to show conclusively that it is so; and you will bear with me while I read a couple of extracts from that very ""memorable"" debate with Judge Douglas last year, to which this newspaper refers., In the first pitched battle which Senator Douglas and myself had, at the town of Ottawa, I used the language which I will now read., Having been previously reading an extract, I continued as follows:  ""Now, gentlemen, I don't want to read at any greater length, but this is the true complexion of all I have ever said in regard to the institution of slavery and the black race., This is the whole of it; and anything that argues me into his idea of perfect social and political equality with the negro, is but a specious and fantastic arrangement of words, by which a man can prove a horse-chestnut to be a chestnut horse., I will say here, while upon this subject, that I have no purpose directly or indirectly to interfere with the institution of slavery in the States where it exists., I believe I have no lawful right to do so, and I have no inclination to do so., I have no purpose to introduce political and social equality between the white and the black races., There is a physical difference between the two which, in my judgment, will probably forbid their ever living together upon the footing of perfect equality; and inasmuch as it becomes a necessity that there must be a difference, I, as well as Judge Douglas, am in favor of the race to which I belong having the superior position., I have never said anything to the contrary, but I hold that, notwithstanding all this, there is no reason in the world why the negro is not entitled to all the natural rights enumerated in the Declaration of Independence,--the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness., I hold that he is as much entitled to these as the white man., I agree with judge Douglas, he is not my equal in many respects,--certainly not in color, perhaps not in moral or intellectual endowments., But in the right to eat the bread, without leave of anybody else, which his own hand earns, he is my equal, and the equal of Judge Douglas, and the equal of every living man."", Upon a subsequent occasion, when the reason for making a statement like this occurred, I said:  ""While I was at the hotel to-day an elderly gentleman called upon me to know whether I was really in favor of producing perfect equality between the negroes and white people., While I had not proposed to myself on this occasion to say much on that subject, yet, as the question was asked me, I thought I would occupy perhaps five minutes in saying something in regard to it., I will say, then, that I am not, nor ever have been, in favor of bringing about in any way the social and political equality of the white and black races; that I am not, nor ever have been, in favor of making voters or jurors of negroes, nor of qualifying them to hold office, or intermarry with the white people; and I will say in addition to this that there is a physical difference between the white and black races which I believe will forever forbid the two races living together on terms of social and political equality., And inasmuch as they can not so live, while they do remain together there must be the position of superior and inferior, and I, as much as any other man, am in favor of having the superior position assigned to the white race., I say upon this occasion I do not perceive that because the white man is to have the superior position, the negro should be denied everything., I do not understand that because I do not want a negro woman for a slave, I must necessarily want her for a wife., My understanding is that I can just let her alone., I am now in my fiftieth year, and I certainly never have had a black woman for either a slave or a wife., So it seems to me quite possible for us to get along without making either slaves or wives of negroes., I will add to this that I have never seen, to my knowledge, a man, woman, or child, who was in favor of producing perfect equality, social and political, between negroes and white men., I recollect of but one distinguished instance that I ever heard of so frequently as to be satisfied of its correctness, and that is the case of Judge Douglas's old friend Colonel Richard M. Johnson., I will also add to the remarks I have made (for I am not going to enter at large upon this subject), that I have never had the least apprehension that I or my friends would marry negroes, if there was no law to keep them from it; but as judge Douglas and his friends seem to be in great apprehension that they might, if there were no law to keep them from it, I give him the most solemn pledge that I will to the very last stand by the law of the State which forbids the marrying of white people with negroes."", There, my friends, you have briefly what I have, upon former occasions, said upon this subject to which this newspaper, to the extent of its ability, has drawn the public attention., In it you not only perceive, as a probability, that in that contest I did not at any time say I was in favor of negro suffrage, but the absolute proof that twice--once substantially, and once expressly--I declared against it., Having shown you this, there remains but a word of comment upon that newspaper article., It is this, that I presume the editor of that paper is an honest and truth-loving man, and that he will be greatly obliged to me for furnishing him thus early an opportunity to correct the misrepresentation he has made, before it has run so long that malicious people can call him a liar., The Giant himself has been here recently., I have seen a brief report of his speech., If it were otherwise unpleasant to me to introduce the subject of the negro as a topic for discussion, I might be somewhat relieved by the fact that he dealt exclusively in that subject while he was here., I shall, therefore, without much hesitation or diffidence, enter upon this subject., The American people, on the first day of January, 1854, found the African slave trade prohibited by a law of Congress., In a majority of the States of this Union, they found African slavery, or any other sort of slavery, prohibited by State constitutions., They also found a law existing, supposed to be valid, by which slavery was excluded from almost all the territory the United States then owned., This was the condition of the country, with reference to the institution of slavery, on the first of January, 1854., A few days after that, a bill was introduced into Congress, which ran through its regular course in the two branches of the national legislature, and finally passed into a law in the month of May, by which the Act of Congress prohibiting slavery from going into the Territories of the United States was repealed., In connection with the law itself, and, in fact, in the terms of the law, the then existing prohibition was not only repealed, but there was a declaration of a purpose on the part of Congress never thereafter to exercise any power that they might have, real or supposed, to prohibit the extension or spread of slavery., This was a very great change; for the law thus repealed was of more than thirty years' standing., Following rapidly upon the heels of this action of Congress, a decision of the Supreme Court is made, by which it is declared that Congress, if it desires to prohibit the spread of slavery into the Territories, has no constitutional power to do so., Not only so, but that decision lays down principles which, if pushed to their logical conclusion,--I say pushed to their logical conclusion,--would decide that the constitutions of free States, forbidding slavery, are themselves unconstitutional., Mark me, I do not say the judges said this, and let no man say I affirm the judges used these words; but I only say it is my opinion that what they did say, if pressed to its logical conclusion, will inevitably result thus., Looking at these things, the Republican party, as I understand its principles and policy, believes that there is great danger of the institution of slavery being spread out and extended until it is ultimately made alike lawful in all the States of this Union; so believing, to prevent that incidental and ultimate consummation is the original and chief purpose of the Republican organization., I say ""chief purpose"" of the Republican organization; for it is certainly true that if the National House shall fall into the hands of the Republicans, they will have to attend to all the other matters of national house-keeping, as well as this., The chief and real purpose of the Republican party is eminently conservative., It proposes nothing save and except to restore this government to its original tone in regard to this element of slavery, and there to maintain it, looking for no further change in reference to it than that which the original framers of the Government themselves expected and looked forward to., The chief danger to this purpose of the Republican party is not just now the revival of the African slave trade, or the passage of a Congressional slave code, or the declaring of a second Dred Scott decision, making slavery lawful in all the States., These are not pressing us just now., They are not quite ready yet., The authors of these measures know that we are too strong for them; but they will be upon us in due time, and we will be grappling with them hand to hand, if they are not now headed off., They are not now the chief danger to the purpose of the Republican organization; but the most imminent danger that now threatens that purpose is that insidious Douglas popular sovereignty., This is the miner and sapper., While it does not propose to revive the African slave trade, nor to pass a slave code, nor to make a second Dred Scott decision, it is preparing us for the onslaught and charge of these ultimate enemies when they shall be ready to come on, and the word of command for them to advance shall be given., I say this ""Douglas popular sovereignty""; for there is a broad distinction, as I now understand it, between that article and a genuine popular sovereignty., I believe there is a genuine popular sovereignty., I think a definition of ""genuine popular sovereignty,"" in the abstract, would be about this: That each man shall do precisely as he pleases with himself, and with all those things which exclusively concern him., Applied to government, this principle would be, that a general government shall do all those things which pertain to it, and all the local governments shall do precisely as they please in respect to those matters which exclusively concern them., I understand that this government of the United States, under which we live, is based upon this principle; and I am misunderstood if it is supposed that I have any war to make upon that principle., Now, what is judge Douglas's popular sovereignty?, It is, as a principle, no other than that if one man chooses to make a slave of another man neither that other man nor anybody else has a right to object., Applied in government, as he seeks to apply it, it is this: If, in a new Territory into which a few people are beginning to enter for the purpose of making their homes, they choose to either exclude slavery from their limits or to establish it there, however one or the other may affect the persons to be enslaved, or the infinitely greater number of persons who are afterwards to inhabit that Territory, or the other members of the families of communities, of which they are but an incipient member, or the general head of the family of States as parent of all, however their action may affect one or the other of these, there is no power or right to interfere., That is Douglas's popular sovereignty applied., He has a good deal of trouble with popular sovereignty., His explanations explanatory of explanations explained are interminable., The most lengthy, and, as I suppose, the most maturely considered of this long series of explanations is his great essay in Harper's Magazine., I will not attempt to enter on any very thorough investigation of his argument as there made and presented., I will nevertheless occupy a good portion of your time here in drawing your attention to certain points in it., Such of you as may have read this document will have perceived that the judge early in the document quotes from two persons as belonging to the Republican party, without naming them, but who can readily be recognized as being Governor Seward of New York and myself., It is true that exactly fifteen months ago this day, I believe, I for the first time expressed a sentiment upon this subject, and in such a manner that it should get into print, that the public might see it beyond the circle of my hearers; and my expression of it at that time is the quotation that Judge Douglas makes., ...]"|3
48|"[When it does pertain to them, is when they are sufficient to be formed into an organized political community, and he fixes the minimum for that at ten thousand, and the maximum at twenty thousand., Now, I would like to know what is to be done with the nine thousand?, Are they all to be treated, until they are large enough to be organized into a political community, as wanderers upon the public land, in violation of law?, And if so treated and driven out, at what point of time would there ever be ten thousand?, If they were not driven out, but remained there as trespassers upon the public land in violation of the law, can they establish slavery there?, No; the judge says popular sovereignty don't pertain to them then., Can they exclude it then?, No; popular sovereignty don't pertain to them then., I would like to know, in the case covered by the essay, what condition the people of the Territory are in before they reach the number of ten thousand?, But the main point I wish to ask attention to is, that the question as to when they shall have reached a sufficient number to be formed into a regular organized community is to be decided ""by Congress."", Judge Douglas says so., Well, gentlemen, that is about all we want., No, that is all the Southerners want., That is what all those who are for slavery want., They do not want Congress to prohibit slavery from coming into the new Territories, and they do not want popular sovereignty to hinder it; and as Congress is to say when they are ready to be organized, all that the South has to do is to get Congress to hold off., Let Congress hold off until they are ready to be admitted as a State, and the South has all it wants in taking slavery into and planting it in all the Territories that we now have or hereafter may have., In a word, the whole thing, at a dash of the pen, is at last put in the power of Congress; for if they do not have this popular sovereignty until Congress organizes them, I ask if it at last does not come from Congress?, If, at last, it amounts to anything at all, Congress gives it to them., I submit this rather for your reflection than for comment., After all that is said, at last, by a dash of the pen, everything that has gone before is undone, and he puts the whole question under the control of Congress., After fighting through more than three hours, if you undertake to read it, he at last places the whole matter under the control of that power which he has been contending against, and arrives at a result directly contrary to what he had been laboring to do., He at last leaves the whole matter to the control of Congress., There are two main objects, as I understand it, of this Harper's Magazine essay., One was to show, if possible, that the men of our Revolutionary times were in favor of his popular sovereignty, and the other was to show that the Dred Scott decision had not entirely squelched out this popular sovereignty., I do not propose, in regard to this argument drawn from the history of former times, to enter into a detailed examination of the historical statements he has made., I have the impression that they are inaccurate in a great many instances,--sometimes in positive statement, but very much more inaccurate by the suppression of statements that really belong to the history., But I do not propose to affirm that this is so to any very great extent, or to enter into a very minute examination of his historical statements., I avoid doing so upon this principle,--that if it were important for me to pass out of this lot in the least period of time possible, and I came to that fence, and saw by a calculation of my known strength and agility that I could clear it at a bound, it would be folly for me to stop and consider whether I could or not crawl through a crack., So I say of the whole history contained in his essay where he endeavored to link the men of the Revolution to popular sovereignty., It only requires an effort to leap out of it, a single bound to be entirely successful., If you read it over, you will find that he quotes here and there from documents of the Revolutionary times, tending to show that the people of the colonies were desirous of regulating their own concerns in their own way, that the British Government should not interfere; that at one time they struggled with the British Government to be permitted to exclude the African slave trade,--if not directly, to be permitted to exclude it indirectly, by taxation sufficient to discourage and destroy it., From these and many things of this sort, judge Douglas argues that they were in favor of the people of our own Territories excluding slavery if they wanted to, or planting it there if they wanted to, doing just as they pleased from the time they settled upon the Territory., Now, however his history may apply and whatever of his argument there may be that is sound and accurate or unsound and inaccurate, if we can find out what these men did themselves do upon this very question of slavery in the Territories, does it not end the whole thing?, If, after all this labor and effort to show that the men of the Revolution were in favor of his popular sovereignty and his mode of dealing with slavery in the Territories, we can show that these very men took hold of that subject, and dealt with it, we can see for ourselves how they dealt with it., It is not a matter of argument or inference, but we know what they thought about it., It is precisely upon that part of the history of the country that one important omission is made by Judge Douglas., He selects parts of the history of the United States upon the subject of slavery, and treats it as the whole, omitting from his historical sketch the legislation of Congress in regard to the admission of Missouri, by which the Missouri Compromise was established and slavery excluded from a country half as large as the present United States., All this is left out of his history, and in nowise alluded to by him, so far as I can remember, save once, when he makes a remark, that upon his principle the Supreme Court were authorized to pronounce a decision that the act called the Missouri Compromise was unconstitutional., All that history has been left out., But this part of the history of the country was not made by the men of the Revolution., There was another part of our political history, made by the very men who were the actors in the Revolution, which has taken the name of the Ordinance of '87., Let me bring that history to your attention., In 1784, I believe, this same Mr. Jefferson drew up an ordinance for the government of the country upon which we now stand, or, rather, a frame or draft of an ordinance for the government of this country, here in Ohio, our neighbors in Indiana, us who live in Illinois, our neighbors in Wisconsin and Michigan., In that ordinance, drawn up not only for the government of that Territory, but for the Territories south of the Ohio River, Mr. Jefferson expressly provided for the prohibition of slavery., Judge Douglas says, and perhaps is right, that that provision was lost from that ordinance., I believe that is true., When the vote was taken upon it, a majority of all present in the Congress of the Confederation voted for it; but there were so many absentees that those voting for it did not make the clear majority necessary, and it was lost., But three years after that, the Congress of the Confederation were together again, and they adopted a new ordinance for the government of this Northwest Territory, not contemplating territory south of the river, for the States owning that territory had hitherto refrained from giving it to the General Government; hence they made the ordinance to apply only to what the Government owned., In fact, the provision excluding slavery was inserted aside, passed unanimously, or at any rate it passed and became a part of the law of the land., Under that ordinance we live., First here in Ohio you were a Territory; then an enabling act was passed, authorizing you to form a constitution and State Government, provided it was republican and not in conflict with the Ordinance of '87., When you framed your constitution and presented it for admission, I think you will find the legislation upon the subject will show that, whereas you had formed a constitution that was republican, and not in conflict with the Ordinance of '87, therefore you were admitted upon equal footing with the original States., The same process in a few years was gone through with in Indiana, and so with Illinois, and the same substantially with Michigan and Wisconsin., Not only did that Ordinance prevail, but it was constantly looked to whenever a step was taken by a new Territory to become a State., Congress always turned their attention to it, and in all their movements upon this subject they traced their course by that Ordinance of '87., When they admitted new States, they advertised them of this Ordinance, as a part of the legislation of the country., They did so because they had traced the Ordinance of '87 throughout the history of this country., Begin with the men of the Revolution, and go down for sixty entire years, and until the last scrap of that Territory comes into the Union in the form of the State of Wisconsin, everything was made to conform with the Ordinance of '87, excluding slavery from that vast extent of country., I omitted to mention in the right place that the Constitution of the United States was in process of being framed when that Ordinance was made by the Congress of the Confederation; and one of the first Acts of Congress itself, under the new Constitution itself, was to give force to that Ordinance by putting power to carry it out in the hands of the new officers under the Constitution, in the place of the old ones, who had been legislated out of existence by the change in the Government from the Confederation to the Constitution., Not only so, but I believe Indiana once or twice, if not Ohio, petitioned the General Government for the privilege of suspending that provision and allowing them to have slaves., A report made by Mr. Randolph, of Virginia, himself a slaveholder, was directly against it, and the action was to refuse them the privilege of violating the Ordinance of '87., This period of history, which I have run over briefly, is, I presume, as familiar to most of this assembly as any other part of the history of our country., I suppose that few of my hearers are not as familiar with that part of history as I am, and I only mention it to recall your attention to it at this time., And hence I ask how extraordinary a thing it is that a man who has occupied a position upon the floor of the Senate of the United States, who is now in his third term, and who looks to see the government of this whole country fall into his own hands, pretending to give a truthful and accurate history o the slavery question in this country, should so entirely ignore the whole of that portion of our history--the most important of all., Is it not a most extraordinary spectacle that a man should stand up and ask for any confidence in his statements who sets out as he does with portions of history, calling upon the people to believe that it is a true and fair representation, when the leading part and controlling feature of the whole history is carefully suppressed?, But the mere leaving out is not the most remarkable feature of this most remarkable essay., His proposition is to establish that the leading men of the Revolution were for his great principle of nonintervention by the government in the question of slavery in the Territories, while history shows that they decided, in the cases actually brought before them, in exactly the contrary way, and he knows it., Not only did they so decide at that time, but they stuck to it during sixty years, through thick and thin, as long as there was one of the Revolutionary heroes upon the stage of political action., Through their whole course, from first to last, they clung to freedom., And now he asks the community to believe that the men of the Revolution were in favor of his great principle, when we have the naked history that they themselves dealt with this very subject matter of his principle, and utterly repudiated his principle, acting upon a precisely contrary ground., It is as impudent and absurd as if a prosecuting attorney should stand up before a jury and ask them to convict A as the murderer of B, while B was walking alive before them., I say, again, if judge Douglas asserts that the men of the Revolution acted upon principles by which, to be consistent with themselves, they ought to have adopted his popular sovereignty, then, upon a consideration of his own argument, he had a right to make you believe that they understood the principles of government, but misapplied them, that he has arisen to enlighten the world as to the just application of this principle., He has a right to try to persuade you that he understands their principles better than they did, and, therefore, he will apply them now, not as they did, but as they ought to have done., He has a right to go before the community and try to convince them of this, but he has no right to attempt to impose upon any one the belief that these men themselves approved of his great principle., There are two ways of establishing a proposition., One is by trying to demonstrate it upon reason, and the other is, to show that great men in former times have thought so and so, and thus to pass it by the weight of pure authority., Now, if Judge Douglas will demonstrate somehow that this is popular sovereignty,--the right of one man to make a slave of another, without any right in that other or any one else to object,--demonstrate it as Euclid demonstrated propositions,--there is no objection., But when he comes forward, seeking to carry a principle by bringing to it the authority of men who themselves utterly repudiate that principle, I ask that he shall not be permitted to do it., I see, in the judge's speech here, a short sentence in these words: ""Our fathers, when they formed this government under which we live, understood this question just as well, and even better than, we do now."", That is true; I stick to that., I will stand by Judge Douglas in that to the bitter end., And now, Judge Douglas, come and stand by me, and truthfully show how they acted, understanding it better than we do., All I ask of you, Judge Douglas, is to stick to the proposition that the men of the Revolution understood this subject better than we do now, and with that better understanding they acted better than you are trying to act now., I wish to say something now in regard to the Dred Scott decision, as dealt with by Judge Douglas., In that ""memorable debate"" between Judge Douglas and myself, last year, the judge thought fit to commence a process of catechising me, and at Freeport I answered his questions, and propounded some to him., Among others propounded to him was one that I have here now., The substance, as I remember it, is, ""Can the people of a United States Territory, under the Dred Scott decision, in any lawful way, against the wish of any citizen of the United States, exclude slavery from its limits, prior to the formation of a State constitution?"", He answered that they could lawfully exclude slavery from the United States Territories, notwithstanding the Dred Scot decision., There was something about that answer that has probably been a trouble to the judge ever since., The Dred Scott decision expressly gives every citizen of the United States a right to carry his slaves into the United States Territories., And now there was some inconsistency in saying that the decision was right, and saying, too, that the people of the Territory could lawfully drive slavery out again., When all the trash, the words, the collateral matter, was cleared away from it, all the chaff was fanned out of it, it was a bare absurdity,--no less than that a thing may be lawfully driven away from where it has a lawful right to be., Clear it of all the verbiage, and that is the naked truth of his proposition,--that a thing may be lawfully driven from the place where it has a lawful right to stay., Well, it was because the judge could n't help seeing this that he has had so much trouble with it; and what I want to ask your especial attention to, just now, is to remind you, if you have not noticed the fact, that the judge does not any longer say that the people can exclude slavery., He does not say so in the copyright essay; he did not say so in the speech that he made here; and, so far as I know, since his re-election to the Senate he has never said, as he did at Freeport, that the people of the Territories can exclude slavery., He desires that you, who wish the Territories to remain free, should believe that he stands by that position; but he does not say it himself., He escapes to some extent the absurd position I have stated, by changing his language entirely., What he says now is something different in language, and we will consider whether it is not different in sense too., It is now that the Dred Scott decision, or rather the Constitution under that decision, does not carry slavery into the Territories beyond the power of the people of the Territories to control it as other property., He does not say the people can drive it out, but they can control it as other property., ...]"|3
49|"[They will be ready for Jeff., Davis and Stephens and other leaders of that company to sound the bugle for the revival of the slave trade, for the second Dred Scott decision, for the flood of slavery to be poured over the free States, while we shall be here tied down and helpless and run over like sheep., It is to be a part and parcel of this same idea to say to men who want to adhere to the Democratic party, who have always belonged to that party, and are only looking about for some excuse to stick to it, but nevertheless hate slavery, that Douglas's popular sovereignty is as good a way as any to oppose slavery., They allow themselves to be persuaded easily, in accordance with their previous dispositions, into this belief, that it is about as good a way of opposing slavery as any, and we can do that without straining our old party ties or breaking up old political associations., We can do so without being called negro-worshipers., We can do that without being subjected to the jibes and sneers that are so readily thrown out in place of argument where no argument can be found., So let us stick to this popular sovereignty,--this insidious popular sovereignty., Now let me call your attention to one thing that has really happened, which shows this gradual and steady debauching of public opinion, this course of preparation for the revival of the slave trade, for the Territorial slave code, and the new Dred Scott decision that is to carry slavery into the Free States., Did you ever, five years ago, hear of anybody in the world saying that the negro had no share in the Declaration of National Independence; that it does not mean negroes at all; and when ""all men"" were spoken of, negroes were not included?, I am satisfied that five years ago that proposition was not put upon paper by any living being anywhere., I have been unable at any time to find a man in an audience who would declare that he had ever known of anybody saying so five years ago., But last year there was not a Douglas popular sovereign in Illinois who did not say it., Is there one in Ohio but declares his firm belief that the Declaration of Independence did not mean negroes at all?, I do not know how this is; I have not been here much; but I presume you are very much alike everywhere., Then I suppose that all now express the belief that the Declaration of Independence never did mean negroes., I call upon one of them to say that he said it five years ago., If you think that now, and did not think it then, the next thing that strikes me is to remark that there has been a change wrought in you,--and a very significant change it is, being no less than changing the negro, in your estimation, from the rank of a man to that of a brute., They are taking him down and placing him, when spoken of, among reptiles and crocodiles, as Judge Douglas himself expresses it., Is not this change wrought in your minds a very important change?, Public opinion in this country is everything., In a nation like ours, this popular sovereignty and squatter sovereignty have already wrought a change in the public mind to the extent I have stated., There is no man in this crowd who can contradict it., Now, if you are opposed to slavery honestly, as much as anybody, I ask you to note that fact, and the like of which is to follow, to be plastered on, layer after layer, until very soon you are prepared to deal with the negro every where as with the brute., If public sentiment has not been debauched already to this point, a new turn of the screw in that direction is all that is wanting; and this is constantly being done by the teachers of this insidious popular sovereignty., You need but one or two turns further, until your minds, now ripening under these teachings, will be ready for all these things, and you will receive and support, or submit to, the slave trade, revived with all its horrors, a slave code enforced in our Territories, and a new Dred Scott decision to bring slavery up into the very heart of the free North., This, I must say, is but carrying out those words prophetically spoken by Mr. Clay,--many, many years ago,--I believe more than thirty years, when he told an audience that if they would repress all tendencies to liberty and ultimate emancipation they must go back to the era of our independence, and muzzle the cannon which thundered its annual joyous return on the Fourth of July; they must blow out the moral lights around us; they must penetrate the human soul, and eradicate the love of liberty: but until they did these things, and others eloquently enumerated by him, they could not repress all tendencies to ultimate emancipation., I ask attention to the fact that in a pre-eminent degree these popular sovereigns are at this work: blowing out the moral lights around us; teaching that the negro is no longer a man, but a brute; that the Declaration has nothing to do with him; that he ranks with the crocodile and the reptile; that man, with body and soul, is a matter of dollars and cents., I suggest to this portion of the Ohio Republicans, or Democrats, if there be any present, the serious consideration of this fact that there is now going on among you a steady process of debauching public opinion on this subject., With this, my friends, I bid you adieu., This is the first time in my life that I have appeared before an audience in so great a city as this: I therefore--though I am no longer a young man--make this appearance under some degree of embarrassment., But I have found that when one is embarrassed, usually the shortest way to get through with it is to quit talking or thinking about it, and go at something else., I understand that you have had recently with you my very distinguished friend Judge Douglas, of Illinois; and I understand, without having had an opportunity (not greatly sought, to be sure) of seeing a report of the speech that he made here, that he did me the honor to mention my humble name., I suppose that he did so for the purpose of making some objection to some sentiment at some time expressed by me., I should expect, it is true, that judge Douglas had reminded you, or informed you, if you had never before heard it, that I had once in my life declared it as my opinion that this government cannot endure permanently, half slave and half free; that a house divided against itself cannot stand, and, as I had expressed it, I did not expect the house to fall, that I did not expect the Union to be dissolved, but that I did expect that it would cease to be divided, that it would become all one thing, or all the other; that either the opponents of slavery would arrest the further spread of it, and place it where the public mind would rest in the belief that it was in the course of ultimate extinction, or the friends of slavery will push it forward until it becomes alike lawful in all the States, old or new, free as well as slave., I did, fifteen months ago, express that opinion, and upon many occasions Judge Douglas has denounced it, and has greatly, intentionally or unintentionally, misrepresented my purpose in the expression of that opinion., I presume, without having seen a report of his speech, that he did so here., I presume that he alluded also to that opinion, in different language, having been expressed at a subsequent time by Governor Seward of New York, and that he took the two in a lump and denounced them; that he tried to point out that there was something couched in this opinion which led to the making of an entire uniformity of the local institutions of the various States of the Union, in utter disregard of the different States, which in their nature would seem to require a variety of institutions and a variety of laws, conforming to the differences in the nature of the different States., Not only so: I presume he insisted that this was a declaration of war between the free and slave States, that it was the sounding to the onset of continual war between the different States, the slave and free States., This charge, in this form, was made by Judge Douglas on, I believe, the 9th of July, 1858, in Chicago, in my hearing., On the next evening, I made some reply to it., I informed him that many of the inferences he drew from that expression of mine were altogether foreign to any purpose entertained by me, and in so far as he should ascribe these inferences to me, as my purpose, he was entirely mistaken; and in so far as he might argue that, whatever might be my purpose, actions conforming to my views would lead to these results, he might argue and establish if he could; but, so far as purposes were concerned, he was totally mistaken as to me., When I made that reply to him, I told him, on the question of declaring war between the different States of the Union, that I had not said that I did not expect any peace upon this question until slavery was exterminated; that I had only said I expected peace when that institution was put where the public mind should rest in the belief that it was in course of ultimate extinction; that I believed, from the organization of our government until a very recent period of time, the institution had been placed and continued upon such a basis; that we had had comparative peace upon that question through a portion of that period of time, only because the public mind rested in that belief in regard to it, and that when we returned to that position in relation to that matter, I supposed we should again have peace as we previously had., I assured him, as I now, assure you, that I neither then had, nor have, or ever had, any purpose in any way of interfering with the institution of slavery, where it exists., I believe we have no power, under the Constitution of the United States, or rather under the form of government under which we live, to interfere with the institution of slavery, or any other of the institutions of our sister States, be they free or slave States., I declared then, and I now re-declare, that I have as little inclination to interfere with the institution of slavery where it now exists, through the instrumentality of the General Government, or any other instrumentality, as I believe we have no power to do so., I accidentally used this expression: I had no purpose of entering into the slave States to disturb the institution of slavery., So, upon the first occasion that Judge Douglas got an opportunity to reply to me, he passed by the whole body of what I had said upon that subject, and seized upon the particular expression of mine that I had no purpose of entering into the slave States to disturb the institution of slavery., ""Oh, no,"" said he, ""he [Lincoln] won't enter into the slave States to disturb the institution of slavery, he is too prudent a man to do such a thing as that; he only means that he will go on to the line between the free and slave States, and shoot over at them., This is all he means to do., He means to do them all the harm he can, to disturb them all he can, in such a way as to keep his own hide in perfect safety."", Well, now, I did not think, at that time, that that was either a very dignified or very logical argument but so it was, I had to get along with it as well as I could., It has occurred to-me here to-night that if I ever do shoot over the line at the people on the other side of the line into a slave State, and purpose to do so, keeping my skin safe, that I have now about the best chance I shall ever have., I should not wonder if there are some Kentuckians about this audience--we are close to Kentucky; and whether that be so or not, we are on elevated ground, and, by speaking distinctly, I should not wonder if some of the Kentuckians would hear me on the other side of the river., For that reason I propose to address a portion of what I have to say to the Kentuckians., I say, then, in the first place, to the Kentuckians, that I am what they call, as I understand it, a ""Black Republican."", I think slavery is wrong, morally and politically., I desire that it should be no further spread in--these United States, and I should not object if it should gradually terminate in the whole Union., While I say this for myself, I say to you Kentuckians that I understand you differ radically with me upon this proposition; that you believe slavery is a good thing; that slavery is right; that it ought to be extended and perpetuated in this Union., Now, there being this broad difference between us, I do not pretend, in addressing myself to you Kentuckians, to attempt proselyting you; that would be a vain effort., I do not enter upon it., I only propose to try to show you that you ought to nominate for the next Presidency, at Charleston, my distinguished friend Judge Douglas., In all that there is a difference between you and him, I understand he is sincerely for you, and more wisely for you than you are for yourselves., I will try to demonstrate that proposition., Understand, now, I say that I believe he is as sincerely for you, and more wisely for you, than you are for yourselves., What do you want more than anything else to make successful your views of slavery,--to advance the outspread of it, and to secure and perpetuate the nationality of it?, What do you want more than anything else?, What--is needed absolutely?, What is indispensable to you?, Why, if I may, be allowed to answer the question, it is to retain a hold upon the North, it is to retain support and strength from the free States., If you can get this support and strength from the free States, you can succeed., If you do not get this support and this strength from the free States, you are in the minority, and you are beaten at once., If that proposition be admitted,--and it is undeniable,--then the next thing I say to you is, that Douglas, of all the men in this nation, is the only man that affords you any hold upon the free States; that no other man can give you any strength in the free States., This being so, if you doubt the other branch of the proposition, whether he is for you--whether he is really for you, as I have expressed it,--I propose asking your attention for a while to a few facts., The issue between you and me, understand, is, that I think slavery is wrong, and ought not to be outspread; and you think it is right, and ought to be extended and perpetuated., [A voice, ""Oh, Lord!""], That is my Kentuckian I am talking to now., I now proceed to try to show you that Douglas is as sincerely for you and more wisely for you than you are for yourselves., In the first place, we know that in a government like this, in a government of the people, where the voice of all the men of the country, substantially, enters into the execution--or administration, rather--of the government, in such a government, what lies at the bottom of all of it is public opinion., I lay down the proposition, that Judge Douglas is not only the man that promises you in advance a hold upon the North, and support in the North, but he constantly moulds public opinion to your ends; that in every possible way he can he constantly moulds the public opinion of the North to your ends; and if there are a few things in which he seems to be against you,--a few things which he says that appear to be against you, and a few that he forbears to say which you would like to have him say you ought to remember that the saying of the one, or the forbearing to say the other, would lose his hold upon the North, and, by consequence, would lose his capacity to serve you., Upon this subject of moulding public opinion I call your attention to the fact--for a well established fact it is--that the Judge never says your institution of slavery is wrong., There is not a public man in the United States, I believe, with the exception of Senator Douglas, who has not, at some time in his life, declared his opinion whether the thing is right or wrong; but Senator Douglas never declares it is wrong., He leaves himself at perfect liberty to do all in your favor which he would be hindered from doing if he were to declare the thing to be wrong., On the contrary, he takes all the chances that he has for inveigling the sentiment of the North, opposed to slavery, into your support, by never saying it is right., This you ought to set down to his credit: You ought to give him full credit for this much; little though it be, in comparison to the whole which he does for you., Some other, things I will ask your attention to., He said upon the floor of the United States Senate, and he has repeated it, as I understand, a great many times, that he does not care whether slavery is ""voted up or voted down."", This again shows you, or ought to show you, if you would reason upon it, that he does not believe it to be wrong; for a man may say when he sees nothing wrong in a thing; that he, dues not care whether it be voted up or voted down but no man can logically say that he cares not whether a thing goes up or goes down which to him appears to be wrong., You therefore have a demonstration in this that to Judge Douglas's mind your favorite institution, which you would have spread out and made perpetual, is no wrong., Another thing he tells you, in a speech made at Memphis in Tennessee, shortly after the canvass in Illinois, last year., He there distinctly told the people that there was a ""line drawn by the Almighty across this continent, on the one side of which the soil must always be cultivated by slaves""; that he did not pretend to know exactly where that line was, but that there was such a line., I want to ask your attention to that proposition again; that there is one portion of this continent where the Almighty has signed the soil shall always be cultivated by slaves; that its being cultivated by slaves at that place is right; that it has the direct sympathy and authority of the Almighty., Whenever you can get these Northern audiences to adopt the opinion that slavery is right on the other side of the Ohio, whenever you can get them, in pursuance of Douglas's views, to adopt that sentiment, they will very readily make the other argument, which is perfectly logical, that that which is right on that side of the Ohio cannot be wrong on this, and that if you have that property on that side of the Ohio, under the seal and stamp of the Almighty, when by any means it escapes over here it is wrong to have constitutions and laws ""to devil"" you about it., So Douglas is moulding the public opinion of the North, first to say that the thing is right in your State over the Ohio River, and hence to say that that which is right there is not wrong here, and that all laws and constitutions here recognizing it as being wrong are themselves wrong, and ought to be repealed and abrogated., He will tell you, men of Ohio, that if you choose here to have laws against slavery, it is in conformity to the idea that your climate is not suited to it, that your climate is not suited to slave labor, and therefore you have constitutions and laws against it., Let us attend to that argument for a little while and see if it be sound., You do not raise sugar-cane (except the new-fashioned sugar-cane, and you won't raise that long), but they do raise it in Louisiana., You don't raise it in Ohio, because you can't raise it profitably, because the climate don't suit it., They do raise it in Louisiana, because there it is profitable., Now, Douglas will tell you that is precisely the slavery question: that they do have slaves there because they are profitable, and you don't have them here because they are not profitable., If that is so, then it leads to dealing with the one precisely as with the other., ...]"|3
50|"[There was nothing said in the Constitution in regard to the spread of slavery into the Territory., I grant that; but there was something very important said about it by the same generation of men in the adoption of the old Ordinance of '87, through the influence of which you here in Ohio, our neighbors in Indiana, we in Illinois, our neighbors in Michigan and Wisconsin, are happy, prosperous, teeming millions of free men., That generation of men, though not to the full extent members of the convention that framed the Constitution, were to some extent members of that convention, holding seats at the same time in one body and the other, so that if there was any compromise on either of these subjects, the strong evidence is that that compromise was in favor of the restriction of slavery from the new Territories., But Douglas says that he is unalterably opposed to the repeal of those laws because, in his view, it is a compromise of the Constitution., You Kentuckians, no doubt, are somewhat offended with that., You ought not to be!, You ought to be patient!, You ought to know that if he said less than that, he would lose the power of ""lugging"" the Northern States to your support., Really, what you would push him to do would take from him his entire power to serve you., And you ought to remember how long, by precedent, Judge Douglas holds himself obliged to stick by compromises., You ought to remember that by the time you yourselves think you are ready to inaugurate measures for the revival of the African slave trade, that sufficient time will have arrived, by precedent, for Judge Douglas to break through, that compromise., He says now nothing more strong than he said in 1849 when he declared in favor of Missouri Compromise,--and precisely four years and a quarter after he declared that Compromise to be a sacred thing, which ""no ruthless hand would ever daze to touch,"" he himself brought forward the measure ruthlessly to destroy it., By a mere calculation of time it will only be four years more until he is ready to take back his profession about the sacredness of the Compromise abolishing the slave trade., Precisely as soon as you are ready to have his services in that direction, by fair calculation, you may be sure of having them., But you remember and set down to Judge Douglas's debt, or discredit, that he, last year, said the people of Territories can, in spite of the Dred Scott decision, exclude your slaves from those Territories; that he declared, by ""unfriendly legislation"" the extension of your property into the new Territories may be cut off, in the teeth of the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States., He assumed that position at Freeport on the 27th of August, 1858., He said that the people of the Territories can exclude slavery, in so many words: You ought, however, to bear in mind that he has never said it since., You may hunt in every speech that he has since made, and he has never used that expression once., He has never seemed to notice that he is stating his views differently from what he did then; but by some sort of accident, he has always really stated it differently., He has always since then declared that ""the Constitution does not carry slavery into the Territories of the United States beyond the power of the people legally to control it, as other property."", Now, there is a difference in the language used upon that former occasion and in this latter day., There may or may not be a difference in the meaning, but it is worth while considering whether there is not also a difference in meaning., What is it to exclude?, Why, it is to drive it out., It is in some way to put it out of the Territory., It is to force it across the line, or change its character so that, as property, it is out of existence., But what is the controlling of it ""as other property""?, Is controlling it as other property the same thing as destroying it, or driving it away?, I should think not., I should think the controlling of it as other property would be just about what you in Kentucky should want., I understand the controlling of property means the controlling of it for the benefit of the owner of it., While I have no doubt the Supreme Court of the United States would say ""God speed"" to any of the Territorial Legislatures that should thus control slave property, they would sing quite a different tune if, by the pretence of controlling it, they were to undertake to pass laws which virtually excluded it,--and that upon a very well known principle to all lawyers, that what a Legislature cannot directly do, it cannot do by indirection; that as the Legislature has not the power to drive slaves out, they have no power, by indirection, by tax, or by imposing burdens in any way on that property, to effect the same end, and that any attempt to do so would be held by the Dred Scott court unconstitutional., Douglas is not willing to stand by his first proposition that they can exclude it, because we have seen that that proposition amounts to nothing more nor less than the naked absurdity that you may lawfully drive out that which has a lawful right to remain., He admitted at first that the slave might be lawfully taken into the Territories under the Constitution of the United States, and yet asserted that he might be lawfully driven out., That being the proposition, it is the absurdity I have stated., He is not willing to stand in the face of that direct, naked, and impudent absurdity; he has, therefore, modified his language into that of being ""controlled as other property."", The Kentuckians don't like this in Douglas!, I will tell you where it will go., He now swears by the court., He was once a leading man in Illinois to break down a court, because it had made a decision he did not like., But he now not only swears by the court, the courts having got to working for you, but he denounces all men that do not swear by the courts, as unpatriotic, as bad citizens., When one of these acts of unfriendly legislation shall impose such heavy burdens as to, in effect, destroy property in slaves in a Territory, and show plainly enough that there can be no mistake in the purpose of the Legislature to make them so burdensome, this same Supreme Court will decide that law to be unconstitutional, and he will be ready to say for your benefit ""I swear by the court; I give it up""; and while that is going on he has been getting all his men to swear by the courts, and to give it up with him., In this again he serves you faithfully, and, as I say, more wisely than you serve yourselves., Again: I have alluded in the beginning of these remarks to the fact that Judge Douglas has made great complaint of my having expressed the opinion that this government ""cannot endure permanently, half slave and half free."", He has complained of Seward for using different language, and declaring that there is an ""irrepressible conflict"" between the principles of free and slave labor., [A voice: ""He says it is not original with Seward., That it is original with Lincoln.""], I will attend to that immediately, sir., Since that time, Hickman of Pennsylvania expressed the same sentiment., He has never denounced Mr. Hickman: why?, There is a little chance, notwithstanding that opinion in the mouth of Hickman, that he may yet be a Douglas man., That is the difference!, It is not unpatriotic to hold that opinion if a man is a Douglas man., But neither I, nor Seward, nor Hickman is entitled to the enviable or unenviable distinction of having first expressed that idea., That same idea was expressed by the Richmond Enquirer, in Virginia, in 1856,--quite two years before it was expressed by the first of us., And while Douglas was pluming himself that in his conflict with my humble self, last year, he had ""squelched out"" that fatal heresy, as he delighted to call it, and had suggested that if he only had had a chance to be in New York and meet Seward he would have ""squelched"" it there also, it never occurred to him to breathe a word against Pryor., I don't think that you can discover that Douglas ever talked of going to Virginia to ""squelch"" out that idea there., No., More than that., That same Roger A. Pryor was brought to Washington City and made the editor of the par excellence Douglas paper, after making use of that expression, which, in us, is so unpatriotic and heretical., From all this, my Kentucky friends may see that this opinion is heretical in his view only when it is expressed by men suspected of a desire that the country shall all become free, and not when expressed by those fairly known to entertain the desire that the whole country shall become slave., When expressed by that class of men, it is in nowise offensive to him., In this again, my friends of Kentucky, you have Judge Douglas with you., There is another reason why you Southern people ought to nominate Douglas at your convention at Charleston., That reason is the wonderful capacity of the man,--the power he has of doing what would seem to be impossible., Let me call your attention to one of these apparently impossible things:  Douglas had three or four very distinguished men of the most extreme anti-slavery views of any men in the Republican party expressing their desire for his re-election to the Senate last year., That would, of itself, have seemed to be a little wonderful; but that wonder is heightened when we see that Wise of Virginia, a man exactly opposed to them, a man who believes in the divine right of slavery, was also expressing his desire that Douglas should be reelected; that another man that may be said to be kindred to Wise, Mr. Breckinridge, the Vice-President, and of your own State, was also agreeing with the anti-slavery men in the North that Douglas ought to be re-elected., Still to heighten the wonder, a senator from Kentucky, whom I have always loved with an affection as tender and endearing as I have ever loved any man, who was opposed to the anti-slavery men for reasons which seemed sufficient to him, and equally opposed to Wise and Breckinridge, was writing letters into Illinois to secure the reelection of Douglas., Now, that all these conflicting elements should be brought, while at daggers' points with one another, to support him, is a feat that is worthy for you to note and consider., It is quite probable that each of these classes of men thought, by the re-election of Douglas, their peculiar views would gain something: it is probable that the anti-slavery men thought their views would gain something; that Wise and Breckinridge thought so too, as regards their opinions; that Mr. Crittenden thought that his views would gain something, although he was opposed to both these other men., It is probable that each and all of them thought that they were using Douglas; and it is yet an unsolved problem whether he was not using them all., If he was, then it is for you to consider whether that power to perform wonders is one for you lightly to throw away., There is one other thing that I will say to you, in this relation., It is but my opinion, I give it to you without a fee., It is my opinion that it is for you to take him or be defeated; and that if you do take him you may be beaten., You will surely be beaten if you do not take him., We, the Republicans and others forming the opposition of the country, intend to ""stand by our guns,"" to be patient and firm, and in the long run to beat you, whether you take him or not., We know that before we fairly beat you we have to beat you both together., We know that you are ""all of a feather,"" and that we have to beat you all together, and we expect to do it., We don't intend to be very impatient about it., We mean to be as deliberate and calm about it as it is possible to be, but as firm and resolved as it is possible for men to be., When we do as we say,--beat you,--you perhaps want to know what we will do with you., I will tell you, so far as I am authorized to speak for the opposition, what we mean to do with you., We mean to treat you, as near as we possibly can, as Washington, Jefferson, and Madison treated you., We mean to leave you alone, and in no way interfere with your institution; to abide by all and every compromise of the Constitution, and, in a word, coming back to the original proposition, to treat you, so far as degenerated men (if we have degenerated) may, according to the examples of those noble fathers, Washington, Jefferson, and Madison., We mean to remember that you are as good as we; that there is no difference between us other than the difference of circumstances., We mean to recognize and bear in mind always that you have as good hearts in your bosoms as other people, or as we claim to have, and treat you accordingly., We mean to marry your girls when we have a chance, the white ones I mean; and I have the honor to inform you that I once did have a chance in that way., I have told you what we mean to do., I want to know, now, when that thing takes place, what do you mean to do?, I often hear it intimated that you mean to divide the Union whenever a Republican, or anything like it, is elected President of the United States., ""That is so,"" one of them says; I wonder if he is a Kentuckian?, Well, then, I  want to know what you are going to do with your half of it?, Are you going to split the Ohio down through, and push your half off a piece?, Or are you going to keep it right alongside of us outrageous fellows?, Or are you going to build up a wall some way between your country and ours, by which that movable property of yours can't come over here any more, to the danger of your losing it?, Do you think you can better yourselves, on that subject, by leaving us here under no obligation whatever to return those specimens of your movable property that come hither?, You have divided the Union because we would not do right with you, as you think, upon that subject; when we cease to be under obligations to do anything for you, how much better off do you think you will be?, Will you make war upon us and kill us all?, Why, gentlemen, I think you are as gallant and as brave men as live; that you can fight as bravely in a good cause, man for man, as any other people living; that you have shown yourselves capable of this upon various occasions: but, man for man, you are not better than we are, and there are not so many of you as there are of us., ...]"|3
51|"[Some men assume that there is necessary connection between capital and labor, and that connection draws within it the whole of the labor of the community., They assume that nobody works unless capital excites them to work., They begin next to consider what is the best way., They say there are but two ways: one is to hire men, and to allure them to labor by their consent; the other is to buy the men, and drive them, to it, and that is slavery., Having assumed that, they proceed to discuss the question of whether the laborers themselves are better off in the condition of slaves or of hired laborers, and they usually decide that they are better off in the condition of slaves., In the first place, I say that the whole thing is a mistake., That there is a certain relation between capital and labor, I admit., That it does exist, and rightfully exists, I think is true., That men who are industrious, and sober, and honest in the pursuit of their own interests should after a while accumulate capital, and after that should be allowed to enjoy it in peace, and also, if they should choose, when they have accumulated it, to use it to save themselves from actual labor, and hire other people to labor for them, is right., In doing so they do not wrong the man they employ, for they find men who have not of their own land to work upon, or shops to work in, and who are benefited by working for others, hired laborers, receiving their capital for it., Thus a few men, that own capital, hire a few others, and these establish the relation of capital and labor rightfully, a relation of which I make no complaint., But I insist that that relation, after all, does not embrace more than one eighth of the labor of the country., I have taken upon myself in the name of some of you to say that we expect upon these principles to ultimately beat them., In order to do so, I think we want and must have a national policy in regard to the institution of slavery that acknowledges and deals with that institution as being wrong., Whoever desires the prevention of the spread of slavery and the nationalization of that institution yields all when he yields to any policy that either recognizes slavery as being right or as being an indifferent thing., Nothing will make you successful but setting up a policy which shall treat the thing as being wrong: When I say this, I do not mean to say that this General Government is charged with the duty of redressing or preventing all the wrongs in the world, but I do think that it is charged with preventing and redressing all wrongs which are wrongs to itself., This Government is expressly charged with the duty of providing for the general welfare., We believe that the spreading out and perpetuity of the institution of slavery impairs the general welfare., We believe--nay, we know--that that is the only thing that has ever threatened the perpetuity of the Union itself., The only thing which has ever menaced the destruction of the government under which we live is this very thing., To repress this thing, we think, is, Providing for the general welfare., Our friends in Kentucky differ from us., We need not make our argument for them, but we who think it is wrong in all its relations, or in some of them at least, must decide as to our own actions and our own course, upon our own judgment., I say that we must not interfere with the institution of slavery in the States where it exists, because the Constitution forbids it, and the general welfare does not require us to do so., We must not withhold an efficient Fugitive Slave law, because the Constitution requires us, as I understand it, not to withhold such a law., But we must prevent the outspreading of the institution, because neither the Constitution nor general welfare requires us to extend it., We must prevent the revival of the African slave trade, and the enacting by Congress of a Territorial slave code., We must prevent each of these things being done by either Congresses or courts., The people of these United States are the rightful masters of both Congresses and courts, not to overthrow the Constitution, but to overthrow the men who pervert the Constitution., To do these things we must employ instrumentalities., We must hold conventions; we must adopt platforms, if we conform to ordinary custom; we must nominate candidates; and we must carry elections., In all these things, I think that we ought to keep in view our real purpose, and in none do anything that stands adverse to our purpose., If we shall adopt a platform that fails to recognize or express our purpose, or elect a man that declares himself inimical to our purpose, we not only take nothing by our success, but we tacitly admit that we act upon no other principle than a desire to have ""the loaves and fishes,"" by which, in the end, our apparent success is really an injury to us., I know that this is very desirable with me, as with everybody else, that all the elements of the opposition shall unite in the next Presidential election and in all future time., I am anxious that that should be; but there are things seriously to be considered in relation to that matter., If the terms can be arranged, I am in favor of the union., But suppose we shall take up some man, and put him upon one end or the other of the ticket, who declares himself against us in regard to the prevention of the spread of slavery, who turns up his nose and says he is tired of hearing anything more about it, who is more against us than against the enemy, what will be the issue?, Why, he will get no slave States, after all,--he has tried that already until being beat is the rule for him., If we nominate him upon that ground, he will not carry a slave State; and not only so, but that portion of our men who are high-strung upon the principle we really fight for will not go for him, and he won't get a single electoral vote anywhere, except, perhaps, in the State of Maryland., There is no use in saying to us that we are stubborn and obstinate because we won't do some such thing as this., We cannot do it., We cannot get our men to vote it., I speak by the card, that we cannot give the State of Illinois in such case by fifty thousand., We would be flatter down than the ""Negro Democracy"" themselves have the heart to wish to see us., After saying this much let me say a little on the other side., There are plenty of men in the slave States that are altogether good enough for me to be either President or Vice-President, provided they will profess their sympathy with our purpose, and will place themselves on the ground that our men, upon principle, can vote for them., There are scores of them, good men in their character for intelligence and talent and integrity., If such a one will place himself upon the right ground, I am for his occupying one place upon the next Republican or opposition ticket., I will heartily go for him., But unless he does so place himself, I think it a matter of perfect nonsense to attempt to bring about a union upon any other basis; that if a union be made, the elements will scatter so that there can be no success for such a ticket, nor anything like success., The good old maxims of the Bible axe applicable, and truly applicable, to human affairs, and in this, as in other things, we may say here that he who is not for us is against us; he who gathereth not with us, scattereth., I should be glad to have some of the many good and able and noble men of the South to place themselves where we can confer upon them the high honor of an election upon one or the other end of our ticket., It would do my soul good to do that thing., It would enable us to teach them that, inasmuch as we select one of their own number to carry out our principles, we are free from the charge that we mean more than we say., But, my friends, I have detained you much longer than I expected to do., I believe I may do myself the compliment to say that you have stayed and heard me with great patience, for which I return you my most sincere thanks., I am here just now attending court., Yesterday, before I left Springfield, your brother, Dr. William S. Wallace, showed me a letter of yours, in which you kindly mention my name, inquiring for my tariff views, and suggest the propriety of my writing a letter upon the subject., I was an old Henry-Clay-Tariff Whig., In old times I made more speeches on that subject than any other., I have not since changed my views., I believe yet, if we could have a moderate, carefully adjusted protective tariff, so far acquiesced in as not to be a perpetual subject of political strife, squabbles changes, and uncertainties, it would be better for us., Still it is my opinion that just now the revival of that question will not advance the cause itself, or the man who revives it., I have not thought much on the subject recently, but my general impression is that the necessity for a protective tariff will ere long force its old opponents to take it up; and then its old friends can join in and establish it on a more firm and durable basis., We, the Old Whigs, have been entirely beaten out on the tariff question, and we shall not be able to re-establish the policy until the absence of it shall have demonstrated the necessity for it in the minds of men heretofore opposed to it., With this view, I should prefer to not now write a public letter on the subject., I therefore wish this to be considered confidential., I shall be very glad to receive a letter from you., Yours of October 27 is received., When a mortgage is given to secure two notes, and one of the notes is sold and assigned, if the mortgaged premises are only sufficient to pay one note, the one assigned will take it all., Also, an execution from a judgment on the assigned note may take it all; it being the same thing in substance., There is redemption on execution sales from the United States Court just as from any other court., You did not mention the name of the plaintiff or defendant in the suit, and so I can tell nothing about it as to sales, bids, etc., Write again., But you Democrats are for the Union; and you greatly fear the success of the Republicans would destroy the Union., Why?, Do the Republicans declare against the Union?, Nothing like it., Your own statement of it is that if the Black Republicans elect a President, you ""won't stand it."", You will break up the Union., If we shall constitutionally elect a President, it will be our duty to see that you submit., Old John Brown has been executed for treason against a State., We cannot object, even though he agreed with us in thinking slavery wrong., That cannot excuse violence, bloodshed and treason., It could avail him nothing that he might think himself right., So, if we constitutionally elect a President, and therefore you undertake to destroy the Union, it will be our duty to deal with you as old John Brown has been dealt with., We shall try to do our duty., We hope and believe that in no section will a majority so act as to render such extreme measures necessary., Your favor of the 12th is at hand, and it gives me pleasure to be able to answer it., It is not my intention to take part in any of the rivalries for the gubernatorial nomination; but the fear of being misunderstood upon that subject ought not to deter me from doing justice to Mr. Judd, and preventing a wrong being done to him by the use of nay name in connection with alleged wrongs to me., In answer to your first question, as to whether Mr. Judd was guilty of any unfairness to me at the time of Senator Trumbull's election, I answer unhesitatingly in the negative; Mr. Judd owed no political allegiance to any party whose candidate I was., He was in the Senate, holding over, having been elected by a Democratic Constituency., He never was in any caucus of the friends who sought to make me U. S. Senator, never gave me any promises or pledges to support me, and subsequent events have greatly tended to prove the wisdom, politically, of Mr. Judd's course., The election of Judge Trumbull strongly tended to sustain and preserve the position of that lion of the Democrats who condemned the repeal of the Missouri Compromise, and left them in a position of joining with us in forming the Republican party, as was done at the Bloomington convention in 1856., During the canvass of 1858 for the senatorship my belief was, and still is, that I had no more sincere and faithful friend than Mr. Judd--certainly none whom I trusted more., His position as chairman of the State Central Committee led to my greater intercourse with him, and to my giving him a larger share of my confidence, than with or to almost any other friend; and I have never suspected that that confidence was, to any degree, misplaced., My relations with Mr. Judo since the organization of the Republican party, in, our State, in 1856, and especially since the adjournment of the Legislature in Feb., 1857, have been so very intimate that I deem it an impossibility that he could have been dealing treacherously with me., He has also, at all times, appeared equally true and faithful to the party., In his position as chairman of the committee, I believe he did all that any man could have done., The best of us are liable to commit errors, which become apparent by subsequent developments; but I do not know of a single error, even, committed by Mr. Judd, since he and I have acted together politically., ...]"|3
52|"[The question of Federal control of slavery in the Territories seems not to have been directly before the convention which framed the original Constitution; and hence it is not recorded that the ""thirty-nine,"" or any of them, while engaged on that instrument, expressed any opinion on that precise question., In 1789, by the first Congress which sat under the Constitution, an act was passed to enforce the Ordinance of '87, including the prohibition of slavery in the Northwestern Territory., The bill for this act was reported by one of the ""thirty-nine,"" Thomas Fitzsimmons, then a member of the House of Representatives from Pennsylvania., It went through all its stages without a word of opposition, and finally passed both branches without yeas and nays, which is equivalent to a unanimous passage., In this Congress there were sixteen of the thirty-nine fathers who framed the original Constitution., They were John Langdon, Nicholas Gilman, Wm., S. Johnnson, Roger Sherman, Robert Morris, Thos., Fitzsimmons, William Few, Abraham Baldwin, Rufus King, William Paterson, George Claimer, Richard Bassett, George Read, Pierce Butler, Daniel Carroll, James Madison., This shows that, in their understanding, no line dividing local from Federal authority, nor anything in the Constitution, properly forbade Congress to prohibit slavery in the Federal territory; else both their fidelity to correct principles and their oath to support the Constitution would have constrained them to oppose the prohibition., Again: George Washington, another of the ""thirty nine,"" was then President of the United States, and, as such, approved and signed the bill; thus completing its validity as a law, and thus showing that, in his understanding, no line dividing local from Federal authority, nor anything in the Constitution, forbade the Federal Government to control as to slavery in Federal territory., No great while after the adoption of the original Constitution, North Carolina ceded to the Federal Government the country now constituting the State of Tennessee; and, a few years later, Georgia ceded that which now constitutes the States of Mississippi and Alabama., In both deeds of cession it was made a condition by the ceding States that the Federal Government should not prohibit slavery in the ceded country., Besides this, slavery was then actually in the ceded country., Under these circumstances, Congress, on taking charge of these countries, did not absolutely prohibit slavery within them., But they did interfere with it--take control of it--even there, to a certain extent., In 1798, Congress organized the Territory of Mississippi: In the act of organization they prohibited the bringing of slaves into the Territory from any place without the United States, by fine and giving freedom to slaves so brought., This act passed both branches of Congress without yeas and nays., In that Congress were three of the ""thirty-nine"" who framed the original Constitution., They were John Langdon, George Read, and Abraham Baldwin., They all, probably, voted for it., Certainly they would have placed their opposition to it upon record, if, in their understanding, any line dividing local from Federal authority, or anything in the Constitution, properly forbade the Federal Government to control as to slavery in Federal territory., In 1803, the Federal Government purchased the Louisiana country., Our former territorial acquisitions came from certain of our own States; but this Louisiana country was acquired from a foreign nation., In 1804, Congress gave a territorial organization to that part of it which now constitutes the State of Lousiana., New Orleans, lying within that part, was an old and comparatively large city., There were other considerable towns and settlements, and slavery was extensively and thoroughly intermingled with the people., Congress did not, in the Territorial Act, prohibit slavery; but they did interfere with it take control of it--in a more marked and extensive way than they did in the case of Mississippi., The substance of the provision therein made in relation to slaves was:  First., That no slave should be imported into the Territory from foreign parts., Second., That no slave should be carried into it who had been imported into the United States since the first day of May, 1798., Third., That no slave should be carried into it except by the owner, and for his own use as a settler; the penalty in all the cases being a fine upon the violator of the law, and freedom to the slave., This act also was passed without yeas and nays., In the Congress which passed it there were two of the ""thirty-nine."", They were Abraham Baldwin and Jonathan Dayton., As stated in the case of Mississippi, it is probable they both voted for it., They would not have allowed it to pass without recording their opposition to it, if, in their understanding, it violated either the line properly dividing local from Federal authority, or any provision of the Constitution., In 1819-20 came and passed the Missouri question., Many votes were taken, by yeas and nays, in both branches of Congress, upon the various phases of the general question., Two of the ""thirty-nine""--Rufus King and Charles Pinckney were members of that Congress., Mr. King steadily voted for slavery prohibition and against all compromises, while Mr. Pinckney as steadily voted against slavery prohibition, and against all compromises., By this, Mr. King showed that, in his understanding, no line dividing local from Federal authority, nor anything in the Constitution, was violated by Congress prohibiting slavery in Federal territory; while Mr. Pinckney, by his vote, showed that in his understanding there was some sufficient reason for opposing such prohibition in that case., The cases I have mentioned are the only acts of the ""thirty-nine,"" or of any of them, upon the direct issue, which I have been able to discover., To enumerate the persons who thus acted, as being four in 1784, two in 1787, seventeen in 1789, three in 1798, two in 1804, and two in 1819-20--there would be thirty of them., But this would be counting, John Langdon, Roger Sherman, William Few, Rufus King, and George Read, each twice, and Abraham Baldwin three times., The true number of those of the ""thirty-nine"" whom I have shown to have acted upon the question which, by the text, they understood better than we, is twenty-three, leaving sixteen not shown to have acted upon it in any way., Here, then, we have twenty-three out of our thirty-nine fathers ""who framed the Government under which we live,"" who have, upon their official responsibility and their corporal oaths, acted upon the very question which the text affirms they ""understood just as well, and even better than we do now""; and twenty-one of them--a clear majority of the whole ""thirty-nine""--so acting upon it as to make them guilty of gross political impropriety and wilful perjury, if, in their understanding, any proper division between local and Federal authority, or anything in the Constitution they had made themselves, and sworn to support, forbade the Federal Government to control as to slavery in the Federal Territories., Thus the twenty-one acted; and, as actions speak louder than words, so actions under such responsibilities speak still louder., Two of the twenty-three voted against Congressional prohibition of slavery in the Federal Territories, in the instances in which they acted upon the question., But for what reasons they so voted is not known., They may have done so because they thought a proper division of local from Federal authority, or some provision or principle of the Constitution, stood in the way; or they may, without any such question, have voted against the prohibition on what appeared to them to be sufficient grounds of expediency., No one who has sworn to support the Constitution can conscientiously vote for what he understands to be an unconstitutional measure, however expedient he may think it; but one may and ought to vote against a measure which he deems constitutional, if, at the same time, he deems it inexpedient., It therefore would be unsafe to set down even the two who voted against the prohibition as having done so because, in their understanding, any proper division of local from Federal authority, or anything in the Constitution, forbade the Federal Government to control as to slavery in Federal territory., The remaining sixteen of the ""thirty-nine,"" so far as I have discovered, have left no record of their understanding upon the direct question of Federal control on slavery in the Federal Territories., But there is much reason to believe that their understanding upon that question would not have appeared different from that of their twenty-three compeers, had it been manifested at all., For the purpose of adhering rigidly to the text, I have purposely omitted whatever understanding may have been manifested by any person, however distinguished, other than the thirty-nine fathers who framed the original Constitution; and, for the same reason, I have also omitted whatever understanding may have been manifested by any of the ""thirty tine"" even on any other phase of the general question of slavery., If we should look into their acts and declarations on those other phases, as the foreign slave trade, and the morality and policy of slavery generally, it would appear to us that on the direct question of Federal control of slavery in Federal Territories, the sixteen, if they had acted at all, would probably have acted just as the twenty-three did., Among that sixteen were several of the most noted anti-slavery men of those times--as Dr. Franklin, Alexander Hamilton, and Gouverneur Morris while there was not one now known to have been otherwise, unless it may be John Rutledge, of South Carolina., The sum of the whole is, that of our thirty-nine fathers who framed the original Constitution, twenty-one--a clear majority of the whole--certainly understood that no proper division of local from Federal authority, nor any part of the Constitution, forbade the Federal Government to control slavery in the Federal Territories; whilst all the rest probably had the same understanding., Such, unquestionably, was the understanding of our fathers who framed the original Constitution; and the text affirms that they understood the question ""better than we."", But, so far, I have been considering the understanding of the question manifested by the framers of the original Constitution., In and by the original instrument, a mode was provided for amending it; and, as I have already stated, the present frame of ""the Government under which we live"" consists of that original, and twelve amendatory articles framed and adopted since., Those who now insist that Federal control of slavery in Federal Territories violates the Constitution, point us to the provisions which they suppose it thus violates; and, as I understand, they all fix upon provisions in these amendatory articles, and not in the original instrument., The Supreme Court, in the Dred Scott case, plant themselves upon the fifth amendment, which provides that no person shall be deprived of ""life, liberty, or property without due process of law""; while Senator Douglas and his peculiar adherents plant themselves upon the tenth amendment, providing that ""the powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution"" ""are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people."", Now, it so happens that these amendments were framed by the first Congress which sat under the Constitution--the identical Congress which passed the act already mentioned, enforcing the prohibition of slavery in the Northwestern Territory., Not only was it the same Congress, but they were the identical same individual men who, at the same session, and at the same time within the session, had under consideration, and in progress toward maturity, these Constitutional amendments, and this act prohibiting slavery in all the territory the nation then owned., The Constitutional amendments were introduced before and passed after the act enforcing the Ordinance of '87; so that, during the whole pendency of the act to enforce the Ordinance, the Constitutional amendments were also pending., The seventy-six members of that Congress, including sixteen of the framers of the original Constitution, as before stated, were pre-eminently our fathers who framed that part of ""the Government under which we live,"" which is now claimed as forbidding the Federal Government to control slavery in the Federal Territories., Is it not a little presumptuous in any one at this day to affirm that the two things which that Congress deliberately framed, and carried to maturity at the same time, are absolutely inconsistent with each other?, And does not such affirmation become impudently absurd when coupled with the other affirmation from the same mouth, that those who did the two things alleged to be inconsistent understood whether they really were inconsistent better than we--better than he who affirms that they are inconsistent?, It is surely safe to assume that the thirty-nine framers of the original Constitution, and the seventy-six members of the Congress which framed the amendments thereto, taken together, do certainly include those who may be fairly called ""our fathers who framed the Government under which we live."", And, so assuming, I defy any man to show that any one of them ever, in his whole life, declared that, in his understanding, any proper division of local from Federal authority, or any part of the Constitution, forbade the Federal Government to control as to slavery in the Federal Territories., I go a step further., I defy any one to show that any living man in the world ever did, prior to the beginning of the present century (and I might almost say prior to the beginning of the last half of the present century), declare that, in his understanding, any proper division of local from Federal authority, or any part of the Constitution, forbade the Federal Government to control as to slavery in the Federal Territories., To those who now so declare, I give not only ""our fathers who framed the Government under which we live,"" but with them all other living men within the century in which it was framed, among whom to search, and they shall not be able to find the evidence of a single man agreeing with them., Now and here let me guard a little against being misunderstood., I do not mean to say we are bound to follow implicitly in whatever our fathers did., To do so would be to discard all the lights of current experience to reject all progress, all improvement., What I do say is that, if we would supplant the opinions and policy of our fathers in any case, we should do so upon evidence so conclusive, and argument so clear, that even their great authority, fairly considered and weighed, cannot stand; and most surely not in a case whereof we ourselves declare they understood the question better than we., If any man at this day sincerely believes that proper division of local from Federal authority, or any part of the Constitution, forbids the Federal Government to control as to slavery in the Federal Territories, he is right to say so, and to enforce his position by all truthful evidence and fair argument which he can., But he has no right to mislead others who have less access to history, and less leisure to study it, into the false belief that ""our fathers who framed the Government under which we live"" were of the same opinion thus substituting falsehood and deception for truthful evidence and fair argument., If any man at this day sincerely believes ""our fathers, who framed the Government under which we live,"" used and applied principles, in other cases, which ought to have led them to understand that a proper division of local from Federal authority, or some part of the Constitution, forbids the Federal Government to control as to slavery in the Federal Territories, he is right to say so., But he should, at the same time, brave the responsibility of declaring that, in his opinion, he understands their principles better than they did themselves; and especially should he not shirk that responsibility by asserting that they ""understood the question just as well, and even better than we do now."", But enough!, Let all who believe that ""our fathers, who framed the Government under which we live, understood this question just as well, and even better than we do now,"" speak as they spoke, and act as they acted upon it., This is all Republicans ask--all Republicans desire--in relation to slavery., As those fathers marked it, so let it be again marked, as an evil not to be extended, but to be tolerated and protected only because of, and so far as, its actual presence among us makes that toleration and protection a necessity., Let all the guaranties those fathers gave it be not grudgingly, but fully and fairly maintained., For this Republicans contend, and with this, so far as I know or believe, they will be content., And now, if they would listen--as I suppose they will not--I would address a few words to the Southern people., I would say to them: You consider yourselves a reasonable and a just people; and I consider that in the general qualities of reason and justice you are not inferior to any other people., Still, when you speak of us Republicans, you do so only to denounce us as reptiles, or, at the best, as no better than outlaws., You will grant a hearing to pirates or murderers, but nothing like it to ""Black Republicans."", In all your contentions with one another, each of you deems an unconditional condemnation of ""Black Republicanism"" as the first thing to be attended to., Indeed, such condemnation of us seems to be an indispensable prerequisite license, so to speak among you, to be admitted or permitted to speak at all: Now; can you, or not, be prevailed upon to pause, and to consider whether this is quite just to us, or even to yourselves?, Bring forward your charges and specifications, and then be patient long enough to hear us deny or justify., You say we are sectional., We deny it., That makes an issue; and the burden of proof is upon you., ...]"|3
53|"[Mr. Jefferson did not mean to say, nor do I, that the power of emancipation is in the Federal Government., He spoke of Virginia; and, as to the power of emancipation, I speak of the slave holding States only., The Federal Government, however, as we insist, has the power of restraining the extension of the institution--the power to insure that a slave insurrection shall never occur on any American soil which is now free from slavery., John Brown's effort was peculiar., It was not a slave insurrection., It was an attempt by white men to get up a revolt among slaves, in which the slaves refused to participate., In fact, it was so absurd that the slaves, with all their ignorance, saw plainly enough it could not succeed., That affair, in its philosophy, corresponds with the many attempts related in history at the assassination of kings and emperors., An enthusiast broods over the oppression of a people till he fancies himself commissioned by Heaven to liberate them., He ventures the attempt, which ends in little else than his own execution., Orsini's attempt on Louis Napoleon and John Brown's attempt at Harper's Ferry were, in their philosophy, precisely the same., The eagerness to cast blame on old England in the one case, and on New England in the other, does not disprove the sameness of the two things., And how much would it avail you, if you could, by the use of John Brown, Helper's Book, and the like, break up the Republican organization?, Human action can be modified to some extent, but human nature cannot be changed., There is a judgment and a feeling against slavery in this nation, which cast at least a million and a half of votes., You cannot destroy that judgment and feeling--that sentiment--by breaking up the political organization which rallies around it., You can scarcely scatter and disperse an army which has been formed into order in the face of your heaviest fire; but if you could, how much would you gain by forcing the sentiment which created it out of the peaceful channel of the ballot-box, into some other channel?, What would that other channel probably be?, Would the number of John Browns be lessened or enlarged by the operation?, But you will break up the Union rather than submit to a denial of your constitutional rights., That has a somewhat reckless sound; but it would be palliated, if not fully justified, were we proposing, by the mere force of numbers, to deprive you of some right plainly written down in the Constitution., But we are proposing no such thing., When you make these declarations, you have a specific and well-understood allusion to an assumed constitutional right of yours to take slaves into the Federal Territories, and to hold them there as property., But no such right is specifically written in the Constitution., That instrument is literally silent about any such right., We, on the contrary, deny that such a right has any existence in the Constitution, even by implication., Your purpose, then, plainly stated, is that you will destroy the Government unless you be allowed to construe and enforce the Constitution as you please on all points in dispute between you and us., You will rule or ruin, in all events., This, plainly stated, is your language., Perhaps you will say the Supreme Court has decided the disputed constitutional question in your favor., Not quite so., But, waiving the lawyer's distinction between dictum and decision, the court have decided the question for you in a sort of way., The court have substantially said it is your constitutional right to take slaves into the Federal Territories, and to hold them there as property., When I say, the decision was made in a sort of way, I mean it was made in a divided court, by a bare majority of the judges, and they not quite agreeing with one another in the reasons for making it; that it is so made as that its avowed supporters disagree with one another about its meaning, and that it was mainly based upon a mistaken statement of fact--the statement in the opinion that ""the right of property in a slave is distinctly and expressly affirmed in the Constitution."", An inspection of the Constitution will show that the right of property in a slave is not ""distinctly and expressly affirmed"" in it., Bear in mind, the judges do not pledge their judicial opinion that such right is impliedly affirmed in the Constitution; but they pledge their veracity that it is ""distinctly and expressly"" affirmed there--""distinctly,"" that is, not mingled with anything else; ""expressly,"" that is, in words meaning just that, without the aid of any inference, and susceptible of no other meaning., If they had only pledged their judicial opinion that such right is affirmed in the instrument by implication, it would be open to others to show that neither the word ""slave"" nor ""slavery"" is to be found in the Constitution, nor the word ""property"" even, in any connection with language alluding to the things slave or slavery; and that wherever in that instrument the slave is alluded to, he is called a ""person""; and wherever his master's legal right in relation to him is alluded to, it is spoken of as ""service or labor which may be due,"" as a debt payable in service or labor., Also, it would be open to show, by contemporaneous history, that this mode of alluding to slaves and slavery, instead of speaking of them, was employed on purpose to exclude from the Constitution the idea that there could be property in man., To show all this, is easy and certain., When this obvious mistake of the judges shall be brought to their notice, is it not reasonable to expect that they will withdraw the mistaken statement, and reconsider the conclusion based upon it?, And then it is to be remembered that ""our fathers; who framed the Government under which we live"",--the men who made the Constitution--decided this same constitutional question in our favor, long ago; decided it without division among themselves, when making the decision, without division among themselves about the meaning of it after it was made, and, so far as any evidence is left, without basing it upon any mistaken statement of facts., Under all these circumstances, do you really feel yourselves justified to break up this Government unless such a court decision as yours is shall be at once submitted to as a conclusive and final rule of political action?, But you will not abide the election of a Republican President!, In that supposed event, you say, you will destroy the Union; and then, you say, the great crime of having destroyed it will be upon us!, That is cool., A highwayman holds a pistol to my ear, and mutters through his teeth, ""stand and deliver, or I shall kill you, and then you'll be a murderer!"", To be sure, what the robber demanded of me-my money was my own, and I had a clear right to keep it; but it was no more my own than my vote is my own; and the threat of death to me, to extort my money, and the threat of destruction to the Union, to extort my vote, can scarcely be distinguished in principle., A few words now to Republicans: It is exceedingly desirable that all parts of this great confederacy shall be at peace and in harmony one with another., Let us Republicans do our part to have it so., Even though much provoked, let us do nothing through passion and ill temper., Even though the Southern people will not so much as listen to us, let us calmly consider their demands, and yield to them if, in our deliberate view of our duty, we possibly can., Judging by all they say and do, and by the subject and nature of their controversy with us, let us determine, if we can, what will satisfy them., Will they be satisfied if the Territories be unconditionally surrendered to them?, We know they will not., In all their present complaints against us, the Territories are scarcely mentioned., Invasions and insurrections are the rage now., Will it satisfy them if, in the future, we have nothing to do with invasions and, insurrections?, We know it will not., We so know because we know we never had anything to do with invasions and insurrections; and yet this total abstaining does not exempt us from the charge and the denunciation., The question recurs, what will satisfy them?, Simply this: We must not only let them alone, but we must, somehow, convince them that we do let them alone., This, we know by experience, is no easy task., We have been so trying to convince them from the very beginning of our organization, but with no success., In all our platforms and speeches we have constantly protested our purpose to let them alone; but this has had no tendency to convince them., Alike unavailing to convince them is the fact that they have never detected a man of us in any attempt to disturb them., These natural and apparently adequate means all failing, what will convince them?, This, and this only: cease to call slavery wrong, and join them in calling it right., And this must be done thoroughly--done in acts as well as in words., Silence will not be tolerated--we must place ourselves avowedly with them., Senator Douglas's new sedition law must be enacted and enforced, suppressing all declarations that slavery is wrong, whether made in politics, in presses, in pulpits; or in private., We must arrest and return their fugitive slaves with greedy pleasure., We must pull down our free State constitutions., The whole atmosphere must be disinfected from all taint of opposition to slavery, before they will cease to believe that all their troubles proceed from us., I am quite aware they do not state their case precisely in this way., Most of them would probably say to us, ""Let us alone, do nothing to us, and say what you please about slavery."", But we do let them alone have never disturbed them--so that after all it is what we say which dissatisfies them., They will continue to accuse us of doing, until we cease saying., I am also aware they have not as yet, in terms, demanded the overthrow of our free State constitutions., Yet those constitutions declare the wrong of slavery, with more solemn emphasis than do all other sayings against it; and when all these other sayings shall have been silenced, the overthrow of these constitutions will be demanded, and nothing be left to resist the demand., It is nothing to the contrary, that they do not demand the whole of this just now., Demanding what they do, and for the reason they do, they can voluntarily stop nowhere short of this consummation., Holding, as they do, that slavery is morally right, and socially elevating, they cannot cease to demand a full national recognition of it, as a legal right and a social blessing., Nor can we justifiably withhold this on any ground save our conviction that slavery is wrong., If slavery is right, all words, acts, laws, and constitutions against it are themselves wrong, and should be silenced and swept away., If it is right, we cannot justly object to its nationality its universality; if it is wrong, they cannot justly insist upon its extension--its enlargement., All they ask we could readily grant if we thought slavery right; all we ask they could as readily grant, if they thought it wrong., Their thinking it right and our thinking it wrong is the precise fact upon which depends the whole controversy., Thinking it right, as they do, they are not to blame for desiring its full recognition, as being right; but thinking it wrong, as we do, can we yield to them?, Can we cast our votes with their view, and against our own?, In view of our moral, social, and political responsibilities, can we do this?, Wrong as we think slavery is, we can yet afford to let it alone where it is, because that much is due to the necessity arising from its actual presence in the nation; but can we, while our votes will prevent it, allow it to spread into the national Territories, and to overrun us here in these free States?, If our sense of duty forbids this, then let us stand by our duty, fearlessly and effectively., Let us be diverted by none of those sophistical contrivances wherewith we are so industriously plied and belabored-contrivances such as groping for some middle ground between the right and the wrong, vain as the search for a man who should be neither a living man nor a dead man-such as a policy of ""don't care"" on a question about which all true men do care--such as Union appeals beseeching true Union men to yield to Disunionists, reversing the divine rule, and calling, not the sinners, but the righteous to repentance--such as invocations to Washington, imploring men to unsay what Washington said, and undo what Washington did., Neither let us be slandered from our duty by false accusations against us, nor frightened from it by menaces of destruction to the Government nor of dungeons to ourselves., LET US HAVE FAITH THAT RIGHT MAKES MIGHT, AND IN THAT FAITH LET US, TO THE END, DARE TO DO OUR DUTY AS WE UNDERSTAND IT., If the Republican party of this nation shall ever have the national House entrusted to its keeping, it will be the duty of that party to attend to all the affairs of national housekeeping., Whatever matters of importance may come up, whatever difficulties may arise in its way of administration of the Government, that party will then have to attend to., It will then be compelled to attend to other questions, besides this question which now assumes an overwhelming importance--the question of slavery., It is true that in the organization of the Republican party this question of slavery was more important than any other: indeed, so much more important has it become that no more national question can even get a hearing just at present., The old question of tariff--a matter that will remain one of the chief affairs of national house-keeping to all time; the question of the management of financial affairs; the question of the disposition of the public domain how shall it be managed for the purpose of getting it well settled, and of making there the homes of a free and happy people?, ...]"|3
54|"[Much more if I found it in bed with my neighbor's children, and I had bound myself by a solemn compact not to meddle with his children under any circumstances, it would become me to let that particular mode of getting rid of the gentleman alone., But if there was a bed newly made up, to which the children were to be taken, and it was proposed to take a batch of young snakes and put them there with them, I take it no man would say there was any question how I ought to decide!, That is just the case., The new Territories are the newly made bed to which our children are to go, and it lies with the nation to say whether they shall have snakes mixed up with them or not., It does not seem as if there could be much hesitation what our policy should be!, Now I have spoken of a policy based on the idea that slavery is wrong, and a policy based on the idea that it is right., But an effort has been made for a policy that shall treat it as neither right nor wrong., It is based upon utter indifference., Its leading advocate [Douglas] has said, ""I don't care whether it be voted up or down."", ""It is merely a matter of dollars and cents."", ""The Almighty has drawn a line across this continent, on one side of which all soil must forever be cultivated by slave labor, and on the other by free."", ""When the struggle is between the white man and the negro, I am for the white man; when it is between the negro and the crocodile, I am for the negro."", Its central idea is indifference., It holds that it makes no more difference to us whether the Territories become free or slave States than whether my neighbor stocks his farm with horned cattle or puts in tobacco., All recognize this policy, the plausible sugar-coated name of which is ""popular sovereignty."", This policy chiefly stands in the way of a permanent settlement of the question., I believe there is no danger of its becoming the permanent policy of the country, for it is based on a public indifference., There is nobody that ""don't care."", All the people do care one way or the other!, I do not charge that its author, when he says he ""don't care,"" states his individual opinion; he only expresses his policy for the government., I understand that he has never said as an individual whether he thought slavery right or wrong--and he is the only man in the nation that has not!, Now such a policy may have a temporary run; it may spring up as necessary to the political prospects of some gentleman; but it is utterly baseless: the people are not indifferent, and it can therefore have no durability or permanence., But suppose it could: Then it could be maintained only by a public opinion that shall say, ""We don't care."", There must be a change in public opinion; the public mind must be so far debauched as to square with this policy of caring not at all., The people must come to consider this as ""merely a question of dollars and cents,"" and to believe that in some places the Almighty has made slavery necessarily eternal., This policy can be brought to prevail if the people can be brought round to say honestly, ""We don't care""; if not, it can never be maintained., It is for you to say whether that can be done., You are ready to say it cannot, but be not too fast!, Remember what a long stride has been taken since the repeal of the Missouri Compromise!, Do you know of any Democrat, of either branch of the party--do you know one who declares that he believes that the Declaration of Independence has any application to the negro?, Judge Taney declares that it has not, and Judge Douglas even vilifies me personally and scolds me roundly for saying that the Declaration applies to all men, and that negroes are men., Is there a Democrat here who does not deny that the Declaration applies to the negro?, Do any of you know of one?, Well, I have tried before perhaps fifty audiences, some larger and some smaller than this, to find one such Democrat, and never yet have I found one who said I did not place him right in that., I must assume that Democrats hold that, and now, not one of these Democrats can show that he said that five years ago!, I venture to defy the whole party to produce one man that ever uttered the belief that the Declaration did not apply to negroes, before the repeal of the Missouri Compromise!, Four or five years ago we all thought negroes were men, and that when ""all men"" were named, negroes were included., But the whole Democratic party has deliberately taken negroes from the class of men and put them in the class of brutes., Turn it as you will it is simply the truth!, Don't be too hasty, then, in saying that the people cannot be brought to this new doctrine, but note that long stride., One more as long completes the journey from where negroes are estimated as men to where they are estimated as mere brutes--as rightful property!, That saying ""In the struggle between white men and the negro,"" etc., which I know came from the same source as this policy--that saying marks another step., There is a falsehood wrapped up in that statement., ""In the struggle between the white man and the negro"" assumes that there is a struggle, in which either the white man must enslave the negro or the negro must enslave the white., There is no such struggle!, It is merely the ingenious falsehood to degrade and brutalize the negro., Let each let the other alone, and there is no struggle about it., If it was like two wrecked seamen on a narrow plank, when each must push the other off or drown himself, I would push the negro off or a white man either, but it is not; the plank is large enough for both., This good earth is plenty broad enough for white man and negro both, and there is no need of either pushing the other off., So that saying, ""In the struggle between the negro and the crocodile,"" etc., is made up from the idea that down where the crocodile inhabits, a white man can't labor; it must be nothing else but crocodile or negro; if the negro does not the crocodile must possess the earth; in that case he declares for the negro., The meaning of the whole is just this: As a white man is to a negro, so is a negro to a crocodile; and as the negro may rightfully treat the crocodile, so may the white man rightfully treat the negro., This very dear phrase coined by its author, and so dear that he deliberately repeats it in many speeches, has a tendency to still further brutalize the negro, and to bring public opinion to the point of utter indifference whether men so brutalized are enslaved or not., When that time shall come, if ever, I think that policy to which I refer may prevail., But I hope the good freemen of this country will never allow it to come, and until then the policy can never be maintained., Now consider the effect of this policy., We in the States are not to care whether freedom or slavery gets the better, but the people in the Territories may care., They are to decide, and they may think what they please; it is a matter of dollars and cents!, But are not the people of the Territories detailed from the States?, If this feeling of indifference this absence of moral sense about the question prevails in the States, will it not be carried into the Territories?, Will not every man say, ""I don't care, it is nothing to me""?, If any one comes that wants slavery, must they not say, ""I don't care whether freedom or slavery be voted up or voted down""?, It results at last in nationalizing the institution of slavery., Even if fairly carried out, that policy is just as certain to nationalize slavery as the doctrine of Jeff Davis himself., These are only two roads to the same goal, and ""popular sovereignty"" is just as sure and almost as short as the other., What we want, and all we want, is to have with us the men who think slavery wrong., But those who say they hate slavery, and are opposed to it, but yet act with the Democratic party--where are they?, Let us apply a few tests., You say that you think slavery is wrong, but you denounce all attempts to restrain it., Is there anything else that you think wrong that you are not willing to deal with as wrong?, Why are you so careful, so tender, of this one wrong and no other?, You will not let us do a single thing as if it was wrong; there is no place where you will even allow it to be called wrong!, We must not call it wrong in the free States, because it is not there, and we must not call it wrong in the slave States, because it is there; we must not call it wrong in politics because that is bringing morality into politics, and we must not call it wrong in the pulpit because that is bringing politics into religion; we must not bring it into the Tract Society or the other societies, because those are such unsuitable places--and there is no single place, according to you, where this wrong thing can properly be called wrong!, Perhaps you will plead that if the people of the slave States should themselves set on foot an effort for emancipation, you would wish them success, and bid them God-speed., Let us test that: In 1858 the emancipation party of Missouri, with Frank Blair at their head, tried to get up a movement for that purpose, and having started a party contested the State., Blair was beaten, apparently if not truly, and when the news came to Connecticut, you, who knew that Frank Blair was taking hold of this thing by the right end, and doing the only thing that you say can properly be done to remove this wrong--did you bow your heads in sorrow because of that defeat?, Do you, any of you, know one single Democrat that showed sorrow over that result?, Not one!, On the contrary every man threw up his hat, and hallooed at the top of his lungs, ""Hooray for Democracy!"", Now, gentlemen, the Republicans desire to place this great question of slavery on the very basis on which our fathers placed it, and no other., It is easy to demonstrate that ""our fathers, who framed this Government under which we live,"" looked on slavery as wrong, and so framed it and everything about it as to square with the idea that it was wrong, so far as the necessities arising from its existence permitted., In forming the Constitution they found the slave trade existing, capital invested in it, fields depending upon it for labor, and the whole system resting upon the importation of slave labor., They therefore did not prohibit the slave trade at once, but they gave the power to prohibit it after twenty years., Why was this?, What other foreign trade did they treat in that way?, Would they have done this if they had not thought slavery wrong?, Another thing was done by some of the same men who framed the Constitution, and afterwards adopted as their own the act by the first Congress held under that Constitution, of which many of the framers were members, that prohibited the spread of slavery into Territories., Thus the same men, the framers of the Constitution, cut off the supply and prohibited the spread of slavery, and both acts show conclusively that they considered that the thing was wrong., If additional proof is wanted it can be found in the phraseology of the Constitution., When men are framing a supreme law and chart of government, to secure blessings and prosperity to untold generations yet to come, they use language as short and direct and plain as can be found, to express their meaning In all matters but this of slavery the framers of the Constitution used the very clearest, shortest, and most direct language., But the Constitution alludes to slavery three times without mentioning it once The language used becomes ambiguous, roundabout, and mystical., They speak of the ""immigration of persons,"" and mean the importation of slaves, but do not say so., In establishing a basis of representation they say ""all other persons,"" when they mean to say slaves--why did they not use the shortest phrase?, In providing for the return of fugitives they say ""persons held to service or labor."", If they had said slaves it would have been plainer, and less liable to misconstruction., Why did n't they do it?, We cannot doubt that it was done on purpose., Only one reason is possible, and that is supplied us by one of the framers of the Constitution--and it is not possible for man to conceive of any other--they expected and desired that the system would come to an end, and meant that when it did, the Constitution should not show that there ever had been a slave in this good free country of ours., I will dwell on that no longer., I see the signs of approaching triumph of the Republicans in the bearing of their political adversaries., A great deal of their war with us nowadays is mere bushwhacking., ...]"|3

and so meet it as if it were possible that something may be said on our side., Do you accept the challenge?, No?, Then you really believe that the principle which our fathers who framed the Government under which we live thought so clearly right as to adopt it, and indorse it again and again, upon their official oaths, is in fact so clearly wrong as to demand our condemnation without a moment's consideration., Some of you delight to flaunt in our faces the warning against sectional parties given by Washington in his Farewell Address., Less than eight years before Washington gave that warning, he had, as President of the United States, approved and signed an act of Congress enforcing the prohibition of slavery in the Northwestern Territory, which act embodied the policy of government upon that subject, up to and at the very moment he penned that warning; and about one year after he penned it he wrote La Fayette that he considered that prohibition a wise measure, expressing in the same connection his hope that we should sometime have a confederacy of free States., Bearing this in mind, and seeing that sectionalism has since arisen upon this same subject, is that warning a weapon in your hands against us, or in our hands against you?, Could Washington himself speak, would he cast the blame of that sectionalism upon us, who sustain his policy, or upon you, who repudiate it?, We respect that warning of Washington, and we commend it to you, together with his example pointing to the right application of it., But you say you are conservative--eminently conservative--while we are revolutionary, destructive, or something of the sort., What is conservatism?, Is it not adherence to the old and tried, against the new and untried?, We stick to, contend for, the identical old policy on the point in controversy which was adopted by our fathers who framed the Government under which we live; while you with one accord reject and scout and spit upon that old policy, and insist upon substituting something new., True, you disagree among yourselves as to what that substitute shall be., You have considerable variety of new propositions and plans, but you are unanimous in rejecting and denouncing the old policy of the fathers., Some of you are for reviving the foreign slave-trade; some for a congressional slave code for the Territories; some for Congress forbidding the Territories to prohibit slavery within their limits; some for maintaining slavery in the Territories through the judiciary; some for the ""gur-reat pur-rinciple"" that if one man would enslave another, no third man should object--fantastically called ""popular sovereignty."", But never a man among you in favor of prohibition of slavery in Federal Territories, according to the practice of our fathers who framed the Government under which we live., Not one of all your various plans can show a precedent or an advocate in the century within which our Government originated., And yet you draw yourselves up and say, ""We are eminently conservative."", It is exceedingly desirable that all parts of this great confederacy shall be at peace, and in harmony one with another., Let us Republicans do our part to have it so., Even though much provoked, let us do nothing through passion and ill-temper., Even though the Southern people will not so much as listen to us, let us calmly consider their demands, and yield to them if, in our deliberate view of our duty, we possibly can., Judging by all they say and do, and by the subject and nature of their controversy with us, let us determine, if we can, what will satisfy them., Will they be satisfied if the Territories be unconditionally surrendered to them?, We know they will not., In all their present complaints against us, the Territories are scarcely mentioned., Invasions and insurrections are the rage now., Will it satisfy them, in the future, if we have nothing to do with invasions and insurrections?, We know it will not., We so know because we know we never had anything to do with invasions and insurrections; and yet this total abstaining does not exempt us from the charge and the denunciation., The question recurs, what will satisfy them?, Simply this: we must not only let them alone, but we must, somehow, convince them that we do let them alone., This, we know by experience, is no easy task., We have been so trying to convince them, from the very beginning of our organization, but with no success., In all our platforms and speeches, we have constantly protested our purpose to let them alone; but this had no tendency to convince them., Alike unavailing to convince them is the fact that they have never detected a man of us in any attempt to disturb them., These natural and apparently adequate means all failing, what will convince them?, This, and this only: cease to call slavery wrong, and join them in calling it right., And this must be done thoroughly--done in acts as well as in words., Silence will not be tolerated--we must place ourselves avowedly with them., Douglas's new sedition law must be enacted and enforced, suppressing all declarations that slavery is wrong, whether made in politics, in presses, in pulpits, or in private., We must arrest and return their fugitive slaves with greedy pleasure., We must pull down our free State constitutions., The whole atmosphere must be disinfected of all taint of opposition to slavery, before they will cease to believe that all their troubles proceed from us., So long as we call slavery wrong, whenever a slave runs away they will overlook the obvious fact that he ran away because he was oppressed, and declare he was stolen off., Whenever a master cuts his slaves with a lash, and they cry out under it, he will overlook the obvious fact that the negroes cry out because they are hurt, and insist that they were put up to it by some rascally abolitionist., I am quite aware that they do not state their case precisely in this way., Most of them would probably say to us, ""Let us alone, do nothing to us, and say what you please about slavery."", But we do let them alone--have never disturbed them--so that, after all, it is what we say which dissatisfies them., They will continue to accuse us of doing, until we cease saying., I am also aware that they have not as yet in terms demanded the overthrow of our free-State constitutions., Yet those constitutions declare the wrong of slavery with more solemn emphasis than do all other sayings against it; and when all these other sayings shall have been silenced, the overthrow of these constitutions will be demanded., It is nothing to the contrary that they do not demand the whole of this just now., Demanding what they do, and for the reason they do, they can voluntarily stop nowhere short of this consummation., Holding as they do that slavery is morally right, and socially elevating, they cannot cease to demand a full national recognition of it, as a legal right, and a social blessing., Nor can we justifiably withhold this on any ground save our conviction that slavery is wrong., If slavery is right, all words, acts, laws, and constitutions against it are themselves wrong and should be silenced and swept away., If it is right, we cannot justly object to its nationality--its universality: if it is wrong, they cannot justly insist upon its extension--its enlargement., All they ask, we could readily grant, if we thought slavery right; all we ask, they could as readily grant, if they thought it wrong., Their thinking it right and our thinking it wrong is the precise fact on which depends the whole controversy., Thinking it right as they do, they are not to blame for desiring its full recognition, as being right; but, thinking it wrong, as we do, can we yield to them?, Can we cast our votes with their view, and against our own?, In view of our moral, social, and political responsibilities, can we do this?, Wrong as we think slavery is, we can yet afford to let it alone where it is because that much is due to the necessity arising from its actual presence in the nation; but can we, while our votes will prevent it, allow it to spread into the national Territories, and to overrun us here in these free States?, If our sense of duty forbids this, then let us stand by our duty, fearlessly and effectively., Let us be diverted by none of those sophistical contrivances wherewith we are so industriously plied and belabored--contrivances such as groping for some middle ground between the right and the wrong, vain as the search for a man who would be neither a living man nor a dead man--such as a policy of ""don't care"" on a question about which all free men do care--such as Union appeals beseeching true Union men to yield to Disunionists, reversing the divine rule, and caning, not the sinners, but the righteous to repentance--such as invocations of Washington, imploring men to unsay what Washington did., Neither let us be slandered from our duty by false accusations against us, nor frightened from it by menaces of destruction to the Government, nor of dungeons to ourselves., Let us have faith that right makes might; and in that faith, let us, to the end, dare to do our duty as we understand it., [As Mr. Lincoln concluded his address, there was witnessed the wildest scene of enthusiasm and excitement that has been in New Haven for years., The Palladium editorially says: ""We give up most of our space to-day to a very full report of the eloquent speech of the HON., Abraham Lincoln, of Illinois, delivered last night at Union Hall.""], As to your kind wishes for myself, allow me to say I cannot enter the ring on the money basis--first, because in the main it is wrong; and secondly, I have not and cannot get the money., I say, in the main, the use of money is wrong; but for certain objects in a political contest, the use of some is both right and indispensable., With me, as with yourself, the long struggle has been one of great pecuniary loss., I now distinctly say this--if you shall be appointed a delegate to Chicago, I will furnish one hundred dollars to bear the expenses of the trip., Reaching home three days ago, I found your letter of February 26th., Considering your difficulty of hearing, I think you had better settle in Chicago, if, as you say, a good man already in fair practice there will take you into partnership., If you had not that difficulty, I still should think it an even balance whether you would not better remain in Chicago, with such a chance for copartnership., If I went west, I think I would go to Kansas, to Leavenworth or Atchison., Both of them are and will continue to be fine growing places., I believe I have said all I can, and I have said it with the deepest interest for your welfare., Reaching home yesterday, I found yours of the 23d March, inclosing a slip from The Middleport Press., It is not true that I ever charged anything for a political speech in my life; but this much is true: Last October I was requested by letter to deliver some sort of speech in Mr. Beecher's church, in Brooklyn--two hundred dollars being offered in the first letter., I wrote that I could do it in February, provided they would take a political speech if I could find time to get up no other., They agreed; and subsequently I informed them the speech would have to be a political one., When I reached New York, I for the first time learned that the place was changed to ""Cooper Institute."", I made the speech, and left for New Hampshire, where I have a son at school, neither asking for pay nor having any offered me., Three days after a check for two hundred dollars was sent to me at New Hampshire; and I took it, and did not know it was wrong., My understanding now is--though I knew nothing of it at the time--that they did charge for admittance to the Cooper Institute, and that they took in more than twice two hundred dollars., ...]"|3
56|"[The people of the South have too much of good sense and good temper to attempt the ruin of the government rather than see it administered as it was administered by the men who made it., At least so I hope and believe., I thank you both for your own letter and a sight of that of Mr. Botts., Yours of the 13th was received this morning., Douglas is managing the Bell element with great adroitness., He had his men in Kentucky to vote for the Bell candidate, producing a result which has badly alarmed and damaged Breckenridge, and at the same time has induced the Bell men to suppose that Bell will certainly be President, if they can keep a few of the Northern States away from us by throwing them to Douglas., But you, better than I, understand all this., I think there will be the most extraordinary effort ever made to carry New York for Douglas., You and all others who write me from your State think the effort cannot succeed, and I hope you are right., Still, it will require close watching and great efforts on the other side., Herewith I send you a copy of a letter written at New York, which sufficiently explains itself, and which may or may not give you a valuable hint., You have seen that Bell tickets have been put on the track both here and in Indiana., In both cases the object has been, I think, the same as the Hunt movement in New York--to throw States to Douglas., In our State, we know the thing is engineered by Douglas men, and we do not believe they can make a great deal out of it., Yours of the 27th is duly received., It consists almost exclusively of a historical detail of some local troubles, among some of our friends in Pennsylvania; and I suppose its object is to guard me against forming a prejudice against Mr. McC------____, I have not heard near so much upon that subject as you probably suppose; and I am slow to listen to criminations among friends, and never expose their quarrels on either side., My sincere wish is that both sides will allow bygones to be bygones, and look to the present and future only., I am annoyed some by a letter from a friend in Chicago, in which the following passage occurs: ""Hamlin has written Colfax that two members of Congress will, he fears, be lost in Maine, the first and sixth districts; and that Washburne's majority for governor will not exceed six thousand."", I had heard something like this six weeks ago, but had been assured since that it was not so., Your secretary of state,--Mr. Smith, I think,--whom you introduced to me by letter, gave this assurance; more recently, Mr. Fessenden, our candidate for Congress in one of those districts, wrote a relative here that his election was sure by at least five thousand, and that Washburne's majority would be from 14,000 to 17,000; and still later, Mr. Fogg, of New Hampshire, now at New York serving on a national committee, wrote me that we were having a desperate fight in Maine, which would end in a splendid victory for us., Such a result as you seem to have predicted in Maine, in your letter to Colfax, would, I fear, put us on the down-hill track, lose us the State elections in Pennsylvania and Indiana, and probably ruin us on the main turn in November., You must not allow it., Yours of the 5th was received last evening., I was right glad to see it., It contains the freshest ""posting"" which I now have., It relieved me some from a little anxiety I had about Maine., Jo Medill, on August 30th, wrote me that Colfax had a letter from Mr. Hamlin saying we were in great danger of losing two members of Congress in Maine, and that your brother would not have exceeding six thousand majority for Governor., I addressed you at once, at Galena, asking for your latest information., As you are at Washington, that letter you will receive some time after the Maine election., I cannot give you details, but it is entirely certain that Pennsylvania and Indiana have gone Republican very largely., Pennsylvania 25,000, and Indiana 5000 to 10,000., Ohio of course is safe., I certainly am in no temper and have no purpose to embitter the feelings of the South, but whether I am inclined to such a course as would in fact embitter their feelings you can better judge by my published speeches than by anything I would say in a short letter if I were inclined now, as I am not, to define my position anew., Your very agreeable letter of the 15th is received., I regret the necessity of saying I have no daughter., I have three sons--one seventeen, one nine, and one seven., They with their mother constitute my whole family., As to the whiskers, as I have never worn any, do you not think that people would call it a piece of silly affectation were I to begin wearing them now?, I am your true friend and sincere well-wisher,  Your very kind letter of the 20th was duly received, for which please accept my thanks., I have another letter, from a writer unknown to me, saying the officers of the army at Fort Kearny have determined in case of Republican success at the approaching Presidential election, to take themselves, and the arms at that point, south, for the purpose of resistance to the government., While I think there are many chances to one that this is a humbug, it occurs to me that any real movement of this sort in the Army would leak out and become known to you., In such case, if it would not be unprofessional or dishonorable (of which you are to be judge), I shall be much obliged if you will apprise me of it., I am anxious for a personal interview with you at as early a day as possible., Can you, without much inconvenience, meet me at Chicago?, If you can, please name as early a day as you conveniently can, and telegraph me, unless there be sufficient time before the day named to communicate by mail., Yours of the 9th is just received., I can only answer briefly., Rest fully assured that the good people of the South who will put themselves in the same temper and mood towards me which you do will find no cause to complain of me., Please excuse me on this occasion from making a speech., I thank you in common with all those who have thought fit by their votes to indorse the Republican cause., I rejoice with you in the success which has thus far attended that cause., Yet in all our rejoicings let us neither express nor cherish any hard feelings toward any citizen who by his vote has differed with us., Let us at all times remember that all American citizens are brothers of a common country, and should dwell together in the bonds of fraternal feeling., Let me again beg you to accept my thanks, and to excuse me from further speaking at this time., I have read in the newspapers your speech recently delivered (I think) before the Georgia Legislature, or its assembled members., If you have revised it, as is probable, I shall be much obliged if you will send me a copy., Yours of the 4th was duly received., The inclosed to Governor Seward covers two notes to him, copies of which you find open for your inspection., Consult with Judge Trumbull; and if you and he see no reason to the contrary, deliver the letter to Governor Seward at once., If you see reason to the contrary write me at once., I have an intimation that Governor Banks would yet accept a place in the Cabinet., Please ascertain and write me how this is,  Your long letter received., Prevent, as far as possible, any of our friends from demoralizing themselves and our cause by entertaining propositions for compromise of any sort on ""slavery extension."", There is no possible compromise upon it but which puts us under again, and leaves all our work to do over again., Whether it be a Missouri line or Eli Thayer's popular sovereignty, it is all the same., Let either be done, and immediately filibustering and extending slavery recommences., On that point hold firm, as with a chain of steel., Yours of the 11th was received two days ago., Should the convocation of governors of which you speak seem desirous to know my views on the present aspect of things, tell them you judge from my speeches that I will be inflexible on the territorial question; but I probably think either the Missouri line extended, or Douglas's and Eli Thayer's popular sovereignty would lose us everything we gain by the election; that filibustering for all south of us and making slave States of it would follow in spite of us, in either case; also that I probably think all opposition, real and apparent, to the fugitive slave clause of the Constitution ought to be withdrawn., I believe you can pretend to find but little, if anything, in my speeches, about secession., But my opinion is that no State can in any way lawfully get out of the Union without the consent of the others; and that it is the duty of the President and other government functionaries to run the machine as it is., Last night I received your letter giving an account of your interview with General Scott, and for which I thank you., Please present my respects to the General, and tell him, confidentially, I shall be obliged to him to be as well prepared as he can to either hold or retake the forts, as the case may require, at and after the inauguration., Your obliging answer to my short note is just received, and for which please accept my thanks., I fully appreciate the present peril the country is in, and the weight of responsibility on me., Do the people of the South really entertain fear that a Republican administration would, directly or indirectly, interfere with the slaves, or with them about the slaves?, If they do, I wish to assure you, as once a friend, and still, I hope, not an enemy, that there is no cause for such fears., The South would be in no more danger in this respect than it was in the days of Washington., I suppose, however, this does not meet the case., You think slavery is right and ought to be extended, while we think it is wrong and ought to be restricted., That, I suppose, is the rub., It certainly is the only substantial difference between us., Resolved: That the fugitive slave clause of the Constitution ought to be enforced by a law of Congress, with efficient provisions for that object, not obliging private persons to assist in its execution, but punishing all who resist it, and with the usual safeguards to liberty, securing free men against being surrendered as slaves., That all State laws, if there be such, really or apparently in conflict with such law of Congress, ought to be repealed; and no opposition to the execution of such law of Congress ought to be made., That the Federal Union must be preserved., Prepared for the consideration of the Republican members of the Senate Committee of Thirteen., I am much obliged by the receipt of yours of the 18th., The most we can do now is to watch events, and be as well prepared as possible for any turn things may take., If the forts fall, my judgment is that they are to be retaken., When I shall determine definitely my time of starting to Washington, I will notify you., Without supposing that you and I are any nearer together, politically, than heretofore, allow me to tender you my sincere thanks for your Union resolution, expressive of views upon which we never were, and, I trust, never will be at variance., I need a man of Democratic antecedents from New England., I cannot get a fair share of that element in without., This stands in the way of Mr. Adams., I think of Governor Banks, Mr. Welles, and Mr. Tuck., Which of them do the New England delegation prefer?, Or shall I decide for myself?, Yours without signature was received last night., I have been considering your suggestions as to my reaching Washington somewhat earlier than is usual., It seems to me the inauguration is not the most dangerous point for us., ...]"|3
57|"[Twenty-four hours ago, at the capital of Indiana, I said to myself, ""I have never seen so many people assembled together in winter weather."", I am no longer able to say that., But it is what might reasonably have been expected--that this great city of Cincinnati would thus acquit herself on such an occasion., My friends, I am entirely overwhelmed by the magnificence of the reception which has been given, I will not say to me, but to the President-elect of the United States of America., Most heartily do I thank you, one and all, for it., I have spoken but once before this in Cincinnati., That was a year previous to the late Presidential election., On that occasion, in a playful manner, but with sincere words, I addressed much of what I said to the Kentuckians., I gave my opinion that we, as Republicans, would ultimately beat them as Democrats, but that they could postpone that result longer by nominating Senator Douglas for the Presidency than they could by any other way., They did not, in any true sense of the word, nominate Mr. Douglas, and the result has come certainly as soon as ever I expected., I also told them how I expected they would be treated after they should have been beaten, and I now wish to call their attention to what I then said upon that subject., I then said:  ""When we do as we say, beat you, you perhaps want to know what we will do with you., I will tell you, as far as I am authorized to speak for the Opposition, what we mean to do with you., We mean to treat you, as near as we possibly can, as Washington, Jefferson, and Madison treated you., We mean to leave you alone, and in no way to interfere with your institutions; to abide by all and every compromise of the Constitution, and, in a word, coming back to the original proposition, to treat you so far as degenerate men, if we have degenerated, may, according to the example of those noble fathers, Washington, Jefferson, and Madison., ""We mean to remember that you are as good as we; that there is no difference between us other than the difference of circumstances., We mean to recognize and bear in mind always that you have as good hearts in your bosoms as other people, or as we claim to have, and treat you accordingly."", Fellow-citizens of Kentucky--friends and brethren, may I call you in my new position?--I see no occasion and feel no inclination to retract a word of this., If it shall not be made good, be assured the fault shall not be mine., I thank you and those whom you represent for the compliment you have paid me by tendering me this address., In so far as there is an allusion to our present national difficulties, which expresses, as you have said, the views of the gentlemen present, I shall have to beg pardon for not entering fully upon the questions which the address you have now read suggests., I deem it my duty--a duty which I owe to my constituents--to you, gentlemen, that I should wait until the last moment for a development of the present national difficulties before I express myself decidedly as to what course I shall pursue., I hope, then, not to be false to anything that you have expected of me., I agree with you, Mr. Chairman, that the working men are the basis of all governments, for the plain reason that they are all the more numerous, and as you added that those were the sentiments of the gentlemen present, representing not only the working class, but citizens of other callings than those of the mechanic, I am happy to concur with you in these sentiments, not only of the native-born citizens, but also of the Germans and foreigners from other countries., Mr. Chairman, I hold that while man exists it is his duty to improve not only his own condition, but to assist in ameliorating the condition of mankind; and therefore, without entering upon the details of the question, I will simply say that I am for those means which will give the greatest good to the greatest number., In regard to the Homestead law, I have to say that, in so far as the government lands can be disposed of, I am in favor of cutting up the wild lands into parcels, so that every poor man may have a home., In regard to the Germans and foreigners, I esteem them no better than other people, nor any worse., It is not my nature, when I see a people borne down by the weight of their shackles--the oppression of tyranny--to make their life more bitter by heaping upon them greater burdens; but rather would I do all in my power to raise the yoke than to add anything that would tend to crush them., Inasmuch as our own country is extensive and new, and the countries of Europe are densely populated, if there are any abroad who desire to make this the land of their adoption, it is not in my heart to throw aught in their way to prevent them from coming to the United States., Mr. Chairman and gentlemen, I will bid you an affectionate farewell., It is true, as has been said by the president of the Senate, that very great responsibility rests upon me in the position to which the votes of the American people have called me., I am deeply sensible of that weighty responsibility., I cannot but know what you all know, that without a name, perhaps without a reason why I should have a name, there has fallen upon me a task such as did not rest even upon the Father of his Country; and so feeling, I can turn and look for that support without which it will be impossible for me to perform that great task., I turn, then, and look to the American people and to that God who has never forsaken them., Allusion has been made to the interest felt in relation to the policy of the new administration., In this I have received from some a degree of credit for having kept silence, and from others some deprecation., I still think that I was right., In the varying and repeatedly shifting scenes of the present, and without a precedent which could enable me to judge by the past, it has seemed fitting that before speaking upon the difficulties of the country I should have gained a view of the whole field, being at liberty to modify and change the course of policy as future events may make a change necessary., I have not maintained silence from any want of real anxiety., It is a good thing that there is no more than anxiety, for there is nothing going wrong., It is a consoling circumstance that when we look out there is nothing that really hurts anybody., We entertain different views upon political questions, but nobody is suffering anything., This is a most consoling circumstance, and from it we may conclude that all we want is time, patience, and a reliance on that God who has never forsaken this people., Fellow-citizens, what I have said I have said altogether extemporaneously, and I will now come to a close., I fear that the great confidence placed in my ability is unfounded., Indeed, I am sure it is., Encompassed by vast difficulties as I am, nothing shall be wanting on my part, if sustained by God and the American people., I believe the devotion to the Constitution is equally great on both sides of the river., It is only the different understanding of that instrument that causes difficulty., The only dispute on both sides is, ""What are their rights?"", If the majority should not rule, who would be the judge?, Where is such a judge to be found?, We should all be bound by the majority of the American people; if not, then the minority must control., Would that be right?, Would it be just or generous?, Assuredly not., I reiterate that the majority should rule., If I adopt a wrong policy, the opportunity for condemnation will occur in four years' time., Then I can be turned out, and a better man with better views put in my place., I most cordially thank his Honor Mayor Wilson, and the citizens of Pittsburg generally, for their flattering reception., I am the more grateful because I know that it is not given to me alone, but to the cause I represent, which clearly proves to me their good-will, and that sincere feeling is at the bottom of it., And here I may remark that in every short address I have made to the people, in every crowd through which I have passed of late, some allusion has been made to the present distracted condition of the country., It is natural to expect that I should say something on this subject; but to touch upon it at all would involve an elaborate discussion of a great many questions and circumstances, requiring more time than I can at present command, and would, perhaps, unnecessarily commit me upon matters which have not yet fully developed themselves., The condition of the country is an extraordinary one, and fills the mind of every patriot with anxiety., It is my intention to give this subject all the consideration I possibly can before specially deciding in regard to it, so that when I do speak it may be as nearly right as possible., When I do speak I hope I may say nothing in opposition to the spirit of the Constitution, contrary to the integrity of the Union, or which will prove inimical to the liberties of the people, or to the peace of the whole country., And furthermore, when the time arrives for me to speak on this great subject, I hope I may say nothing to disappoint the people generally throughout the country, especially if the expectation has been based upon anything which I may have heretofore said., Notwithstanding the troubles across the river [the speaker pointing southwardly across the Monongahela, and smiling], there is no crisis but an artificial one., What is there now to warrant the condition of affairs presented by our friends over the river?, Take even their own view of the questions involved, and there is nothing to justify the course they are pursuing., I repeat, then, there is no crisis, excepting such a one as may be gotten up at any time by turbulent men aided by designing politicians, My advice to them, under such circumstances, is to keep cool., If the great American people only keep their temper on both sides of the line, the troubles will come to an end, and the question which now distracts the country will be settled, just as surely as all other difficulties of a like character which have originated in this government have been adjusted., Let the people on both sides keep their self-possession, and just as other clouds have cleared away in due time, so will this great nation continue to prosper as heretofore., But, fellow-citizens, I have spoken longer on this subject than I intended at the outset., It is often said that the tariff is the specialty of Pennsylvania., Assuming that direct taxation is not to be adopted, the tariff question must be as durable as the government itself., It is a question of national housekeeping., It is to the government what replenishing the meal-tub is to the family., Every varying circumstances will require frequent modifications as to the amount needed and the sources of supply., So far there is little difference of opinion among the people., It is as to whether, and how far, duties on imports shall be adjusted to favor home production in the home market, that controversy begins., One party insists that such adjustment oppresses one class for the advantage of another; while the other party argues that, with all its incidents, in the long run all classes are benefited., In the Chicago platform there is a plank upon this subject which should be a general law to the incoming administration., We should do neither more nor less than we gave the people reason to believe we would when they gave us their votes., Permit me, fellow-citizens, to read the tariff plank of the Chicago platform, or rather have it read in your hearing by one who has younger eyes., As with all general propositions, doubtless, there will be shades of difference in construing this., I have by no means a thoroughly matured judgment upon this subject, especially as to details; some general ideas are about all., I have long thought it would be to our advantage to produce any necessary article at home which can be made of as good quality and with as little labor at home as abroad, at least by the difference of the carrying from abroad., In such case the carrying is demonstrably a dead loss of labor., For instance, labor being the true standard of value, is it not plain that if equal labor get a bar of railroad iron out of a mine in England and another out of a mine in Pennsylvania, each can be laid down in a track at home cheaper than they could exchange countries, at least by the carriage?, If there be a present cause why one can be both made and carried cheaper in money price than the other can be made without carrying, that cause is an unnatural and injurious one, and ought gradually, if not rapidly, to be removed., The condition of the treasury at this time would seem to render an early revision of the tariff indispensable., The Morrill [tariff] bill, now pending before Congress, may or may not become a law., I am not posted as to its particular provisions, but if they are generally satisfactory, and the bill shall now pass, there will be an end for the present., If, however, it shall not pass, I suppose the whole subject will be one of the most pressing and important for the next Congress., By the Constitution, the executive may recommend measures which he may think proper, and he may veto those he thinks improper, and it is supposed that he may add to these certain indirect influences to affect the action of Congress., My political education strongly inclines me against a very free use of any of these means by the executive to control the legislation of the country., As a rule, I think it better that Congress should originate as well as perfect its measures without external bias., I therefore would rather recommend to every gentleman who knows he is to be a member of the next Congress to take an enlarged view, and post himself thoroughly, so as to contribute his part to such an adjustment of the tariff as shall produce a sufficient revenue, and in its other bearings, so far as possible, be just and equal to all sections of the country and classes of the people., We have been marching about two miles through snow, rain, and deep mud., ...]"|3
58|"[If the election had fallen to any of the more distinguished citizens who received the support of the people, this same honor should have greeted him that greets me this day, in testimony of the universal, unanimous devotion of the whole people to the Constitution, the Union, and to the perpetual liberties of succeeding generations in this country., I have neither the voice nor the strength to address you at any greater length., I beg you will therefore accept my most grateful thanks for this manifest devotion--not to me, but the institutions of this great and glorious country., It is with feelings of great diffidence, and, I may say, with feelings of awe, perhaps greater than I have recently experienced, that I meet you here in this place., The history of this great State, the renown of those great men who have stood here, and have spoken here, and have been heard here, all crowd around my fancy, and incline me to shrink from any attempt to address you., Yet I have some confidence given me by the generous manner in which you have invited me, and by the still more generous manner in which you have received me, to speak further., You have invited and received me without distinction of party., I cannot for a moment suppose that this has been done in any considerable degree with reference to my personal services, but that it is done in so far as I am regarded, at this time, as the representative of the majesty of this great nation., I doubt not this is the truth, and the whole truth of the case, and this is as it should be., It is much more gratifying to me that this reception has been given to me as the elected representative of a free people, than it could possibly be if tendered merely as an evidence of devotion to me, or to any one man personally., And now I think it were more fitting that I should close these hasty remarks., It is true that, while I hold myself, without mock modesty, the humblest of all individuals that have ever been elevated to the Presidency, I have a more difficult task to perform than any one of them., You have generously tendered me the support--the united support--of the great Empire State., For this, in behalf of the nation--in behalf of the present and future of the nation--in behalf of civil and religious liberty for all time to come, most gratefully do I thank you., I do not propose to enter into an explanation of any particular line of policy, as to our present difficulties, to be adopted by the incoming administration., I deem it just to you, to myself, to all, that I should see everything, that I should hear everything, that I should have every light that can be brought within my reach, in order that, when I do so speak, I shall have enjoyed every opportunity to take correct and true ground; and for this reason I do not propose to speak at this time of the policy of the Government., But when the time comes, I shall speak, as well as I am able, for the good of the present and future of this country for the good both of the North and of the South--for the good of the one and the other, and of all sections of the country., In the meantime, if we have patience, if we restrain ourselves, if we allow ourselves not to run off in a passion, I still have confidence that the Almighty, the Maker of the universe, will, through the instrumentality of this great and intelligent people, bring us through this as He has through all the other difficulties of our country., Relying on this, I again thank you for this generous reception., I thank you very kindly for this great reception., Since I left my home it has not been my fortune to meet an assemblage more numerous and more orderly than this., I am the more gratified at this mark of your regard since you assure me it is tendered, not to the individual but to the high office you have called me to fill., I have neither strength nor time to make any extended remarks on this occasion, and I can only repeat to you my sincere thanks for the kind reception you have thought proper to extend to me., It is altogether impossible I should make myself heard by any considerable portion of this vast assemblage; but, although I appear before you mainly for the purpose of seeing you, and to let you see rather than hear me, I cannot refrain from saying that I am highly gratified--as much here, indeed, under the circumstances, as I have been anywhere on my route--to witness this noble demonstration--made, not in honor of an individual, but of the man who at this time humbly, but earnestly, represents the majesty of the nation., This reception, like all the others that have been tendered to me, doubtless emanates from all the political parties, and not from one alone., As such I accept it the more gratefully, since it indicates an earnest desire on the part of the whole people, with out regard to political differences, to save--not the country, because the country will save itself but to save the institutions of the country, those institutions under which, in the last three quarters of a century, we have grown to a great, and intelligent, and a happy people--the greatest, the most intelligent, and the happiest people in the world., These noble manifestations indicate, with unerring certainty, that the whole people are willing to make common cause for this object; that if, as it ever must be, some have been successful in the recent election and some have been beaten, if some are satisfied and some are dissatisfied, the defeated party are not in favor of sinking the ship, but are desirous of running it through the tempest in safety, and willing, if they think the people have committed an error in their verdict now, to wait in the hope of reversing it and setting it right next time., I do not say that in the recent election the people did the wisest thing, that could have been done--indeed, I do not think they did; but I do say that in accepting the great trust committed to me, which I do with a determination to endeavor to prove worthy of it, I must rely upon you, upon the people of the whole country, for support; and with their sustaining aid, even I, humble as I am, cannot fail to carry the ship of state safely through the storm., I have now only to thank you warmly for your kind attendance, and bid you all an affectionate farewell., I see that you are providing a platform for me., I shall have to decline standing upon it, because the president of the company tells me that I shall not have time to wait until it is brought to me., As I said yesterday, under similar circumstances at another gathering, you must not draw the inference that I have any intention of deserting any platform with which I have a legitimate connection because I do not stand on yours., Allow me to thank you for this splendid reception, and I now bid you farewell., I have but a moment to stand before you to listen to and return your kind greeting., I thank you for this reception, and for the pleasant manner in which it is tendered to me by our mutual friends., I will say in a single sentence, in regard to the difficulties that lie before me and our beloved country, that if I can only be as generously and unanimously sustained as the demonstrations I have witnessed indicate I shall be, I shall not fail; but without your sustaining hands I am sure that neither I nor any other man can hope to surmount these difficulties., I trust that in the course I shall pursue I shall be sustained not only by the party that elected me, but by the patriotic people of the whole country., I appear before you not to make a speech., I have not sufficient time, if I had the strength, to repeat speeches at every station where the people kindly gather to welcome me as we go along., If I had the strength, and should take the time, I should not get to Washington until after the inauguration, which you must be aware would not fit exactly., That such an untoward event might not transpire, I know you will readily forego any further remarks; and I close by bidding you farewell., I have stepped before you merely in compliance with what appears to be your wish, and not with the purpose of making a speech., I do not propose making a speech this afternoon., I could not be heard by any but a small fraction of you, at best; but, what is still worse than that, I have nothing just now to say that is worthy of your hearing., I beg you to believe that I do not now refuse to address you from any disposition to disoblige you, but to the contrary., But, at the same time, I beg of you to excuse me for the present., I am rather an old man to avail myself of such an excuse as I am now about to do., Yet the truth is so distinct, and presses itself so distinctly upon me, that I cannot well avoid it--and that is, that I did not understand when I was brought into this room that I was to be brought here to make a speech., It was not intimated to me that I was brought into the room where Daniel Webster and Henry Clay had made speeches, and where one in my position might be expected to do something like those men or say something worthy of myself or my audience., I therefore beg you to make allowance for the circumstances in which I have been by surprise brought before you., Now I have been in the habit of thinking and sometimes speaking upon political questions that have for some years past agitated the country; and, if I were disposed to do so, and we could take up some one of the issues, as the lawyers call them, and I were called upon to make an argument about it to the best of my ability, I could do so without much preparation., But that is not what you desire to have done here to-night., I have been occupying a position, since the Presidential election, of silence--of avoiding public speaking, of avoiding public writing., I have been doing so because I thought, upon full consideration, that was the proper course for me to take., I am brought before you now, and required to make a speech, when you all approve more than anything else of the fact that I have been keeping silence., And now it seems to me that the response you give to that remark ought to justify me in closing just here., I have not kept silence since the Presidential election from any party wantonness, or from any indifference to the anxiety that pervades the minds of men about the aspect of the political affairs of this country., I have kept silence for the reason that I supposed it was peculiarly proper that I should do so until the time came when, according to the custom of the country, I could speak officially., I still suppose that, while the political drama being enacted in this country at this time is rapidly shifting its scenes--forbidding an anticipation with any degree of certainty to-day of what we shall see to-morrow--it is peculiarly fitting that I should see it all, up to the last minute, before I should take ground that I might be disposed, by the shifting of the scenes afterward, also to shift., I have said several times upon this journey, and I now repeat it to you, that when the time does come, I shall then take the ground that I think is right--right for the North, for the South, for the East, for the West, for the whole country., And in doing so I hope to feel no necessity pressing upon me to say anything in conflict with the Constitution, in conflict with the continued union of these States, in conflict with the perpetuation of the liberties of this people, or anything in conflict with anything whatever that I have ever given you reason to expect from me., And now, my friends, have I said enough?, [Loud cries of ""No, no!"", and, ""Three cheers for LINCOLN!""], Now, my friends, there appears to be a difference of opinion between you and me, and I really feel called upon to decide the question myself., It is with feelings of deep gratitude that I make my acknowledgments for the reception that has been given me in the great commercial city of New York., I cannot but remember that it is done by the people who do not, by a large majority, agree with me in political sentiment., It is the more grateful to me because in this I see that for the great principles of our Government the people are pretty nearly or quite unanimous., In regard to the difficulties that confront us at this time, and of which you have seen fit to speak so becomingly and so justly, I can only say I agree with the sentiments expressed., In my devotion to the Union I hope I am behind no man in the nation., As to my wisdom in conducting affairs so as to tend to the preservation of the Union, I fear too great confidence may have been placed in me., I am sure I bring a heart devoted to the work., There is nothing that could ever bring me to consent--willingly to consent--to the destruction of this Union (in which not only the great city of New York, but the whole country, has acquired its greatness), unless it would be that thing for which the Union itself was made., I understand that the ship is made for the carrying and preservation of the cargo; and so long as the ship is safe with the cargo, it shall not be abandoned., This Union shall never be abandoned, unless the possibility of its existence shall cease to exist without the necessity of throwing passengers and cargo overboard., So long, then, as it is possible that the prosperity and liberties of this people can be preserved within this Union, it shall be my purpose at all tunes to preserve it., And now, Mr. Mayor, renewing my thanks for this cordial reception, allow me to come to a close., I shall only thank you briefly for this very kind reception given me, not personally, but as the temporary representative of the majesty of the nation., To the kindness of your hearts, and of the hearts of your brethren in your State, I should be very proud to respond, but I shall not have strength to address you or other assemblages at length, even if I had the time to do so., I appear before you, therefore, for little else than to greet you, and to briefly say farewell., You have done me the very high honor to present your reception courtesies to me through your great man a man with whom it is an honor to be associated anywhere, and in owning whom no State can be poor., He has said enough, and by the saying of it suggested enough, to require a response of an hour, well considered., I could not in an hour make a worthy response to it., I therefore, ladies and gentlemen of New Jersey, content myself with saying, most heartily do I indorse all the sentiments he has expressed., Allow me, most gratefully, to bid you farewell., I thank you for this reception at the city of Newark., With regard to the great work of which you speak, I will say that I bring to it a heart filled with love for my country, and an honest desire to do what is right., I am sure, however, that I have not the ability to do anything unaided of God, and that without His support and that of this free, happy, prosperous, and intelligent people, no man can succeed in doing that the importance of which we all comprehend., Again thanking you for the reception you have given me, I will now bid you farewell, and proceed upon my journey., I have been invited by your representatives to the Legislature to visit this the capital of your honored State, and in acknowledging their kind invitation, compelled to respond to the welcome of the presiding officers of each body, and I suppose they intended I should speak to you through them, as they are the representatives of all of you; and if I were to speak again here, I should only have to repeat in a great measure much that I have said, which would be disgusting to my friends around me who have met here., I have no speech to make, but merely appear to see you and let you look at me; and as to the latter I think I have greatly the best of the bargain., My friends, allow me to bid you farewell., I am very grateful to you for the honorable reception of which I have been the object., I cannot but remember the place that New Jersey holds in our early history., In the Revolutionary struggle few of the States among the Old Thirteen had more of the battle-fields of the country within their limits than New Jersey., May I be pardoned if, upon this occasion, I mention that away back in my childhood, the earliest days of my being able to read, I got hold of a small book, such a one as few of the younger members have ever seen Weems's Life of Washington., I remember all the accounts there given of the battle-fields and struggles for the liberties of the country; and none fixed themselves upon my imagination so deeply as the struggle here at Trenton, New Jersey., The crossing of the river, the contest with the Hessians, the great hardships endured at that time, all fixed themselves on my memory more than any single Revolutionary event; and you all know, for you have all been boys, how these early impressions last longer than any others., I recollect thinking then, boy even though I was, that there must have been something more than common that these men struggled for., I am exceedingly anxious that that thing that something even more than national independence, that something that held out a great promise to all the people of the world to all time to come--I am exceedingly anxious that this Union, the Constitution, and the liberties of the people shall be perpetuated in accordance with the original idea for which that struggle was made; and I shall be most happy indeed if I shall be a humble instrument in the hands of the Almighty, and of this his almost chosen people, for perpetuating the object of that great struggle., ...]"|3
59|"[Allusion has been made to the fact--the interesting fact perhaps we should say--that I for the first time appear at the capital of the great commonwealth of Pennsylvania upon the birthday of the Father of his Country., In connection with that beloved anniversary connected with the history of this country, I have already gone through one exceedingly interesting scene this morning in the ceremonies at Philadelphia., Under the kind conduct of gentlemen there, I was for the first time allowed the privilege of standing in old Independence Hall to have a few words addressed to me there, and opening up to me an opportunity of manifesting my deep regret that I had not more time to express something of my own feelings excited by the occasion, that had been really the feelings of my whole life., Besides this, our friends there had provided a magnificent flag of the country., They had arranged it so that I was given the honor of raising it to the head of its staff, and when it went up I was pleased that it went to its place by the strength of my own feeble arm., When, according to the arrangement, the cord was pulled, and it floated gloriously to the wind, without an accident, in the bright, glowing sunshine of the morning, I could not help hoping that there was in the entire success of that beautiful ceremony at least something of an omen of what is to come., Nor could I help feeling then, as I have often felt, that in the whole of that proceeding I was a very humbled instrument., I had not provided the flag; I had not made the arrangements for elevating it to its place; I had applied but a very small portion of even my feeble strength in raising it., In the whole transaction I was in the hands of the people who had arranged it, and if I can have the same generous co-operation of the people of this nation, I think the flag of our country may yet be kept flaunting gloriously., I recur for a moment but to repeat some words uttered at the hotel in regard to what has been said about the military support which the General Government may expect from the commonwealth of Pennsylvania in a proper emergency., To guard against any possible mistake do I recur to this., It is not with any pleasure that I contemplate the possibility that a necessity may arise in this country for the use of the military arm., While I am exceedingly gratified to see the manifestation upon your streets of your military force here, and exceedingly gratified at your promise to use that force upon a proper emergency--while I make these acknowledgments I desire to repeat, in order to preclude any possible misconstruction, that I do most sincerely hope that we shall have no use for them; that it will never become their duty to shed blood, and most especially never to shed fraternal blood., I promise that so far as I may have wisdom to direct, if so painful a result shall in any wise be brought about, it shall be through no fault of mine., Allusion has also been made by one of your honored speakers to some remarks recently made by myself at Pittsburg in regard to what is supposed to be the especial interest of this great commonwealth of Pennsylvania., I now wish only to say in regard to that matter, that the few remarks which I uttered on that occasion were rather carefully worded., I took pains that they should be so., I have seen no occasion since to add to them or subtract from them., I leave them precisely as they stand, adding only now that I am pleased to have an expression from you, gentlemen of Pennsylvania, signifying that they are satisfactory to you., And now, gentlemen of the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, allow me again to return to you my most sincere thanks., I thank you, and through you the municipal authorities of this city who accompany you, for this welcome., And as it is the first time in my life, since the present phase of politics has presented itself in this country, that I have said anything publicly within a region of country where the institution of slavery exists, I will take this occasion to say that I think very much of the ill feeling that has existed and still exists between the people in the section from which I came and the people here, is dependent upon a misunderstanding of one another., I therefore avail myself of this opportunity to assure you, Mr. Mayor, and all the gentlemen present, that I have not now, and never have had, any other than as kindly feelings toward you as to the people of my own section., I have not now, and never have had, any disposition to treat you in any respect otherwise than as my own neighbors., I have not now any purpose to withhold from you any of the benefits of the Constitution, under any circumstances, that I would not feel myself constrained to withhold from my own neighbors; and I hope, in a word, that when we shall become better acquainted--and I say it with great confidence--we shall like each other better., I thank you for the kindness of this reception., I suppose that I may take this as a compliment paid to me, and as such please accept my thanks for it., I have reached this city of Washington under circumstances considerably differing from those under which any other man has ever reached it., I am here for the purpose of taking an official position amongst the people, almost all of whom were politically opposed to me, and are yet opposed to me, as I suppose., I propose no lengthy address to you., I only propose to say, as I did on yesterday, when your worthy mayor and board of aldermen called upon me, that I thought much of the ill feeling that has existed between you and the people of your surroundings and that people from among whom I came, has depended, and now depends, upon a misunderstanding., I hope that, if things shall go along as prosperously as I believe we all desire they may, I may have it in my power to remove something of this misunderstanding; that I may be enabled to convince you, and the people of your section of the country, that we regard you as in all things our equals, and in all things entitled to the same respect and the same treatment that we claim for ourselves; that we are in no wise disposed, if it were in our power, to oppress you, to deprive you of any of your rights under the Constitution of the United States, or even narrowly to split hairs with you in regard to these rights, but are determined to give you, as far as lies in our hands, all your rights under the Constitution--not grudgingly, but fully and fairly., I hope that, by thus dealing with you, we will become better acquainted, and be better friends., And now, my friends, with these few remarks, and again returning my thanks for this compliment, and expressing my desire to hear a little more of your good music, I bid you good-night., Gentlemen, it is evident that some one must take the responsibility of these appointments, and I will do it., My Cabinet is completed., The positions are not definitely assigned, and will not be until I announce them privately to the gentlemen whom I have selected as my Constitutional advisers., In compliance with a custom as old as the Government itself, I appear before you to address you briefly, and to take in your presence the oath prescribed by the Constitution of the United States to be taken by the President ""before he enters on the execution of his office."", I do not consider it necessary at present for me to discuss those matters of administration about which there is no special anxiety or excitement., Apprehension seems to exist among the people of the Southern States that by the accession of a Republican administration their property and their peace and personal security are to be endangered., There has never been any reasonable cause for such apprehension., Indeed, the most ample evidence to the contrary has all the while existed and been open to their inspection., It is found in nearly all the published speeches of him who now addresses you., I do but quote from one of those speeches when I declare that  ""I have no purpose, directly or indirectly, to interfere with the institution of slavery in the States where it exists., I believe I have no lawful right to do so, and I have no inclination to do so."", Those who nominated and elected me did so with full knowledge that I had made this and many similar declarations, and had never recanted them., And, more than this, they placed in the platform for my acceptance, and as a law to themselves and to me, the clear and emphatic resolution which I now read:  ""Resolved, That the maintenance inviolate of the rights of the States, and especially the right of each State to order and control its own domestic institutions according to its own judgment exclusively, is essential to that balance of power on which the perfection and endurance of our political fabric depend, and we denounce the lawless invasion by armed force of the soil of any State or Territory, no matter under what pretext, as amongst the gravest of crimes."", I now reiterate these sentiments; and, in doing so, I only press upon the public attention the most conclusive evidence of which the case is susceptible, that the property, peace, and security of no section are to be in any wise endangered by the now incoming administration., I add, too, that all the protection which, consistently with the Constitution and the laws, can be given, will be cheerfully given to all the States when lawfully demanded, for whatever cause--as cheerfully to one section as to another., There is much controversy about the delivering up of fugitives from service or labor., The clause I now read is as plainly written in the Constitution as any other of its provisions:  ""No person held to service or labor in one State, under the laws thereof, escaping into another, shall in consequence of any law or regulation therein be discharged from such service or labor, but shall be delivered up on claim of the party to whom such service or labor may be due."", It is scarcely questioned that this provision was intended by those who made it for the reclaiming of what we call fugitive slaves; and the intention of the lawgiver is the law., All members of Congress swear their support to the whole Constitution--to this provision as much as to any other., To the proposition, then, that slaves whose cases come within the terms of this clause ""shall be delivered up,"" their oaths are unanimous., Now, if they would make the effort in good temper, could they not with nearly equal unanimity frame and pass a law by means of which to keep good that unanimous oath?, There is some difference of opinion whether this clause should be enforced by national or by State authority; but surely that difference is not a very material one., If the slave is to be surrendered, it can be of but little consequence to him or to others by which authority it is done., And should any one in any case be content that his oath shall go unkept on a merely unsubstantial controversy as to how it shall be kept?, Again, in any law upon this subject, ought not all the safeguards of liberty known in civilized and humane jurisprudence to be introduced, so that a free man be not, in any case, surrendered as a slave?, And might it not be well at the same time to provide by law for the enforcement of that clause in the Constitution which guarantees that ""the citizens of each State shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in the several States""?, I take the official oath to-day with no mental reservations, and with no purpose to construe the Constitution or laws by any hypercritical rules., And, while I do not choose now to specify particular acts of Congress as proper to be enforced, I do suggest that it will be much safer for all, both in official and private stations, to conform to and abide by all those acts which stand unrepealed, than to violate any of them, trusting to find impunity in having them held to be unconstitutional., It is seventy-two years since the first inauguration of a President under our national Constitution., During that period fifteen different and greatly distinguished citizens have, in succession, administered the executive branch of the Government., They have conducted it through many perils, and generally with great success., Yet, with all this scope of precedent, I now enter upon the same task for the brief constitutional term of four years under great and peculiar difficulty., A disruption of the Federal Union, heretofore only menaced, is now formidably attempted., I hold that, in contemplation of universal law and of the Constitution, the Union of these States is perpetual., Perpetuity is implied, if not expressed, in the fundamental law of all national governments., It is safe to assert that no government proper ever had a provision in its organic law for its own termination., Continue to execute all the express provisions of our national Constitution, and the Union will endure forever--it being impossible to destroy it except by some action not provided for in the instrument itself., Again, if the United States be not a government proper, but an association of States in the nature of contract merely, can it as a contract be peaceably unmade by less than all the parties who made it?, One party to a contract may violate it--break it, so to speak; but does it not require all to lawfully rescind it?, Descending from these general principles, we find the proposition that in legal contemplation the Union is perpetual confirmed by the history of the Union itself., The Union is much older than the Constitution., It was formed, in fact, by the Articles of Association in 1774., It was matured and continued by the Declaration of Independence in 1776., It was further matured, and the faith of all the then thirteen States expressly plighted and engaged that it should be perpetual, by the Articles of Confederation in 1778., And, finally, in 1787 one of the declared objects for ordaining and establishing the Constitution was ""to form a more perfect Union."", But if the destruction of the Union by one or by a part only of the States be lawfully possible, the Union is less perfect than before the Constitution, having lost the vital element of perpetuity., It follows from these views that no State upon its own mere motion can lawfully get out of the Union; that resolves and ordinances to that effect are legally void; and that acts of violence, within any State or States, against the authority of the United States, are insurrectionary or revolutionary, according to circumstances., I therefore consider that, in view of the Constitution and the laws, the Union is unbroken; and to the extent of my ability I shall take care, as the Constitution itself expressly enjoins upon me, that the laws of the Union be faithfully executed in all the States., Doing this I deem to be only a simple duty on my part; and I shall perform it so far as practicable, unless my rightful masters, the American people, shall withhold the requisite means, or in some authoritative manner direct the contrary., I trust this will not be regarded as a menace, but only as the declared purpose of the Union that it will constitutionally defend and maintain itself., In doing this there needs to be no bloodshed or violence; and there shall be none, unless it be forced upon the national authority., The power confided to me will be used to hold, occupy, and possess the property and places belonging to the Government, and to collect the duties and imposts; but beyond what may be necessary for these objects, there will be no invasion, no using of force against or among the people anywhere., Where hostility to the United States, in any interior locality, shall be so great and universal as to prevent competent resident citizens from holding the Federal offices, there will be no attempt to force obnoxious strangers among the people for that object., While the strict legal right may exist in the government to enforce the exercise of these offices, the attempt to do so would be so irritating, and so nearly impracticable withal, that I deem it better to forego for the time the uses of such offices., The mails, unless repelled, will continue to be furnished in all parts of the Union., So far as possible, the people everywhere shall have that sense of perfect security which is most favorable to calm thought and reflection., The course here indicated will be followed unless current events and experience shall show a modification or change to be proper, and in every case and exigency my best discretion will be exercised according to circumstances actually existing, and with a view and a hope of a peaceful solution of the national troubles and the restoration of fraternal sympathies and affections., That there are persons in one section or another who seek to destroy the Union at all events, and are glad of any pretext to do it, I will neither affirm nor deny; but if there be such, I need address no word to them., To those, however, who really love the Union may I not speak?, Before entering upon so grave a matter as the destruction of our national fabric, with all its benefits, its memories, and its hopes, would it not be wise to ascertain precisely why we do it?, Will you hazard so desperate a step while there is any possibility that any portion of the ills you fly from have no real existence?, Will you, while the certain ills you fly to are greater than all the real ones you fly from--will you risk the commission of so fearful a mistake?, All profess to be content in the Union if all constitutional rights can be maintained., Is it true, then, that any right, plainly written in the Constitution, has been denied?, I think not., Happily the human mind is so constituted that no party can reach to the audacity of doing this., ...]"|3
60|"[Please consider and answer by 9 A.M. to-morrow., As I have so frequently said heretofore, when I have had occasion to address the people of the Keystone, in my visits to that State, I can now but repeat the assurance of my gratification at the support you gave me at the election, and at the promise of a continuation of that support which is now tendered to me., Allusion has been made to the hope that you entertain that you have a President and a government., In respect to that I wish to say to you that in the position I have assumed I wish to do more than I have ever given reason to believe I would do., I do not wish you to believe that I assume to be any better than others who have gone before me., I prefer rather to have it understood that if we ever have a government on the principles we profess, we should remember, while we exercise our opinion, that others have also rights to the exercise of their opinions, and that we should endeavor to allow these rights, and act in such a manner as to create no bad feeling., I hope we have a government and a President., I hope, and wish it to be understood, that there may be no allusion to unpleasant differences., We must remember that the people of all the States are entitled to all the privileges and immunities of the citizens of the several States., We should bear this in mind, and act in such a way as to say nothing insulting or irritating., I would inculcate this idea, so that we may not, like Pharisees, set ourselves up to be better than other people., Now, my friends, my public duties are pressing to-day, and will prevent my giving more time to you., Indeed, I should not have left them now, but I could not well deny myself to so large and respectable a body., I am thankful for this renewed assurance of kind feeling and confidence, and the support of the old Bay State, in so far as you, Mr. Chairman, have expressed, in behalf of those whom you represent, your sanction of what I have enunciated in my inaugural address., This is very grateful to my feelings., The object was one of great delicacy, in presenting views at the opening of an administration under the peculiar circumstances attending my entrance upon the official duties connected with the Government., I studied all the points with great anxiety, and presented them with whatever of ability and sense of justice I could bring to bear., If it met the approbation of our good friends in Massachusetts, I shall be exceedingly gratified, while I hope it will meet the approbation of friends everywhere., I am thankful for the expressions of those who have voted with us; and like every other man of you, I like them as certainly as I do others., As the President in the administration of the Government, I hope to be man enough not to know one citizen of the United States from another, nor one section from another., I shall be gratified to have good friends of Massachusetts and others who have thus far supported me in these national views still to support me in carrying them out., Herewith is the diplomatic address and my reply., To whom the reply should be addressed--that is, by what title or style--I do not quite understand, and therefore I have left it blank., Will you please bring with you to-day the message from the War Department, with General Scott's note upon it, which we had here yesterday?, I wish to examine the General's opinion, which I have not yet done., Please accept my sincere thanks for your kind congratulations., It affords me pleasure to confirm the confidence you so generously express in the friendly disposition of the United States, through me, towards the sovereigns and governments you respectively represent., With equal satisfaction I accept the assurance you are pleased to give, that the same disposition is reciprocated by your sovereigns, your governments, and yourselves., Allow me to express the hope that these friendly relations may remain undisturbed, and also my fervent wishes for the health and happiness of yourselves personally., What think you of sending ministers at once as follows: Dayton to England; Fremont to France; Clay to Spain; Corwin to Mexico?, We need to have these points guarded as strongly and quickly as possible., This is suggestion merely, and not dictation., God help me., It is said I have offended you., I hope you will tell me how., Yours very truly,   I am entirely unconscious that you have any way offended me., I cherish no sentiment towards you but that of kindness and confidence., Very glad to know that I haven't., The bearer of this, Mr. C. T. Hempstow, is a Virginian who wishes to get, for his son, a small place in your Dept., I think Virginia should be heard, in such cases., Assuming it to be possible to now provision Fort Sumter, under all the circumstances is it wise to attempt it?, Please give me your opinion in writing on this question., The Senate has transmitted to me a copy of the message sent by my predecessor to that body on the 21st of February last, proposing to take its advice on the subject of a proposition made by the British Government through its minister here to refer the matter in controversy between that government and the Government of the United States to the arbitrament of the King of Sweden and Norway, the King of the Netherlands, or the Republic of the Swiss Confederation., In that message my predecessor stated that he wished to present to the Senate the precise questions following, namely:  ""Will the Senate approve a treaty referring to either of the sovereign powers above named the dispute now existing between the governments of the United States and Great Britain concerning the boundary line between Vancouver's Island and the American continent?, In case the referee shall find himself unable to decide where the line is by the description of it in the treaty of June 15, 1846, shall he be authorized to establish a line according to the treaty as nearly as possible?, Which of the three powers named by Great Britain as an arbiter shall be chosen by the United States?"", I find no reason to disapprove of the course of my predecessor in this important matter; but, on the contrary, I not only shall receive the advice of the Senate thereon cheerfully, but I respectfully ask the Senate for their advice on the three questions before recited., AI believe it is a necessity with us to make the appointments I mentioned last night--that is, Charles F. Adams to England, William L. Dayton to France, George P. Marsh to Sardinia, and Anson Burlingame to Austria., These gentlemen all have my highest esteem, but no one of them is originally suggested by me except Mr. Dayton., Mr. Adams I take because you suggested him, coupled with his eminent fitness for the place., Mr. Marsh and Mr. Burlingame I take because of the intense pressure of their respective States, and their fitness also., The objection to this card is that locally they are so huddled up--three being in New England and two from a single State., I have considered this, and will not shrink from the responsibility., This, being done, leaves but five full missions undisposed of--Rome, China, Brazil, Peru, and Chili., And then what about Carl Schurz; or, in other words, what about our German friends?, Shall we put the card through, and arrange the rest afterward?, What say you?, I did see and talk with Master Geo., Evans Patten last May at Springfield, Ill., I have received a copy of the resolution of the Senate, passed on the 25th instant, requesting me, if in my opinion not incompatible with the public interest, to communicate to the Senate the despatches of Major Robert Anderson to the War Department during the time he has been in command of Fort Sumter., On examination of the correspondence thus called for, I have, with the highest respect for the Senate, come to the conclusion that at the present moment the publication of it would be inexpedient., I desire that an expedition to move by sea be got ready to sail as early as the 6th of April next, the whole according to memorandum attached, and that you cooperate with the Secretary of the Navy for that object., Steamers Pocahontas at Norfolk, Paunee at Washington, Harriet Lane at New York, to be under sailing orders for sea, with stores, etc., for one month., Three hundred men to be kept ready for departure from on board the receiving-ships at New York., Two hundred men to be ready to leave Governor's Island in New York., Supplies for twelve months for one hundred men to be put in portable shape, ready for instant shipping., A large steamer and three tugs conditionally engaged., Cousin Lizzie shows me your letter of the 27th., The question of giving her the Springfield post-office troubles me., You see I have already appointed William Jayne a Territorial governor and Judge Trumbull's brother to a land-office., Will it do for me to go on and justify the declaration that Trumbull and I have divided out all the offices among our relatives?, Dr. Wallace, you know, is needy, and looks to me; and I personally owe him much., I see by the papers, a vote is to be taken as to the post-office., Could you not set up Lizzie and beat them all?, She, being here, need know nothing of it, so therefore there would be no indelicacy on her part., Fit out the Powhatan to go to sea at the earnest possible moment under sealed orders., Orders by a confidential messenger go forward to-morrow., You will proceed to New York, and with the least possible delay, assuming command of any naval steamer available, proceed to Pensacola Harbor, and at any cost or risk prevent any expedition from the mainland reaching Fort Pickens or Santa Rosa Island., You will exhibit this order to any naval officer at Pensacola, if you deem it necessary, after you have established yourself within the harbor, and will request co-operation by the entrance of at least one other steamer., This order, its object, and your destination will be communicated to no person whatever until you reach the harbor of Pensacola., All officers of the army and navy to whom this order may be exhibited will aid by every means in their power the expedition under the command of Colonel Harvey Brown, supplying him with men and material, and co-operating with him as he may desire., Circumstances render it necessary to place in command of your ship (and for a special purpose) an officer who is fully informed and instructed in relation to the wishes of the Government, and you will therefore consider yourself detached., But in taking this step the Government does not in the least reflect upon your efficiency or patriotism; on the contrary, have the fullest confidence in your ability to perform any duty required of you., Hoping soon to be able to give you a better command than the one you now enjoy, and trusting that you will have full confidence in the disposition of the Government toward you, I remain, etc.,  Some thoughts for the President's Consideration,  First., We are at the end of a month's administration, and yet without a policy either domestic or foreign., Second., This, however, is not culpable, and it has even been unavoidable., The presence of the Senate, with the need to meet applications for patronage, have prevented attention to other and more grave matters., Third., But further delay to adopt and prosecute our policies for both domestic and foreign affairs would not only bring scandal on the administration, but danger upon the country., Fourth., To do this we must dismiss the applicants for office., But how?, I suggest that we make the local appointments forthwith, leaving foreign or general ones for ulterior and occasional action., Fifth., The policy at home., I am aware that my views are singular, and perhaps not sufficiently explained., My system is built upon this idea as a ruling one, namely, that we must CHANGE THE QUESTION BEFORE THE PUBLIC FROM ONE UPON SLAVERY, OR ABOUT SLAVERY, for a question upon UNION OR DISUNION: In other words, from what would be regarded as a party question, to one of patriotism or union., The occupation or evacuation of Fort Sumter, although not in fact a slavery or a party question, is so regarded., Witness the temper manifested by the Republicans in the free States, and even by the Union men in the South., ...]"|3
61|"[In witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed., Done at the city of Washington, this twenty seventh day of April, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-one, and of the independence of the United States the eighty-fifth., I have desired as sincerely as any man, and I sometimes think more than any other man, that our present difficulties might be settled without the shedding of blood., I will not say that all hope has yet gone; but if the alternative is presented whether the Union is to be broken in fragments and the liberties of the people lost, or blood be shed, you will probably make the choice with which I shall not be dissatisfied., You are engaged in suppressing an insurrection against the laws of the United States., If at any point on or in the vicinity of any military line which is now or which shall be used between the City of Philadelphia and the city of Washington you find resistance which renders it necessary to suspend the writ of habeas corpus for the public safety, you personally, or through the officer in command at the point at which resistance occurs, are authorized to suspend that writ., The President of the United States directs that you enroll in the military service of the United States the loyal citizens of Saint Louis and vicinity, not exceeding, with those heretofore enlisted, ten thousand in number, for the purpose of maintaining the authority of the United States; for the protection of the peaceful inhabitants of Missouri; and you will, if deemed necessary for that purpose by yourself, by Messrs. Oliver F. Ferny, John How, James O. Broadhead, Samuel T. Glover, J. Wilzie, Francis P. Blair, Jr., proclaim martial law in the city of Saint Louis., The additional force hereby authorized shall be discharged in part or in whole, if enlisted., As soon as it appears to you and the gentlemen above mentioned that there is no danger of an attempt on the part of the enemies of the Government to take military possession of the city of Saint Louis, or put the city in control of the combination against the Government of the United States; and whilst such additional force remains in the service the same shall be governed by the Rules and Articles of War, and such special regulations as you may prescribe., I shall like the force hereafter directed to be enrolled to be under your command., The arms and other military stores in the Saint Louis Arsenal not needed for the forces of the United States in Missouri must be removed to Springfield, or some other safe place of deposit in the State of Illinois, as speedily as practicable, by the ordnance officers in charge at Saint Louis., It is revolutionary times, and therefore I do not object to the irregularity of this., W. S.  I sincerely regret that the failure of the late attempt to provision Fort Sumter should be the source of any annoyance to you., The practicability of your plan was not, in fact, brought to a test., By reason of a gale, well known in advance to be possible and not improbable, the tugs, an essential part of the plan, never reached the ground; while, by an accident for which you were in no wise responsible, and possibly I to some extent was, you were deprived of a war vessel, with her men, which you deemed of great importance to the enterprise., I most cheerfully and truly declare that the failure of the undertaking has not lowered you a particle, while the qualities you developed in the effort have greatly heightened you in my estimation., For a daring and dangerous enterprise of a similar character you would to-day be the man of all my acquaintances whom I would select., You and I both anticipated that the cause of the country would be advanced by making the attempt to provision Fort Sumter, even if it should fail; and it is no small consolation now to feel that our anticipation is justified by the result., Whereas existing exigencies demand immediate and adequate measures for the protection of the National Constitution and the preservation of the National Union by the suppression of the insurrectionary combinations now existing in several States for opposing the laws of the Union and obstructing the execution thereof, to which end a military force in addition to that called forth by my proclamation of the 15th day of April in the present year appears to be indispensably necessary:  Now, therefore, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States and Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy thereof and of the militia of the several States when called into actual service, do hereby call into the service of the United States 42,034 volunteers to serve for the period of three years, unless sooner discharged, and to be mustered into service as infantry and cavalry., The proportions of each arm and the details of enrollment and organization will be made known through the Department of War., And I also direct that the Regular Army of the United States be increased by the addition of eight regiments of infantry, one regiment of cavalry, and one regiment of artillery, making altogether a maximum aggregate increase of 22,714 officers and enlisted men, the details of which increase will also be made known through the Department of War., And I further direct the enlistment for not less than one or more than three years of 18,000 seamen, in addition to the present force, for the naval service of the United States., The details of the enlistment and organization will be made known through the Department of the Navy., The call for volunteers hereby made and the direction for the increase of the Regular Army and for the enlistment of seamen hereby given, together with the plan of organization adopted for the volunteer and for the regular forces hereby authorized, will be submitted to Congress as soon as assembled., In the meantime I earnestly invoke the co-operation of all good citizens in the measures hereby adopted for the effectual suppression of unlawful violence, for the impartial enforcement of constitutional laws, and for the speediest possible restoration of peace and order, and with these of happiness and prosperity, throughout our country., In testimony whereof I have hereunto set my band and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed   Please advise me at the close of each day what troops left during the day, where going, and by what route; what remaining at New York, and what expected in the next day., Give the numbers, as near as convenient, and what corps they are., This information, reaching us daily, will be very useful as well as satisfactory., Know ye that, reposing special trust and confidence in the patriotism, valor, fidelity, and ability of Colonel Robert Anderson, U. S. Army, I have empowered him, and do hereby empower him, to receive into the army of the United States as many regiments of volunteer troops from the State of Kentucky and from the western part of the State of Virginia as shall be willing to engage in the Service of the United States for the term of three years, upon the terms and according to the plan proposed by the proclamation of May 3, 1861, and General Orders No., 15, from the War Department, of May 4, 1861., The troops whom he receives shall be on the same footing in every respect as those of the like kind called for in the proclamation above cited, except that the officers shall be commissioned by the United States., He is therefore carefully and diligently to discharge the duty hereby devolved upon him by doing and performing all manner of things thereunto belonging., Given under my hand, at the city of Washington, this 7th day of May, A. D. 1861, and in the eighty-fifth year of the independence of the United States., Whereas an insurrection exists in the State of Florida, by which the lives, liberty, and property of loyal citizens of the United States are endangered:  And whereas it is deemed proper that all needful measures should be taken for the protection of such citizens and all officers of the United States in the discharge of their public duties in the State aforesaid:  Now, therefore, be it known that I, Abraham LINCOLN, President of the United States, do hereby direct the commander of the forces of the United States on the Florida coast to permit no person to exercise any office or authority upon the islands of Key West, the Tortugas, and Santa Rosa, which may be inconsistent with the laws and Constitution of the United States, authorizing him at the same time, if he shall find it necessary, to suspend there the writ of habeas corpus, and to remove from the vicinity of the United States fortresses all dangerous or suspected persons., In witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.Lieut., D. D. Porter was placed in command of the steamer Powhatan, and Captain Samuel Mercer was detached therefrom, by my special order, and neither of them is responsible for any apparent or real irregularity on their part or in connection with that vessel., Hereafter Captain Porter is relieved from that special service and placed under the direction of the Navy Department, from which he will receive instructions and to which he will report., Mr. Dallas, in a brief despatch of May 2d (No., 333), tells us that Lord John Russell recently requested an interview with him on account of the solicitude which his lordship felt concerning the effect of certain measures represented as likely to be adopted by the President., In that conversation the British secretary told Mr. Dallas that the three representatives of the Southern Confederacy were then in London, that Lord John Russell had not yet seen them, but that he was not unwilling to see them unofficially., He further informed Mr. Dallas that an understanding exists between the British and French governments which would lead both to take one and the same course as to recognition., His lordship then referred to the rumor of a meditated blockade by us of Southern ports, and a discontinuance of them as ports of entry., Mr. Dallas answered that he knew nothing on those topics, and therefore  could say nothing., He added that you were expected to arrive in two weeks., Upon this statement Lord John Russell acquiesced in the expediency of waiting for the full knowledge you were expected to bring., Mr. Dallas transmitted to us some newspaper reports of ministerial explanations made in Parliament., You will base no proceedings on parliamentary debates further than to seek explanations when necessary and communicate them to this department., We intend to have a clear and simple record of whatever issue may arise between us and Great Britain., The President is surprised and grieved regrets that Mr. Dallas did not protest against the proposed unofficial intercourse between the British Government and the missionaries of the insurgents as well as against the demand for explanations made by the British Government., It is due, however, to Mr. Dallas to say that our instructions had been given only to you and not to him, and that his loyalty and fidelity, too rare in these times [among our late representatives abroad, are confessed and] are appreciated., Intercourse of any kind with the so-called commissioners is liable to be construed as a recognition of the authority which appointed them., Such intercourse would be none the less wrongful hurtful to us for being called unofficial, and it might be even more injurious, because we should have no means of knowing what points might be resolved by it., Moreover, unofficial intercourse is useless and meaningless if it is not expected to ripen into official intercourse and direct recognition., It is left doubtful here whether the proposed unofficial intercourse has yet actually begun., Your own [present] antecedent instructions are deemed explicit enough, and it is hoped that you have not misunderstood them., You will in any event desist from all intercourse whatever, unofficial as well as official, with the British Government, so long as it shall continue intercourse of either kind with the domestic enemies of this country confining yourself to a delivery of a copy of this paper to the Secretary of State., After doing this., When intercourse shall have been arrested for this cause, you will communicate with this department and receive further directions., Lord John Russell has informed us of an understanding between the British and French governments that they will act together in regard to our affairs., This communication, however, loses something of its value from the circumstance that the communication was withheld until after knowledge of the fact had been acquired by us from other sources., We know also another fact that has not yet been officially communicated to us--namely, that other European States are apprised by France and England of their agreement, and are expected to concur with or follow them in whatever measures they adopt on the subject of recognition., The United States have been impartial and just in all their conduct toward the several nations of Europe., They will not complain, however, of the combination now announced by the two leading powers, although they think they had a right to expect a more independent, if not a more friendly, course from each of them., You will take no notice of that or any other alliance., Whenever the European governments shall see fit to communicate directly with us, we shall be, as heretofore, frank and explicit in our reply., As to the blockade, you will say that by our own laws of nature and the laws of nature and the laws of nations, this Government has a clear right to suppress insurrection., An exclusion of commerce from national ports which have been seized by the insurgents, in the equitable form of blockade, is the proper means to that end., You will [admit] not insist that our blockade is [not] to be respected if it be not maintained by a competent force; but passing by that question as not now a practical, or at least an urgent, one, you will add that [it] the blockade is now, and it will continue to be so maintained, and therefore we expect it to be respected by Great Britain., You will add that we have already revoked the exequatur of a Russian consul who had enlisted in the military service of the insurgents, and we shall dismiss or demand the recall of every foreign agent, consular or diplomatic, who shall either disobey the Federal laws or disown the Federal authority., As to the recognition of the so-called Southern Confederacy, it is not to be made a subject of technical definition., It is, of course, [quasi] direct recognition to publish an acknowledgment of the sovereignty and independence of a new power., It is [quasi] direct recognition to receive its ambassadors, ministers, agents, or commissioners officially., A concession of belligerent rights is liable to be construed as a recognition of them., No one of these proceedings will [be borne] pass [unnoticed] unquestioned by the United States in this case., Hitherto recognition has been moved only on the assumption that the so-called Confederate States are de facto a self-sustaining power., Now, after long forbearance, designed to soothe discontent and avert the need of civil war, the land and naval forces of the United States have been put in motion to repress the insurrection., The true character of the pretended new State is at once revealed., It is seen to be a power existing in pronunciamento only, It has never won a field., It has obtained no forts that were not virtually betrayed into its hands or seized in breach of trust., It commands not a single port on the coast nor any highway out from its pretended capital by land., Under these circumstances Great Britain is called upon to intervene and give it body and independence by resisting our measures of suppression., British recognition would be British intervention to create within our own territory a hostile state by overthrowing this republic itself., [When this act of intervention is distinctly performed, we from that hour shall cease to be friends, and become once more, as we have twice before been forced to be, enemies of Great Britain.], As to the treatment of privateers in the insurgent service, you will say that this is a question exclusively our own., We treat them as pirates., They are our own citizens, or persons employed by our citizens, preying on the commerce of our country., If Great Britain shall choose to recognize them as lawful belligerents, and give them shelter from our pursuit and punishment, the laws of nations afford an adequate and proper remedy [and we shall avail ourselves of it., And while you need not say this in advance, be sure that you say nothing inconsistent with it.], Happily, however, her Britannic Majesty's government can avoid all these difficulties., It invited us in 1856 to accede to the declaration of the Congress of Paris, of which body Great Britain was herself a member, abolishing privateering everywhere in all cases and forever., You already have our authority to propose to her our accession to that declaration., If she refuse to receive it, it can only be because she is willing to become the patron of privateering when aimed at our devastation., These positions are not elaborately defended now, because to vindicate them would imply a possibility of our waiving them., 1 We are not insensible of the grave importance of  1 (Drop all from this line to the end, and in lieu of it write, ""This paper is for your own guidance only, and not [sic] to be read or shown to any one.""), this occasion., We see how, upon the result of the debate in which we are engaged, a war may ensue between the United States and one, two, or even more European nations., War in any case is as exceptionable from the habits as it is revolting from the sentiments of the American people., But if it come, it will be fully seen that it results from the action of Great Britain, not our own; that Great Britain will have decided to fraternize with our domestic enemy, either without waiting to hear from you our remonstrances and our warnings, or after having heard them., War in defense of national life is not immoral, and war in defense of independence is an inevitable part of the discipline of nations., The dispute will be between the European and the American branches of the British race., ...]"|3
62|"[Finding this condition of things, and believing it to be an imperative duty upon the incoming executive to prevent, if possible, the consummation of such attempt to destroy the Federal Union, a choice of means to that end became indispensable., This choice was made and was declared in the inaugural address., The policy chosen looked to the exhaustion of all peaceful measures before a resort to any stronger ones., It sought only to hold the public places and property not already wrested from the government, and to collect the revenue, relying for the rest on time, discussion, and the ballot-box., It promised a continuance of the mails, at government expense, to the very people who were resisting the government; and it gave repeated pledges against any disturbance to any of the people, or any of their rights., Of all that which a President might constitutionally and justifiably do in such a case, everything was forborne without which it was believed possible to keep the government on foot., On the 5th of March (the present incumbent's first full day in office), a letter of Major Anderson, commanding at Fort Sumter, written on the 28th of February and received at the War Department on the 4th of March, was by that department placed in his hands., This letter expressed the professional opinion of the writer that reinforcements could not be thrown into that fort within the time for his relief, rendered necessary by the limited supply of provisions, and with a view of holding possession of the same, with a force of less than twenty thousand good and well-disciplined men., This opinion was concurred in by all the officers of his command, and their memoranda on the subject were made inclosures of Major Anderson's letter., The whole was immediately laid before Lieutenant-General Scott, who at once concurred with Major Anderson in opinion., On reflection, however, he took full time, consulting with other officers, both of the army and the navy, and at the end of four days came reluctantly but decidedly to the same conclusion as before., He also stated at the same time that no such sufficient force was then at the control of the government, or could be raised and brought to the ground within the time when the provisions in the fort would be exhausted., In a purely military point of view, this reduced the duty of the administration in the case to the mere matter of getting the garrison safely out of the fort., It was believed, however, that to so abandon that position, under the circumstances, would be utterly ruinous; that the necessity under which it was to be done would not be fully understood; that by many it would be construed as a part of a voluntary policy; that at home it would discourage the friends of the Union, embolden its adversaries, and go far to insure to the latter a recognition abroad; that in fact, it would be our national destruction consummated., This could not be allowed., Starvation was not yet upon the garrison, and ere it would be reached Fort Pickens might be reinforced., This last would be a clear indication of policy, and would better enable the country to accept the evacuation of Fort Sumter as a military necessity., An order was at once directed to be sent for the landing of the troops from the steamship Brooklyn into Fort Pickens., This order could not go by land, but must take the longer and slower route by sea., The first return news from the order was received just one week before the fall of Fort Sumter., The news itself was that the officer commanding the Sabine, to which vessel the troops had been transferred from the Brooklyn, acting upon some quasi armistice of the late administration (and of the existence of which the present administration, up to the time the order was despatched, had only too vague and uncertain rumors to fix attention), had refused to land the troops., To now reinforce Fort Pickens before a crisis would be reached at Fort Sumter was impossible--rendered so by the near exhaustion of provisions in the latter-named fort., In precaution against such a conjuncture, the government had, a few days before, commenced preparing an expedition as well adapted as might be to relieve Fort Sumter, which expedition was intended to be ultimately used, or not, according to circumstances., The strongest anticipated case for using it was now presented, and it was resolved to send it forward., As had been intended in this contingency, it was also resolved to notify the governor of South Carolina that he might expect an attempt would be made to provision the fort; and that, if the attempt should not be resisted, there would be no effort to throw in men, arms, or ammunition, without further notice, or in case of an attack upon the fort., This notice was accordingly given; whereupon the fort was attacked and bombarded to its fall, without even awaiting the arrival of the provisioning expedition., It is thus seen that the assault upon and reduction of Fort Sumter was in no sense a matter of self-defense on the part of the assailants., They well knew that the garrison in the fort could by no possibility commit aggression upon them., They knew--they were expressly notified--that the giving of bread to the few brave and hungry men of the garrison was all which would on that occasion be attempted, unless themselves, by resisting so much, should provoke more., They knew that this government desired to keep the garrison in the fort, not to assail them, but merely to maintain visible possession, and thus to preserve the Union from actual and immediate dissolution--trusting, as hereinbefore stated, to time, discussion, and the ballot-box for final adjustment; and they assailed and reduced the fort for precisely the reverse object--to drive out the visible authority of the Federal Union, and thus force it to immediate dissolution., That this was their object the executive well understood; and having said to them in the inaugural address, ""You can have no conflict without being yourselves the aggressors,"" he took pains not only to keep this declaration good, but also to keep the case so free from the power of ingenious sophistry that the world should not be able to misunderstand it., By the affair at Fort Sumter, with its surrounding circumstances, that point was reached., Then and thereby the assailants of the government began the conflict of arms, without a gun in sight or in expectancy to return their fire, save only the few in the fort sent to that harbor years before for their own protection, and still ready to give that protection in whatever was lawful., In this act, discarding all else, they have forced upon the country the distinct issue, ""immediate dissolution or blood."", And this issue embraces more than the fate of these United States., It presents to the whole family of man the question whether a constitutional republic or democracy--a government of the people by the same people--can or cannot maintain its territorial integrity against its own domestic foes., It presents the question whether discontented individuals, too few in numbers to control administration according to organic law in any case, can always, upon the pretenses made in this case, or on any other pretenses, or arbitrarily without any pretense, break up their government, and thus practically put an end to free government upon the earth., It forces us to ask: Is there in all republics this inherent and fatal weakness?, Must a government, of necessity, be too strong for the liberties of its own people, or too weak to maintain its own existence?, So viewing the issue, no choice was left but to call out the war power of the government, and so to resist force employed for its destruction by force for its preservation., The call was made, and the response of the country was most gratifying, surpassing in unanimity and spirit the most sanguine expectation., Yet none of the States commonly called slave States, except Delaware, gave a regiment through regular State organization., A few regiments have been organized within some others of those States by individual enterprise, and received into the government service., Of course the seceded States, so called (and to which Texas had been joined about the time of the inauguration), gave no troops to the cause of the Union., The border States, so called, were not uniform in their action, some of them being almost for the Union, while in others--as Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Arkansas--the Union sentiment was nearly repressed and silenced., The course taken in Virginia was the most remarkable--perhaps the most important., A convention elected by the people of that State to consider this very question of disrupting the Federal Union was in session at the capital of Virginia when Fort Sumter fell., To this body the people had chosen a large majority of professed Union men., Almost immediately after the fall of Sumter, many members of that majority went over to the original disunion minority, and with them adopted an ordinance for withdrawing the State from the Union., Whether this change was wrought by their great approval of the assault upon Sumter, or their great resentment at the government's resistance to that assault, is not definitely known., Although they submitted the ordinance for ratification to a vote of the people, to be taken on a day then somewhat more than a month distant, the convention and the Legislature (which was also in session at the same time and place), with leading men of the State not members of either, immediately commenced acting as if the State were already out of the Union., They pushed military preparations vigorously forward all over the State., They seized the United States armory at Harper's Ferry, and the navy-yard at Gosport, near Norfolk., They received perhaps invited--into their State large bodies of troops, with their warlike appointments, from the so-called seceded States., They formally entered into a treaty of temporary alliance and co-operation with the so-called ""Confederate States,"" and sent members to their congress at Montgomery., And finally, they permitted the insurrectionary government to be transferred to their capital at Richmond., The people of Virginia have thus allowed this giant insurrection to make its nest within her borders; and this government has no choice left but to deal with it where it finds it., And it has the less regret as the loyal citizens have, in due form, claimed its protection., Those loyal citizens this government is bound to recognize and protect, as being Virginia., In the border States, so called,--in fact, the middle States,--there are those who favor a policy which they call ""armed neutrality""; that is, an arming of those States to prevent the Union forces passing one way, or the disunion the other, over their soil., This would be disunion completed., Figuratively speaking, it would be the building of an impassable wall along the line of separation--and yet not quite an impassable one, for under the guise of neutrality it would tie the hands of Union men and freely pass supplies from among them to the insurrectionists, which it could not do as an open enemy., At a stroke it would take all the trouble off the hands of secession, except only what proceeds from the external blockade., It would do for the disunionists that which, of all things, they most desire--feed them well and give them disunion without a struggle of their own., It recognizes no fidelity to the Constitution, no obligation to maintain the Union; and while very many who have favored it are doubtless loyal citizens, it is, nevertheless, very injurious in effect., Recurring to the action of the government, it may be stated that at first a call was made for 75,000 militia; and, rapidly following this, a proclamation was issued for closing the ports of the insurrectionary districts by proceedings in the nature of blockade., So far all was believed to be strictly legal., At this point the insurrectionists announced their purpose to enter upon the practice of privateering., Other calls were made for volunteers to serve for three years, unless sooner discharged, and also for large additions to the regular army and navy., These measures, whether strictly legal or not, were ventured upon, under what appeared to be a popular demand and a public necessity; trusting then, as now, that Congress would readily ratify them., It is believed that nothing has been done beyond the constitutional competency of Congress., Soon after the first call for militia, it was considered a duty to authorize the commanding general in proper cases, according to his discretion, to suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus, or, in other words, to arrest and detain, without resort to the ordinary processes and forms of law, such individuals as he might deem dangerous to the public safety., This authority has purposely been exercised but very sparingly., Nevertheless, the legality and propriety of what has been done under it are questioned, and the attention of the country has been called to the proposition that one who has sworn to ""take care that the laws be faithfully executed"" should not himself violate them., Of course some consideration was given to the questions of power and propriety before this matter was acted upon., The whole of the laws which were required to be faithfully executed were being resisted and failing of execution in nearly one third of the States., Must they be allowed to finally fail of execution, even had it been perfectly clear that by the use of the means necessary to their execution some single law, made in such extreme tenderness of the citizen's liberty that, practically, it relieves more of the guilty than of the innocent, should to a very limited extent be violated?, To state the question more directly, are all the laws but one to go unexecuted, and the government itself go to pieces lest that one be violated?, Even in such a case, would not the official oath be broken if the government should be overthrown when it was believed that disregarding the single law would tend to preserve it?, But it was not believed that this question was presented., It was not believed that any law was violated., The provision of the Constitution that ""the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended, unless when, in cases of rebellion or invasion, the public safety may require it,"" is equivalent to a provision--is a provision--that such privilege may be suspended when, in case of rebellion or invasion, the public safety does require it., It was decided that we have a case of rebellion, and that the public safety does require the qualified suspension of the privilege of the writ which was authorized to be made., Now it is insisted that Congress, and not the executive, is vested with this power., But the Constitution itself is silent as to which or who is to exercise the power; and as the provision was plainly made for a dangerous emergency, it cannot be believed the framers of the instrument intended that in every case the danger should run its course until Congress could be called together, the very assembling of which might be prevented, as was intended in this case, by the rebellion., No more extended argument is now offered, as an opinion at some length will probably be presented by the attorney-general., Whether there shall be any legislation upon the subject, and if any, what, is submitted entirely to the better judgment of Congress., The forbearance of this government had been so extraordinary and so long continued as to lead some foreign nations to shape their action as if they supposed the early destruction of our national Union was probable., While this, on discovery, gave the executive some concern, he is now happy to say that the sovereignty and rights of the United States are now everywhere practically respected by foreign powers; and a general sympathy with the country is manifested throughout the world., The reports of the Secretaries of the Treasury, War, and the Navy will give the information in detail deemed necessary and convenient for your deliberation and action; while the executive and all the departments will stand ready to supply omissions, or to communicate new facts considered important for you to know., It is now recommended that you give the legal means for making this contest a short and decisive one: that you place at the control of the government for the work at least four hundred thousand men and $400,000,000., That number of men is about one-tenth of those of proper ages within the regions where, apparently, all are willing to engage; and the sum is less than a twenty-third part of the money value owned by the men who seem ready to devote the whole., A debt of $600,000,000 now is a less sum per head than was the debt of our Revolution when we came out of that struggle; and the money value in the country now bears even a greater proportion to what it was then than does the population., Surely each man has as strong a motive now to preserve our liberties as each had then to establish them., A right result at this time will be worth more to the world than ten times the men and ten times the money., The evidence reaching us from the country leaves no doubt that the material for the work is abundant, and that it needs only the hand of legislation to give it legal sanction, and the hand of the executive to give it practical shape and efficiency., One of the greatest perplexities of the government is to avoid receiving troops faster than it can provide for them., In a word, the people will save their government if the government itself will do its part only indifferently well., It might seem, at first thought, to be of little difference whether the present movement at the South be called ""secession"" or ""rebellion."", The movers, however, well understand the difference., ...]"|3
63|"[On the side of the Union it is a struggle for maintaining in the world that form and substance of government whose leading object is to elevate the condition of men to lift artificial weights from all shoulders; to clear the paths of laudable pursuit for all; to afford all an unfettered start, and a fair chance in the race of life., Yielding to partial and temporary departures, from necessity; this is the leading object of the government for whose existence we contend., I am most happy to believe that the plain people understand and appreciate this., It is worthy of note that, while in this the government's hour of trial large numbers of those in the army and navy who have been favored with the offices have resigned and proved false to the hand which had pampered them, not one common soldier or common sailor is known to have deserted his flag., Great honor is due to those officers who remained true, despite the example of their treacherous associates; but the greatest honor, and most important fact of all, is the unanimous firmness of the common soldiers and common sailors., To the last man, so far as known, they have successfully resisted the traitorous efforts of those whose commands, but an hour before, they obeyed as absolute law., This is the patriotic instinct of the plain people., They understand, without an argument, that the destroying of the government which was made by Washington means no good to them., Our popular government has often been called an experiment., Two points in it our people have already settled--the successful establishing and the successful administering of it., One still remains--its successful maintenance against a formidable internal attempt to overthrow it., It is now for them to demonstrate to the world that those who can fairly carry an election can also suppress a rebellion; that ballots are the rightful and peaceful successors of bullets; and that when ballots have fairly and constitutionally decided, there can be no successful appeal back to bullets; that there can be no successful appeal, except to ballots themselves, at succeeding elections., Such will be a great lesson of peace: teaching men that what they cannot take by an election, neither can they take it by a war; teaching all the folly of being the beginners of a war., Lest there be some uneasiness in the minds of candid men as to what is to be the course of the government toward the Southern States after the rebellion shall have been suppressed, the executive deems it proper to say it will be his purpose then, as ever, to be guided by the Constitution and the laws; and that he probably will have no different understanding of the powers and duties of the Federal Government relatively to the rights of the States and the people, under the Constitution, than that expressed in the inaugural address., He desires to preserve the government, that it may be administered for all as it was administered by the men who made it., Loyal citizens everywhere have the right to claim this of their government, and the government has no right to withhold or neglect it., It is not perceived that in giving it there is any coercion, any conquest, or any subjugation, in any just sense of those terms., The Constitution provides, and all the States have accepted the provision, that ""the United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a republican form of government."", But if a State may lawfully go out of the Union, having done so it may also discard the republican form of government, so that to prevent its going out is an indispensable means to the end of maintaining the guarantee mentioned; and when an end is lawful and obligatory, the indispensable means to it are also lawful and obligatory., It was with the deepest regret that the executive found the duty of employing the war power in defense of the government forced upon him., He could but perform this duty or surrender the existence of the government., No compromise by public servants could, in this case, be a cure; not that compromises are not often proper, but that no popular government can long survive a marked precedent that those who carry an election can only save the government from immediate destruction by giving up the main point upon which the people gave the election., The people themselves, and not their servants, can safely reverse their own deliberate decisions., As a private citizen the executive could not have consented that these institutions shall perish; much less could he in betrayal of so vast and so sacred a trust as these free people had confided to him., He felt that he had no moral right to shrink, nor even to count the chances of his own life, in what might follow., In full view of his great responsibility he has, so far, done what he has deemed his duty., You will now, according to your own judgment, perform yours., He sincerely hopes that your views and your action may so accord with his as to assure all faithful citizens who have been disturbed in their rights of a certain and speedy restoration to them, under the Constitution and the laws., And having thus chosen our course, without guile and with pure purpose, let us renew our trust in God, and go forward without fear and with manly hearts., Please ask the Comr., of Indian Affairs, and of the Gen'l Land Office to come with you, and see me at once., I want the assistance of all of you in overhauling the list of appointments a little before I send them to the Senate., In answer to the resolution of the House of Representatives of the 9th instant, requesting a copy of correspondence upon the subject of the incorporation of the Dominican republic with the Spanish monarchy, I transmit a report from the Secretary of State; to whom the resolution was referred., I transmit to Congress a copy of correspondence between the Secretary of State and her Britannic Majesty's envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary accredited to this government, relative to the exhibition of the products of industry of all nations, which is to take place at London in the course of next year., As citizens of the United States may justly pride themselves upon their proficiency in industrial arts, it is desirable that they should have proper facilities toward taking part in the exhibition., With this view I recommend such legislation by Congress at this session as may be necessary for that purpose., As the United States have, in common with Great Britain and France, a deep interest in the preservation and development of the fisheries adjacent to the northeastern coast and islands of this continent, it seems proper that we should concert with the governments of those countries such measures as may be conducive to those important objects., With this view I transmit to Congress a copy of a correspondence between the Secretary of State and the British minister here, in which the latter proposes, on behalf of his government, the appointment of a joint commission to inquire into the matter, in order that such ulterior measures may be adopted as may be advisable for the objects proposed., Such legislation recommended as may be necessary to enable the executive to provide for a commissioner on behalf of the United States:  I have agreed, and do agree, that the two Indian regiments named within shall be accepted if the act of Congress shall admit it., Let there be no further question about it., 1., Let the plan for making the blockade effective be pushed forward with all possible despatch., 2., Let the volunteer forces at Fort Monroe and vicinity under General Butler be constantly drilled, disciplined, and instructed without more for the present., 3., Let Baltimore be held as now, with a gentle but firm and certain hand., 4., Let the force now under Patterson or Banks be strengthened and made secure in its position., 5., Let the forces in Western Virginia act till further orders according to instructions or orders from General McClellan., 6., [Let] General Fremont push forward his organization and operations in the West as rapidly as possible, giving rather special attention to Missouri., 7., Let the forces late before Manassas, except the three-months men, be reorganized as rapidly as possible in their camps here and about Arlington., 8., Let the three-months forces who decline to enter the longer service be discharged as rapidly as circumstances will permit., 9., Let the new volunteer forces be brought forward as fast as possible, and especially into the camps on the two sides of the river here., When the foregoing shall be substantially attended to:  1., Let Manassas Junction (or some point on one or other of the railroads near it) and Strasburg be seized, and permanently held, with an open line from Washington to Manassas, and an open line from Harper's Ferry to Strasburg the military men to find the way of doing these., 2., This done, a joint movement from Cairo on Memphis; and from Cincinnati on East Tennessee., Together with the regiments of three years' volunteers which the government already has in service in your State, enough to make eight in all, if tendered in a reasonable time, will be accepted, the new regiments to be taken, as far as convenient, from the three months' men and officers just discharged, and to be organized, equipped, and sent forward as fast as single regiments are ready, On the same terms as were those already in the service from that State., This order is entered in the War Department, and the Governor of New Jersey is authorized to furnish the regiments with wagons and horses., In answer to the resolution of the House of Representatives of the 22d instant; requesting a copy of the correspondence between this, government and foreign powers with reference to maritime right, I transmit a report from the Secretary of State., In answer to the resolution of the House of Representatives of the 15th instant, requesting a copy of the correspondence between this government and foreign powers on the subject of the existing insurrection in the United States, I transmit a report from the Secretary of State., The bearer, Mr. ------, wants ------ in the custom house at Baltimore., If his recommendations are satisfactory, and I recollect them to have been so, the fact that he is urged by the Methodists should be in his favor, as they complain of us some., In answer to the resolution of the House of Representatives of the 24th instant, asking the grounds, reasons, and evidence upon which the police Commissioners of Baltimore were arrested and are now detained as prisoners at Port McHenry, I have to state that it is judged to be incompatible with the public interest at this time to furnish the information called for by the resolution., In answer to the resolution of the Senate of the 19th instant requesting information concerning the quasi armistice alluded to in my message of the 4th instant, I transmit a report from the Secretary of the Navy., In answer to the resolution of the Senate of the 23d instant requesting information concerning the imprisonment of Lieutenant John J. Worden (John L. Worden) of the United States navy, I transmit a report from the Secretary of the Navy., The Marshals of the United States in the vicinity of forts where political prisoners are held will supply decent lodging and sustenance for such prisoners unless they shall prefer to provide in those respects for themselves, in which case they will be allowed to do so by the commanding officer in charge., Approved, and the Secretary of the State will transmit the order to the Marshals, to the Lieutenant-General, and the Secretary of the Interior., In answer to the resolution of the House of Representatives of yesterday, requesting information regarding the imprisonment of loyal citizens of the United States by the forces now in rebellion against this government, I transmit a report from the Secretary of State, and the copy of a telegraphic despatch by which it was accompanied., In answer to the resolution of your honorable body of date July 31, 1861, requesting the President to inform the Senate whether the Hon., James H. Lane, a member of that body from Kansas, has been appointed a brigadier-general in the army of the United States, and if so, whether he has accepted such appointment, I have the honor to transmit herewith certain papers, numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7, which, taken together, explain themselves, and which contain all the information I possess upon the questions propounded., It was my intention, as shown by my letter of June 20, 1861, to appoint Hon., James H. Lane, of Kansas, a brigadier-general of United States volunteers in anticipation of the act of Congress, since passed, for raising such volunteers; and I have no further knowledge upon the subject, except as derived from the papers herewith enclosed., The within paper, as you see, is by HON., John S. Phelps and HON., Frank P. Blair, Jr., both members of the present Congress from Missouri., The object is to get up an efficient force of Missourians in the southwestern part of the State., It ought to be done, and Mr. Phelps ought to have general superintendence of it., I see by a private report to me from the department that eighteen regiments are already accepted from Missouri., Can it not be arranged that part of them (not yet organized, as I understand) may be taken from the locality mentioned and put under the control of Mr. Phelps, and let him have discretion to accept them for a shorter term than three years--or the war--understanding, however, that he will get them for the full term if he can?, I hope this can be done, because Mr. Phelps is too zealous and efficient and understands his ground too well for us to lose his service., Of course provision for arming, equipping, etc., must be made., Mr. Phelps is here, and wishes to carry home with him authority for this matter., Whereas a joint committee of both houses of Congress has waited on the President of the United States and requested him to ""recommend a day of public humiliation, prayer, and fasting to be observed by the people of the United States with religious solemnities and the offering of fervent supplications to Almighty God for the safety and welfare of these States, His blessings on their arms, and a speedy restoration of peace""; and  Whereas it is fit and becoming in all people at all times to acknowledge and revere the supreme government of God, to bow in humble submission to His chastisements, to confess and deplore their sins and transgressions in the full conviction that the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, and to pray with all fervency and contrition for the pardon of their past offences and for a blessing upon their present and prospective action; and  Whereas when our own beloved country, once, by the blessing of God, united, prosperous, and happy, is now afflicted with faction and civil war, it is peculiarly fit for us to recognize the hand of God in this terrible visitation, and in sorrowful remembrance of our own faults and crimes as a nation and as individuals to humble ourselves before Him and to pray for His mercy-to pray that we may be spared further punishment, though most justly deserved, that our arms may be blessed and made effectual for the re-establishment of order, law, and peace throughout the wide extent of our country, and that the inestimable boon of civil and religious liberty, earned under His guidance and blessing by the labors and sufferings of our fathers, may be restored in all its original excellence., Therefore I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States, do appoint the last Thursday in September next as a day of humiliation, prayer, and fasting for all the people of the nation., And I do earnestly recommend to all the people, and especially to all ministers and teachers of religion of all denominations and to all heads of families, to observe and keep that day according to their several creeds and modes of worship in all humility and with all religious solemnity, to the end that the united prayer of the nation may ascend to the Throne of Grace and bring down plentiful blessings upon our country., You must make a job for the bearer of this--make a job of it with the collector and have it done., You can do it for me and you must., Start your four regiments to St. Louis at the earliest moment possible., Get such harness as may be necessary for your rifled gums., Do not delay a single regiment, but hasten everything forward as soon as any one regiment is ready., Have your three additional regiments organized at once., We shall endeavor to send you the arms this week., Been answering your messages since day before yesterday., Do you receive the answers?, ...]"|3
64|"[Now as to policy., No doubt the thing was popular in some quarters, and would have been more so if it had been a general declaration of emancipation., The Kentucky Legislature would not budge till that proclamation was modified; and General Anderson telegraphed me that on the news of General Fremont having actually issued deeds of manumission, a whole company of our volunteers threw down their arms and disbanded., I was so assured as to think it probable that the very arms we had furnished Kentucky would be turned against us., I think to lose Kentucky is nearly the same as to lose the whole game., Kentucky gone, we cannot hold Missouri, nor, as I think, Maryland., These all against us, and the job on our hands is too large for us., We would as well consent to separation at once, including the surrender of this Capital., On the contrary, if you will give up your restlessness for new positions, and back me manfully on the grounds upon which you and other kind friends gave me the election and have approved in my public documents, we shall go through triumphantly., You must not understand I took my course on the proclamation because of Kentucky., I took the same ground in a private letter to General Fremont before I heard from Kentucky., You think I am inconsistent because I did not also forbid General Fremont to shoot men under the proclamation., I understand that part to be within military law, but I also think, and so privately wrote General Fremont, that it is impolitic in this, that our adversaries have the power, and will certainly exercise it, to shoot as many of our men as we shoot of theirs., I did not say this in the public letter, because it is a subject I prefer not to discuss in the hearing of our enemies., There has been no thought of removing General Fremont on any ground connected with his proclamation, and if there has been any wish for his removal on any ground, our mutual friend Sam., Glover can probably tell you what it was., I hope no real necessity for it exists on any ground., On or about the 5th of October (the exact date to be determined hereafter) I wish a movement made to seize and hold a point on the railroad connecting Virginia and Tennessee near the mountain-pass called Cumberland Gap., That point is now guarded against us by Zollicoffer, with 6000 or 8000 rebels at Barboursville Ky.,--say twenty-five miles from the Gap, toward Lexington., We have a force of 5000 or 6000 under General Thomas, at Camp Dick Robinson, about twenty-five miles from Lexington and seventy-five from Zollicoffer's camp, On the road between the two., There is not a railroad anywhere between Lexington and the point to be seized, and along the whole length of which the Union sentiment among the people largely predominates., We have military possession of the railroad from Cincinnati to Lexington, and from Louisville to Lexington, and some home guards, under General Crittenden, are on the latter line., We have possession of the railroad from Louisville to Nashville, Tenn., so far as Muldraugh's Hill, about forty miles, and the rebels have possession of that road all south of there., At the Hill we have a force of 8000, under General Sherman, and about an equal force of rebels is a very short distance south, under General Buckner., We have a large force at Paducah, and a smaller at Port Holt, both on the Kentucky side, with some at Bird's Point, Cairo, Mound City, Evansville, and New Albany, all on the other side, and all which, with the gunboats on the river, are perhaps sufficient to guard the Ohio from Louisville to its mouth., About supplies of troops, my general idea is that all from Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, and Kansas, not now elsewhere, be left to Fremont., All from Indiana and Michigan, not now elsewhere, be sent to Anderson at Louisville., All from Ohio needed in western Virginia be sent there, and any remainder be sent to Mitchell at Cincinnati, for Anderson., All east of the mountains be appropriated to McClellan and to the coast., As to movements, my idea is that the one for the coast and that on Cumberland Gap be simultaneous, and that in the meantime preparation, vigilant watching, and the defensive only be acted upon; this, however, not to apply to Fremont's operations in northern and middle Missouri., That before these movements Thomas and Sherman shall respectively watch but not attack Zollicoffer and Buckner., That when the coast and Gap movements shall be ready Sherman is merely to stand fast, while all at Cincinnati and all at Louisville, with all on the line, concentrate rapidly at Lexington, and thence to Thomas's camp, joining him, and the whole thence upon the Gap., It is for the military men to decide whether they can find a pass through the mountains at or near the Gap which cannot be defended by the enemy with a greatly inferior force, and what is to be done in regard to this., The coast and Gap movements made, Generals McClellan and Fremont, in their respective departments, will avail themselves of any advantages the diversions may present., [He was entirely unable to get this started, Sherman would have taken an active part if given him, the others were too busy getting lines of communication guarded--and discovering many ""critical"" supply items that had not been sent them., Also the commanding general did not like it., D.W.]  Please see Mr. Walker, well vouched as a Union man and son-in-law of Governor Morehead, and pleading for his release., I understand the Kentucky arrests were not made by special direction from here, and I am willing if you are that any of the parties may be released when James Guthrie and James Speed think they should be., I have received from Mr. Thayer, Consul-General of the United States at Alexandria, a full account of the liberal, enlightened, and energetic proceedings which, on his complaint, you have adopted in bringing to speedy and condign punishment the parties, subjects of your Highness in Upper Egypt, who were concerned in an act of criminal persecution against Faris, an agent of certain Christian missionaries in Upper Egypt., I pray your Highness to be assured that these proceedings, at once so prompt and so just, will be regarded as a new and unmistakable proof equally of your Highness's friendship for the United States and of the firmness, integrity and wisdom, with which the government of your Highness is conducted., Wishing you great prosperity and success, I am your friend,  The military line of the United States for the suppression of the insurrection may be extended so far as Bangor, in Maine., You and any officer acting under your authority are hereby authorized to suspend the writ of habeas corpus in any place between that place and the city of Washington., How is this?, I supposed I was appointing for register of wills a citizen of this District., Now the commission comes to me ""Moses Kelly, of New Hampshire."", I do not like this., The lady bearer of this says she has two sons who want to work., Set them at it if possible., Wanting to work is so rare a want that it should be encouraged., Your despatch of yesterday received and shown to General McClellan., I have promised him not to direct his army here without his consent., I do not think I shall come to Annapolis., Herewith is a document--half letter, half order--which, wishing you to see, but not to make public, I send unsealed., Please read it and then inclose it to the officer who may be in command of the Department of the West at the time it reaches him., I cannot now know whether Fremont or Hunter will then be in command., On receipt of this, with the accompanying inclosures, you will take safe, certain, and suitable measures to have the inclosure addressed to Major-General Fremont delivered to him with all reasonable despatch, subject to these conditions only: that if, when General Fremont shall be reached by the messenger--yourself or any one sent by you--he shall then have, in personal command, fought and won a battle, or shall then be actually in a battle, or shall then be in the immediate presence of the enemy in expectation of a battle, it is not to be delivered, but held for further orders., After, and not till after, the delivery to General Fremont, let the inclosure addressed to General Hunter be delivered to him., Major-General Fremont, of the United States Army, the present commander of the Western Department of the same, will, on the receipt of this order, call Major-General Hunter, of the United States Volunteers, to relieve him temporarily in that command, when he (Major-General Fremont) will report to general headquarters by letter for further orders., The command of the Department of the West having devolved upon you, I propose to offer you a few suggestions., Knowing how hazardous it is to bind down a distant commander in the field to specific lines and operations, as so much always depends on a knowledge of localities and passing events, it is intended, therefore, to leave a considerable margin for the exercise of your judgment and discretion., The main rebel army (Price's) west of the Mississippi is believed to have passed Dade County in full retreat upon northwestern Arkansas, leaving Missouri almost freed from the enemy, excepting in the southeast of the State., Assuming this basis of fact, it seems desirable, as you are not likely to overtake Price, and are in danger of making too long a line from your own base of supplies and reinforcements, that you should give up the pursuit, halt your main army, divide it into two corps of observation, one occupying Sedalia and the other Rolla, the present termini of railroads; then recruit the condition of both corps by re-establishing and improving their discipline and instructions, perfecting their clothing and equipments, and providing less uncomfortable quarters., Of course, both railroads must be guarded and kept open, judiciously employing just so much force as is necessary for this., From these two points, Sedalia and Rolla, and especially in judicious cooperation with Lane on the Kansas border, it would be so easy to concentrate and repel any army of the enemy returning on Missouri from the southwest, that it is not probable any such attempt will be made before or during the approaching cold weather., Before spring the people of Missouri will probably be in no favorable mood to renew for next year the troubles which have so much afflicted and impoverished them during this., If you adopt this line of policy, and if, as I anticipate, you will see no enemy in great force approaching, you will have a surplus of force which you can withdraw from these points and direct to others as may be needed, the railroads furnishing ready means of reinforcing these main points if occasion requires., Doubtless local uprisings will for a time continue to occur, but these can be met by detachments and local forces of our own, and will ere long tire out of themselves., While, as stated in the beginning of the letter, a large discretion must be and is left with yourself, I feel sure that an indefinite pursuit of Price or an attempt by this long and circuitous route to reach Memphis will be exhaustive beyond endurance, and will end in the loss of the whole force engaged in it., The following order from the President of the United States, announcing the retirement from active command of the honored veteran Lieutenant general Winfield Scott, will be read by the army with profound regret:  On the 1st day of November, A.D. 1861, upon his own application to the President of the United States, Brevet Lieutenant-General Winfield Scott is ordered to be placed, and hereby is placed, upon the list of retired officers of the army of the United States, without reduction in his current pay, subsistence, or allowances., The American people will hear with sadness and deep emotion that General Scott has withdrawn from the active control of the army, while the President and a unanimous Cabinet express their own and the nation's sympathy in his personal affliction and their profound sense of the important public services rendered by him to his country during his long and brilliant career, among which will ever be gratefully distinguished his faithful devotion to the Constitution, the Union, and the flag when assailed by parricidal rebellion., The President is pleased to direct that Major general George B. McClellan assume the command of the army of the United States., The headquarters of the army will be established in the city of Washington., All communications intended for the commanding general will hereafter be addressed direct to the adjutant-general., The duplicate returns, orders, and other papers heretofore sent to the assistant adjutant-general, headquarters of the army, will be discontinued., The Governor of the State of Missouri, acting under the direction of the convention of that State, proposes to the Government of the United States that he will raise a military force to serve within the State as State militia during the war there, to cooperate with the troops in the service of the United States in repelling the invasion of the State and suppressing rebellion therein; the said State militia to be embodied and to be held in the camp and in the field, drilled, disciplined, and governed according to the Army Regulations and subject to the Articles of War; the said State militia not to be ordered out of the State except for the immediate defense of the State of Missouri, but to co-operate with the troops in the service of the United States in military operations within the State or necessary to its defense, and when officers of the State militia act with officers in the service of the United States of the same grade the officers of the United States service shall command the combined force; the State militia to be armed, equipped, clothed, subsisted, transported, and paid by the United States during such time as they shall be actually engaged as an embodied military force in service in accordance with regulations of the United States Army or general orders as issued from time to time., In order that the Treasury of the United States may not be burdened with the pay of unnecessary officers, the governor proposes that, although the State law requires him to appoint upon the general staff an adjutant-general, a commissary-general, an inspector-general, a quartermaster-general, a paymaster-general, and a surgeon-general, each with the rank of colonel of cavalry, yet he proposes that the Government of the United States pay only the adjutant-general, the quartermaster-general, and inspector-general, their services being necessary in the relations which would exist between the State militia and the United States., The governor further proposes that while he is allowed by the State law to appoint aides-de-camp to the governor at his discretion, with the rank of colonel, three only shall be reported to the United States for payment., He also proposes that the State militia shall be commanded by a single major-general and by such number of brigadier-generals as shall allow one for a brigade of not less than four regiments, and that no greater number of staff officers shall be appointed for regimental, brigade, and division duties than as provided for in the act of Congress of the 22d July, 1861; and that, whatever be the rank of such officers as fixed by the law of the State, the compensation that they shall receive from the United States shall only be that which belongs to the rank given by said act of Congress to officers in the United States service performing the same duties., The field officers of a regiment in the State militia are one colonel, one lieutenant-colonel, and one major, and the company officers are a captain, a first lieutenant, and a second lieutenant., The governor proposes that, as the money to be disbursed is the money of the United States, such staff officers in the service of the United States as may be necessary to act as disbursing officers for the State militia shall be assigned by the War Department for that duty; or, if such cannot be spared from their present duty, he will appoint such persons disbursing officers for the State militia as the President of the United States may designate., Such regulations as may be required, in the judgment of the President, to insure regularity of returns and to protect the United States from any fraudulent practices shall be observed and obeyed by all in office in the State militia., The above propositions are accepted on the part of the United States, and the Secretary of War is directed to make the necessary orders upon the Ordnance, Quartermaster's, Commissary, Pay, and Medical departments to carry this agreement into effect., He will cause the necessary staff officers in the United States service to be detailed for duty in connection with the Missouri State militia, and will order them to make the necessary provision in their respective offices for fulfilling this agreement., All requisitions upon the different officers of the United States under this agreement to be made in substance in the same mode for the Missouri State militia as similar requisitions are made for troops in the service of the United States; and the Secretary of War will cause any additional regulations that may be necessary to insure regularity and economy in carrying this agreement into effect to be adopted and communicated to the Governor of Missouri for the government of the Missouri State militia., This plan approved, with the modification that the governor stipulates that when he commissions a major-general of militia it shall be the same person at the time in command of the United States Department of the West; and in case the United States shall change such commander of the department, he (the governor) will revoke the State commission given to the person relieved and give one to the person substituted to the United States command of said department., I receive with great pleasure a Minister from Sweden., That pleasure is enhanced by the information which preceded your arrival here, that his Majesty, your sovereign, had selected you to fill the mission upon the grounds of your derivation from an ancestral stock identified with the most glorious era of your country's noble history, and your own eminent social and political standing in Sweden., This country, sir, maintains, and means to maintain, the rights of human nature, and the capacity of men for self-government., The history of Sweden proves that this is the faith of the people of Sweden, and we know that it is the faith and practice of their respected sovereign., Rest assured, therefore, that we shall be found always just and paternal in our transactions with your government, and that nothing will be omitted on my part to make your residence in this capital agreeable to yourself and satisfactory to your government., No written authority is found here to declare and enforce martial law in this department., Please send me such written authority and telegraph me that it has been sent by mail., If General McClellan and General Halleck deem it necessary to declare and maintain martial law in Saint Louis, the same is hereby authorized., I have thought over the interview which Mr. Gilmore has had with Mr. Greeley, and the proposal that Greeley has made to Gilmore, namely, that he [Gilmore] shall communicate to him [Greeley] all that he learns from you of the inner workings of the administration, in return for his [Greeley's] giving such aid as he can to the new magazine, and allowing you [Walker] from time to time the use of his [Greeley's] columns when it is desirable to feel of, or forestall, public opinion on important subjects., The arrangement meets my unqualified approval, and I shall further it to the extent of my ability, by opening to you--as I do now--fully the policy of the Government,--its present views and future intentions when formed, giving you permission to communicate them to Gilmore for Greeley; and in case you go to Europe I will give these things direct to Gilmore., But all this must be on the express and explicit understanding that the fact of these communications coming from me shall be absolutely confidential,--not to be disclosed by Greeley to his nearest friend, or any of his subordinates., He will be, in effect, my mouthpiece, but I must not be known to be the speaker., I need not tell you that I have the highest confidence in Mr. Greeley., He is a great power., Having him firmly behind me will be as helpful to me as an army of one hundred thousand men., ...]"|3
65|"[If useful, no State should be denied them; if not useful, no State should have them., Let them be provided for all or abolished as to all., Three modifications occur to me, either of which, I think, would be an improvement upon our present system., Let the Supreme Court be of convenient number in every event; then, first, let the whole country be divided into circuits of convenient size, the Supreme judges to serve in a number of them corresponding to their own number, and independent circuit judges be provided for all the rest; or, secondly, let the Supreme judges be relieved from circuit duties and circuit judges provided for all the circuits; or, thirdly, dispense with circuit courts altogether, leaving the judicial functions wholly to the district courts and an independent Supreme Court., I respectfully recommend to the consideration of Congress the present condition of the statute laws, with the hope that Congress will be able to find an easy remedy for many of the inconveniences and evils which constantly embarrass those engaged in the practical administration of them., Since the Organization of the government, Congress has enacted some 5000 acts and joint resolutions, which fill more than 6000 closely printed pages and are scattered through many volumes., Many of these acts have been drawn in haste and without sufficient caution, so that their provisions are often obscure in themselves or in conflict with each other, or at least so doubtful as to render it very difficult for even the best-informed persons to ascertain precisely what the statute law really is., It seems to me very important that the statute laws should be made as plain and intelligible as possible, and be reduced to as small a compass as may consist with the fullness and precision of the will of the Legislature and the perspicuity of its language., This well done would, I think, greatly facilitate the labors of those whose duty it is to assist in the administration of the laws, and would be a lasting benefit to the people, by placing before them in a more accessible and intelligible form the laws which so deeply concern their interests and their duties., I am informed by some whose opinions I respect that all the acts of Congress now in force and of a permanent and general nature might be revised and rewritten so as to be embraced in one volume (or at most two volumes) of ordinary and convenient size; and I respectfully recommend to Congress to consider of the subject, and if my suggestion be approved to devise such plan as to their wisdom shall seem most proper for the attainment of the end proposed., One of the unavoidable consequences of the present insurrection is the entire suppression in many places of all the ordinary means of administering civil justice by the officers and in the forms of existing law., This is the case, in whole or in part, in all the insurgent States; and as our armies advance upon and take possession of parts of those States the practical evil becomes more apparent., There are no courts or officers to whom the citizens of other States may apply for the enforcement of their lawful claims against citizens of the insurgent States, and there is a vast amount of debt constituting such claims., Some have estimated it as high as $200,000,000, due in large part from insurgents in open rebellion to loyal citizens who are even now making great sacrifices in the discharge of their patriotic duty to support the government., Under these circumstances I have been urgently solicited to establish, by military power, courts to administer summary justice in such cases., I have thus far declined to do it, not because I had any doubt that the end proposed--the collection of the debts--was just and right in itself, but because I have been unwilling to go beyond the pressure of necessity in the unusual exercise of power., But the powers of Congress, I suppose, are equal to the anomalous occasion, and therefore I refer the whole matter to Congress, with the hope that a plan maybe devised for the administration of justice in all such parts of the insurgent States and Territories as may be under the control of this government, whether by a voluntary return to allegiance and order or by the power of our arms; this, however, not to be a permanent institution, but a temporary substitute, and to cease as soon as the ordinary courts can be reestablished in peace., It is important that some more convenient means should be provided, if possible, for the adjustment of claims against the government, especially in view of their increased number by reason of the war., It is as much the duty of government to render prompt justice against itself in favor of citizens as it is to administer the same between private individuals., The investigation and adjudication of claims in their nature belong to the judicial department., Besides, it is apparent that the attention of Congress will be more than usually engaged for some time to come with great national questions., It was intended by the organization of the Court of Claims mainly to remove this branch of business from the halls of Congress; but, while the court has proved to be an effective and valuable means of investigation, it in great degree fails to effect the object of its creation for want of power to make its judgments final., Fully aware of the delicacy, not to say the danger of the subject, I commend to your careful consideration whether this power of making judgments final may not properly be given to the court, reserving the right of appeal on questions of law to the Supreme Court, with such other provisions as experience may have shown to be necessary., I ask attention to the report of the Postmaster general, the following being a summary statement of the condition of the department:  The revenue from all sources during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1861, including the annual permanent appropriation of $700,000 for the transportation of ""free mail matter,"" was $9,049,296.40, being about 2 per cent., less than the revenue for 1860., The expenditures were $13,606,759.11, showing a decrease of more than 8 per cent., as compared with those of the previous year and leaving an excess of expenditure over the revenue for the last fiscal year of $4,557,462.71., The gross revenue for the year ending June 30, 1863, is estimated at an increase of 4 per cent., on that of 1861, making $8,683,000, to which should be added the earnings of the department in carrying free matter, viz., $700,000, making $9,383,000., The total expenditures for 1863 are estimated at $12,528,000, leaving an estimated deficiency of $3,145,000 to be supplied from the treasury in addition to the permanent appropriation., The present insurrection shows, I think, that the extension of this District across the Potomac River at the time of establishing the capital here was eminently wise, and consequently that the relinquishment of that portion of it which lies within the State of Virginia was unwise and dangerous., I submit for your consideration the expediency of regaining that part of the District and the restoration of the original boundaries thereof through negotiations with the State of Virginia., The report of the Secretary of the Interior, with the accompanying documents, exhibits the condition of the several branches of the public business pertaining to that department., The depressing influences of the insurrection have been specially felt in the operations of the Patent and General Land Offices., The cash receipts from the sales of public lands during the past year have exceeded the expenses of our land system only about $200,000., The sales have been entirely suspended in the Southern States, while the interruptions to the business of the country and the diversion of large numbers of men from labor to military service have obstructed settlements in the new States and Territories of the Northwest., The receipts of the Patent Office have declined in nine months about $100,000.00 rendering a large reduction of the force employed necessary to make it self-sustaining., The demands upon the Pension Office will be largely increased by the insurrection., Numerous applications for pensions, based upon the casualties of the existing war, have already been made., There is reason to believe that many who are now upon the pension rolls and in receipt of the bounty of the government are in the ranks of the insurgent army or giving them aid and comfort., The Secretary of the Interior has directed a suspension of the payment of the pensions of such persons upon proof of their disloyalty., I recommend that Congress authorize that officer to cause the names of such persons to be stricken from the pension rolls., The relations of the government with the Indian tribes have been greatly disturbed by the insurrection, especially in the southern superintendency and in that of New Mexico., The Indian country south of Kansas is in the possession of insurgents from Texas and Arkansas., The agents of the United States appointed since the 4th of March for this superintendency have been unable to reach their posts, while the most of those who were in office before that time have espoused the insurrectionary cause, and assume to exercise the powers of agents by virtue of commissions from the insurrectionists., It has been stated in the public press that a portion of those Indians have been organized as a military force and are attached to the army of the insurgents., Although the government has no official information upon this subject, letters have been written to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs by several prominent chiefs giving assurance of their loyalty to the United States and expressing a wish for the presence of Federal troops to protect them., It is believed that upon the repossession of the country by the Federal forces the Indians will readily cease all hostile demonstrations and resume their former relations to the government., Agriculture, confessedly the largest interest of the nation, has not a department nor a bureau, but a clerkship only, assigned to it in the government., While it is fortunate that this great interest is so independent in its nature as not to have demanded and extorted more from the government, I respectfully ask Congress to consider whether something more cannot be given voluntarily with general advantage., Annual reports exhibiting the condition of our agriculture, commerce, and manufactures would present a fund of information of great practical value to the country., While I make no suggestion as to details, I venture the opinion that an agricultural and statistical bureau might profitably be organized., The execution of the laws for the suppression of the African slave trade has been confided to the Department of the Interior., It is a subject of gratulation that the efforts which have been made for the suppression of this inhuman traffic have been recently attended with unusual success., Five vessels being fitted out for the slave trade have been seized and condemned., Two mates of vessels engaged in the trade and one person in equipping a vessel as a slaver have been convicted and subjected to the penalty of fine and imprisonment, and one captain, taken with a cargo of Africans on board his vessel, has been convicted of the highest grade of offense under our laws, the punishment of which is death., The Territories of Colorado, Dakota, and Nevada, created by the last Congress, have been organized, and civil administration has been inaugurated therein under auspices especially gratifying when it is considered that the leaven of treason was found existing in some of these new countries when the Federal officers arrived there., The abundant natural resources of these Territories, with the security and protection afforded by organized government, will doubtless invite to them a large immigration when peace shall restore the business of the country to its accustomed channels., I submit the resolutions of the Legislature of Colorado, which evidence the patriotic spirit of the people of the Territory., So far the authority of the United States has been upheld in all the Territories, as it is hoped it will be in the future., I commend their interests and defense to the enlightened and generous care of Congress., I recommend to the favorable consideration of Congress the interests of the District of Columbia., The insurrection has been the cause of much suffering and sacrifice to its inhabitants, and as they have no representative in Congress that body should not overlook their just claims upon the government., At your late session a joint resolution was adopted authorizing the President to take measures for facilitating a proper representation of the industrial interests of the United States at the exhibition of the industry of all nations to be holden at London in the year 1862., I regret to say I have been unable to give personal attention to this subject--a subject at once so interesting in itself and so extensively and intimately connected with the material prosperity of the world., Through the Secretaries of State and of the Interior a plan or system has been devised and partly matured, and which will be laid before you., Under and by virtue of the act of Congress entitled ""An act to confiscate property used for insurrectionary purposes,"" approved August 6, 1861, the legal claims of certain persons to the labor and service of certain other persons have become forfeited, and numbers of the latter thus liberated are already dependent on the United States, and must be provided for in some way., Besides this, it is not impossible that some of the States will pass similar enactments for their own benefit respectively, and by operation of which persons of the same class will be thrown upon them for disposal., In such case I recommend that Congress provide for accepting such persons from such States, according to some mode of valuation, in lieu, pro tanto, of direct taxes, or upon some other plan to be agreed on with such States respectively; that such persons, on such acceptance by the General Government, be at once deemed free, and that in any event steps be taken for colonizing both classes (or the one first mentioned if the other shall not be brought into existence) at some place or places in a climate congenial to them., It might be well to consider, too, whether the free colored people already in the United States could not, so far as individuals may desire, be included in such colonization., To carry out the plan of colonization may involve the acquiring of territory, and also the appropriation of money beyond that to be expended in the territorial acquisition., Having practised the acquisition of territory for nearly sixty years, the question of constitutional power to do so is no longer an open one with us., The power was questioned at first by Mr. Jefferson, who, however, in the purchase of Louisiana, yielded his scruples on the plea of great expediency., If it be said that the only legitimate object of acquiring territory is to furnish homes for white men, this measure effects that object, for emigration of colored men leaves additional room for white men remaining or coming here., Mr. Jefferson, however, placed the importance of procuring Louisiana more on political and commercial grounds than on providing room for population., On this whole proposition, including the appropriation of money with the acquisition of territory, does not the expediency amount to absolute necessity--that without which the government itself cannot be perpetuated?, The war continues., In considering the policy to be adopted for suppressing the insurrection I have been anxious and careful that the inevitable conflict for this purpose shall not degenerate into a violent and remorseless revolutionary struggle., I have therefore in every case thought it proper to keep the integrity of the Union prominent as the primary object of the contest on our part, leaving all questions which are not of vital military importance to the more deliberate action of the Legislature., In the exercise of my best discretion I have adhered to the blockade of the ports held by the insurgents, instead of putting in force by proclamation the law of Congress enacted at the late session for closing those ports., So also, obeying the dictates of prudence, as well as the obligations of law, instead of transcending I have adhered to the act of Congress to confiscate property used for insurrectionary purposes., If a new law upon the same subject shall be proposed, its propriety will be duly considered., The Union must be preserved, and hence all indispensable means must be employed., We should not be in haste to determine that radical and extreme measures, which may reach the loyal as well as the disloyal, are indispensable., The inaugural address at the beginning of the Administration and the message to Congress at the late special session were both mainly devoted to topics domestic controversy out of which the insurrection and consequent war have sprung., Nothing now occurs to add or subtract to or from the principles or general purposes stated and expressed in those documents., The last ray of hope for preserving the Union peaceably expired at the assault upon Fort Sumter, and a general review of what has occurred since may not be unprofitable., What was painfully uncertain then is much better defined and more distinct now, and the progress of events is plainly in the right direction., The insurgents confidently claimed a strong support from north of Mason and Dixon's line, and the friends of the Union were not free from apprehension on the point., This, however, was soon settled definitely, and on the right side., South of the line noble little Delaware led off right from the first., Maryland was made to seem against the Union., Our soldiers were assaulted, bridges were burned, and railroads torn up within her limits, and we were many days at one time without the ability to bring a single regiment over her soil to the capital., Now her bridges and railroads are repaired and open to the government; she already gives seven regiments to the cause of the Union, and none to the enemy; and her people, at a regular election, have sustained the Union by a larger majority and a larger aggregate vote than they ever before gave to any candidate or any question., Kentucky, too, for some time in doubt, is now decidedly and, I think, unchangeably ranged on the side of the Union., Missouri is comparatively quiet, and, I believe, can, not again be overrun by the insurrectionists., These three States of Maryland, Kentucky, and Missouri, neither of which would promise a single soldier at first, have now an aggregate of not less than forty thousand in the field for the Union, while of their citizens certainly not more than a third of that number, and they of doubtful whereabouts and doubtful existence, are in arms against us., After a somewhat bloody struggle of months, winter closes on the Union people of western Virginia, leaving them masters of their own country., An insurgent force of about fifteen hundred, for months dominating the narrow peninsular region constituting the counties of Accomac and Northampton, and known as Eastern Shore of Virginia, together with some contiguous parts of Maryland, have laid down their arms, and the people there have renewed their allegiance to and accepted the protection of the old flag., This leaves no armed insurrectionist north of the Potomac or east of the Chesapeake., ...]"|3
66|"[Please do not lose time in this matter., In view of the recent declaration of the people of Maryland of their adhesion to the Union, so distinctly made in their recent election, the President directs that all the prisoners who having heretofore been arrested in that State are now detained in military custody by the President's authority, be released from their imprisonment on the following conditions, namely: that if they were holding any civil or military offices when arrested, the terms of which have expired, they shall not resume or reclaim such office; and secondly, all persons availing themselves of this proclamation shall engage by oath or parole of honor to maintain the Union and the Constitution of the United States, and in no way to aid or abet by arms, counsel, conversation, or information of any kind the existing insurrection against the Government of the United States., To guard against misapprehension it is proper to state that this proclamation does not apply to prisoners of war., I transmit to Congress a copy of a letter to the Secretary of State from James R. Partridge, secretary to the executive committee to the in exhibition to be held in London in the course present year, and a copy of the correspond which it refers, relative to a vessel for the of taking such articles as persons in this country may wish to exhibit on that occasion., As it appears no naval vessel can be spared for the purpose, I recommend that authority be given to charter a suitable merchant vessel, in order that facilities similar to those afforded by the government exhibition of 1851 may also be extended to citizens of the United States who may desire to contribute to the exhibition of this year., Have arms gone forward for East Tennessee?, Please tell me the progress and condition of the movement in that direction., Answer., Your despatch of yesterday has been received, and it disappoints and distresses me., I have shown it to General McClellan, who says he will write you to-day., I am not competent to criticize your views, and therefore what I offer is in justification of myself., Of the two, I would rather have a point on the railroad south of Cumberland Gap than Nashville., First, because it cuts a great artery of the enemy's communication, which Nashville does not; and secondly, because it is in the midst of loyal people who would rally around it, while Nashville is not., Again, I cannot see why the movement on East Tennessee would not be a diversion in your favor rather than a disadvantage, assuming that a movement toward Nashville is the main object., But my distress is that our friends in East Tennessee are being hanged and driven to despair, and even now, I fear, are thinking of taking rebel arms for the sake of personal protection., In this we lose the most valuable stake we have in the South., My despatch, to which yours is an answer, was sent with the knowledge of Senator Johnson and Representative Maynard of East Tennessee, and they will be upon me to know the answer, which I cannot safely show them., They would despair, possibly resign to go and save their families somehow, or die with them., I do not intend this to be an order in any sense, but merely, as intimated before, to show you the grounds of my anxiety., Please name as early a day as you safely can on or before which you can be ready to move southward in concert with Major-General Halleck., Delay is ruining us, and it is indispensable for me to have something definite., I send a like despatch to Major-General Halleck., I transmit to Congress a translation of an instruction to the minister of his Majesty the Emperor of Austria accredited to this government, and a copy of a note to that minister from the Secretary of State relative to the questions involved in the taking from the British steamer Trent of certain citizens of the United States by order of Captain Wilkes of the United States Navy., This correspondence may be considered as a sequel to that previously communicated to Congress relating to the same subject., In reply to your Excellency's letter of the 1st instant, I have to state that on receiving your telegram I immediately communicated with General Buell and have since sent him all the information I could obtain of the enemy's movements about Columbus and Camp Beauregard., No considerable force has been sent from those places to Bowling Green., They have about 22,000 men at Columbus, and the place is strongly fortified., I have at Cairo, Port Holt, and Paducah only about 15,000, which, after leaving guards at these places, would give me but little over 10,000 men with which to assist General Buell., It would be madness to attempt anything serious with such a force, and I cannot at the present time withdraw any from Missouri without risking the loss of this State., The troops recently raised in other States of this department have, without my knowledge, been sent to Kentucky and Kansas., I am satisfied that the authorities at Washington do not appreciate the difficulties with which we have to contend here., The operations of Lane, Jennison, and others have so enraged the people of Missouri that it is estimated that there is a majority of 80,000 against the government., We are virtually in an enemy's country., Price and others have a considerable army in the southwest, against which I am operating with all my available force., This city and most of the middle and northern counties are insurrectionary,--burning bridges, destroying telegraph lines, etc.,--and can be kept down only by the presence of troops., A large portion of the foreign troops organized by General Fremont are unreliable; indeed, many of them are already mutinous., They have been tampered with by politicians, and made to believe that if they get up a mutiny and demand Fremont's return the government will be forced to restore him to duty here., It is believed that some high officers are in the plot I have already been obliged to disarm several of these organizations, and I am daily expecting more serious outbreaks., Another grave difficulty is the want of proper general officers to command the troops and enforce order and discipline, and especially to protect public property from robbery and plunder., Some of the brigadier-generals assigned to this department are entirely ignorant of their duties and unfit for any command., I assure you, Mr. President, it is very difficult to accomplish much with such means., I am in the condition of a carpenter who is required to build a bridge with a dull axe, a broken saw, and rotten timber., It is true that I have some very good green timber, which will answer the purpose as soon as I can get it into shape and season it a little., I know nothing of General Buell's intended operations, never having received any information in regard to the general plan of campaign., If it be intended that his column shall move on Bowling Green while another moves from Cairo or Paducah on Columbus or Camp Beauregard, it will be a repetition of the same strategic error which produced the disaster of Bull Run., To operate on exterior lines against an enemy occupying a central position will fail, as it always has failed, in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred., It is condemned by every military authority I have ever read., General Buell's army and the forces at Paducah occupy precisely the same position in relation to each other and to the enemy as did the armies of McDowell and Patterson before the battle of Bull Run., I will be greatly obliged if you will arrange; somehow with General Butler to officer his two un-officered regiments., Your despatch of yesterday is received, in which you say, ""I received your letter and General McClellan's, and will at once devote my efforts to your views and his."", In the midst of my many cares I have not seen, nor asked to see, General McClellan's letter to you., For my own views, I have not offered and do not now offer them as orders; and while I am glad to have them respectfully considered, I would blame you to follow them contrary to your own clear judgment, unless I should put them in the form of orders., As to General McClellan's views, you understand your duty in regard to them better than I do., With this preliminary I state my general idea of this war to be, that we have the greater numbers and the enemy has the greater facility of concentrating forces upon points of collision; that we must fail unless we can find some way of making our advantage an overmatch for his; and that this can only be done by menacing him with superior forces at different points at the same time, so that we can safely attack one or both if he makes no change; and if he weakens one to strengthen the other, forbear to attack the strengthened one, but seize and hold the weakened one, gaining so much., To illustrate: Suppose last summer, when Winchester ran away to reinforce Manassas, we had forborne to attack Manassas, but had seized and held Winchester., I mention this to illustrate and not to criticise., I did not lose confidence in McDowell, and I think less harshly of Patterson than some others seem to...., Applying the principle to your case, my idea is that Halleck shall menace Columbus and ""down river"" generally, while you menace Bowling Green and East Tennessee., If the enemy shall concentrate at Bowling Green, do not retire from his front, yet do not fight him there either, but seize Columbus and East Tennessee, one or both, left exposed by the concentration at Bowling Green., It is a matter of no small anxiety to me, and which I am sure you will not overlook, that the East Tennessee line is so long and over so bad a road., Having to-day written General Buell a letter, it occurs to me to send General Halleck a copy of it., The Germans are true and patriotic and so far as they have got cross in Missouri it is upon mistake and misunderstanding., Without a knowledge of its contents, Governor Koerner, of Illinois, will hand you this letter., He is an educated and talented German gentleman, as true a man as lives., With his assistance you can set everything right with the Germans.... My clear judgment is that, with reference to the German element in your command, you should have Governor Koerner with you; and if agreeable to you and him, I will make him a brigadier-general, so that he can afford to give his time., He does not wish to command in the field, though he has more military knowledge than some who do., If he goes into the place, he will simply be an efficient, zealous, and unselfish assistant to you., I say all this upon intimate personal acquaintance with Governor Koerner., I transmit to Congress a translation of an instruction to the minister of his Majesty the King of Prussia accredited to this government, and a copy of a note to that minister from the Secretary of State relating to the capture and detention of certain citizens of the United States, passengers on board the British steamer Trent, by order of Captain Wilkes of the United States Navy., You or any officer you may designate will in your discretion suspend the writ of habeas corpus so far as may relate to Major Chase, lately of the Engineer Corps of the Army of the United States, now alleged to be guilty of treasonable practices against this government., Ordered, That the 22d day of February, 1862, be the day for a general movement of the land and the naval forces of the United States against the insurgent forces., That especially the army at and about Fortress Monroe, the Army of the Potomac, the Army of Western Virginia, the army near Munfordville, Kentucky, the army and flotilla at Cairo, and a naval force in the Gulf of Mexico, be ready for a movement on that day., That all other forces, both land and naval, with their respective commanders, obey existing orders for the time, and be ready to obey additional orders when duly given., That the heads of departments, and especially the Secretaries of War and of the Navy, with all their subordinates, and the General-in-chief, with all other commanders and subordinates of land and naval forces, will severally be held to their strict and full responsibilities for the prompt execution of this order., It is my wish that the expedition commonly called the ""Lane Expedition"" shall be, as much as has been promised at the adjutant-general's office, under the supervision of General McClellan, and not any more., I have not intended, and do not now intend, that it shall be a great, exhausting affair, but a snug, sober column of 10,000 or 15,000., General Lane has been told by me many times that he is under the command of General Hunter, and assented to it as often as told., It was the distinct agreement between him and me, when I appointed him, that he was to be under Hunter., Ordered, That all the disposable force of the Army of the Potomac, after providing safely for the defence of Washington, be formed into an expedition for the immediate object of seizing and occupying a point upon the railroad southwestward of what is known as Manassas Junction, all details to be in the discretion of the commander-in-chief, and the expedition to move before or on the 22d day of February next., You and I have distinct and different plans for a movement of the Army of the Potomac--yours to be down the Chesapeake, up the Rappahannock to Urbana, and across land to the terminus of the railroad on the York River; mine to move directly to a point on the railroad southwest of Manassas., If you will give me satisfactory answers to the following questions, I shall gladly yield my plan to yours., First., Does not your plan involve a greatly larger expenditure of time and money than mine?, Second., Wherein is a victory more certain by your plan than mine?, Third., Wherein is a victory more valuable by your plan than mine?, Fourth., In fact, would it not be less valuable in this, that it would break no great line of the enemy's communications, while mine would?, Fifth., In case of disaster, would not a retreat be more difficult by your plan than mine?, First., Suppose the enemy should attack us in force before we reach the Occoquan, what?, Second., Suppose the enemy in force shall dispute the crossing of the Occoquan, what?, In view of this, might it not be safest for us to cross the Occoquan at Coichester, rather than at the village of Occoquan?, This would cost the enemy two miles of travel to meet us, but would, on the contrary, leave us two miles farther from our ultimate destination., Third., Suppose we reach Maple Valley without an attack, will we not be attacked there in force by the enemy marching by the several roads from Manassas; and if so, what?, Yours of January 30th just received., ...]"|3
67|"[In the annual message last December, I thought fit to say, ""The Union must be preserved, and hence all indispensable means must be employed."", I said this not hastily, but deliberately., War has been made and continues to be an indispensable means to this end., A practical reacknowledgment of the national authority would render the war unnecessary, and it would at once cease., If, however, resistance continues, the war must also continue; and it is impossible to foresee all the incidents which may attend and all the ruin which may follow it., Such as may seem indispensable or may obviously promise great efficiency toward ending the struggle must and will come., The proposition now made (though an offer only), I hope it may be esteemed no offense to ask whether the pecuniary consideration tendered would not be of more value to the States and private persons concerned than are the institution and property in it in the present aspect of affairs., While it is true that the adoption of the proposed resolution would be merely initiatory, and not within itself a practical measure, it is recommended in the hope that it would soon lead to important practical results., In full view of my great responsibility to my God and to my country, I earnestly beg the attention of Congress and the people to the subject., The government at my special request a few months since contracted for fourteen batteries of the James rifled gun, 6-pounder calibre, and a limited quantity of the James projectiles, weighing about fourteen pounds each., The reports showing the superiority of this gun and projectile, both as regards range, accuracy, and execution, for field service over that of all others at the battle of Fort Donelson, leads me to request that there be furnished to the State of Illinois in the shortest time practicable seven batteries of 12-pounder calibre James rifled guns, with carriages, harness, implements, etc., complete and ready for field service, together with the following fixed ammunition to each gun, viz., 225 shells, 225 canister, and 50 solid projectiles, weighing about 24 pounds each, and also 200 shells, 100 canister, and 100 solid projectiles for each of the guns of the fourteen batteries named above, weighing about 14 pounds each, all to be of the James model., The within is from the Governor of Illinois., I understand the seven additional batteries now sought are to be 6-gun batteries, and the object is to mix them with the fourteen batteries they already have so as to make each battery consist of four 6-pounders and two 12-pounders., I shall be very glad to have the requisition filled if it can be without detriment to the service., Ordered: 1., That the major-general commanding the Army of the Potomac proceed forthwith to organize that part of the said army destined to enter upon active operations (including the reserve, but excluding the troops to be left in the fortifications about Washington) into four army corps, to be commanded according to seniority of rank, as follows:  First Corps to consist of four divisions, and to be commanded by Major-General I. McDowell., Second Corps to consist of three divisions, and to be commanded by Brigadier-General E. V. Sumner., Third Corps to consist of three divisions, and to be commanded by Brigadier-General S. P. Heintzelman., Fourth Corps to consist of three divisions, and to be commanded by Brigadier-General E. D. Keyes., 2., That the divisions now commanded by the officers above assigned to the commands of army corps shall be embraced in and form part of their respective corps., 3., The forces left for the defense of Washington will be placed in command of Brigadier-General James S. Wadsworth, who shall also be military governor of the District of Columbia., 4., That this order be executed with such promptness and dispatch as not to delay the commencement of the operations already directed to be underwritten by the Army of the Potomac., 5., A fifth army corps, to be commanded by Major general N. P. Banks, will be formed from his own and General Shields's (late General Lander's) divisions., Ordered: That no change of the base of operations of the Army of the Potomac shall be made without leaving in and about Washington such a force as in the opinion of the general-in-chief and the commanders of all the army corps shall leave said city entirely secure., That no more than two army corps (about 50,000 troops) of said Army of the Potomac shall be moved en route for a new base of operations until the navigation of the Potomac from Washington to the Chesapeake Bay shall be freed from enemy's batteries and other obstructions, or until the President shall hereafter give express permission., That any movements as aforesaid en route for a new base of operations which may be ordered by the general-in-chief, and which may be intended to move upon the Chesapeake Bay, shall begin to move upon the bay as early as the 18th day of March instant, and the general-in-chief shall be responsible that it so move as early as that day., Ordered, That the army and navy co-operate in an immediate effort to capture the enemy's batteries upon the Potomac between Washington and the Chesapeake Bay., Yesterday, on my return from church, I found Mr. Postmaster-General Blair in my room, writing the above note, which he immediately suspended, and verbally communicated the President's invitation, and stated that the President's purpose was to have some conversation with the delegations of Kentucky, Missouri, Maryland, Virginia, and Delaware, in explanation of his message of the 6th instant., This morning these delegations, or such of them as were in town, assembled at the White House at the appointed time, and after some little delay were admitted to an audience., Mr. Leary and myself were the only members from Maryland present, and, I think, were the only members of the delegation at that time in the city., I know that Mr. Pearoe, of the Senate, and Messrs. Webster and Calvert, of the House, were absent., After the usual salutations, and we were seated, the President said, in substance, that he had invited us to meet him to have some conversation with us in explanation of his message of the 6th; that since he had sent it in several of the gentlemen then present had visited him, but had avoided any allusion to the message, and he therefore inferred that the import of the message had been misunderstood, and was regarded as inimical to the interests we represented; and he had resolved he would talk with us, and disabuse our minds of that erroneous opinion., The President then disclaimed any intent to injure the interests or wound the sensibilities of the slave States., On the contrary, his purpose was to protect the one and respect the other; that we were engaged in a terrible, wasting, and tedious war; immense armies were in the field, and must continue in the field as long as the war lasts; that these armies must, of necessity, be brought into contact with slaves in the States we represented and in other States as they advanced; that slaves would come to the camps, and continual irritation was kept up; that he was constantly annoyed by conflicting and antagonistic complaints: on the one side a certain class complained if the slave was not protected by the army; persons were frequently found who, participating in these views, acted in a way unfriendly to the slaveholder; on the other hand, slaveholders complained that their rights were interfered with, their slaves induced to abscond and protected within the lines; these complaints were numerous, loud and deep; were a serious annoyance to him and embarrassing to the progress of the war; that it kept alive a spirit hostile to the government in the States we represented; strengthened the hopes of the Confederates that at some day the border States would unite with them, and thus tend to prolong the war; and he was of opinion, if this resolution should be adopted by Congress and accepted by our States, these causes of irritation and these hopes would be removed, and more would be accomplished toward shortening the war than could be hoped from the greatest victory achieved by Union armies; that he made this proposition in good faith, and desired it to be accepted, if at all, voluntarily, and in the same patriotic spirit in which it was made; that emancipation was a subject exclusively under the control of the States, and must be adopted or rejected by each for itself; that he did not claim nor had this government any right to coerce them for that purpose; that such was no part of his purpose in making this proposition, and he wished it to be clearly understood; that he did not expect us there to be prepared to give him an answer, but he hoped we would take the subject into serious consideration, confer with one another, and then take such course as we felt our duty and the interests of our constituents required of us., The President replied that he must not be expected to quarrel with the New York Tribune before the right time; he hoped never to have to do it; he would not anticipate events., In respect to emancipation in Missouri, he said that what had been observed by Mr. Noell was probably true, but the operation of these natural causes had not prevented the irritating conduct to which he had referred, or destroyed the hopes of the Confederates that Missouri would at some time merge herself alongside of them, which, in his judgment, the passage of this resolution by Congress and its acceptance by Missouri would accomplish., The President replied that he had no designs beyond the actions of the States on this particular subject., He should lament their refusal to accept it, but he had no designs beyond their refusal of it., The President replied that he thought there could not be., He then went off into a course of remarks not qualifying the foregoing declaration nor material to be repeated to a just understanding of his meaning., The President replied that, unless he was expelled by the act of God or the Confederate armies he should occupy that house for three years; and as long as he remained there Maryland had nothing to fear either for her institutions or her interests on the points referred to., The President: ""That [meaning a publication of what he said] will not do; it would force me into a quarrel before the proper time ""; and, again intimating, as he had before done, that a quarrel with the ""Greeley faction"" was impending, he said he did not wish to encounter it before the proper time, nor at all if it could be avoided., The President replied: ""As you may suppose, I have considered that; and the proposition now submitted does not encounter any constitutional difficulty., It proposes simply to co-operate with any State by giving such State pecuniary aid""; and he thought that the resolution, as proposed by him, would be considered rather as the expression of a sentiment than as involving any constitutional question., The President said he saw and felt the force of the objection; it was a fearful responsibility, and every gentleman must do as he thought best; that he did not know how this scheme was received by the members from the free States; some of them had spoken to him and received it kindly; but for the most part they were as reserved and chary as we had been, and he could not tell how they would vote., And in reply to some expression of Mr. Hall as to his own opinion regarding slavery, he said he did not pretend to disguise his anti-slavery feeling; that he thought it was wrong, and should continue to think so; but that was not the question we had to deal with now., Slavery existed, and that, too, as well by the act of the North as of the South; and in any scheme to get rid of it the North as well as the South was morally bound to do its full and equal share., He thought the institution wrong and ought never to have existed; but yet he recognized the rights of property which had grown out of it, and would respect those rights as fully as similar rights in any other property; that property can exist and does legally exist., He thought such a law wrong, but the rights of property resulting must be respected; he would get rid of the odious law, not by violating the rights, but by encouraging the proposition and offering inducements to give it up., Major-General McClellan having personally taken the field at the head of the Army of the Potomac, until otherwise ordered he is relieved from the command of the other military departments, he retaining command of the Department of the Potomac., Ordered further, That the departments now under the respective commands of Generals Halleck and Hunter, together with so much of that under General Buell as lies west of a north and south line indefinitely drawn through Knoxville, Tenn., be consolidated and designated the Department of the Mississippi, and that until otherwise ordered Major General Halleck have command of said department., Ordered also, That the country west of the Department of the Potomac and east of the Department of the Mississippi be a military department, to be called the Mountain Department, and that the same be commanded by Major-General Fremont., That all the commanders of departments, after the receipt of this order by them, respectively report severally and directly to the Secretary of War, and that prompt, full, and frequent reports will be expected of all and each of them., The President, having considered the plan of operations agreed upon by yourself and the commanders of army corps, makes no objection to the same but gives the following directions as to its execution:  1., Leave such force at Manassas Junction as shall make it entirely certain that the enemy shall no repossess himself of that position and line of communication., 2., Leave Washington entirely secure., 3., Move the remainder of the force down the Potomac, choosing a new base at Fortress Monroe or anywhere between here and there, or, at all events, move such remainder of the army at once in pursuit of the enemy by some route., I thank you, Mr., Train, for your kindness in presenting me with this truly elegant and highly creditable specimen of the handiwork of the mechanics of your State of Massachusetts, and I beg of you to express my hearty thanks to the donors., It displays a perfection of workmanship which I really wish I had time to acknowledge in more fitting words, and I might then follow your idea that it is suggestive, for it is evidently expected that a good deal of whipping is to be done., But as we meet here socially let us not think only of whipping rebels, or of those who seem to think only of whipping negroes, but of those pleasant days, which it is to be hoped are in store for us, when seated behind a good pair of horses we can crack our whips and drive through a peaceful, happy, and prosperous land., With this idea, gentlemen, I must leave you for my business duties., In conformity with this law, Captain Samuel F. Du Pont, of the navy, was nominated to the Senate for continuance as the flag-officer in command of the squadron which recently rendered such important service to the Union in the expedition to the coasts of South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida., Believing that no occasion could arise which would more fully correspond with the intention of the law or be more pregnant with happy influence as an example, I cordially recommend that Captain Samuel F. Du Pont receive a vote of thanks of Congress for his service and gallantry displayed in the capture since the 21st December, 1861, of various ports on the coasts of Georgia and Florida, particularly Brunswick, Cumberland Island and Sound, Amelia Island, the towns of St. Mary's, St. Augustine, and Jacksonville and Fernandina., This morning I felt constrained to order Blenker's division to Fremont, and I write this to assure you I did so with great pain, understanding that you would wish it otherwise., If you could know the full pressure of the case, I am confident that you would justify it, even beyond a mere acknowledgment that the commander-in-chief may order what he pleases., Allow me to thank you in behalf of my little son for your present of white rabbits., He is very much pleased with them., The Secretary of War will order that one or the other of the corps of General McDowell and General Sumner remain in front of Washington until further orders from the department, to operate at or in the direction of Manassas Junction, or otherwise, as occasion may require; that the other Corps not so ordered to remain go forward to General McClellan as speedily as possible; that General McClellan commence his forward movements from his new base at once, and that such incidental modifications as the foregoing may render proper be also made., Yours of 11 A. M. today received., Secretary of War informs me that the forwarding of transportation, ammunition, and Woodbury's brigade, under your orders, is not, and will not be, interfered with., You now have over one hundred thousand troops with you, independent of General Wool's command., I think you better break the enemy's line from Yorktown to Warwick River at once., This will probably use time as advantageously as you can., Your despatches, complaining that you are not properly sustained, while they do not offend me, do pain me very much., Blenker's division was withdrawn from you before you left here, and you knew the pressure under which I did it, and, as I thought, acquiesced in it certainly not without reluctance., After you left I ascertained that less than 20,000 unorganized men, without a single field battery, were all you designed to be left for the defense of Washington and Manassas Junction, and part of this even to go to General Hooker's old position; General Banks's corps, once designed for Manassas Junction, was divided and tied up on the line of Winchester and Strasburg, and could not leave it without again exposing the upper Potomac and the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad., This presented (or would present when McDowell and Sumner should be gone) a great temptation to the enemy to turn back from the Rappahannock and sack Washington., My explicit order that Washington should, by the judgment of all the Commanders of corps, be left entirely secure, had been neglected., It was precisely this that drove me to detain McDowell., I do not forget that I was satisfied with your arrangement to leave Banks at Manassas Junction; but when that arrangement was broken up and nothing substituted for it, of course I was not satisfied., I was constrained to substitute something for it myself., And now allow me to ask, do you really think I should permit the line from Richmond via Manaasas Junction to this city to be entirely open, except what resistance could be presented by less than 20,000 unorganized troops?, This is a question which the country will not allow me to evade., There is a curious mystery about the number of the troops now with you., When I telegraphed you on the 6th, saying you had over 100,000 with you, I had just obtained from the Secretary of War a statement, taken as he said from your own returns, making 108,000 then with you and en route to you., You now say you will have but 85,000 when all enroute to you shall have reached you., How can this discrepancy of 23,000 be accounted for?, As to General Wool's command, I understand it is doing for you precisely what a like number of your own would have to do if that command was away., I suppose the whole force which has gone forward to you is with you by this time; and if so, I think it is the precise time for you to strike a blow., By delay the enemy will relatively gain upon you--that is, he will gain faster by fortifications and reinforcements than you can by reinforcements alone., And once more let me tell you it is indispensable to you that you strike a blow., I am powerless to help this., You will do me the justice to remember I always insisted that going down the bay in search of a field, instead of fighting at or near Manassas, was only shifting and not surmounting a difficulty; that we would find the same enemy and the same or equal entrenchments at either place., ...]"|3
68|"[I hope that upon your return to your homes you will find your friends and loved ones well and happy., I bid you farewell., What is the strength of your force now actually with you?, May 17, 1862., You will retain the separate command of the forces taken with you; but while co-operating with General McClellan you will obey his orders, except that you are to judge, and are not to allow your force to be disposed otherwise than so as to give the greatest protection to this capital which may be possible from that distance., The President having shown this to me, I suggested that it is dangerous to direct a subordinate not to obey the orders of his superior in any case, and that to give instructions to General McClellan to this same end and furnish General McDowell with a copy thereof would effect the object desired by the President., He desired me to say that the sketch of instructions to General McClellan herewith he thought made this addition unnecessary., No commanding general shall do such a thing upon my responsibility without consulting me., Your despatch to the President, asking reinforcements, has been received and carefully considered., The President is not willing to uncover the capital entirely; and it is believed that, even if this were prudent, it would require more time to effect a junction between your army and that of the Rappahannock by the way of the Potomac and York rivers than by a land march., In order, therefore, to increase the strength of the attack upon Richmond at the earliest moment, General McDowell has been ordered to march upon that city by the shortest route., He is ordered, keeping himself always in position to save the capital from all possible attack, so to operate as to put his left wing in communication with your right wing, and you are instructed to co-operate so as to establish this communication as soon as possible by extending your right-wing to the north of Richmond., It is believed that this communication can be safely established either north or south of the Pamunkey River., In any event, you will be able to prevent the main body of the enemy's forces from leaving Richmond and falling in overwhelming force upon General McDowell., He will move with between thirty-five and forty thousand men., A copy of the instructions to General McDowell are with this., The specific task assigned to his command has been to provide against any danger to the capital of the nation., At your earnest call for reinforcements, he is sent forward to co-operate in the reduction of Richmond, but charged, in attempting this, not to uncover the city of Washington; and you will give no order, either before or after your junction, which can put him out of position to cover this city., You and he will communicate with each other by telegraph or otherwise as frequently as may be necessary for efficient cooperation., When General McDowell is in position on your right, his supplies must be drawn from West Point, and you will instruct your staff-officers to be prepared to supply him by that route., The President desires that General McDowell retain the command of the Department of the Rappahannock and of the forces with which he moves forward., Whereas there appears in the public prints what purports to be a proclamation of Major general Hunter, in the words and figures following, to wit:  ""The three States of Georgia, Florida, and South Carolina, comprising the military department of the South, having deliberately declared themselves no longer under the protection of the United States of America, and having taken up arms against the said United States, it became a military necessity to declare martial law., This was accordingly done on the 25th day of April, 1862., Slavery and martial law in a free country are altogether incompatible., The persons in these three States: Georgia Florida, and South Carolina--heretofore held as slaves are therefore declared forever free., ""By command of Major-General D. Hunter: ""(Official.)ED., W. SMITH, ""Acting Assistant Adjutant-General."", And whereas the same is producing some excitement and misunderstanding: therefore,  I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States, proclaim and declare that the Government of the United States, had no knowledge, information, or belief of an intention on the part of General Hunter to issue such a proclamation; nor has it yet any authentic information that the document is genuine., And further, that neither General Hunter nor any other commander or person has been authorized by the Government of the United States to make a proclamation declaring the slaves of any State free; and that the supposed proclamation now in question, whether genuine or false, is altogether void so far as respects such a declaration., I further make known that whether it be competent for me, as commander-in-chief of the army and navy, to declare the slaves of any State or States free, and whether, at any time, in any case, it shall have become a necessity indispensable to the maintenance of the government to exercise such supposed power, are questions which under my responsibility I reserve to myself, and which I cannot feel justified in leaving to the decision of commanders in the field., These are totally different questions from those of police regulations in armies and camps., On the sixth day of March last, by special message, I recommended to Congress the adoption of a joint resolution, to be substantially as follows:  Resolved, That the United States ought to co-operate with any State which may adopt gradual abolishment of slavery, giving to such State pecuniary aid, to be used by such State, in its discretion, to compensate for the inconvenience, public and private, produced by such change of system., The resolution in the language above quoted was adopted by large majorities in both branches of Congress, and now stands an authentic, definite, and solemn proposal of the nation to the States and people most immediately interested in the subject-matter., To the people of those States I now earnestly appeal., I do not argue--I beseech you to make arguments for yourselves., You cannot, if you would, be blind to the signs of the times., I beg of you a calm and enlarged consideration of them, ranging, if it may be, far above personal and partisan politics., This proposal makes common cause for a common object, casting no reproaches upon any., It acts not the Pharisee., The change it contemplates would come gently as the dews of heaven, not rending or wrecking anything., Will you not embrace it?, So much good has not been done, by one effort, in all past time, as in the providence of God it is now your high privilege to do., May the vast future not have to lament that you have neglected it., In witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed., Done at the city of Washington, this nineteenth day of May, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-two, and of the independence of the United States the eighty-sixth., I have just been waited on by a large committee who present a petition signed by twenty-three senators and eighty-four representatives asking me to restore General Hamilton to his division., I wish to do this, and yet I do not wish to be understood as rebuking you., Please answer at once., Your long despatch of yesterday just received., You will have just such control of General McDowell and his forces as you therein indicate., McDowell can reach you by land sooner than he could get aboard of boats, if the boats were ready at Fredericksburg, unless his march shall be resisted, in which case the force resisting him will certainly not be confronting you at Richmond., By land he can reach you in five days after starting, whereas by water he would not reach you in two weeks, judging by past experience., Franklin's single division did not reach you in ten days after I ordered it., In consequence of General Banks's critical position, I have been compelled to suspend General McDowell's movements to join you., The enemy are making a desperate push upon Harper's Ferry, and we are trying to throw General Fremont's force and part of General McDowell's in their rear., I left General McDowell's camp at dark last evening., Shields's command is there, but it is so worn that he cannot move before Monday morning, the 26th., We have so thinned our line to get troops for other places that it was broken yesterday at Front Royal, with a probable loss to us of one regiment infantry, two Companies cavalry, putting General Banks in some peril., The enemy's forces under General Anderson now opposing General McDowell's advance have as their line of supply and retreat the road to Richmond., If, in conjunction with McDowell's movement against Anderson, you could send a force from your right to cut off the enemy's supplies from Richmond, preserve the railroad bridges across the two forks of the Pamunkey, and intercept the enemy's retreat, you will prevent the army now opposed to you from receiving an accession of numbers of nearly 15,000 men; and if you succeed in saving the bridges you will secure a line of railroad for supplies in addition to the one you now have., Can you not do this almost as well as not while you are building the Chickahominy bridges?, McDowell and Shields both say they can, and positively will, move Monday morning., I wish you to move cautiously and safely., You will have command of McDowell, after he joins you, precisely as you indicated in your long despatch to us of the 21st., Geary reports Jackson with 20,000 moving from Ashby's Gap by the Little River turnpike, through Aldie, toward Centreville., This he says is reliable., He is also informed of large forces south of him., We know a force of some 15,000 broke up Saturday night from in front of Fredericksburg and went we know not where., Please inform us, if possible, what has become of the force which pursued Banks yesterday; also any other information you have., Could you not send scouts from Winchester who would tell whether enemy are north of Banks, moving on Winchester?, What is the latest you have?, You are authorized to purchase the 400 horses, or take them wherever or however you can get them., The exposed condition of General Banks makes his immediate relief a point of paramount importance., You are therefore directed by the President to move against Jackson at Harrisonburg and operate against the enemy in such way as to relieve Banks., This movement must be made immediately., You will acknowledge the receipt of this order, and specify the hour it is received by you., Many thanks for the promptness with which you have answered that you will execute the order., Much--perhaps all--depends upon the celerity with which you can execute it., Put the utmost speed into it., Do not lose a minute., Several despatches from Assistant Secretary Scott and one from Governor Morton asking reinforcements for you have been received., I beg you to be assured we do the best we can., I mean to cast no blame where I tell you each of our commanders along our line from Richmond to Corinth supposes himself to be confronted by numbers superior to his own., Under this pressure We thinned the line on the upper Potomac, until yesterday it was broken with heavy loss to us, and General Banks put in great peril, out of which he is not yet extricated, and may be actually captured., We need men to repair this breach, and have them not at hand., My dear General, I feel justified to rely very much on you., I believe you and the brave officers and men with you can and will get the victory at Corinth., General Fremont has been ordered by telegraph to move from Franklin on Harrisonburg to relieve General Banks, and capture or destroy Jackson's and Ewell's forces., You are instructed, laying aside for the present the movement on Richmond, to put 20,000 men in motion at once for the Shenandoah, moving on the line or in advance of the line of the Manassas Gap railroad., Your object will be to capture the forces of Jackson and Ewell, either in co-operation with General Fremont, or, in case want of supplies or of transportation, interferes with his movements, it is believed that the force which you move will be sufficient to accomplish this object alone., The information thus far received here makes it probable that if the enemy operate actively against General Banks, you will not be able to count upon much assistance from him, but may even have to release him., Reports received this moment are that Banks is fighting with Ewell eight miles from Winchester., I am highly gratified by your alacrity in obeying my order., The change was as painful to me as it can possibly be to you or to any one., Everything now depends upon the celerity and vigor of your movement., Please give us your best present impression as to the number of the enemy's forces north of Strasburg and Front Royal., Are the forces still moving north through the gap at Front Royal and between you and there?, The enemy is moving north in sufficient force to drive General Banks before him--precisely in what force we cannot tell., He is also threatening Leesburg and Geary, on the Manassas Gap railroad, from both north and south--in precisely what force we cannot tell., I think the movement is a general and concerted one, such as would not be if he was acting upon the purpose of a very desperate defense of Richmond., ...]"|3
69|"[Concentrations of our force have been made, which it is hoped will capture the enemy., The President directs you to halt at Moorefield and await orders, unless you hear of the enemy being in the general direction of Rodney, in which case you will move upon him., Acknowledge the receipt of this order, and the hour it is received., General McClellan at 6.30 P.M. yesterday telegraphed that Fitz-John Porter's division had fought and driven 13,000 of the enemy, under General Branch, from Hanover Court-House, and was driving them from a stand they had made on the railroad at the time the messenger left., Two hours later he telegraphed that Stoneman had captured an engine and six cars on the Virginia Central, which he at once sent to communicate with Porter., Nothing further from McClellan., If Porter effects a lodgment on both railroads near Hanover Court-House, consider whether your forces in front of Fredericksburg should not push through and join him., What of F.J. Porter's expedition?, Please answer., You say General Geary's scouts report that they find no enemy this side of the Blue Ridge., Neither do I., Have they been to the Blue Ridge looking for them., I think the evidence now preponderates that Ewell and Jackson are still about Winchester., Assuming this, it is for you a question of legs., Put in all the speed you can., I have told Fremont as much, and directed him to drive at them as fast as possible., By the way, I suppose you know Fremont has got up to Moorefield, instead of going into Harrisonburg., I am very glad of General F. J. Porter's victory., Still, if it was a total rout of the enemy, I am puzzled to know why the Richmond and Fredericksburg railroad was not seized again, as you say you have all the railroads but the Richmond and Fredericksburg., I am puzzled to see how, lacking that, you can have any, except the scrap from Richmond to West Point., The scrap of the Virginia Central from Richmond to Hanover Junction, without more, is simply nothing., That the whole of the enemy is concentrating on Richmond, I think cannot be certainly known to you or me., Saxton, at Harper's Ferry informs us that large forces, supposed to be Jackson's and Ewells, forced his advance from Charlestown today., General King telegraphs us from Fredericksburg that contrabands give certain information that 15,000 left Hanover Junction Monday morning to reinforce Jackson., I am painfully impressed with the importance of the struggle before you, and shall aid you all I can consistently with my view of due regard to all points., The order to remain at Moorefield was based on the supposition that it would find you there., Upon subsequent information that the enemy were still operating in the vicinity of Winchester and Martinsburg, you were directed to move against the enemy., The President now again directs you to move against the enemy without delay., Please acknowledge the receipt of this, and the time received., Yours just received., I think it cannot be certainly known whether the force which fought General Porter is the same which recently confronted McDowell., Another item of evidence bearing on it is that General Branch commanded against Porter, while it was General Anderson who was in front of McDowell., He and McDowell were in correspondence about prisoners., I think we shall be able within three days to tell you certainly whether any considerable force of the enemy--Jackson or any one else--is moving on to Harper's Ferry or vicinity., Take this expected development into your calculations., General McDowell's advance should, and probably will, be at or near Front Royal at twelve (noon) tomorrow., General Fremont will be at or near Strasburg as soon., Please watch the enemy closely, and follow and harass and detain him if he attempts to retire., I mean this for General Saxton's force as well as that immediately with you., General McDowell's advance, if not checked by the enemy, should, and probably will, be at Front Royal by twelve (noon) to-morrow., His force, when up, will be about 20,000., Please have your force at Strasburg, or, if the route you are moving on does not lead to that point, as near Strasburg as the enemy may be by the same time., Your despatch No.30 received and satisfactory., General Fremont's force should, and probably will, be at or near Strasburg by twelve (noon) tomorrow., Try to have your force, or the advance of it, at Front Royal as soon., Your despatch as to the South Anna and Ashland being seized by our forces this morning is received., Understanding these points to be on the Richmond and Fredericksburg railroad, I heartily congratulate the country, and thank General McClellan and his army for their seizure., I somewhat apprehend that Fremont's force, in its present condition, may not be quite strong enough in case it comes in collision with the enemy., For this additional reason I wish you to push forward your column as rapidly as possible., Tell me what number your force reaching Front Royal will amount to., If the enemy in force is in or about Martinsburg, Charlestown, and Winchester, Or any or all of them, he may come in collision with Fremont, in which case I am anxious that your force, with you and at Harper's Ferry, should so operate as to assist Fremont if possible; the same if the enemy should engage McDowell., This was the meaning of my despatch yesterday., Your despatch of to-day received and is satisfactory., Fremont has nominally 22,000, really about 17,000., Blenker's division is part of it., I have a despatch from Fremont this morning, not telling me where he is; but he says:  ""Scouts and men from Winchester represent Jackson's force variously at 30,000 to 60,000., With him Generals Ewell and Longstreet."", The high figures erroneous, of course., Do you know where Longstreet is?, Corinth is evacuated and occupied by us., Yours, saying you will reach Strasburg or vicinity at 5 P.M. Saturday, has been received and sent to General McDowell, and he directed to act in view of it., You must be up to the time you promised, if possible., Corinth was evacuated last night, and is occupied by our troops to-day; the enemy gone south to Okolotia, on the railroad to Mobile., I send you a despatch just received from Saxton at Harper's Ferry: ""The rebels are in line of battle in front of our lines., They have nine pieces of artillery, and in position, and cavalry., I shelled the woods in which they were, and they in return threw a large number of shells into the lines and tents from which I moved last night to take up a stronger position., I expect a great deal from the battery on the mountain, having three 9 inch Dahlgren bearing directly on the enemy's approaches., The enemy appeared this morning and then retired, with the intention of drawing us on., I shall act on the defensive, as my position is a strong one., In a skirmish which took place this afternoon I lost one horse, The enemy lost two men killed and seven wounded., It seems the game is before you., Have sent a copy to General Fremont., A circle whose circumference shall pass through Harper's Ferry, Front Royal, and Strasburg, and whose center shall be a little northeast of Winchester, almost certainly has within it this morning the forces of Jackson, Ewell, and Edward Johnson., Quite certainly they were within it two days ago., Some part of their forces attacked Harper's Ferry at dark last evening, and are still in sight this morning., Shields, with McDowell's advance, retook Front Royal at 11 A.M. yesterday, with a dozen of our own prisoners taken there a week ago, 150 of the enemy, two locomotives, and eleven cars, some other property and stores, and saved the bridge., General Fremont, from the direction of Moorefield, promises to be at or near Strasburg at 5 P.M. to-day., General Banks at Williamsport, with his old force and his new force at Harper's Ferry, is directed to co-operate., Shields at Front Royal reports a rumor of still an additional force of the enemy, supposed to be Anderson's, having entered the valley of Virginia., This last may or may not be true., Corinth is certainly in the hands of General Halleck., You are probably engaged with the enemy., I suppose he made the attack., Stand well on your guard, hold all your ground, or yield any only inch by inch and in good order., This morning we merge General Wool's department into yours, giving you command of the whole, and sending General Dix to Port Monroe and General Wool to Fort McHenry., We also send General Sigel to report to you for duty., With these continuous rains I am very anxious about the Chickahominy so close in your rear and crossing your line of communication., Please look to it., Anxious to know whether Shields can head or flank Jackson., Please tell about where Shields and Jackson, respectively, are at the time this reaches you., Your despatch of to-day to Secretary of War received., Thanks for the good news it brings., Have you anything from Memphis or other parts of the Mississippi River?, Please answer., Do you really wish to have control of the question of releasing rebel prisoners so far as they may be Tennesseeans?, If you do, please tell us so., Your answer not to be made public., Your despatch about Chattanooga and Dalton was duly received and sent to General Halleck., I have just received the following answer from him:  We have Fort Pillow, Randolph, and Memphis., We are changing one of the departmental lines, so as to give you all of Kentucky and Tennessee., ...]"|3
70|"[Yours of to-day, making it probable that Jackson has been reinforced by about 10,000 from Richmond, is corroborated by a despatch from General King at Fredericksburg, saying a Frenchman, just arrived from Richmond by way of Gordonsville, met 10,000 to 15,000 passing through the latter place to join Jackson., If this is true, it is as good as a reinforcement to you of an equal force., I could better dispose of things if I could know about what day you can attack Richmond, and would be glad to be informed, if you think you can inform me with safety., Yours of last night just received, and for which I thank you., If large reinforcements are going from Richmond to Jackson, it proves one of two things: either they are very strong at Richmond, or do not mean to defend the place desperately., On reflection, I do not see how reinforcements from Richmond to Jackson could be in Gordonsville, as reported by the Frenchman and your deserters., Have not all been sent to deceive?, In regard to the contemplated execution of Captains Spriggs and Triplett the government has no information whatever, but will inquire and advise you., We have this morning sent you a despatch of General Sigel corroborative of the proposition that Jackson is being reinforced from Richmond., This may be reality, and yet may only be contrivance for deception, and to determine which is perplexing., If we knew it was not true, we could send you some more force; but as the case stands we do not think we safely can., Still, we will watch the signs and do so if possible., In regard to a contemplated execution of Captains Spriggs and Triplett the government has no information whatever, but will inquire and advise you., Your despatch of yesterday (2 P. M.) was received this morning., If it would not divert too much of your time and attention from the army under your immediate command, I would be glad to have your views as to the present state of military affairs throughout the whole country, as you say you would be glad to give them., I would rather it should be by letter than by telegraph, because of the better chance of secrecy., As to the numbers and positions of the troops not under your command in Virginia and elsewhere, even if I could do it with accuracy, which I cannot, I would rather not transmit either by telegraph or by letter, because of the chances of its reaching the enemy., I would be very glad to talk with you, but you cannot leave your camp, and I cannot well leave here., I am very glad you are looking well to the west for a movement of the enemy in that direction., You know my anxiety on that point., All was quiet at General McClellan's headquarters at two o'clock to-day., On the 7th day of December, 1861, I submitted to the Senate the project of a treaty between the United States and Mexico which had been proposed to me by Mr. Corwin, our minister to Mexico, and respectfully requested the advice of the Senate thereupon., On the 25th day of February last a resolution was adopted by the Senate to the effect:  ""That it is not advisable to negotiate a treaty that will require the United States to assume any portion of the principal or interest of the debt of Mexico, or that will require the concurrence of European powers."", This resolution having been duly communicated to me, notice thereof was immediately given by the Secretary of State to Mr. Corwin, and he was informed that he was to consider his instructions upon the subject referred to modified by this resolution and would govern his course accordingly., That despatch failed to reach Mr. Corwin, by reason of the disturbed condition of Mexico, until a very recent date, Mr. Corwin being without instructions, or thus practically left without instructions, to negotiate further with Mexico., In view of the very important events Occurring there, he has thought that the interests of the United States would be promoted by the conclusion of two treaties which should provide for a loan to that republic., He has therefore signed such treaties, and they having been duly ratified by the Government of Mexico, he has transmitted them to me for my consideration., The action of the Senate is of course conclusive against an acceptance of the treaties On my part., I have, nevertheless, thought it just to our excellent minister in Mexico and respectful to the Government of that republic to lay the treaties before the Senate, together with the correspondence which has occurred in relation to them., In performing this duty I have only to add that the importance of the subject thus submitted to the Senate, can not be over estimated, and I shall cheerfully receive and consider with the highest respect any further advice the Senate may think proper to give upon the subject., The bill which has passed the House of Representatives and the Senate, entitled ""An act to repeal that part of an act of Congress which prohibits the circulation of bank-notes of a less denomination than five dollars in the District of Columbia,"" has received my attentive consideration, and I now return it to the Senate, in which it originated, with the following objections:  1., The bill proposes to repeal the existing legislation prohibiting the circulation of bank-notes of a less denomination than five dollars within the District of Columbia, without permitting the issuing of such bills by banks not now legally authorized to issue them., In my judgment, it will be found impracticable, in the present condition of the currency, to make such a discrimination., The banks have generally suspended specie payments, and a legal sanction given to the circulation of the irredeemable notes of one class of them will almost certainly be so extended, in practical operation, as to include those of all classes, whether authorized or unauthorized., If this view be correct, the currency of the District, should this act become a law, will certainly and greatly deteriorate, to the serious injury of honest trade and honest labor., 2., This bill seems to contemplate no end which cannot be otherwise more certainly and beneficially attained., During the existing war it is peculiarly the duty of the National Government to secure to the people a sound circulating medium., This duty has been, under existing circumstances, satisfactorily performed, in part at least, by authorizing the issue of United States notes, receivable for all government dues except customs, and made a legal tender for all debts, public and private, except interest on public debt., The object of the bill submitted to me--namely, that of providing a small note currency during the present suspension--can be fully accomplished by authorizing the issue, as part of any new emission of United States notes made necessary by the circumstances of the country, of notes of a similar character, but of less denomination than five dollars., Such an issue would answer all the beneficial purposes of the bill, would save a considerable amount to the treasury in interest, would greatly facilitate payments to soldiers and other creditors of small sums, and would furnish; to the people a currency as safe as their own government., Entertaining these objections to the bill, I feel myself constrained to withhold from it my approval and return it for the further consideration and action of Congress., When birds and animals are looked at through a fog, they are seen to disadvantage, and so it might be with you if I were to attempt to tell you why I went to see General Scott., I can only say that my visit to West Point did not have the importance which has been attached to it; but it concerned matters that you understand quite as well as if I were to tell you all about them., Now, I can only remark that it had nothing whatever to do with making or unmaking any general in the country., The Secretary of War, you know, holds a pretty tight rein on the press, so that they shall not tell more than they ought to; and I 'm afraid that if I blab too much, he might draw a tight rein on me., Your three despatches of yesterday in relation to the affair, ending with the statement that you completely succeeded in making your point, are very gratifying., The later one of 6.15 P.M., suggesting the probability of your being overwhelmed by two hundred thousand, and talking of where the responsibility will belong, pains me very much., I give you all I can, and act on the presumption that you will do the best you can with what you have, while you continue, ungenerously I think, to assume that I could give you more if I would., I have omitted, and shall omit, no opportunity to send you reinforcements whenever I possibly can., General Pope thinks if you fall back it would be much better towards York River than towards the James., As Pope now has charge of the capital, please confer with him through the telegraph., Ordered: 1st., The forces under Major-Generals Fremont, Banks, and McDowell, including the troops now under Brigadier-General Sturgis at Washington, shall be consolidated and form one army, to be called the Army of Virginia., 2d., The command of the Army of Virginia is specially assigned to Major-General John Pope, as commanding general., The troops of the Mountain Department, heretofore under command of General Fremont, shall constitute the First Army Corps, under the command of General Fremont; the troops of the Shenandoah Department, now under General Banks, shall constitute the Second Army Corps, and be commanded by him; the troops under the command of General McDowell, except those within the fortifications and city of Washington, shall form the Third Army Corps, and be under his command., 3d., The Army of Virginia shall operate in such manner as, while protecting western Virginia and the national capital from danger or insult, it shall in the speediest manner attack and overcome the rebel forces under Jackson and Ewell, threaten the enemy in the direction of Charlottesville, and render the most effective aid to relieve General McClellan and capture Richmond., 4th., When the Army of the Potomac and the Army of Virginia shall be in position to communicate and directly co-operate at or before Richmond, the chief command, while so operating together, shall be governed, as in like cases, by the Rules and Articles of War., The enemy have concentrated in such force at Richmond as to render it absolutely necessary, in the opinion of the President, for you immediately to detach 25,000 of your force and forward it by the nearest and quickest route by way of Baltimore and Washington to Richmond., It is believed that the quickest route would be by way of Columbus, Ky., and up the Ohio River., But in detaching your force the President directs that it be done in such a way as to enable you to hold your ground and not interfere with the movement against Chattanooga and East Tennessee., This condition being observed, the forces to be detached and the routes they are to be sent are left to your own judgment., The direction to send these forces immediately is rendered imperative by a serious reverse suffered by General McClellan before Richmond yesterday, the full extent of which is not yet known., You will acknowledge the receipt of this despatch, stating the day and hour it is received, and inform me what your action will be, so that we may take measures to aid in river and railroad transportation., I think you had better go, with any reinforcements you can spare, to General McClellan., Save your army, at all events., Will send reinforcements as fast as we can., Of course they cannot reach you to-day, to-morrow, or next day., I have not said you were ungenerous for saying you needed reinforcements., I thought you were ungenerous in assuming that I did not send them as fast as I could., I feel any misfortune to you and your army quite as keenly as you feel it yourself., If you have had a drawn battle, or a repulse, it is the price we pay for the enemy not being in Washington., We protected Washington, and the enemy concentrated on you., Had we stripped Washington, he would have been upon us before the troops could have gotten to you., Less than a week ago you notified us that reinforcements were leaving Richmond to come in front of us., It is the nature of the case, and neither you nor the government is to blame., Please tell at once the present condition and aspect of things., My view of the present condition of the war is about as follows:  The evacuation of Corinth and our delay by the flood in the Chickahominy have enabled the enemy to concentrate too much force in Richmond for McClellan to successfully attack., In fact there soon will be no substantial rebel force anywhere else., But if we send all the force from here to McClellan, the enemy will, before we can know of it, send a force from Richmond and take Washington., Or if a large part of the western army be brought here to McClellan, they will let us have Richmond, and retake Tennessee, Kentucky, Missouri, etc., What should be done is to hold what we have in the West, open the Mississippi, and take Chattanooga and East Tennessee without more., A reasonable force should in every event be kept about Washington for its protection., Then let the country give us a hundred thousand new troops in the shortest possible time, which, added to McClellan directly or indirectly, will take Richmond without endangering any other place which we now hold, and will substantially end the war., I expect to maintain this contest until successful, or till I die, or am conquered, or my term expires, or Congress or the country forsake me; and I would publicly appeal to the country for this new force were it not that I fear a general panic and stampede would follow, so hard it is to have a thing understood as it really is., I think the new force should be all, or nearly all, infantry, principally because such can be raised most cheaply and quickly., Communication with McClellan by White House is cut off., Strain every nerve to open communication with him by James River, or any other way you can., Report to me., Enemy has cut McClellan's communication with White House, and is driving Stoneman back on that point., Do what you can for him with gunboats at or near that place., McClellan's main force is between the Chickahominy and the James., Also do what you can to communicate with him and support him there., Your despatch of to-day is just received., I have no recollection of either John R. Cravens or Cyrus M.

71|"[Ten thousand thanks for it., On the 28th we sent General Burnside an order to send all the force he could spare to you., We then learned that you had requested him to go to Goldsborough; upon which we said to him our order was intended for your benefit, and we did not wish to be in conflict with your views., We hope you will have help from him soon., Today we have ordered General Hunter to send you all he can spare., At last advices General Halleck thinks he cannot send reinforcements without endangering all he has gained., I understand your position as stated in your letter and by General Marcy., To reinforce you so as to enable you to resume the offensive within a month, or even six weeks, is impossible., In addition to that arrived and now arriving from the Potomac (about 10,000 men, I suppose), and about 10,000 I hope you will have from Burnside very soon, and about 5000 from Hunter a little later, I do not see how I can send you another man within a month., Under these circumstances the defensive for the present must be your only care., Save the army first, where you are, if you can; secondly, by removal, if you must., You, on the ground, must be the judge as to which you will attempt, and of the means for effecting it., I but give it as my opinion that with the aid of the gunboats and the reinforcements mentioned above you can hold your present position--provided, and so long as, you can keep the James River open below you., If you are not tolerably confident you can keep the James River open, you had better remove as soon as possible., I do not remember that you have expressed any apprehension as to the danger of having your communication cut on the river below you, yet I do not suppose it can have escaped your attention., If at any time you feel able to take the offensive, you are not restrained from doing so., A.L., You do not know how much you would oblige us if, without abandoning any of your positions or plans, you could promptly send us even 10,000 infantry., Can you not?, Some part of the Corinth army is certainly fighting McClellan in front of Richmond., Prisoners are in our hands from the late Corinth army., Send forward the despatch to Colonel Hawkins and this also., Our order and General McClellan's to General Burnside being the same, of course we wish it executed as promptly as possible., A thousand thanks for the relief your two despatches of 12 and 1 P.M. yesterday gave me., Be assured the heroism and skill of yourself and officers and men is, and forever will be, appreciated., If you can hold your present position, we shall have the enemy yet., This introduces Governor William Sprague, of Rhode Island., He is now Governor for the third time, and senator-elect of the United States., I know the object of his visit to you., He has my cheerful consent to go, but not my direction., He wishes to get you and part of your force, one or both, to come here., You already know I should be exceedingly glad of this if, in your judgment, it could be without endangering positions and operations in the southwest; and I now repeat what I have more than once said by telegraph: ""Do not come or send a man if, in your judgment, it will endanger any point you deem important to hold, or endangers or delays the Chattanooga expedition."", Still, please give my friend, Governor Sprague, a full and fair hearing., What amount of force have you now?, GWhat is the whole amount of your corps with you now., What is likely to be your condition as to health in this camp?, In your present encampment what is the present and prospective condition as to health?, Where is the enemy now?, Where and in what condition do you believe the enemy to be now?, What is the aggregate of your killed, wounded, and missing from the attack on the 26th ultimo till now?, If you desired could you remove the army safely?, If it were desired to get the army away, could it be safely effected?, Is the army secure in its present position?, Ordered, That Major-General Henry W. Halleck be assigned to command the whole land forces of the United States, as general-in-chief, and that he repair to this capital so soon as he can with safety to the positions and operations within the department now under his charge., Whereas, in the judgment of the President, the public safety does require that the railroad line called and known as the Southwest Branch of the Pacific Railroad in the State of Missouri be repaired, extended, and completed from Rolla to Lebanon, in the direction to Springfield, in the said State, the same being necessary to the successful and economical conduct of the war and to the maintenance of the authority of the government in the Southwest:  Therefore, under and in virtue of the act of Congress entitled ""An act to authorize the President of the United States in certain cases to take possession of railroad and telegraph lines, and for other purposes,"" approved January 31, 1862, it is ordered, That the portion of the said railroad line which reaches from Rolla to Lebanon be repaired, extended, and completed, so as to be made available for the military uses of the government, as speedily as may be., And, inasmuch as upon the part of the said line from Rolla to the stream called Little Piney a considerable portion of the necessary work has already been done by the railroad company, and the road to this extent may be completed at comparatively small cost, it is ordered that the said line from Rolla to and across Little Piney be first completed, and as soon as possible., The Secretary of War is charged with the execution of this order., And to facilitate the speedy execution of the work, he is directed, at his discretion, to take possession and control of the whole or such part of the said railroad line, and the whole or such part of the rolling stock, offices, shops, buildings, and all their appendages and appurtenances, as he may judge necessary or convenient for the early completion of the road from Rolla to Lebanon., I recommend that the thanks of Congress be given to the following officers of the United States Navy:  Captain James L. Lardner, for meritorious conduct at the battle of Port Royal and distinguished services on the coast of the United States against the enemy., Captain Charles Henry Davis, for distinguished services in conflict with the enemy at Fort Pillow, at Memphis, and for successful operations at other points in the waters of the Mississippi River., Commander John A.

Rowan, for distinguished services in the waters of North Carolina, and particularly in the capture of Newbern, being in chief command of the naval forces., Commander David D. Porter, for distinguished services in the conception and preparation of the means used for the capture of the forts below New Orleans, and for highly meritorious conduct in the management of the mortar flotilla during the bombardment of Forts Jackson and St. Philip., Captain Silas H. Stringharn, now on the retired list, for distinguished services in the capture of Forts Hatteras and Clark., Yours of yesterday is received., Do you not, my good friend, perceive that what you ask is simply to put you in command in the West?, I do not suppose you desire this., You only wish to control in your own localities; but this you must know may derange all other posts., Can you not, and will you not, have a full conference with General Halleck?, Telegraph him, and meet him at such place as he and you can agree upon., I telegraph him to meet you and confer fully with you., Governor Johnson, at Nashville, is in great trouble and anxiety about a raid into Kentucky., The governor is a true and valuable man--indispensable to us in Tennessee., Will you please get in communication with him, and have a full conference with him before you leave for here?, I have telegraphed him on the subject., After the adjournment of Congress now very near, I shall have no opportunity of seeing you for several months., Believing that you of the border States hold more power for good than any other equal number of members, I feel it a duty which I cannot justifiably waive to make this appeal to you., I intend no reproach or complaint when I assure you that, in my opinion, if you all had voted for the resolution in the gradual-emancipation message of last March, the war would now be substantially ended., And the plan therein proposed is yet one of the most potent and swift means of ending it., Let the States which are in rebellion see definitely and certainly that in no event will the States you represent ever join their proposed confederacy, and they cannot much longer maintain the contest., But you cannot divest them of their hope to ultimately have you with them so long as you show a determination to perpetuate the institution within your own States., Beat them at elections, as you have overwhelmingly done, and, nothing daunted, they still claim you as their own., You and I know what the lever of their power is., Break that lever before their faces, and they can shake you no more forever., Most of you have treated me with kindness and consideration and I trust you will not now think I improperly touch what is exclusively your own, when, for the sake of the whole country, I ask, Can you, for your States, do better than to take the course I urge?, Discarding punctilio and maxims adapted to more manageable times, and looking only to the unprecedentedly stern facts of our case, can you do better in any possible event?, You prefer that the constitutional relation of the States to the nation shall be practically restored without disturbance of the institution; and if this were done, my whole duty in this respect, under the Constitution and my oath of office, would be performed., But it is not done, and we are trying to accomplish it by war., The incidents of the war cannot be avoided., If the war continues long, as it must if the object be not sooner attained, the institution in your States will be extinguished by mere friction and abrasion--by the mere incidents of the war., It will be gone, and you will have nothing valuable in lieu of it., Much of its value is gone already., How much better for you and for your people to take the step which at once shortens the war and secures substantial compensation for that which is sure to be wholly lost in any other event!, How much better to thus save the money which else we sink forever in war!, How much better to do it while we can, lest the war ere long render us pecuniarily unable to do it!, How much better for you as seller, and the nation as buyer, to sell out and buy out that without which the war could never have been, than to sink both the thing to be sold and the price of it in cutting one another's throats!, I do not speak of emancipation at once, but of a decision at once to emancipate gradually., Room in South America for colonization can be obtained cheaply and in abundance, and when numbers shall be large enough to be company and encouragement for one another, the freed people will not be so reluctant to go., I am pressed with a difficulty not yet mentioned--one which threatens division among those who, united, are none too strong., An instance of it is known to you., General Hunter is an honest man., He was, and I hope still is, my friend., I valued him none the less for his agreeing with me in the general wish that all men everywhere could be free., He proclaimed all men free within certain States, and I repudiated the proclamation., He expected more good and less harm from the measure than I could believe would follow., Yet, in repudiating it, I gave dissatisfaction, if not offence, to many whose support the country cannot afford to lose., And this is not the end of it., The pressure in this direction is still upon me, and is increasing., By conceding what I now ask you can relieve me, and, much more, can relieve the country in this important point., Upon these considerations, I have again begged your attention to the message of March last., ...]"|3
72|"[The twelfth and thirteenth sections are something better than unobjectionable; and the fourteenth is entirely proper, if all other parts of the act shall stand., That to which I chiefly object pervades most parts of the act, but more distinctly appears in the first, second, seventh, and eighth sections., It is the sum of those provisions which results in the divesting of title forever., For the causes of treason and ingredients of treason, not amounting to the full crime, it declares forfeiture extending beyond the lives of the guilty parties; whereas the Constitution of the United States declares that ""no attainder of treason shall work corruption of blood or forfeiture except during the life of the person attainted."", True, there is to be no formal attainder in this case; still, I think the greater punishment cannot be constitutionally inflicted, in a different form, for the same offence., With great respect I am constrained to say I think this feature of the act is unconstitutional., It would not be difficult to modify it., I may remark that the provision of the Constitution, put in language borrowed from Great Britain, applies only in this country, as I understand, to real or landed estate., Again, this act in rem forfeits property for the ingredients of treason without a conviction of the supposed criminal, or a personal hearing given him in any proceeding., That we may not touch property lying within our reach, because we cannot give personal notice to an owner who is absent endeavoring to destroy the government, is certainly not satisfactory., Still, the owner may not be thus engaged; and I think a reasonable time should be provided for such parties to appear and have personal hearings., Similar provisions are not uncommon in connection with proceedings in rem., For the reasons stated, I return the bill to the House in which it originated., This is Monday., I hope to be able to tell you on Thursday what is to be done with Burnside., Representations have been made to the President by the ministers of various foreign powers in amity with the United States that subjects of such powers have during the present insurrection been obliged or required by military authorities to take an oath of general or qualified allegiance to this government., It is the duty of all aliens residing in the United States to submit to and obey the laws and respect the authority of the government., For any proceeding or conduct inconsistent with this obligation and subversive of that authority they may rightfully be subjected to military restraints when this may be necessary., But they cannot be required to take an oath of allegiance to this government, because it conflicts with the duty they owe to their own sovereigns., All such obligations heretofore taken are therefore remitted and annulled., Military commanders will abstain from imposing similar obligations in future, and will in lieu thereof adopt such other restraints of the character indicated as they shall find necessary, convenient, and effectual for the public safety., It is further directed that whenever any order shall be made affecting the personal liberty of an alien reports of the same and of the causes thereof shall be made to the War Department for the consideration of the Department of State., 1., That military commanders within the States of Virginia, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas, and Arkansas in an orderly manner seize and use any property, real or personal, which may be necessary or convenient for their several commands as supplies or for other military purposes; and that while property may be destroyed for proper military objects, none shall be destroyed in wantonness or malice., 2., That military and naval commanders shall employ as laborers within and from said States so many persons of African descent as can be advantageously used for military or naval purposes, giving them reasonable wages for their labor., 3., That as to both property and persons of African descent accounts shall be kept sufficiently accurate and in detail to show quantities and amounts and from whom both property and such persons shall have come, as a basis upon which compensation can be made in proper cases; and the several departments of this government shall attend to and perform their appropriate parts toward the execution of these orders., In pursuance of the sixth section of the act of Congress entitled ""An act to suppress insurrection and to punish treason and rebellion, to seize and confiscate property of rebels, and for other purposes,"" approved July 17, 1862, and which act and the joint resolution explanatory thereof are herewith published, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States, do hereby proclaim to and warn all persons within the contemplation of said sixth section to cease participating in, aiding, countenancing, or abetting the existing rebellion or any rebellion against the Government of the United States and to return to their proper allegiance to the United States, on pain of the forfeitures and seizures as within and by said sixth section provided., In testimony whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed., Done at the city of Washington, this twenty-fifth day of July, A.D. 1862, and of the independence of the United States the eighty-seventh., Yours of the 16th is received  You are ready to say I apply to friends what is due only to enemies., I distrust the wisdom if not the sincerity of friends who would hold my hands while my enemies stab me., This appeal of professed friends has paralyzed me more in this struggle than any other one thing., You remember telling me, the day after the Baltimore mob in April, 1861, that it would crush all Union feeling in Maryland for me to attempt bringing troops over Maryland soil to Washington., I brought the troops notwithstanding, and yet there was Union feeling enough left to elect a Legislature the next autumn, which in turn elected a very excellent Union United States senator!, I am a patient man--always willing to forgive on the Christian terms of repentance, and also to give ample time for repentance., Still, I must save this government, if possible., What I cannot do, of course, I will not do; but it may as well be understood, once for all, that I shall not surrender this game leaving any available card unplayed., The copy of a letter addressed to yourself by Mr. Thomas J. Durant has been shown to me., The writer appears to be an able, a dispassionate, and an entirely sincere man., The first part of the letter is devoted to an effort to show that the secession ordinance of Louisiana was adopted against the will of a majority of the people., This is probably true, and in that fact may be found some instruction., Why did they allow the ordinance to go into effect?, Why did they not assert themselves?, Why stand passive and allow themselves to be trodden down by minority?, Why did they not hold popular meetings and have a convention of their own to express and enforce the true sentiment of the State?, If preorganization was against them then, why not do this now that the United States army is present to protect them?, The paralysis--the dead palsy--of the government in this whole struggle is that this class of men will do nothing for the government, nothing for themselves, except demanding that the government shall not strike its open enemies, lest they be struck by accident!, Mr. Durant complains that in various ways the relation of master and slave is disturbed by the presence of our army, and he considers it particularly vexatious that this, in part, is done under cover of an act of Congress, while constitutional guaranties are suspended on the plea of military necessity., The truth is, that what is done and omitted about slaves is done and omitted on the same military necessity., It is a military necessity to have men and money; and we can get neither in sufficient numbers or amounts if we keep from or drive from our lines slaves coming to them., Mr. Durant cannot be ignorant of the pressure in this direction, nor of my efforts to hold it within bounds till he and such as he shall have time to help themselves., I am not posted to speak understandingly on all the police regulations of which Mr. Durant complains., If experience shows any one of them to be wrong, let them be set right., I think I can perceive in the freedom of trade which Mr. Durant urges that he would relieve both friends and enemies from the pressure of the blockade., By this he would serve the enemy more effectively than the enemy is able to serve himself., I do not say or believe that to serve the enemy is the purpose, of Mr. Durant, or that he is conscious of any purpose other than national and patriotic ones., Still, if there were a class of men who, having no choice of sides in the contest, were anxious only to have quiet and comfort for themselves while it rages, and to fall in with the victorious side at the end of it without loss to themselves, their advice as to the mode of conducting the contest would be precisely such as his is., He speaks of no duty--apparently thinks of none--resting upon Union men., He even thinks it injurious to the Union cause that they should be restrained in trade and passage without taking sides., They are to touch neither a sail nor a pump, but to be merely passengers--deadheads at that--to be carried snug and dry throughout the storm, and safely landed right side up., Nay, more: even a mutineer is to go untouched, lest these sacred passengers receive an accidental wound., Of course the rebellion will never be suppressed in Louisiana if the professed Union men there will neither help to do it nor permit the government to do it without their help., Now, I think the true remedy is very different from what is suggested by Mr. Durant., It does not lie in rounding the rough angles of the war, but in removing the necessity for the war., The people of Louisiana who wish protection to person and property have but to reach forth their hands and take it., Let them in good faith reinaugurate the national authority, and set up a State government conforming thereto under the Constitution., They know how to do it and can have the protection of the army while doing it., The army will be withdrawn so soon as such State government can dispense with its presence; and the people of the State can then, upon the old constitutional terms, govern themselves to their own liking., This is very simple and easy., If they will not do this--if they prefer to hazard all for the sake of destroying the government--it is for them to consider whether it is probable I will surrender the government to save them from losing all., If they decline what I suggest, you scarcely need to ask what I will do., What would you do in my position?, Would you drop the war where it is?, Or would you prosecute it in future with elder-stalk squirts charged with rose water?, Would you deal lighter blows rather than heavier ones?, Would you give up the contest, leaving any available means unapplied?, I am in no boastful mood., I shall not do more than I can, and I shall do all I can, to save the government, which is my sworn duty as well as my personal inclination., I shall do nothing in malice., What I deal with is too vast for malicious dealing., It would be of great service here for us to know, as fully as you can tell, what progress is made and making in recruiting for old regiments in your State., Also about what day the first regiments can move with you, what the second, what the third, and so on., This information is important to us in making calculations., Please give it as promptly and accurately as you call., Broken eggs cannot be mended; but Louisiana has nothing to do now but to take her place in the Union as it was, barring the already broken eggs., The sooner she does so, the smaller will be the amount of that which will be past mending., This government cannot much longer play a game in which it stakes all, and its enemies stake nothing., Those enemies must understand that they cannot experiment for ten years trying to destroy the government, and if they fail, still come back into the Union unhurt., If they expect in any contingency to ever have the Union as it was, I join with the writer in saying, ""Now is the time."", How much better it would have been for the writer to have gone at this, under the protection of the army at New Orleans, than to have sat down in a closet writing complaining letters northward!, Your very acceptable letter, dated Orbe, Canton de Vaud, Switzerland, 18th of July, 1862, is received., The moral effect was the worst of the affair before Richmond, and that has run its course downward., We are now at a stand, and shall soon be rising again, as we hope., I believe it is true that, in men and material, the enemy suffered more than we in that series of conflicts, while it is certain that he is less able to bear it., With us every soldier is a man of character, and must be treated with more consideration than is customary in Europe., Hence our great army, for slighter causes than could have prevailed there, has dwindled rapidly, bringing the necessity for a new call earlier than was anticipated., We shall easily obtain the new levy, however., Be not alarmed if you shall learn that we shall have resorted to a draft for part of this., ...]"|3
73|"[It is exceedingly important that we have men at the beginning capable of thinking as white men, and not those who have been systematically oppressed., There is much to encourage you., For the sake of your race you should sacrifice something of your present comfort for the purpose of being as grand in that respect as the white people., It is a cheering thought throughout life that something can be done to ameliorate the condition of those who have been subject to the hard usages of the world., It is difficult to make a man miserable while he feels he is worthy of himself and claims kindred to the great God who made him., In the American Revolutionary war sacrifices were made by men engaged in it, but they were cheered by the future., General WASHINGTON himself endured greater physical hardships than if he had remained a British subject, yet he was a happy man because he had engaged in benefiting his race, in doing something for the children of his neighbors, having none of his own., The colony of Liberia has been in existence a long time., In a certain sense it is a success., The old President of Liberia, Roberts, has just been with me--the first time I ever saw him., He says they have within the bounds of that colony between three and four hundred thousand people, or more than in some of our old States, such as Rhode Island or Delaware, or in some of our newer States, and less than in some of our larger ones., They are not all American colonists or their descendants., Something less than 12,000 have been sent thither from this country., Many of the original settlers have died; yet, like people else-where, their offspring outnumber those deceased., The question is, if the colored people are persuaded to go anywhere, why not there?, One reason for unwillingness to do so is that some of you would rather remain within reach of the country of your nativity., I do not know how much attachment you may have toward our race., It does not strike me that you have the greatest reason to love them., But still you are attached to them, at all events., The place I am thinking about for a colony is in Central America., It is nearer to us than Liberia not much more than one fourth as far as Liberia, and within seven days' run by steamers., Unlike Liberia, it is a great line of travel--it is a highway., The country is a very excellent one for any people, and with great natural resources and advantages, and especially because of the similarity of climate with your native soil, thus being suited to your physical condition., The particular place I have in view is to be a great highway from the Atlantic or Caribbean Sea to the Pacific Ocean, and this particular place has all the advantages for a colony., On both sides there are harbors--among the finest in the world., Again, there is evidence of very rich coal-mines., A certain amount of coal is valuable in any country., Why I attach so much importance to coal is, it will afford an opportunity to the inhabitants for immediate employment till they get ready to settle permanently in their homes., If you take colonists where there is no good landing, there is a bad show; and so where there is nothing to cultivate and of which to make a farm., But if something is started so that you can get your daily bread as soon as reach you there, it is a great advantage., Coal land is the best thing I know of with which to commence an enterprise., To return--you have been talked to upon this subject, and told that a speculation is intended by gentlemen who have an interest in the country, including the coal-mines., We have been mistaken all our lives if we do not know whites, as well as blacks, look to their self-interest., Unless among those deficient of intellect, everybody you trade with makes something., You meet with these things here and everywhere., If such persons have what will be an advantage to them, the question is whether it cannot be made of advantage to you., You are intelligent, and know that success does not so much depend on external help as on self-reliance., Much, therefore, depends upon yourselves., As to the coal-mines, I think I see the means available for your self-reliance., I shall, if I get a sufficient number of you engaged, have provision made that you shall not be wronged., If you will engage in the enterprise, I will spend some of the money intrusted to me., I am not sure you will succeed., The government may lose the money; but we cannot succeed unless we try, and we think with care we can succeed., The political affairs in Central America are not in quite as satisfactory a condition as I wish., There are contending factions in that quarter, but it is true all the factions are agreed alike on the subject of colonization, and want it, and are more generous than we are here., To your colored race they have no objection I would endeavor to have you made the equals, and have the best assurance that you should be the equals, of the best., The practical thing I want to ascertain is whether I can get a number of able-bodied men, with their wives and children, who are willing to go when I present evidence of encouragement and protection., Could I get a hundred tolerably intelligent men, with their wives and children, and able to ""cut their own fodder,"" so to speak?, Can I have fifty?, If I could find twenty-five able-bodied men, with a mixture of women and children--good things in the family relation, I think,--I could make a successful commencement., I want you to let me know whether this can be done or not., This is the practical part of my wish to see you., These are subjects of very great importance, worthy of a month's study, instead of a speech delivered in an hour., I ask you, then, to consider seriously, not pertaining to yourselves merely, nor for your race and ours for the present time, but as one of the things, if successfully managed, the good of mankind--not confined to the present generation, but as  It is believed that a Dr. J. J. Williams is a prisoner in your charge, and if so tell him his wife is here and allow him to telegraph to her., Mrs. L. has $1000 for the benefit of the hospitals and she will be obliged, and send the pay, if you will be so good as to select and send her $200 worth of good lemons and $100 worth of good oranges., The Secretary of the Treasury and the Commissioner of Internal Revenue will please see Mr. Talcott, one of the best men there is, and, if any difference, one they would like better than they do me., Which do you prefer--commissary or quartermaster?, If appointed it must be without conditions., Your despatch to Mrs. L. received yesterday., She is not well., Owing to her early and strong friendship for you, I would gladly oblige you, but I cannot absolutely do it., If General Boyle and Hon., James Guthrie, one or both, in their discretion see fit to give you the passes, this is my authority to them for doing so., Your telegram in regard to the lunatic asylum has been received., It is certainly a case of difficulty, but if you cannot remain, I cannot conceive who under my authority can., Remain as long as you safely can and provide as well as you can for the poor inmates of the institution., I have just read yours of the 19th, addressed to myself through the New York Tribune., If there be in it any statements or assumptions of fact which I may know to be erroneous, I do not now and here controvert them., If there be in it any inferences which I may believe to be falsely drawn, I do not now and here argue against them., If there be perceptible in it an impatient and dictatorial tone, I waive it in deference to an old friend, whose heart I have always supposed to be right., As to the policy I ""seem to be pursuing,"" as you say, I have not meant to leave any one in doubt., I would save the Union., I would save it the shortest way under the Constitution., The sooner the national authority can be restored, the nearer the Union will be, ""the Union as it was."", If there be those who would not save the Union unless they could at the same time save slavery, I do not agree with them., If there be those who would not save the Union unless they could at the same time destroy slavery, I do not agree with them., My paramount object in this struggle is to save the Union, and is not either to save or destroy slavery., If I could save the Union without freeing any slave, I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing all the slaves, I would do it; and if I could do it by freeing some and leaving others alone, I would also do that., What I do about slavery and the colored race, I do because I believe it helps to save this Union; and what I forbear, I forbear because I do not believe it would help to save the Union., I shall do less whenever I shall believe what I am doing hurts the cause, and I shall do more whenever I shall believe doing more will help the cause., I shall try to correct errors when shown to be errors; and I shall adopt new views so fast as they shall appear to be true views., I have here stated my purpose according to my view of official duty, and I intend no modification of my oft expressed personal wish that all men, everywhere, could be free., I am pained to hear that you reject the service of an officer we sent to assist in organizing and getting off troops., Pennsylvania and Indiana accepted such officers kindly, and they now have more than twice as many new troops in the field as all the other States together., If Illinois had got forward as many troops as Indiana, Cumberland Gap would soon be relieved from its present peril., Please do not ruin us on punctilio., Yours received., Attend to the Indians., If the draft cannot proceed, of course it will not proceed., Necessity knows no law., The government cannot extend the time., What news from the front?, Do you hear anything from Pope?, Any news from General Pope?, Yours received., How do you learn that the rebel forces at Manassas are large and commanded by several of their best generals?, Any further news?, Does Colonel Devon mean that sound of firing was heard in direction of Warrenton, as stated, or in direction of Warrenton Junction?, What news from direction of Manassas Junction?, What generally?, ...]"|3
74|"[How can we feed and care for such a multitude?, General Butler wrote me a few days since that he was issuing more rations to the slaves who have rushed to him than to all the white troops under his command., They eat, and that is all; though it is true General Butler is feeding the whites also by the thousand; for it nearly amounts to a famine there., If, now, the pressure of the war should call off our forces from New Orleans to defend some other point, what is to prevent the masters from reducing the blacks to slavery again?, for I am told that whenever the rebels take any black prisoners, free or slave, they immediately auction them off., They did so with those they took from a boat that was aground in the Tennessee River a few days ago., And then I am very ungenerously attacked for it!, For instance, when, after the late battles at and near Bull Run, an expedition went out from Washington under a flag of truce to bury the dead and bring in the wounded, and the rebels seized the blacks who went along to help, and sent them into slavery, Horace Greeley said in his paper that the government would probably do nothing about it., What could I do?, Now, then, tell me, if you please, what possible result of good would follow the issuing of such a proclamation as you desire?, Understand, I raise no objections against it on legal or constitutional grounds; for, as commander-in-chief of the army and navy, in time of war I suppose I have a right to take any measure which may best subdue the enemy; nor do I urge objections of a moral nature, in view of possible consequences of insurrection and massacre at the South., I view this matter as a practical war measure, to be decided on according to the advantages or disadvantages it may offer to the suppression of the rebellion., I admit that slavery is the root of the rebellion, or at least its sine qua non., The ambition of politicians may have instigated them to act, but they would have been impotent without slavery as their instrument., I will also concede that emancipation would help us in Europe, and convince them that we are incited by something more than ambition., I grant, further, that it would help somewhat at the North, though not so much, I fear, as you and those you represent imagine., Still, some additional strength would be added in that way to the war, and then, unquestionably, it would weaken the rebels by drawing off their laborers, which is of great importance; but I am not so sure we could do much with the blacks., If we were to arm them, I fear that in a few weeks the arms would be in the hands of the rebels; and, indeed, thus far we have not had arms enough to equip our white troops., I will mention another thing, though it meet only your scorn and contempt., There are fifty thousand bayonets in the Union armies from the border slave States., It would be a serious matter if, in consequence of a proclamation such as you desire, they should go over to the rebels., I do not think they all would--not so many, indeed, as a year ago, or as six months ago--not so many to-day as yesterday., Every day increases their Union feeling., They are also getting their pride enlisted, and want to beat the rebels., Let me say one thing more: I think you should admit that we already have an important principle to rally and unite the people, in the fact that constitutional government is at stake., This is a fundamental idea going down about as deep as anything., Do not misunderstand me because I have mentioned these objections., They indicate the difficulties that have thus far prevented my action in some such way as you desire., I have not decided against a proclamation of liberty to the slaves, but hold the matter under advisement; and I can assure you that the subject is on my mind, by day and night, more than any other., Whatever shall appear to be God's will, I will do., I trust that in the freedom with which I have canvassed your views I have not in any respect injured your feelings., Thanks for your despatch., Can you not pursue the retreating enemy, and relieve Cumberland Gap?, Your despatch of to-day received., God bless you, and all with you., Destroy the rebel army if possible., I now consider it safe to say that General McClellan has gained a great victory over the great rebel army in Maryland, between Fredericktown and Hagerstown., He is now pursuing the flying foe., What do you hear from General McClellan's army?, We have nothing from him to-day., I have received your despatch in regard to recommendations of General Wright., I have received no such despatch from him, at least not that I can remember., I refer yours for General Halleck's consideration., How many regiments are there in Illinois, ready for service but for want of arms?, How many arms have you there ready for distribution?, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States of America and Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy thereof, do hereby proclaim and declare that hereafter, as heretofore, the war will be prosecuted for the object of practically restoring the constitutional relation between the United States and each of the States and the people thereof in which States that relation is or may be suspended or disturbed., That it is my purpose, upon the next meeting of Congress, to again recommend the adoption of a practical measure tendering pecuniary aid to the free acceptance or rejection of all slave States, so called, the people whereof may not then be in rebellion against the United States, and which States may then have voluntarily adopted, or thereafter may voluntarily adopt, immediate or gradual abolishment of slavery within their respective limits; and that the effort to colonize persons of African descent with their consent upon this continent or elsewhere, with the previously obtained consent of the governments existing there, will be continued., That on the 1st day of January, A.D. 1863, all persons held as slaves within any State or designated part of a State the people whereof shall then be in rebellion against the United States shall be then, thenceforward, and forever free; and the executive government of the United States, including the military and naval authority thereof, will recognize and maintain the freedom of such persons and will do no act or acts to repress such persons, or any of them, in any efforts they may make for their actual freedom., That the Executive will on the 1st day of January aforesaid, by proclamation, designate the States and parts of States, if any, in which the people thereof, respectively, shall then be in rebellion against the United States; and the fact that any State or the people thereof shall on that day be in good faith represented in the Congress of the United States by members chosen thereto at elections wherein a majority of the qualified voters of such State shall have participated shall, in the absence of strong countervailing testimony, be deemed conclusive evidence that such State and the people thereof are not then in rebellion against the United States., That attention is hereby called to an act of Congress entitled ""An act to make an additional article of war,"" approved March 13, 1862, and which act is in the words and figure following:  ""Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That hereafter the following shall be promulgated as an additional article of war for the government of the Army of the United States and shall be obeyed and observed as such., ""ART., All officers or persons in the military or naval service of the United States are prohibited from employing any of the forces under their respective commands for the purpose of returning fugitives from service or labor who may have escaped from any person, to whom such service or labor is claimed to be due, and any officer who shall be found guilty by a court-martial of violating this article shall be dismissed from the service., ""SEC., 2., And be it further enacted, That this act shall take effect from and after its passage."", Also to the ninth and tenth sections of an act entitled ""An act to suppress insurrection, to punish treason and rebellion, to seize and confiscate the property of rebels, and for other purposes,"" approved July 17, 1862, and which sections are in the words and figures following:   ""SEC., 9., And be it further enacted, That all slaves of persons who shall hereafter be engaged in rebellion against the Government of the United States, or who shall in any way give aid or comfort thereto, escaping from such persons and taking refuge within the lines of the army, and all slaves captured from such persons or deserted by them and coming under the control of the Government of the United States, and all slaves of such persons found on (or) being within any place occupied by rebel forces and afterwards occupied by the forces of the United States, shall be deemed captives of war and shall be forever free of their servitude and not again held as slaves., ""SEC., 9., And be it further enacted, That no slave escaping into any State, Territory, or the District of Columbia from any other State shall be delivered up or in any way impeded or hindered of his liberty, except for crime, or some offence against the laws, unless the person claiming said fugitive shall first make oath that the person to whom the labor or service of such fugitive is alleged to be due is his lawful owner, and has not borne arms against the United States in the present rebellion, nor in any way given aid and comfort thereto; and no person engaged in the military or naval service of the United States shall, under any pretense whatever, assume to decide on the validity of the claim of any person to the service or labor of any other person, or surrender up any such person to the claimant, on pain of being dismissed from the service."", And I do hereby enjoin upon and order all persons engaged in the military and naval service of the United States to observe, obey, and enforce, within their respective spheres of service, the act and sections above recited., And the Executive will in due time recommend that all citizens of the United States who shall have remained loyal thereto throughout the rebellion shall (upon the restoration of the constitutional relation between the United States and their respective States and people, if that relation shall have been suspended or disturbed) be compensated for all losses by acts of the United States, including the loss of slaves., In witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed., Done at the City of Washington, this twenty-second day of September, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-two, and of the independence of the United States the eighty-seventh., Whereas it has become necessary to call into service not only volunteers, but also portions of the militia of the States by draft, in order to suppress the insurrection existing in the United States, and disloyal persons are not adequately restrained by the ordinary processes of law from hindering this measure, and from giving aid and comfort in various ways to the insurrection:  Now, therefore, be it ordered  First., That during the existing insurrection, and as a necessary measure for suppressing the same, all rebels and insurgents, their aiders and abettors within the United States, and all persons discouraging volunteer enlistments, resisting militia drafts, or guilty of any disloyal practice affording aid and comfort to rebels against the authority of the United States, shall be subject to martial law, and liable to trial and punishment by courts-martial or military commissions., Second., That the writ of habeas corpus is suspended in respect to all persons arrested, or who are now, or hereafter during the rebellion shall be, imprisoned in any fort camp, arsenal, military prison or other place of confinement by any military authority or by the sentence of any court-martial or military commission., In witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed., Done at the city of WASHINGTON, this twenty-fourth day of September., A.D. eighteen hundred and sixty-two, and of the independence of the United States the eighty-seventh., I appear before you to do little more than acknowledge the courtesy you pay me, and to thank you for it., I have not been distinctly informed why it is that on this occasion you appear to do me this honor, though I suppose it is because of the proclamation., What I did, I did after a very full deliberation, and under a very heavy and solemn sense of responsibility., I can only trust in God I have made no mistake., I shall make no attempt on this occasion to sustain what I have done or said by any comment., It is now for the country and the world to pass judgment and, maybe, take action upon it., I will say no more upon this subject., In my position I am environed with difficulties., Yet they are scarcely so great as the difficulties of those who upon the battle-field are endeavoring to purchase with their blood and their lives the future happiness and prosperity of this country., Let us never forget them., On the fourteenth and seventeenth days of this present month there have been battles bravely, skillfully, and successfully fought., We do not yet know the particulars., Let us be sure that, in giving praise to certain individuals, we do no injustice to others., I only ask you, at the conclusion of these few remarks, to give three hearty cheers for all good and brave officers and men who fought those successful battles., I am informed that, in answer to the question, ""Why was not the rebel army bagged immediately after the battle near Sharpsburg?"", propounded to you by Major Levi C. Turner, Judge Advocate, etc., you said: ""That is not the game., The object is, that neither army shall get much advantage of the other; that both shall be kept in the field till they are exhausted, when we will make a compromise and save slavery."", I shall be very happy if you will, within twenty-four hours from the receipt of this, prove to me by Major Turner that you did not, either literally or in substance, make the answer stated., On cross-examination, Major Turner says he has frequently heard Major Key converse in regard to the present troubles, and never heard him utter a sentiment unfavorable to the maintenance of the Union., He has never uttered anything which he, Major T., would call disloyalty., The particular conversation detailed was a private one., In my view, it is wholly inadmissible for any gentleman holding a military commission from the United States to utter such sentiments as Major Key is within proved to have done., Therefore, let Major John J., Key be forthwith dismissed from the military service of the United States., Your kind letter of the 25th is just received., It is known to some that, while I hope something from the proclamation, my expectations are not as sanguine as are those of some friends., The time for its effect southward has not come; but northward the effect should be instantaneous., It is six days old, and, while commendation in newspapers and by distinguished individuals is all that a vain man could wish, the stocks have declined, and troops come forward more slowly than ever., ...]"|3
75|"[The bearer of this, Thomas R. Smith, a citizen of Tennessee, goes to that State seeking to have such of the people thereof as desire to avoid the unsatisfactory prospect before them, and to have peace again upon the old terms, under the Constitution of the United States, to manifest such desire by elections of members to the Congress of the United States particularly, and perhaps a Legislature, State officers, and a United States senator friendly to their object., I shall be glad for you and each of you to aid him, and all others acting for this object, as much as possible., In all available ways give the people a show to express their wishes at these elections., Follow law, and forms of law, as far as convenient, but at all events get the expression of the largest number of the people possible., All see how such action will connect with and affect the proclamation of September 22., Of course the men elected should be gentlemen of character, willing to swear support to the Constitution as of old, and known to be above reasonable suspicion of duplicity., How is your health now?, Do you or not wish Lieut., R. P. Crawford to be restored to his office?, I have just read your despatch about sore-tongued and fatigued horses., Will you pardon me for asking what the horses of your army have done since the battle of Antietam that fatigues anything?, Yours, in reply to mine about horses, received., Of course you know the facts better than I; still two considerations remain: Stuart's cavalry outmarched ours, having certainly done more marked service on the Peninsula and everywhere since., Secondly, will not a movement of our army be a relief to the cavalry, compelling the enemy to concentrate instead of foraging in squads everywhere?, But I am so rejoiced to learn from your despatch to General Halleck that you begin crossing the river this morning., Your despatch to Mr. Stanton, of which the enclosed is a copy, has been handed me by him., It would be dangerous for me now to begin construing and making specific applications of the proclamation., It is obvious to all that I therein intended to give time and opportunity., Also, it is seen I left myself at liberty to exempt parts of States., Without saying more, I shall be very glad if any Congressional district will, in good faith, do as your despatch contemplates., Could you give me the facts which prompted you to telegraph?, Yours of yesterday received., Most certainly I intend no injustice to any, and if I have done any I deeply regret it., To be told, after more than five weeks' total inaction of the army, and during which period we have sent to the army every fresh horse we possibly could, amounting in the whole to 7918, that the cavalry horses were too much fatigued to move, presents a very cheerless, almost hopeless, prospect for the future, and it may have forced something of impatience in my despatch., If not recruited and rested then, when could they ever be?, I suppose the river is rising, and I am glad to believe you are crossing., Your despatch of 3 P.M. to-day, in regard to filling up old regiments with drafted men, is received, and the request therein shall be complied with as far as practicable., And now I ask a distinct answer to the question, Is it your purpose not to go into action again until the men now being drafted in the States are incorporated into the old regiments?, Your despatches of night before last, yesterday, and last night all received., I am much pleased with the movement of the army., When you get entirely across the river let me know., What do you know of the enemy?, By some means I have not seen your despatch of the 27th about order No.154 until this moment., I now learn, what I knew nothing of before, that the history of the order is as follows:  When General McClellan telegraphed asking General Halleck to have the order made, General Halleck went to the Secretary of War with it, stating his approval of the plan., The Secretary assented and General Halleck wrote the order., It was a military question, which the Secretary supposed the General understood better than he., I wish I could see Governor Curtin., Yours of the 29th received., I shall take it to General Halleck, but I already know it will be inconvenient to take General Morgan's command from where it now is., I am glad to hear you speak hopefully of Tennessee., I sincerely hope Rosecrans may find it possible to do something for her., David Nelson, son of the M. C. of your State, regrets his father's final defection, and asks me for a situation., Do you know him?, Could he be of service to you or to Tennessee in any capacity in which I could send him?, Captain Derrickson, with his company, has been for some time keeping guard at my residence, now at the Soldiers' Retreat., He and his company are very agreeable to me, and while it is deemed proper for any guard to remain, none would be more satisfactory than Captain Derrickson and his company., By direction of the President, it is ordered that Major-General McClellan be relieved from the command of the Army of the Potomac, and that Major-General Burnside take the command of that army., Also that Major-General Hunter take command of the corps in said army which is now commanded by General Burnside., That Major-General Fitz., John Porter be relieved from command of the corps he now commands in said army, and that Major-General Hooker take command of said corps., The general-in-chief is authorized, in [his] discretion, to issue an order substantially as the above forthwith, or so soon as he may deem proper., You are re-elected., I wish to see you at once will you come?, Please answer., Yours of yesterday received., Governor Johnson, Mr. Ethridge, and others are looking after the very thing you telegraphed about., Your despatch giving the names of 300 Indians condemned to death is received., Please forward as soon as possible the full and complete record of their convictions; and if the record does not fully indicate the more guilty and influential of the culprits, please have a careful statement made on these points and forwarded to me., Send all by mail., This will introduce Major-General Banks., He is in command of a considerable land force for operating in the South, and I shall be glad for you to co-Operate with him and give him such assistance as you can consistently with your orders from the Navy Department., Ordered, First: that clearances issued by the Treasury Department for vessels or merchandise bound for the port of Norfolk, for the military necessities of the department, certified by the military commandant at Fort Monroe, shall be allowed to enter said port., Second: that vessels and domestic produce from Norfolk, permitted by the military commandant at Fort Monroe for the military purposes of his command, shall on his permit be allowed to pass from said port to their destination in any port not blockaded by the United States., Ordered, by the President of the United States, That the Attorney-General be charged with the superintendence and direction of all proceedings to be had under the act of Congress of the 17th of July, 1862, entitled ""An act to suppress insurrection, to punish treason and rebellion, to seize and confiscate the property of rebels, and for other purposes,"" in so far as may concern the seizure, prosecution, and condemnation of the estate, property, and effects of rebels and traitors, as mentioned and provided for in the fifth, sixth, and seventh sections of the said act of Congress., And the Attorney-General is authorized and required to give to the attorneys and marshals of the United States such instructions and directions as he may find needful and convenient touching all such seizures, prosecutions, and condemnations, and, moreover, to authorize all such attorneys and marshals, whenever there may be reasonable ground to fear any forcible resistance to them in the discharge of their respective duties in this behalf, to call upon any military officer in command of the forces of the United States to give to them such aid, protection, and support as may be necessary to enable them safely and efficiently to discharge their respective duties; and all such commanding officers are required promptly to obey such call, and to render the necessary service as far as may be in their power consistently with their other duties., Your despatch of the 4th, about returning troops from western Virginia to Tennessee, is just received, and I have been to General Halleck with it., He says an order has already been made by which those troops have already moved, or soon will move, to Tennessee., The President, Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy, desires and enjoins the orderly observance of the Sabbath by the officers and men in the military and naval service., The importance for man and beast of the prescribed weekly rest, the sacred rights of Christian soldiers and sailors, a becoming deference to the best sentiment of a Christian people, and a due regard for the divine will demand that Sunday labor in the army and navy be reduced to the measure of strict necessity., The discipline and character of the national forces should not suffer nor the cause they defend be imperilled by the profanation of the day or name of the Most High., ""At this time of public distress,"" adopting the words of Washington in 1776, ""men may find enough to do in the service of God and their country without abandoning themselves to vice and immorality."", The first general order issued by the Father of his Country after the Declaration of Independence indicates the spirit in which our institutions were founded and should ever be defended:  ""The General hopes and trusts that every officer and man will endeavor to live and act as becomes a Christian soldier defending the dearest rights and liberties of his country."", Your brother says you are solicitous to be ordered to join General McLernand., I suppose you are ordered to Helena; this means that you are to form part of McLernand's expedition as it moves down the river; and General McLernand is so informed., I will see General Halleck as to whether the additional force you mention can go with you., Please give me your best opinion as to the number of the enemy now at Richmond and also at Petersburg., Dr. Kennedy, bearer of this, has some apprehension that Federal officers not citizens of Louisiana may be set up as candidates for Congress in that State., In my view there could be no possible object in such an election., We do not particularly need members of Congress from there to enable us to get along with legislation here., What we do want is the conclusive evidence that respectable citizens of Louisiana are willing to be members of Congress and to swear support to the Constitution, and that other respectable citizens there are willing to vote for them and send them., To send a parcel of Northern men here as representatives, elected, as would be understood (and perhaps really so), at the point of the bayonet, would be disgusting and outrageous; and were I a member of Congress here, I would vote against admitting any such man to a seat., Ordered, That no arms, ammunition, or munitions of war be cleared or allowed to be exported from the United States until further orders., That any clearance for arms, ammunition, or munitions of war issued heretofore by the Treasury Department be vacated, if the articles have not passed without the United States, and the articles stopped., That the Secretary of War hold possession of the arms, etc., recently seized by his order at Rouse's Point, bound for Canada., Early last week you left me in high hope with your assurance that you would be off with your expedition at the end of that week, or early in this., It is now the end of this, and I have just been overwhelmed and confounded with the sight of a requisition made by you which, I am assured, cannot be filled and got off within an hour short of two months., I enclose you a copy of the requisition, in some hope that it is not genuine--that you have never seen it., My dear General, this expanding and piling up of impedimenta has been, so far, almost our ruin, and will be our final ruin if it is not abandoned., If you had the articles of this requisition upon the wharf, with the necessary animals to make them of any use, and forage for the animals, you could not get vessels together in two weeks to carry the whole, to say nothing of your twenty thousand men; and, having the vessels, you could not put the cargoes aboard in two weeks more., And, after all, where you are going you have no use for them., When you parted with me you had no such ideas in your mind., I know you had not, or you could not have expected to be off so soon as you said., You must get back to something like the plan you had then, or your expedition is a failure before you start., You must be off before Congress meets., You would be better off anywhere, and especially where you are going, for not having a thousand wagons doing nothing but hauling forage to feed the animals that draw them, and taking at least two thousand men to care for the wagons and animals, who otherwise might be two thousand good soldiers., Now, dear General, do not think this is an ill-natured letter; it is the very reverse., The simple publication of this requisition would ruin you., I have just received and read your letter of the 20th., The purport of it is that we lost the late elections and the administration is failing because the war is unsuccessful, and that I must not flatter myself that I am not justly to blame for it., I certainly know that if the war fails the administration fails, and that I will be blamed for it, whether I deserve it or not., ...]"|3
76|"[The Territories of the United States, with unimportant exceptions, have remained undisturbed by the civil war; and they are exhibiting such evidence of prosperity as justifies an expectation that some of them will soon be in a condition to be organized as States and be constitutionally admitted into the Federal Union., The immense mineral resources of some of those Territories ought to be developed as rapidly as possible., Every step in that direction would have a tendency to improve the revenues of the government and diminish the burdens of the people., It is worthy of your serious consideration whether some extraordinary measures to promote that end cannot be adopted., The means which suggests itself as most likely to be effective is a scientific exploration of the mineral regions in those Territories with a view to the publication of its results at home and in foreign countries--results which cannot fail to be auspicious., The condition of the finances win claim your most diligent consideration., The vast expenditures incident to the military and naval operations required for the suppression of the rebellion have hitherto been met with a promptitude and certainty unusual in similar circumstances, and the public credit has been fully maintained., The continuance of the war, however, and the increased disbursements made necessary by the augmented forces now in the field demand your best reflections as to the best modes of providing the necessary revenue without injury to business and with the least possible burdens upon labor., The suspension of specie payments by the banks soon after the commencement of your last session made large issues of United States notes unavoidable., In no other way could the payment of troops and the satisfaction of other just demands be so economically or so well provided for., The judicious legislation of Congress, securing the receivability of these notes for loans and internal duties and making them a legal tender for other debts, has made them an universal currency, and has satisfied, partially at least, and for the time, the long-felt want of an uniform circulating medium, saving thereby to the people immense sums in discounts and exchanges., A return to specie payments, however, at the earliest period compatible with due regard to all interests concerned should ever be kept in view., Fluctuations in the value of currency are always injurious, and to reduce these fluctuations to the lowest possible point will always be a leading purpose in wise legislation., Convertibility, prompt and certain convertibility, into coin is generally acknowledged to be the best and surest safeguard against them; and it is extremely doubtful whether a circulation of United States notes payable in coin and sufficiently large for the wants of the people can be permanently, usefully, and safely maintained., Is there, then, any other mode in which the necessary provision for the public wants can be made and the great advantages of a safe and uniform currency secured?, I know of none which promises so certain results and is at the same time so unobjectionable as the organization of banking associations, under a general act of Congress, well guarded in its provisions., To such associations the government might furnish circulating notes, on the security of United States bonds deposited in the treasury., These notes, prepared under the supervision of proper officers, being uniform in appearance and security and convertible always into coin, would at once protect labor against the evils of a vicious currency and facilitate commerce by cheap and safe exchanges., A moderate reservation from the interest on the bonds would compensate the United States for the preparation and distribution of the notes and a general supervision of the system, and would lighten the burden of that part of the public debt employed as securities., The public credit, moreover, would be greatly improved and the negotiation of new loans greatly facilitated by the steady market demand for government bonds which the adoption of the proposed system would create., It is an additional recommendation of the measure, of considerable weight, in my judgment, that it would reconcile as far as possible all existing interests by the opportunity offered to existing institutions to reorganize under the act, substituting only the secured uniform national circulation for the local and various circulation, secured and unsecured, now issued by them., The receipts into the treasury from all sources, including loans and balance from the preceding year, for the fiscal year ending on the 30th June, 1862, were $583,885,247.06, of which sum $49,056,397.62 were derived from customs; $1,795,331.73 from the direct tax; from public lands, $152,203.77; from miscellaneous sources, $931,787.64; from loans in all forms, $529,692,460.50., The remainder, $2,257,065.80, was the balance from last year., The disbursements during the same period were: For congressional, executive, and judicial purposes, $5,939,009.29; for foreign intercourse, $1,339,710.35; for miscellaneous expenses, including the mints, loans, post-office deficiencies, collection of revenue, and other like charges, $14,129,771.50; for expenses under the Interior Department, $3,102,985.52; under the War Department, $394,368,407.36; under the Navy Department, $42,674,569.69; for interest on public debt, $13,190,324.45; and for payment of public debt, including reimbursement of temporary loan and redemptions, $96,096,922.09; making an aggregate of $570,841,700.25, and leaving a balance in the treasury on the 1st day of July, 1862, of $13,043,546.81., It should be observed that the sum of $96,096,922.09, expended for reimbursements and redemption of public debt, being included also in the loans made, may be properly deducted both from receipts and expenditures, leaving the actual receipts for the year $487,788,324.97, and the expenditures $474,744,778.16., Other information on the subject of the finances will be found in the report of the Secretary of the Treasury, to whose statements and views I invite your most candid and considerate attention., The reports of the Secretaries of War and of the Navy are herewith transmitted., These reports, though lengthy, are scarcely more than brief abstracts of the very numerous and extensive transactions and operations conducted through those departments., Nor could I give a summary of them here upon any principle which would admit of its being much shorter than the reports themselves., I therefore content myself with laying the reports before you and asking your attention to them., It gives me pleasure to report a decided improvement in the financial condition of the Post-Office Department as compared with several preceding years., The receipts for the fiscal year 1861 amounted to $8,349,296.40, which embraced the revenue from all the States of the Union for three quarters of that year., Notwithstanding the cessation of revenue from the so-called seceded States during the last fiscal year, the increase of the correspondence of the loyal States has been sufficient to produce a revenue during the same year of $8,299,820.90, being only $50,000 less than was derived from all the States of the Union during the previous year., The expenditures show a still more favorable result., The amount expended in 1861 was $13,606,759.11., For the last year the amount has been reduced to $11,125,364.13, showing a decrease of about $2,481,000 in the expenditures as compared with the preceding year, and about $3,750,000 as compared with the fiscal year 1860., The deficiency in the department for the previous year was $4,551,966.98., For the last fiscal year it was reduced to $2,112,814.57., These favorable results are in part owing to the cessation of mail service in the insurrectionary States and in part to a careful review of all expenditures in that department in the interest of economy., The efficiency of the postal service, it is believed, has also been much improved., The Postmaster-General has also opened a correspondence through the Department of State with foreign governments proposing a convention of postal representatives for the purpose of simplifying the rates of foreign postage and to expedite the foreign mails., This proposition, equally important to our adopted citizens and to the commercial interests of this country, has been favorably entertained and agreed to by all the governments from whom replies have been received., I ask the attention of Congress to the suggestions of the Postmaster-General in his report respecting the further legislation required, in his opinion, for the benefit of the postal service., The discrepancy between the sum here stated as arising from the sales of the public lands and the sum derived from the same source as reported from the Treasury Department arises, as I understand, from the fact that the periods of time, though apparently were not really coincident at the beginning point, the Treasury report including a considerable sum now which had previously been reported from the Interior, sufficiently large to greatly overreach the sum derived from the three months now reported upon by the Interior and not by the Treasury., The Indian tribes upon our frontiers have during the past year manifested a spirit of insubordination, and at several points have engaged in open hostilities against the white settlements in their vicinity., The tribes occupying the Indian country south of Kansas renounced their allegiance to the United States and entered into treaties with the insurgents., Those who remained loyal to the United States were driven from the country., The chief of the Cherokees has visited this city for the purpose of restoring the former relations of the tribe with the United States., He alleges that they were constrained by superior force to enter into treaties with the insurgents, and that the United States neglected to furnish the protection which their treaty stipulations required., In the month of August last the Sioux Indians in Minnesota attacked the settlements in their vicinity with extreme ferocity, killing indiscriminately men, women, and children., This attack was wholly unexpected, and therefore no means of defense had been provided., It is estimated that not less than 800 persons were killed by the Indians, and a large amount of property was destroyed., How this outbreak was induced is not definitely known, and suspicions, which may be unjust, need not to be stated., Information was received by the Indian Bureau from different sources about the time hostilities were commenced that a simultaneous attack was to be made upon white settlements by all the tribes between the Mississippi River and the Rocky Mountains., The State of Minnesota has suffered great injury from this Indian war., A large portion of her territory has been depopulated, and a severe loss has been sustained by the destruction of property., The people of that State manifest much anxiety for the removal of the tribes beyond the limits of the State as a guaranty against future hostilities., The Commissioner of Indian Affairs will furnish full details., I submit for your especial consideration whether our Indian system shall not be remodeled., Many wise and good men have impressed me with the belief that this can be profitably done., I submit a statement of the proceedings of commissioners, which shows the progress that has been made in the enterprise of constructing the Pacific Railroad., And this suggests the earliest completion of this road, and also the favorable action of Congress upon the projects now pending before them for enlarging the capacities of the great canals in New York and Illinois, as being of vital and rapidly increasing importance to the whole nation, and especially to the vast interior region hereinafter to be noticed at some greater length., I purpose having prepared and laid before you at an early day some interesting and valuable statistical information upon this subject., The military and commercial importance of enlarging the Illinois and Michigan Canal and improving the Illinois River is presented in the report of Colonel Webster to the Secretary of War, and now transmitted to Congress., I respectfully ask attention to it., To carry out the provisions of the act of Congress of the 15th of May last, I have caused the Department of Agriculture of the United States to be organized., The Commissioner informs me that within the period of a few months this department has established an extensive system of correspondence and exchanges, both at home and abroad, which promises to effect highly beneficial results in the development of a correct knowledge of recent improvements in agriculture, in the introduction of new products, and in the collection of the agricultural statistics of the different States., Also, that it will soon be prepared to distribute largely seeds, cereals, plants, and cuttings, and has already published and liberally diffused much valuable information in anticipation of a more elaborate report, which will in due time be furnished, embracing some valuable tests in chemical science now in progress in the laboratory., The creation of this department was for the more immediate benefit of a large class of our most valuable citizens, and I trust that the liberal basis upon which it has been organized will not only meet your approbation, but that it will realize at no distant day all the fondest anticipations of its most sanguine friends and become the fruitful source of advantage to all our people., On the 22d day of September last a proclamation was issued by the Executive, a copy of which is herewith submitted., In accordance with the purpose expressed in the second paragraph of that paper, I now respectfully recall your attention to what may be called ""compensated emancipation."", A nation may be said to consist of its territory, its people, and its laws., The territory is the only part which is of certain durability., It is of the first importance to duly consider and estimate this ever enduring part., That portion of the earth's surface which is owned and inhabited by the people of the United States is well adapted to be the home of one national family, and it is not well adapted for two or more., Its vast extent and its variety of climate and productions are of advantage in this age for one people, whatever they might have been in former ages., Steam, telegraphs, and intelligence have brought these to be an advantageous combination for one united people., In the inaugural address I briefly pointed out the total inadequacy of disunion as a remedy for the differences between the people of the two sections., I did so in language which I cannot improve, and which, therefore, I beg to repeat:  ""One section of our country believes slavery is right and ought to be extended, while the other believes it is wrong and ought not to be extended., This is the only substantial dispute., The fugitive-slave clause of the Constitution and the laws for the suppression of the foreign slave trade are each as well enforced, perhaps, as any law can ever be in a community where the moral Sense of the people imperfectly supports the law itself., The great body of the people abide by the dry legal obligation in both cases, and a few break over in each., This, I think, cannot be perfectly cured, and it would be worse in both cases after the separation of the sections than before., The foreign slave trade, now imperfectly suppressed, would be ultimately revived without restriction in one section, while fugitive slaves, now only partially surrendered, would not be surrendered at all by the other., ""Physically speaking, we can not separate., We can not remove our respective sections from each other nor build an impassable wall between them., A husband and wife may be divorced and go out of the presence and beyond the reach of each other, but the different parts of our country cannot do this., They cannot but remain face to face, and intercourse, either amicable or hostile, must continue between them., Is it possible, then, to make that intercourse more advantageous or more satisfactory after separation than before?, Can aliens make treaties easier than friends can make laws?, Can treaties be more faithfully enforced between aliens than laws can among friends?, Suppose you go to war, you cannot fight always; and when, after much loss on both sides and no gain on either, you cease fighting, the identical old questions, as to terms of intercourse, are again upon you."", There is no line, straight or crooked, suitable for a national boundary upon which to divide., Trace through, from east to west, upon the line between the free and slave country, and we shall find a little more than one third of its length are rivers, easy to be crossed, and populated, or soon to be populated, thickly upon both sides; while nearly all its remaining length are merely surveyors' lines, over which people may walk back and forth without any consciousness of their presence., No part of this line can be made any more difficult to pass by writing it down on paper or parchment as a national boundary., The fact of separation, if it comes, gives up on the part of the seceding section the fugitive-slave clause along with all other constitutional obligations upon the section seceded from, while I should expect no treaty stipulation would ever be made to take its place., But there is another difficulty., The great interior region bounded east by the Alleghenies, north by the British dominions, west by the Rocky Mountains, and south by the line along which the culture of corn and cotton meets, and which includes part of Virginia, part of Tennessee, all of Kentucky, Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, Wisconsin, Illinois, Missouri, Kansas, Iowa, Minnesota, and the Territories of Dakota, Nebraska, and part of Colorado, already has above 10,000,000 people, and will have 50,000,000 within fifty years if not prevented by any political folly or mistake., It contains more than one third of the country owned by the United States--certainly more than 1,000,000 square miles., Once half as populous as Massachusetts already is, it would have more than 75,000,000 people., ...]"|3
77|"[As to when this may be, we can judge by the past and the present; as to when it will be, if ever, depends much on whether we maintain the Union These figures show that our country may be as populous as Europe now is at some point between 1920 and 1930, say about 1925--our territory, at 73 persons to the square mile, being of capacity to contain 217,186,000., And we will reach this, too, if we do not ourselves relinquish the chance by the folly and evils of disunion or by long and exhausting war springing from the only great element of national discord among us., While it cannot be foreseen exactly how much one huge example of secession, breeding lesser ones indefinitely, would retard population, civilization, and prosperity, no one can doubt that the extent of it would be very great and injurious., The proposed emancipation would shorten the war, perpetuate peace, insure this increase of population, and proportionately the wealth of the country., With these we should pay all the emancipation would cost, together with our other debt, easier than we should pay our other debt without it., If we had allowed our old national debt to run at six per cent., per annum, simple interest, from the end of our revolutionary struggle until to-day, without paying anything on either principal or interest, each man of us would owe less upon that debt now than each man owed upon it then; and this because our increase of men through the whole period has been greater than six per cent.--has run faster than the interest upon the debt., Thus time alone relieves a debtor nation, so long as its population increases faster than unpaid interest accumulates on its debt., This fact would be no excuse for delaying payment of what is justly due, but it shows the great importance of time in this connection--the great advantage of a policy by which we shall not have to pay until we number 100,000,000 what by a different policy we would have to pay now, when we number but 31,000,000., In a word, it shows that a dollar will be much harder to pay for the war than will be a dollar for emancipation on the proposed plan., And then the latter will cost no blood, no precious life., It will be a saving of both., As to the second article, I think it would be impracticable to return to bondage the class of persons therein contemplated., Some of them, doubtless, in the property sense belong to loyal owners, and hence Provision is made in this article for compensating such., The third article relates to the future of the freed people., It does not oblige, but merely authorizes Congress to aid in colonizing such as may consent., This ought nut to be regarded as objectionable on the one hand or on the other, insomuch as it comes to nothing unless by the mutual consent of the people to be deported and the American voters through their representatives in Congress., I cannot make it better known than it already is that I strongly favor colonization; and yet I wish to say there is an objection urged against free colored persons remaining in the country which is largely imaginary, if not sometimes malicious., It is insisted that their presence would injure and displace white labor and white laborers., If there ever could be a proper time for mere catch arguments that time surely is not now., In times like the present men should utter nothing for which they would not willingly be responsible through time and in eternity., Is it true, then, that colored people can displace any more white labor by being free than by remaining slaves?, If they stay in their old places, they jostle no white laborers; if they leave their old places, they leave them open to white laborers., Logically, there is neither more nor less of it., Emancipation, even without deportation, would probably enhance the wages of white labor, and very surely would not reduce them., Thus the customary amount of labor would still have to be performed., The freed people would surely not do more than their old proportion of it, and very probably for a time would do less, leaving an increased part to white laborers, bringing their labor into greater demand, and consequently enhancing the wages of it., With deportation, even to a limited extent, enhanced wages to white labor is mathematically certain., Labor is like any other commodity in the market-increase the demand for it and you increase the price of it., Reduce the supply of black labor by colonizing the black laborer out of the country, and by precisely so much you increase the demand for and wages of white labor., But it is dreaded that the freed people will swarm forth and cover the whole land., Are they not already in the land?, Will liberation make them any more numerous?, Equally distributed among the whites of the whole country, and there would be but one colored to seven whites., Could the one in any way greatly disturb the seven?, There are many communities now having more than one free colored person to seven whites, and this without any apparent consciousness of evil from it., The District of Columbia and the States of Maryland and Delaware are all in this condition., The District has more than one free colored to six whites, and yet in its frequent petitions to Congress I believe it has never presented the presence of free colored persons as one of its grievances., But why should emancipation South send the free people North?, People of any color seldom run unless there be something to run from., Heretofore colored people to some extent have fled North from bondage, and now, perhaps, from both bondage and destitution., But if gradual emancipation and deportation be adopted, they will have neither to flee from., Their old masters will give them wages at least until new laborers can be procured, and the freedmen in turn will gladly give their labor for the wages till new homes can be found for them in congenial climes and with people of their own blood and race., This proposition can be trusted on the mutual interests involved., And in any event, cannot the North decide for itself whether to receive them?, Again, as practice proves more than theory in any case, has there been any irruption of colored people northward because of the abolishment of slavery in this District last spring?, What I have said of the proportion of free colored persons to the whites in the District is from the census of 1860, having no reference to persons called contrabands nor to those made free by the act of Congress abolishing slavery here., The plan consisting of these articles is recommended, not but that a restoration of the national authority would be accepted without its adoption., Nor will the war nor proceedings under the proclamation of September 22, 1862, be stayed because of the recommendation of this plan., Its timely adoption, I doubt not, would bring restoration, and thereby stay both., And notwithstanding this plan, the recommendation that Congress provide by law for compensating any State which may adopt emancipation before this plan shall have been acted upon is hereby earnestly renewed., Such would be only an advance part of the plan, and the same arguments apply to both., This plan is recommended as a means, not in exclusion of, but additional to, all others for restoring and preserving the national authority throughout the Union., The subject is presented exclusively in its economical aspect., The plan would, I am confident, secure peace more speedily and maintain it more permanently than can be done by force alone, while all it would cost, considering amounts and manner of payment and times of payment, would be easier paid than will be the additional cost of the war if we rely solely upon force., It is much, very much, that it would cost no blood at all., The plan is proposed as permanent constitutional law., It cannot become such without the concurrence of, first, two thirds of Congress, and afterwards three fourths of the States., The requisite three fourths of the States will necessarily include seven of the slave States., Their concurrence, if obtained, will give assurance of their severally adopting emancipation at no very distant day upon the new constitutional terms., This assurance would end the struggle now and save the Union forever., I do not forget the gravity which should characterize a paper addressed to the Congress of the nation by the chief magistrate of the nation, nor do I forget that some of you are my seniors, nor that many of you have more experience than I in the conduct of public affairs., Yet I trust that in view of the great responsibility resting upon me you will perceive no want of respect to yourselves in any undue earnestness I may seem to display., Is it doubted, then, that the plan I propose, if adopted, would shorten the war, and thus lessen its expenditure of money and of blood?, Is it doubted that it would restore the national authority and national prosperity and perpetuate both indefinitely?, Is it doubted that we here--Congress and executive--can secure its adoption?, Will not the good people respond to a united and earnest appeal from us?, Can we, can they, by any other means so certainly or so speedily assure these vital objects?, We can succeed only by concert., It is not ""Can any of us imagine better?"", but ""Can we all do better?"", Object whatsoever is possible, still the question recurs, ""Can we do better?"", The dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present., The occasion is piled high with difficulty, and we must rise with the occasion., As our case is new, so we must think anew and act anew., We must disenthrall ourselves, and then we shall save our country., Fellow-citizens, we can not escape history., We of this Congress and this administration will be remembered in spite of ourselves., No personal significance or insignificance can spare one or another of us., The fiery trial through which we pass will light us down in honor or dishonor to the latest generation., We say we are for the Union., The world will not forget that we say this., We know how to save the Union., The world knows we do know how to save it., We, even we here, hold the power and bear the responsibility., In giving freedom to the slave we assure freedom to the free--honorable alike in what we give and what we preserve., We shall nobly save or meanly lose the last, best hope of earth., Other means may succeed; this could not fail., The way is plain, peaceful, generous, just--a way which if followed the world will forever applaud and God must forever bless., On the 3d of November, 1861, a collision took place off the coast of Cuba between the United States war steamer San Jacinto and the French brig Jules et Marie, resulting in serious damage to the latter., The obligation of this Government to make amends therefor could not be questioned if the injury resulted from any fault On the part of the San Jacinto., With a view to ascertain this, the subject was referred to a commission of the United States and French naval officers at New York, with a naval officer of Italy as an arbiter., The conclusion arrived at was that the collision was occasioned by the failure of the San Jacinto seasonably to reverse her engine., It then became necessary to ascertain the amount of indemnification due to the injured party., The United States consul-general at Havana was consequently instructed to confer with the consul of France on this point, and they have determined that the sum of $9,500 is an equitable allowance under the circumstances., I recommend an appropriation of this sum for the benefit of the owners of the Jules et Marie., A copy of the letter of Mr. Shufeldt, the consul-general of the United States at Havana, to the Secretary of State on the subject is herewith transmitted., Yours of November 25 reached me only yesterday., Thank you for it., I shall consider and remember your suggestions., ...]"|3
78|"[Is not this so?, And yet it is a mistake., You are sure to be happy again., To know this, which is certainly true, will make you some less miserable now., I have had experience enough to know what I say, and you need only to believe it to feel better at once., The memory of your dear father, instead of an agony, will yet be a sad, sweet feeling in your heart, of a purer and holier sort than you have known before., Please present my kind regards to your afflicted mother., Two Ohio regiments and one Illinois regiment which were captured at Hartsville have been paroled and are now at Columbus, Ohio., This brings the Ohio regiments substantially to their homes., I am strongly impressed with the belief that the Illinois regiment better be sent to Illinois, where it will be recruited and put in good condition by the time they are exchanged so as to re-enter the service., They did not misbehave, as I am satisfied, so that they should receive no treatment nor have anything withheld from them by way of punishment., Let the order in regard to Dr. McPheeters and family be suspended until you hear from me., I do not wish to leave the country north of the Missouri to the care of the enrolled militia except upon the concurrent judgment of yourself and General Curtis., His I have not yet obtained., Confer with him, and I shall be glad to act when you and he agree., I have good reason for saying you must not make a general movement of the army without letting me know., I hear not a word about the Congressional election of which you and I corresponded., Time clearly up., The proclamation cannot be telegraphed to you until during the day to-morrow., Whereas on the 22d day of September, A.D. 1862, a proclamation was issued by the President of the United States, containing, among other things, the following, to wit:  ""That on the 1st day of January, A.D., 1863, all persons held as slaves within any State or designated part of a State the people whereof shall then be in rebellion against the United States shall be then, thenceforward, and forever free; and the executive government of the United States, including the military and naval authority thereof, will recognize and maintain the freedom of such persons and will do no act or acts to repress such persons, or any of them, in any efforts they may make for their actual freedom., ""That the executive will on the 1st day of January aforesaid, by proclamation, designate the States and parts of States, if any, in which the people thereof, respectively, shall then be in rebellion against the United States; and the fact that any State or the people thereof shall on that day be in good faith represented in the Congress of the United States by members chosen thereto at elections wherein a majority of the qualified voters of such States shall have participated shall, in the absence of strong countervailing testimony, be deemed conclusive evidence that such State and the people thereof are not then in rebellion against the United States."", Now, therefore, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States, by virtue of the power in me vested as Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States in time of actual armed rebellion against the authority and government of the United States, and as a fit and necessary war measure for suppressing said rebellion, do, on this 1st day of January, A. D. 1863, and in accordance with my purpose so to do, publicly proclaimed for the full period of one hundred days from the first day above mentioned, order and designate as the States and parts of States wherein the people thereof, respectively, are this day in rebellion against the United States the following, to wit:  Arkansas, Texas, Louisiana (except the parishes of St. Bernard, Plaquemines, Jefferson, St. John, St. Charles, St. James, Ascension, Assumption, Terre Bonne, Lafourche, St. Mary, St. Martin, and Orleans, including the city of New Orleans), Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, and Virginia (except the forty-eight counties designated as West Virginia, and also the counties of Berkeley, Accomac, Northampton, Elizabeth City, York, Princess Anne, and Norfolk, including the cities of Norfolk and Portsmouth), and which excepted parts are for the present left precisely as if this proclamation were not issued., And by virtue of the power and for the purpose aforesaid, I do order and declare that all persons held as slaves within said designated States and parts of States are, and henceforward shall be, free; and that the Executive Government of the United States, including the military and naval authorities thereof, will recognize and maintain the freedom of said persons., And I hereby enjoin upon the people so declared to be free to abstain from all violence, unless in necessary self-defense; and I recommend to them that, in all cases when allowed, they labor faithfully for reasonable wages., And I further declare and make known that such persons of suitable condition will be received into the armed service of the United States to garrison forts, positions, stations, and other places, and to man vessels of all sorts in said service., And upon this act, sincerely believed to be an act of justice, warranted by the Constitution upon military necessity, I invoke the considerate judgment of mankind and the gracious favor of Almighty God., In witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed., Done at the city of Washington, this first day of January, A.D. 1863, and of the independence of the United States of America the eighty-seventh., General Burnside wishes to cross the Rappahannock with his army, but his grand division commanders all oppose the movement., If in such a difficulty as this you do not help, you fail me precisely in the point for which I sought your assistance You know what General Burnside's plan is, and it is my wish that you go with him to the ground, examine it as far as practicable, confer with the officers, getting their judgment, and ascertaining their temper--in a word, gather all the elements for forming a judgment of your own, and then tell General Burnside that you do approve or that you do not approve his plan., Your military skill is useless to me if you will not do this., I submit to Congress the expediency of extending to other departments of the government the authority conferred on the President by the eighth section of the act of the 8th of May, 1792, to appoint a person to temporarily discharge the duties of Secretary of State, Secretary of the Treasury, and Secretary of War, in case of the death, absence from the seat of government, or sickness of either of those officers., Yours of December 29 by the hand of Mr. Strong is just received., The day I telegraphed you suspending the order in relation to Dr. McPheeters, he, with Mr. Bates, the Attorney-General, appeared before me and left with me a copy of the order mentioned., The doctor also showed me the Copy of an oath which he said he had taken, which is indeed very strong and specific., He also verbally assured me that he had constantly prayed in church for the President and government, as he had always done before the present war., In looking over the recitals in your order, I do not see that this matter of the prayer, as he states it, is negatived, nor that any violation of his oath is charged nor, in fact, that anything specific is alleged against him., The charges are all general: that he has a rebel wife and rebel relations, that he sympathies with rebels, and that he exercises rebel influence., Now, after talking with him, I tell you frankly I believe he does sympathize with the rebels, but the question remains whether such a man, of unquestioned good moral character, who has taken such an oath as he has, and cannot even be charged with violating it, and who can be charged with no other specific act or omission, can, with safety to the government, be exiled upon the suspicion of his secret sympathies., But I agree that this must be left to you, who are on the spot; and if, after all, you think the public good requires his removal, my suspension of the order is withdrawn, only with this qualification, that the time during the suspension is not to be counted against him., I have promised him this., But I must add that the United States Government must not, as by this order, undertake to run the churches., When an individual in a church or out of it becomes dangerous to the public interest, he must be checked; but let the churches, as such, take care of themselves., It will not do for the United States to appoint trustees, supervisors, or other agents for the churches., The committee composed of Messrs. Yeatman and Filley (Mr. Broadhead not attending) has presented your letter and the memorial of sundry citizens., On the whole subject embraced exercise your best judgment, with a sole view to the public interest, and I will not interfere without hearing you., As many persons who come well recommended for loyalty and service to the Union cause, and who are refugees from rebel oppression in the State of Virginia, make application to me for authority and permission to remove their families and property to protection within the Union lines, by means of our armed gunboats on the Potomac River and Chesapeake Bay, you are hereby requested to hear and consider all such applications, and to grant such assistance to this class of persons as in your judgment their merits may render proper, and as may in each case be consistent with the perfect and complete efficiency of the naval service and with military expediency., I am having a good deal of trouble with Missouri matters, and I now sit down to write you particularly about it., One class of friends believe in greater severity and another in greater leniency in regard to arrests, banishments, and assessments., As usual in such cases, each questions the other's motives., On the one hand, it is insisted that Governor Gamble's unionism, at most, is not better than a secondary spring of action; that hunkerism and a wish for political influence stand before Unionism with him., On the other hand, it is urged that arrests, banishments, and assessments are made more for private malice, revenge, and pecuniary interest than for the public good., This morning I was told, by a gentleman who I have no doubt believes what he says, that in one case of assessments for $10,000 the different persons who paid compared receipts, and found they had paid $30,000., If this be true, the inference is that the collecting agents pocketed the odd $20,000., And true or not in the instance, nothing but the sternest necessity can justify the making and maintaining of a system so liable to such abuses., Doubtless the necessity for the making of the system in Missouri did exist, and whether it continues for the maintenance of it is now a practical and very important question., Some days ago Governor Gamble telegraphed me, asking that the assessments outside of St. Louis County might be suspended, as they already have been within it, and this morning all the members of Congress here from Missouri but one laid a paper before me asking the same thing., Now, my belief is that Governor Gamble is an honest and true man, not less so than yourself; that you and he could confer together on this and other Missouri questions with great advantage to the public; that each knows something which the other does not; and that acting together you could about double your stock of pertinent information., May I not hope that you and he will attempt this?, I could at once safely do (or you could safely do without me) whatever you and he agree upon., There is absolutely no reason why you should not agree., I forgot to say that Hon., James S. Rollins, member of Congress from one of the Missouri districts, wishes that, upon his personal responsibility, Rev., John M. Robinson, of Columbia, Missouri; James L. Matthews, of Boone County, Missouri; and James L. Stephens, also of Boone County, Missouri, may be allowed to return to their respective homes., Major Rollins leaves with me very strong papers from the neighbors of these men, whom he says he knows to be true men., He also says he has many constituents who he thinks are rightly exiled, but that he thinks these three should be allowed to return., Please look into the case, and oblige Major Rollins if you consistently can., The Honorable Senator Harlan has just placed in my hands your letter of the 27th of December, which I have read with pleasure and gratitude., It is most cheering and encouraging for me to know that in the efforts which I have made and am making for the restoration of a righteous peace to our country, I am upheld and sustained by the good wishes and prayers of God's people., No one is more deeply than myself aware that without His favor our highest wisdom is but as foolishness and that our most strenuous efforts would avail nothing in the shadow of His displeasure., I am conscious of no desire for my country's welfare that is not in consonance with His will, and of no plan upon which we may not ask His blessing., It seems to me that if there be one subject upon which all good men may unitedly agree, it is imploring the gracious favor of the God of Nations upon the struggles our people are making for the preservation of their precious birthright of civil and religious liberty., Your despatch announcing retreat of enemy has just reached here., God bless you and all with you!, Please tender to all, and accept for yourself, the nation's gratitude for your and their skill, endurance, and dauntless courage., Do Richmond papers of 6th say nothing about Vicksburg, or if anything, what?, What think you of forming a reserve cavalry corps of, say, 6000 for the Army of the Potomac?, Might not such a corps be constituted from the cavalry of Sigel's and Slocum's corps, with scraps we could pick up here and there?, Yours of to-day just received., The administration takes no part between its friends in Missouri, of whom I, at least, consider you one; and I have never before had an intimation that appointees there were interfering, or were inclined to interfere., Since my return to the army I have become more than ever convinced that the general officers of this command are almost unanimously opposed to another crossing of the river; but I am still of the opinion that the crossing should be attempted, and I have accordingly issued orders to the engineers and artillery to prepare for it., There is much hazard in it, as there always is in the majority of military movements, and I cannot begin the movement without giving you notice of it, particularly as I know so little of the effect that it may have upon other movements of distant armies., The influence of your telegram the other day is still upon me, and has impressed me with the idea that there are many parts of the problem which influence you that are not known to me., In order to relieve you from all embarrassment in my case, I inclose with this my resignation of my commission as major-general of volunteers, which you can have accepted if my movement is not in accordance with the views of yourself and your military advisers., I have taken the liberty to write to you personally upon this subject, because it was necessary, as I learned from General Halleck, for you to approve of my general plan, written at Warrenton, before I could commence the movement; and I think it quite as necessary that you should know of the important movement I am about to make, particularly as it will have to be made in opposition to the views of nearly all my general officers, and after the receipt of a despatch from you informing me of the opinion of some of them who had visited you., In conversation with you on New Year's morning I was led to express some opinions which I afterward felt it my duty to place on paper, and to express them verbally to the gentleman of whom we were speaking, which I did in your presence, after handing you the letter., You were not disposed then, as I saw, to retain the letter, and I took it back, but I now return it to you for record if you wish it., I beg leave to say that my resignation is not sent in in any spirit of insubordination, but, as I before said, simply to relieve you from any embarrassment in changing commanders where lack of confidence may have rendered it necessary., The bearer of this will bring me any answer, or I should be glad to hear from you by telegraph in cipher., Your communication of the 5th was delivered to me by your aide-de-camp at 12 M. to-day., In all my communications and interviews with you since you took command of the Army of the Potomac I have advised a forward movement across the Rappahannock., At our interview at Warrenton I urged that you should cross by the fords above Fredericksburg rather than to fall down to that place; and when I left you at Warrenton it was understood that at least a considerable part of your army would cross by the fords, and I so represented to the President., It was this modification of the plan proposed by you that I telegraphed you had received his approval., When the attempt at Fredericksburg was abandoned, I advised you to renew the attempt at some other point, either in whole or in part, to turn the enemy's works, or to threaten their wings or communications; in other words, to keep the enemy occupied till a favorable opportunity offered to strike a decisive blow., I particularly advised you to use your cavalry and light artillery upon his communications, and attempt to cut off his supplies and engage him at an advantage., In all our interviews I have urged that our first object was, not Richmond, but the defeat or scattering of Lee's army, which threatened Washington and the line of the upper Potomac., I now recur to these things simply to remind you of the general views which I have expressed, and which I still hold., The circumstances of the case, however, have somewhat changed since the early part of November., The chances of an extended line of operations are now, on account of the advanced season, much less than then., But the chances are still in our favor to meet and defeat the enemy on the Rappahannock, if we can effect a crossing in a position where we can meet the enemy on favorable or even equal terms., ...]"|3
79|"[I submit herewith for your consideration the joint resolutions of the corporate authorities of the city of Washington, adopted September a 7, 1862, and a memorial of the same under date of October 28, 1862, both relating to and urging the construction of certain railroads concentrating upon the city of Washington., In presenting this memorial and the joint resolutions to you, I am not prepared to say more than that the subject is one of great practical importance, and that I hope it will receive the attention of Congress., In compliance with the Sixty-fifth Article of War, these whole proceedings are transmitted to the Secretary of War, to be laid before the President of the United States., The foregoing proceedings, findings, and sentence in the foregoing case of Major-General Fitz-John Porter are approved and confirmed, and it is ordered that the said Fitz-John Porter be, and he hereby is, cashiered and dismissed from the service of the United States as a major-general of volunteers, and as colonel and brevet brigadier-general in the regular service of the United States, and forever disqualified from holding any office of trust or profit under the Government of the United States., The President has directed that so much of Arkansas as you may desire to control be temporarily attached to your department., This will give you control of both banks of the river., In your operations down the Mississippi you must not rely too confidently upon any direct co-operation of General Banks and the lower flotilla, as it is possible that they may not be able to pass or reduce Port Hudson., They, however, will do everything in their power to form a junction with you at Vicksburg., If they should not be able to effect this, they will at least occupy a portion of the enemy's forces, and prevent them from reinforcing Vicksburg., I hope, however, that they will do still better and be able to join you., It may be proper to give you some explanation of the revocation of your order expelling all Jews from your department., The President has no objection to your expelling traitors and Jew peddlers, which, I suppose, was the object of your order; but as it in terms proscribed an entire religious class, some of whom are fighting in our ranks, the President deemed it necessary to revoke it., Will see you any moment when you come., I., The President of the United States has directed:  1st., That Major-General A. E. Burnside, at his own request, be relieved from the command of the Army of the Potomac., 2d., That Major-General E. V. Sumner, at his own request, be relieved from duty in the Army of the Potomac., 3d., That Major-General W. B. Franklin be relieved from duty in the Army of the Potomac., 4th., That Major-General J. Hooker be assigned to the command of the Army of the Potomac., II., The officers relieved as above will report in person to the adjutant-general of the army., By order of the Secretary of War: D. TOWNSEND, Assistant Adjutant-General  I have placed you at the head of the Army of the Potomac., Of course I have done this upon what appear to me to be sufficient reasons, and yet I think it best for you to know that there are some things in regard to which I am not quite satisfied with you., I believe you to be a brave and skillful soldier, which of course I like., I also believe you do not mix politics with your profession, in which you are right., You have confidence in yourself, which is a valuable if not an indispensable quality., You are ambitious, which within reasonable bounds does good rather than harm; but I think that during General Burnside's command of the army you have taken counsel of your ambition and thwarted him as much as you could, in which you did a great wrong to the country and to a most meritorious and honorable brother officer., I have heard, in such a way as to believe it, of your recently saying that both the army and the government needed a dictator., Of course it was not for this, but in spite of it, that I have given you the command., Only those generals who gain successes can set up dictators., What I now ask of you is military success, and I will risk the dictatorship., The government will support you to the utmost of its ability, which is neither more nor less than it has done and will do for all commanders., I much fear that the spirit that you have aided to infuse into the army, of criticizing their commander and withholding confidence from him, will now turn upon you., I shall assist you as far as I can to put it down., Neither you nor Napoleon, if he were alive again, could get any good out of an army while such a spirit prevails in it., And now beware of rashness., Beware of rashness, but with energy and sleepless vigilance go forward and give us victories., In conformity to the law of July 16, 1862, I most cordially recommend that Commander David D. Porter, United States Navy, acting rear-admiral, commanding the Mississippi Squadron, receive a vote of thanks of Congress for the bravery and skill displayed in the attack on the post of Arkansas, which surrendered to the combined military and naval forces on the 10th instant., Please come here immediately., Telegraph me about what time you will arrive., Do Richmond papers have anything from Vicksburg?, your valedictory to the patrons of the Albany Evening journal brings me a good deal of uneasiness., What does it mean?, What iron-clads, if any, have gone out of Hampton Roads within the last two days?, Corcoran's and Pryor's battle terminated., Have you any news through Richmond papers or otherwise?, I do not take jurisdiction of the pass question., Exercise your own discretion as to whether Judge Pettis shall have a pass., I have received the New Year's address which you have sent me, with a sincere appreciation of the exalted and humane sentiments by which it was inspired., As these sentiments are manifestly the enduring support of the free institutions of England, so I am sure also that they constitute the only reliable basis for free institutions throughout the world., The resources, advantages, and powers of the American people are very great, and they have consequently succeeded to equally great responsibilities., It seems to have devolved upon them to test whether a government established on the principles of human freedom can be maintained against an effort to build one upon the exclusive foundation of human bondage., They will rejoice with me in the new evidences which your proceedings furnish that the magnanimity they are exhibiting is justly estimated by the true friends of freedom and humanity in foreign countries., Accept my best wishes for your individual welfare, and for the welfare and happiness of the whole British people., I hear of some difficulty in the streets of Baltimore yesterday., What is the amount of it?, On the 4th of September, 1862, Commander George Henry Preble, United States Navy, then senior officer in command of the naval force off the harbor of Mobile, was guilty of inexcusable neglect in permitting the armed steamer Oreto in open daylight to run the blockade., For his omission to perform his whole duty on that occasion, and the injury thereby inflicted on the service and the country, his name was stricken from the list of naval officers and he was dismissed [from] the service., Since his dismissal earnest application has been made for his restoration to his former position by senators and naval officers, on the ground that his fault was an error of judgment, and that the example in his case has already had its effect in preventing a repetition of similar neglect., I therefore on this application and representation, and in consideration of his previous fair record, do hereby nominate George Henry Preble to be a commander in the navy from the 16th July, 1862, to take rank on the active list next after Commander Edward Donaldson, and to fill a vacancy occasioned by the death of Commander J. M. Wainwright., On the 24th August, 1861, Commander Roger Perry, United., States Navy, was dismissed from the service under a misapprehension in regard to his loyalty to the Government, from the circumstance that several oaths were transmitted to him and the Navy Department failed to receive any recognition of them., After his dismissal, and upon his assurance that the oath failed to reach him and his readiness to execute it, he was recommissioned to his original position on the 4th September following., On the same day, 4th September, he was ordered to command the sloop of war Vandalia; on the 22d this order was revoked and he was ordered to duty in the Mississippi Squadron, and on the 23d January, 1862, was detached sick, and has since remained unemployed., The advisory board under the act of 16th July, 1862, did not recommend him for further promotion., This last commission, having been issued during the recess of the Senate, expired at the end of the succeeding session, 17th July, 1862, from which date, not having been nominated to the Senate, he ceased to be a commander in the navy., To correct the omission to nominate this officer to the Senate at its last session, I now nominate Commander Roger Perry to be a commander in the navy from the 14th September, 1855, to take his relative position on the list of commanders not recommended for further promotion., Your despatch about ""river patrolling"" received., I have called the Secretary of the Navy, Secretary of War, and General-in-Chief together, and submitted it to them, who promise to do their very best in the case., I cannot take it into my own hands without producing inextricable confusion., General Clay is here and I suppose the matter we spoke of will have to be definitely settled now., Please answer., Your note, by which you, as General Superintendent of the United States Christian Commission, invite me to preside at a meeting to be held this day at the hall of the House of Representatives in this city, is received., While, for reasons which I deem sufficient, I must decline to preside, I cannot withhold my approval of the meeting and its worthy objects., Whatever shall be, sincerely and in God's name, devised for the good of the soldiers and seamen in their hard spheres of duty, can scarcely fail to be blessed; and whatever shall tend to turn our thoughts from the unreasoning and uncharitable passions, prejudices, and jealousies incident to a great national trouble such as ours, and to fix them on the vast and long enduring consequences, for weal or for woe, which are to result from the struggle, and especially to strengthen our reliance on the Supreme Being for the final triumph of the right, cannot but be well for us all., The birthday of Washington and the Christian Sabbath coinciding this year, and suggesting together the highest interests of this life and of that to come, is most propitious for the meeting proposed., General Rosecrans respectfully urges the appointment of William P. Caslin as a brigadier-general, What say you?, If it will be no detriment to the service I will be obliged for Capt., Henry A. Marchant, of Company I, Twenty-third Pennsylvania Volunteers, to come here and remain four or five days., Whereas objects of interest to the United States require that the Senate should be convened at 12 o'clock on the 4th of March next to receive and act upon such communications as may be made to it on the part of the Executive:  Now, therefore, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States, have considered it to be my duty to issue this my proclamation, declaring that an extraordinary occasion requires the Senate of the United States to convene for the transaction of business at the Capitol, in the city of Washington, on the 4th day of March next, at 12 o'clock at noon on that day, of which all who shall at that time be entitled to act as members of that body are hereby required to take notice., Given under my hand and the seal of the United States, at Washington, the twenty eighth day of February A.D. 1863, and of the independence of the United States of America, the eighty-seventh., Mr. M. is now with me on the question of the Honolulu Commissioner., It pains me some that this tilt for the place of Colonel Baker's friend grows so fierce, now that the Colonel is no longer alive to defend him., I presume, however, we shall have no rest from it., In self-defense I am disposed to say, ""Make a selection and send it to me."", I think your advice with that of others would be valuable in the selection of provost-marshals for Ohio., In pursuance of the twenty-sixth section of the act of Congress entitled ""An act for enrolling and calling out the national forces, and for other purposes,"" approved on the 3d day of March, 1863, I, Abraham Lincoln, President and Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States, do hereby order and command that all soldiers enlisted or drafted in the service of the United States now absent from their regiments without leave shall forthwith return to their respective regiments., And I do hereby declare and proclaim that all soldiers now absent from their respective regiments without leave who shall, on or before the first day of April, 1863, report themselves at any rendezvous designated by the general orders of the War Department No., 58, hereto annexed, may be restored to their respective regiments without punishment, except the forfeiture of pay and allowances during their absence; and all who do not return within the time above specified shall be arrested as deserters and punished as the law provides; and  Whereas evil-disposed and disloyal persons at sundry places have enticed and procured soldiers to desert and absent themselves from their regiments, thereby weakening the strength of the armies and prolonging the war, giving aid and comfort to the enemy, and cruelly exposing the gallant and faithful soldiers remaining in the ranks to increased hardships and danger:  I do therefore call upon all patriotic and faithful citizens to oppose and resist the aforementioned dangerous and treasonable crimes, and to aid in restoring to their regiments all soldiers absent without leave, and to assist in the execution of the act of Congress ""for enrolling and calling out the national forces, and for other purposes,"" and to support the proper authorities in the prosecution and punishment of offenders against said act and in suppressing the insurrection and rebellion., In testimony whereof I have hereunto set my hand., Done at the city of Washington, this tenth day of March, A.D. 1863, and of the independence of the United States the eighty-seventh., General Stahel wishes to be assigned to General Heintzelman and General Heintzelman also desires it., I would like to oblige both if it would not injure the service in your army, or incommode you., What say you?, I am very glad of your note saying ""recent despatches from him are able, judicious, and loyal,"" and that if I agree; we will leave him there., I am glad to agree, so long as the public interest does not seem to require his removal., William Chumasero is proposed for provost-marshal of your district., ...]"|3
80|"[General S. is not moving rapidly enough to make the expedition come to anything., He has now been out three days, two of which were unusually fair weather, and all three without hindrance from the enemy, and yet he is not twenty-five miles from where he started., To reach his point he still has sixty to go, another river (the Rapidan) to cross, and will be hindered by the enemy., By arithmetic, how many days will it take him to do it?, I do not know that any better can be done, but I greatly fear it is another failure already., Write me often., I am very anxious., Know ye that, whereas a paper bearing date the 3rd day of December last, purporting to be an agreement between the United States and one Bernard Kock for immigration of persons of African extraction to a dependency of the Republic of Haiti, was signed by me on behalf of the party of the first part; but whereas the said instrument was and has since remained incomplete in consequence of the seal of the United States not having been thereunto affixed; and whereas I have been moved by considerations by me deemed sufficient to withhold my authority for affixing the said seal:  Now, therefore, be it known that I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States, do hereby authorize the Secretary of State to cancel my signature to the instrument aforesaid., Whereas by the act of Congress approved the 31st day of December last the State of West Virginia was declared to be one of the United States of America, and was admitted into the Union on an equal footing with the original States in all respects whatever, upon the condition that certain changes should be duly made in the proposed constitution for that State; and  Whereas proof of a compliance with that condition, as required by the second section of the act aforesaid, has been submitted to me:  Now, therefore, be it known that I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States, do hereby, in pursuance of the act of Congress aforesaid, declare and proclaim that the said act shall take effect and be in force from and after sixty days from the date hereof., In witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed., Done at the city of Washington, this twentieth day of April, A.D. 1863, and of the independence of the United States the eighty-seventh., Your despatch of the 21st received., I really cannot say that I have heard any complaint of you., I have heard complaint of a police corps at Nashville, but your name was not mentioned in connection with it, so far as I remember., It may be that by inference you are connected with it, but my attention has never been drawn to it in that light., How does it look now?, I do not think the people of Pennsylvania should be uneasy about an invasion., Doubtless a small force of the enemy is flourishing about in the northern part of Virginia, on the ""skewhorn"" principle, on purpose to divert us in another quarter., I believe it is nothing more., We think we have adequate force close after them., I have some trouble about provost-marshal in your first district., Please procure HON., Mr. Starr to come with you and see me, or come to an agreement with him and telegraph me the result., The whole disposable force at Baltimore and else where in reach have already been sent after the enemy which alarms you., The worst thing the enemy could do for himself would be to weaken himself before Hooker, and therefore it is safe to believe he is not doing it; and the best thing he could do for himself would be to get us so scared as to bring part of Hooker's force away, and that is just what he is trying to do., I will telegraph you in the morning about calling out the militia., General Halleck tells me he has a despatch from General Schenck this morning, informing him that our forces have joined, and that the enemy menacing Pennsylvania will have to fight or run today., I hope I am not less anxious to do my duty to Pennsylvania than yourself, but I really do not yet see the justification for incurring the trouble and expense of calling out the militia., I shall keep watch, and try to do my duty., Our forces are exactly between the enemy and Pennsylvania., The President thanks you for your telegrams, and hopes you will keep him advised as rapidly as any information reaches you., Where is General Hooker?, Where is Sedgwick Where is Stoneman?, We have news here that the enemy has reoccupied heights above Fredericksburg., Is that so?, Our friend General Sigel claims that you owe him a letter., If you so remember please write him at once., He is here., We have through General Dix the contents of Richmond papers of the 5th., General Dix's despatch in full is going to you by Captain Fox of the navy., The substance is General Lee's despatch of the 3d (Sunday), claiming that he had beaten you and that you were then retreating across the Rappahannock, distinctly stating that two of Longstreet's divisions fought you on Saturday, and that General [E. F.] Paxton was killed, Stonewall Jackson severely wounded, and Generals Heth and A. P. Hill slightly wounded., The Richmond papers also stated, upon what authority not mentioned, that our cavalry have been at Ashland, Hanover Court-House, and other points, destroying several locomotives and a good deal of other property, and all the railroad bridges to within five miles of Richmond., Just as I telegraphed you contents of Richmond papers showing that our cavalry has not failed, I received General Butterfield's of 11 A.M. yesterday., This, with the great rain of yesterday and last night securing your right flank, I think puts a new face upon your case; but you must be the judge., News has gone to General Hooker which may change his plans., Act in view of such contingency., The recent movement of your army is ended without effecting its object, except, perhaps, some important breakings of the enemy's communications., What next?, If possible, I would be very glad of another movement early enough to give us some benefit from the fact of the enemy's communication being broken; but neither for this reason nor any other do I wish anything done in desperation or rashness., An early movement would also help to supersede the bad moral effect of there certain, which is said to be considerably injurious., Have you already in your mind a plan wholly or partially formed?, If you have, prosecute it without interference from me., If you have not, please inform me, so that I, incompetent as I may be, can try and assist in the formation of some plan for the army., Whereas the Congress of the United States, at its last session, enacted a law entitled ""An act for enrolling and calling out the national forces and for other purposes,"" which was approved on the 3d day of March last; and  Whereas it is recited in the said act that there now exists in the United States an insurrection and rebellion against the authority thereof, and it is, under the Constitution of the United States, the duty of the government to suppress insurrection and rebellion, to guarantee to each State a republican form of government, and to preserve the public tranquillity; and  Whereas for these high purposes a military force is indispensable, to raise and support which all persons Ought willingly to contribute; and  Whereas no service can be more praiseworthy and honorable than that which is rendered for the maintenance of the Constitution and the Union, and the consequent preservation of free government; and  Whereas, for the reasons thus recited, it was enacted by the said statute that all able-bodied male citizens of the United States, and persons of foreign birth who shall have declared on oath their intention to become citizens under and in pursuance of the laws thereof, between the ages of twenty and forty-five years (with certain exceptions not necessary to be here mentioned), are declared to constitute the national forces, and shall be liable to perform military duty in the service of the United States when called out by the President for that purpose; and  Whereas it is claimed by and in behalf of persons of foreign birth within the ages specified in said act, who have heretofore declared on oath their intentions to become citizens under and in pursuance of the laws of the United States, and who have not exercised the right of suffrage or any other political franchise under the laws of the United States, or of any of the States thereof, that they are not absolutely concluded by their aforesaid declaration of intention from renouncing their purpose to become citizens, and that, on the contrary, such persons under treaties or the law of nations retain a right to renounce that purpose and to forego the privileges of citizenship and residence within the United States under the obligations imposed by the aforesaid act of Congress:  Now, therefore, to avoid all misapprehensions concerning the liability of persons concerned to perform the service required by such enactment, and to give it full effect, I do hereby order and proclaim that no plea of alienage will be received or allowed to exempt from the obligations imposed by the aforesaid act of Congress any person of foreign birth who shall have declared on oath his intention to become a citizen of the United States under the laws thereof, and who shall be found within the United States at any time during the continuance of the present insurrection and rebellion, at or after the expiration of the period of sixty-five days from the date of this proclamation; nor shall any such plea of alienage be allowed in favor of any such person who has so, as aforesaid, declared his intention to become a citizen of the United States, and shall have exercised at any time the right of suffrage, or any other political franchise, within the United States, under the laws thereof, or under the laws of any of the several States., In witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand, and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed., Done at the city of Washington, this eighth day of May, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-three, and of the independence of the United States the eighty-seventh., The news is here of the capture by our forces of Grand Gulf--a large and very important thing., General Willich, an exchanged prisoner just from Richmond, has talked with me this morning., He was there when our cavalry cut the roads in that vicinity., He says there was not a sound pair of legs in Richmond, and that our men, had they known it, could have safely gone in and burned everything and brought in Jeff Davis., We captured and paroled 300 or 400 men., He says as he came to City Point there was an army three miles long (Longstreet's, he thought) moving toward Richmond., Muroy has captured a despatch of General Lee, in which he says his loss was fearful in his last battle with you., It is very important for Hooker to know exactly what damage is done to the railroads at all points between Fredericksburg and Richmond., As yet we have no word as to whether the crossings of the North and South Anna, or any of them, have been touched., There are four of these Crossings; that is, one on each road on each stream., You readily perceive why this information is desired., I suppose Kilpatrick or Davis can tell., Please ascertain fully what was done, and what is the present condition, as near as you can, and advise me at once., I believe Mr. L. is a good man, but two things need to be remembered., 1st., Mr. R.'s rival was a relative of Mr. L.  2d., I hear of nobody calling Mr. R. a ""Copperhead,"" but Mr. L. However, let us watch., I have again concluded to relieve General Curtis., I see no other way to avoid the worst consequences there., I think of General Schofield as his successor, but I do not wish to take the matter of a successor out of the hands of yourself and General Halleck., Do the Richmond papers have anything about Grand Gulf or Vicksburg?, About what distance is it from the observatory we stopped at last Thursday to the line of enemies' works you ranged the glass upon for me?, Dr. Swinburne and Mr. Gillett are here, having been refused, as they say, by the War Department, permission to go to the Army of the Potomac., They now appeal to me, saying you wish them to go., I suppose they have been excluded by a rule which experience has induced the department to deem proper; still they shall have leave to go, if you say you desire it., Please answer., Governor Chase's feelings were hurt by my action in his absence., Smith is removed, but Governor Chase wishes to name his successor, and asks a day or two to make the designation., When I wrote on the 7th, I had an impression that possibly by an early movement you could get some advantage from the supposed facts that the enemy's communications were disturbed and that he was somewhat deranged in position., That idea has now passed away, the enemy having re-established his communications, regained his positions, and actually received reinforcements., It does not now appear probable to me that you can gain anything by an early renewal of the attempt to cross the Rappahannock., I therefore shall not complain if you do no more for a time than to keep the enemy at bay and out of other mischief by menaces and occasional cavalry raids, if practicable, and to put your own army in good condition again., Still, if in your own clear judgment you can renew the attack successfully, I do not mean to restrain you., Bearing upon this last point, I must tell you that I have some painful intimations that some of your corps and division commanders are not giving you their entire confidence., This would be ruinous, if true, and you should therefore, first of all, ascertain the real facts beyond all possibility of doubt., Your despatch of to-day is just received., It is very painful to me that you in Missouri cannot or will not settle your factional quarrel among yourselves., I have been tormented with it beyond endurance for months by both sides., Neither side pays the least respect to my appeals to your reason., I am now compelled to take hold of the case., Your despatch of to-day is received., I personally know nothing of Colonel Churchill, but months ago and more than once he has been represented to me as exerting a mischievous influence at Saint Louis, for which reason I am unwilling to force his continuance there against the judgment of our friends on the ground; but if it will oblige you, he may come to and remain at Louisville upon taking the oath of allegiance, and your pledge for his good behavior., The commander of the Department at St. Louis has ordered several persons south of our military lines, which order is not disapproved by me., Yet at the special request of the HON., ...]"|3
81|"[We have despatches from Vicksburg of the 3d., Siege progressing., No general fighting recently., All well., Nothing new from Port Hudson., The substance of news sent of the fighting at Port Hudson on the 27th we have had here three or four days, and I supposed you had it also, when I said this morning, ""No news from Port Hudson."", We knew that General Sherman was wounded, but we hoped not so dangerously as your despatch represents., We still have nothing of that Richmond newspaper story of Kirby Smith crossing and of Banks losing an arm., I believe that it was upon your recommendation that B., B. Bunker was appointed attorney for Nevada Territory., I am pressed to remove him on the ground that he does not attend to the office, nor in fact pass much time in the Territory., Do you wish to say anything on the subject?, Think you had better put ""Tad's"" pistol away., I had an ugly dream about him., I am told there are 50 incendiary shells here at the arsenal made to fit the 100 pounder Parrott gun now with you., If this be true would you like to have the shells sent to you?, Your long despatch of to-day is just received., If left to me, I would not go south of the Rappahannock upon Lee's moving north of it., If you had Richmond invested to-day you would not be able to take it in twenty days; meanwhile your communications, and with them your army, would be ruined., I think Lee's army, and not Richmond, is your true objective point., If he comes towards the upper Potomac, follow on his flank, and on the inside track, shortening your lines while he lengthens his., Fight him, too, when opportunity offers., If he stay where he is, fret him and fret him., Your three despatches received., I am very well and am glad to know that you and ""Tad"" are so., If you can show me a trial of the incendiary shells on Saturday night, I will try to join you at 5 P.M. that day Answer., Your letter of May 19, inclosing the resolutions of a public meeting held at Albany, New York, on the 16th of the same month, was received several days ago., The resolutions, as I understand them, are resolvable into two propositions--first, the expression of a purpose to sustain the cause of the Union, to secure peace through victory, and to support the administration in every constitutional and lawful measure to suppress the rebellion; and, secondly, a declaration of censure upon the administration for supposed unconstitutional action, such as the making of military arrests., And from the two propositions a third is deduced, which is that the gentlemen composing the meeting are resolved on doing their part to maintain our common government and country, despite the folly or wickedness, as they may conceive, of any administration., This position is eminently patriotic, and as such I thank the meeting, and congratulate the nation for it., My own purpose is the same; so that the meeting and myself have a common object, and can have no difference, except in the choice of means or measures for effecting that object., And here I ought to close this paper, and would close it, if there were no apprehension that more injurious consequences than any merely personal to myself might follow the censures systematically cast upon me for doing what, in my view of duty, I could not forbear., The resolutions promise to support me in every constitutional and lawful measure to suppress the rebellion; and I have not knowingly employed, nor shall knowingly employ, any other., But the meeting, by their resolutions, assert and argue that certain military arrests, and proceedings following them, for which I am ultimately responsible, are unconstitutional., I think they are not., The resolutions quote from the Constitution the definition of treason, and also the limiting safeguards and guarantees therein provided for the citizen on trial for treason, and on his being held to answer for capital or otherwise infamous crimes, and in criminal prosecutions his right to a speedy and public trial by an impartial jury., They proceed to resolve ""that these safeguards of the rights of the citizen against the pretensions of arbitrary power were intended more especially for his protection in times of civil commotion."", And, apparently to demonstrate the proposition, the resolutions proceed: ""They were secured substantially to the English people after years of protracted civil war, and were adopted into our Constitution at the close of the Revolution."", Would not the demonstration have been better if it could have been truly said that these safeguards had been adopted and applied during the civil wars and during our Revolution, instead of after the one and at the close of the other?, I too am devotedly for them after civil war, and before Civil war, and at all times, ""except when, in cases of rebellion or invasion, the public safety may require"" their suspension., The resolutions proceed to tell us that these safeguards ""have stood the test of seventy-six years of trial under our republican system, under circumstances which show that, while they constitute the foundation of all free government, they are the elements of the enduring stability of the republic."", No one denies that they have so stood the test up to the beginning of the present rebellion, if we except a certain occurrence at New Orleans hereafter to be mentioned; nor does any one question that they will stand the same test much longer after the rebellion closes., But these provisions of the Constitution have no application to the case we have in hand, because the arrests complained of were not made for treason--that is, not for the treason defined in the Constitution, and upon the conviction of which the punishment is death--nor yet were they made to hold persons to answer for any capital or otherwise infamous crimes; nor were the proceedings following, in any constitutional or legal sense, ""criminal prosecutions."", The arrests were made on totally different grounds, and the proceedings following accorded with the grounds of the arrests., Let us consider the real case with which we are dealing, and apply to it the parts of the Constitution plainly made for such cases., Prior to my installation here it had been inculcated that any State had a lawful right to secede from the national Union, and that it would be expedient to exercise the right whenever the devotees of the doctrine should fail to elect a president to their own liking., I was elected contrary to their liking; and accordingly, so far as it was legally possible, they had taken seven States out of the Union, had seized many of the United States forts, and had fired upon the United States flag, all before I was inaugurated, and, of course, before I had done any official act whatever., The rebellion thus begun soon ran into the present civil war; and, in certain respects, it began on very unequal terms between the parties., The insurgents had been preparing for it more than thirty years, while the government had taken no steps to resist them., The former had carefully considered all the means which could be turned to their account., It undoubtedly was a well-pondered reliance with them that in their own unrestricted effort to destroy Union, Constitution and law, all together, the government would, in great degree, be restrained by the same Constitution and law from arresting their progress., Their sympathizers invaded all departments of the government and nearly all communities of the people., From this material, under cover of ""liberty of speech,"" ""liberty of the press,"" and ""habeas corpus,"" they hoped to keep on foot amongst us a most efficient corps of spies, informers, suppliers, and aiders and abettors of their cause in a thousand ways., They knew that in times such as they were inaugurating, by the Constitution itself the ""habeas corpus"" might be suspended; but they also knew they had friends who would make a question as to who was to suspend it; meanwhile their spies and others might remain at large to help on their cause., Or if, as has happened, the Executive should suspend the writ without ruinous waste of time, instances of arresting innocent persons might occur, as are always likely to occur in such cases; and then a clamor could be raised in regard to this, which might be at least of some service to the insurgent cause., It needed no very keen perception to discover this part of the enemies program, so soon as by open hostilities their machinery was fairly put in motion., Yet, thoroughly imbued with a reverence for the guaranteed rights of individuals, I was slow to adopt the strong measures which by degrees I have been forced to regard as being within the exceptions of the Constitution, and as indispensable to the public safety., Nothing is better known to history than that courts of justice are utterly incompetent to such cases., Civil courts are organized chiefly for trials of individuals--or, at most, a few individuals acting in concert, and this in quiet times, and on charges of crimes well defined in the law., Even in times of peace bands of horse-thieves and robbers frequently grow too numerous and powerful for the ordinary courts of justice., But what comparison, in numbers have such bands ever borne to the insurgent sympathizers even in many of the loyal States?, Again, a jury too frequently has at least one member more ready to hang the panel than to hang the traitor., And yet again, he who dissuades one man from volunteering, or induces one soldier to desert, weakens the Union cause as much as he who kills a Union soldier in battle., Yet this dissuasion or inducement may be so conducted as to be no defined crime of which any civil court would take cognizance., Ours is a case of rebellion--so called by the resolutions before me--in fact, a clear, flagrant, and gigantic case of rebellion; and the provision of the Constitution that ""the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended unless when, in cases of rebellion or invasion, the public safety may require it,"" is the provision which specially applies to our present case., This provision plainly attests the understanding of those who made the Constitution that ordinary courts of justice are inadequate to ""cases of rebellion""--attests their purpose that, in such cases, men may be held in custody whom the courts, acting on ordinary rules, would discharge., Habeas corpus does not discharge men who are proved to be guilty of defined crime, and its suspension is allowed by the Constitution on purpose that men may be arrested and held who can not be proved to be guilty of defined crime, ""when, in cases of rebellion or invasion, the public safety may require it."", This is precisely our present case--a case of rebellion wherein the public safety does require the suspension--Indeed, arrests by process of courts and arrests in cases of rebellion do not proceed altogether upon the same basis., The former is directed at the small percentage of ordinary and continuous perpetration of crime, while the latter is directed at sudden and extensive uprisings against the government, which, at most, will succeed or fail in no great length of time., In the latter case arrests are made not so much for what has been done as for what probably would be done., The latter is more for the preventive and less for the vindictive than the former., In such cases the purposes of men are much more easily understood than in cases of ordinary crime., The man who stands by and says nothing when the peril of his government is discussed, cannot be misunderstood., If not hindered, he is sure to help the enemy; much more if he talks ambiguously--talks for his country with ""buts,"" and ""ifs,"" and ""ands."", Of how little value the constitutional provision I have quoted will be rendered if arrests shall never be made until defined crimes shall have been committed, may be illustrated by a few notable examples: General John C. Breckinridge, General Robert E. Lee, General Joseph E. Johnston, General John B. Magruder, General William B. Preston, General Simon B. Buckner, and Commodore Franklin Buchanan, now occupying the very highest places in the rebel war service, were all within the power of the government since the rebellion began, and were nearly as well known to be traitors then as now., Unquestionably if we had seized and had them the insurgent cause would be much weaker., But no one of them had then committed any crime defined in the law., Every one of them, if arrested, would have been discharged on habeas corpus were the writ allowed to operate., In view of these and similar cases, I think the time not unlikely to come when I shall be blamed for having made too few arrests rather than too many., By the third resolution the meeting indicate their opinion that military arrests may be constitutional in localities where rebellion actually exists, but that such arrests are unconstitutional in localities where rebellion or insurrection does not actually exist., They insist that such arrests shall not be made ""outside of the lines of necessary military occupation and the scenes of insurrection."", Inasmuch, however, as the Constitution itself makes no such distinction, I am unable to believe that there is any such constitutional distinction., I concede that the class of arrests complained of can be constitutional only when, in cases of rebellion or invasion, the public safety may require them; and I insist that in such cases--they are constitutional wherever the public safety does require them, as well in places to which they may prevent the rebellion extending, as in those where it may be already prevailing; as well where they may restrain mischievous interference with the raising and supplying of armies to suppress the rebellion as where the rebellion may actually be; as well where they may restrain the enticing men out of the army as where they would prevent mutiny in the army; equally constitutional at all places where they will conduce to the public safety as against the dangers of rebellion or invasion., Take the particular case mentioned by the meeting., It is asserted in substance that Mr. Vallandigham was, by a military commander, seized and tried ""for no other reason than words addressed to a public meeting in criticism of the course of the administration, and in condemnation of the military orders of the general."", Now, if there be no mistake about this, if this assertion is the truth, and the whole truth, if there were no other reason for the arrest, then I concede that the arrest was wrong., But the arrest, as I understand, was made for a very different reason., Mr. Vallandigham avows his hostility to the war on the part of the Union; and his arrest was made because he was laboring, with some effect, to prevent the raising of troops, to encourage desertions from the army, and to leave the rebellion without an adequate military force to suppress it., He was not arrested because he was damaging the political prospects of the administration or the personal interests of the commanding general, but because he was damaging the army, upon the existence and vigor of which the life of the nation depends., He was warring upon the military, and thus gave the military constitutional jurisdiction to lay hands upon him., If Mr. Vallandigham was not damaging the military power of the country, then his arrest was made on mistake of fact, which I would be glad to correct on reasonably satisfactory evidence., I understand the meeting whose resolutions I am considering to be in favor of suppressing the rebellion by military force--by armies., Long experience has shown that armies cannot be maintained unless desertion shall be punished by the severe penalty of death., The case requires, and the law and the Constitution sanction, this punishment., Must I shoot a simple-minded boy and not touch a hair of a wily agitator who induced him to desert., This is none the less injurious when effected by getting a father, or brother, or friend into a public meeting, and there working upon his feelings till he is persuaded to write the soldier boy that he is fighting in a bad cause, for a wicked administration of a contemptible government, too weak to arrest and punish him if he shall desert., I think that, in such a case, to silence the agitator and save the boy is not only constitutional, but withal a great mercy., If I be wrong on this question of constitutional power, my error lies in believing that certain proceedings are constitutional when, in cases of rebellion or invasion, the public safety requires them, which would not be constitutional when, in absence of rebellion or invasion, the public safety does not require them: in other words, that the Constitution is not in its application in all respects the same in cases of rebellion or invasion involving the public safety as it is in times of profound peace and public security., The Constitution itself makes the distinction, and I can no more be persuaded that the government can constitutionally take no strong measures in time of rebellion, because it can be shown that the same could not be lawfully taken in times of peace, than I can be persuaded that a particular drug is not good medicine for a sick man because it can be shown to not be good food for a well one., Nor am I able to appreciate the danger apprehended by the meeting, that the American people will by means of military arrests during the rebellion lose the right of public discussion, the liberty of speech and the press, the law of evidence, trial by jury, and habeas corpus throughout the indefinite peaceful future which I trust lies before them, any more than I am able to believe that a man could contract so strong an appetite for emetics during temporary illness as to persist in feeding upon them during the remainder of his healthful life., ...]"|3
82|"[The people of Louisiana shall not lack an opportunity for a fair election for both Federal and State officers by want of anything within my power to give them., Your despatch, asking in substance whether, in case Missouri shall adopt gradual emancipation, the General Government will protect slave owners in that species of property during the short time it shall be permitted by the State to exist within it, has been received., Desirous as I am that emancipation shall be adopted by Missouri, and believing as I do that gradual can be made better than immediate for both black and white, except when military necessity changes the case, my impulse is to say that such protection would be given., I cannot know exactly what shape an act of emancipation may take., If the period from the initiation to the final end should be comparatively short, and the act should prevent persons being sold during that period into more lasting slavery, the whole would be easier., I do not wish to pledge the General Government to the affirmative support of even temporary slavery beyond what can be fairly claimed under the Constitution., I suppose, however, this is not desired, but that it is desired for the military force of the United States, while in Missouri, to not be used in subverting the temporarily reserved legal rights in slaves during the progress of emancipation., This I would desire also., I have very earnestly urged the slave States to adopt emancipation; and it ought to be, and is, an object with me not to overthrow or thwart what any of them may in good faith do to that end., You are therefore authorized to act in the spirit of this letter in conjunction with what may appear to be the military necessities of your department., Although this letter will become public at some time, it is not intended to be made so now., Operator at Leesburg just now says: ""I heard very little firing this A.M. about daylight, but it seems to have stopped now., It was in about the same direction as yesterday, but farther off."", You remember that Hon., W. D. Kelly and others are engaged in raising or trying to raise some colored regiments in Philadelphia., The bearer of this, Wilton M. Huput, is a friend of Judge Kelly, as appears by the letter of the latter., He is a private in the 112th Penn., and has been disappointed in a reasonable expectation of one of the smaller offices., He now wants to be a lieutenant in one of the colored regiments., If Judge Kelly will say in writing he wishes to so have him, I am willing for him to be discharged from his present position, and be so appointed., If you approve, so indorse and let him carry the letter to Kelly., Have you any idea what the news is in the despatch of General Banks to General Halleck?, Have you any reports of the enemy moving into Pennsylvania?, And if any, what?, We have a despatch from General Grant of the 19th., Don't think Kirby Smith took Milliken's Bend since, allowing time to get the news to Joe Johnston and from him to Richmond., But it is not absolutely impossible., Also have news from Banks to the 16th, I think., He had not run away then, nor thought of it., Colonel Derrom, of the Twenty-fifth New Jersey Volunteers, now mustered out, says there is a man in your hands under conviction for desertion, who formerly belonged to the above named regiment, and whose name is Templeton--Isaac F. Templeton, I believe., The Colonel and others appeal to me for him., Please telegraph to me what is the condition of the case, and if he has not been executed send me the record of the trial and conviction., Was William Gruvier, Company A, Forty-sixth, Pennsylvania, one of the men executed as a deserter last Friday?, It did not come from the newspapers, nor did I believe it, but I wished to be entirely sure it was a falsehood., There is nothing going on in Kentucky on the subject of which you telegraph, except an enrolment., Before anything is done beyond this, I will take care to understand the case better than I now do., There is nothing going on in Kentucky on the subject of which you telegraph, except an enrolment., Before anything is done beyond this, I will take care to understand the case better than I now do., Every place in the Naval school subject to my appointment is full, and I have one unredeemed promise of more than half a year's standing., The resolutions of the Ohio Democratic State convention, which you present me, together with your introductory and closing remarks, being in position and argument mainly the same as the resolutions of the Democratic meeting at Albany, New York, I refer you to my response to the latter as meeting most of the points in the former., This response you evidently used in preparing your remarks, and I desire no more than that it be used with accuracy., In a single reading of your remarks, I only discovered one inaccuracy in matter, which I suppose you took from that paper., It is where you say: ""The undersigned are unable to agree with you in the opinion you have expressed that the Constitution is different in time of insurrection or invasion from what it is in time of peace and public security."", A recurrence to the paper will show you that I have not expressed the opinion you suppose., I expressed the opinion that the Constitution is different in its application in cases of rebellion or invasion, involving the public safety, from what it is in times of profound peace and public security; and this opinion I adhere to, simply because, by the Constitution itself, things may be done in the one case which may not be done in the other., I dislike to waste a word on a merely personal point, but I must respectfully assure you that you will find yourselves at fault should you ever seek for evidence to prove your assumption that I ""opposed in discussions before the people the policy of the Mexican war."", You say: ""Expunge from the Constitution this limitation upon the power of Congress to suspend the writ of habeas corpus, and yet the other guarantees of personal liberty would remain unchanged."", Doubtless, if this clause of the Constitution, improperly called, as I think, a limitation upon the power of Congress, were expunged, the other guarantees would remain the same; but the question is not how those guarantees would stand with that clause out of the Constitution, but how they stand with that clause remaining in it, in case of rebellion or invasion involving the public safety., If the liberty could be indulged of expunging that clause, letter and spirit, I really think the constitutional argument would be with you., My general view on this question was stated in the Albany response, and hence I do not state it now., I only add that, as seems to me, the benefit of the writ of habeas corpus is the great means through which the guarantees of personal liberty are conserved and made available in the last resort; and corroborative of this view is the fact that Mr. Vallandigham, in the very case in question, under the advice of able lawyers, saw not where else to go but to the habeas corpus., But by the Constitution the benefit of the writ of habeas corpus itself may be suspended when, in case of rebellion or invasion, the public safety may require it., You ask, in substance, whether I really claim that I may override all the guaranteed rights of individuals, on the plea of conserving the public safety when I may choose to say the public safety requires it., This question, divested of the phraseology calculated to represent me as struggling for an arbitrary personal prerogative, is either simply a question who shall decide, or an affirmation that nobody shall decide, what the public safety does require in cases of rebellion or invasion., The Constitution contemplates the question as likely to occur for decision, but it does not expressly declare who is to decide it., By necessary implication, when rebellion or invasion comes, the decision is to be made from time to time; and I think the man whom, for the time, the people have, under the Constitution, made the commander-in-chief of their army and navy, is the man who holds the power and bears the responsibility of making it., If he uses the power justly, the same people will probably justify him; if he abuses it, he is in their hands to be dealt with by all the modes they have reserved to themselves in the Constitution., The earnestness with which you insist that persons can only, in times of rebellion, be lawfully dealt with in accordance with the rules for criminal trials and punishments in times of peace, induces me to add a word to what I said on that point in the Albany response., You claim that men may, if they choose, embarrass those whose duty it is to combat a giant rebellion, and then be dealt with in turn only as if there were no rebellion., The Constitution itself rejects this view., The military arrests and detentions which have been made, including those of Mr. Vallandigham, which are not different in principle from the others, have been for prevention, and not for punishment--as injunctions to stay injury, as proceedings to keep the peace; and hence, like proceedings in such cases and for like reasons, they have not been accompanied with indictments, or trials by juries, nor in a single case by any punishment whatever, beyond what is purely incidental to the prevention., The original sentence of imprisonment in Mr. Vallandigham's case was to prevent injury to the military service only, and the modification of it was made as a less disagreeable mode to him of securing the same prevention., I am unable to perceive an insult to Ohio in the case of Mr. Vallandigham., Quite surely nothing of the sort was or is intended., I was wholly unaware that Mr. Vallandigham was, at the time of his arrest, a candidate for the Democratic nomination for governor until so informed by your reading to me the resolutions of the convention., I am grateful to the State of Ohio for many things, especially for the brave soldiers and officers she has given in the present national trial to the armies of the Union., You claim, as I understand, that according to my own position in the Albany response, Mr. Vallandigham should be released; and this because, as you claim, he has not damaged the military service by discouraging enlistments, encouraging desertions, or otherwise; and that if he had, he should have been turned over to the civil authorities under the recent acts of Congress., I certainly do not know that Mr. Vallandigham has specifically and by direct language advised against enlistments and in favor of desertion and resistance to drafting., We all know that combinations, armed in some instances, to resist the arrest of deserters began several months ago; that more recently the like has appeared in resistance to the enrolment preparatory to a draft; and that quite a number of assassinations have occurred from the same animus., These had to be met by military force, and this again has led to bloodshed and death., And now, under a sense of responsibility more weighty and enduring than any which is merely official, I solemnly declare my belief that this hindrance of the military, including maiming and murder, is due to the course in which Mr. Vallandigham has been engaged in a greater degree than to any other cause; and it is due to him personally in a greater degree than to any other one man., These things have been notorious, known to all, and of course known to Mr. Vallandigham., Perhaps I would not be wrong to say they originated with his special friends and adherents., With perfect knowledge of them, he has frequently if not constantly made speeches in Congress and before popular assemblies; and if it can be shown that, with these things staring him in the face he has ever uttered a word of rebuke or counsel against them, it will be a fact greatly in his favor with me, and one of which as yet I am totally ignorant., When it is known that the whole burden of his speeches has been to stir up men against the prosecution of the war, and that in the midst of resistance to it he has not been known in any instance to counsel against such resistance, it is next to impossible to repel the inference that he has counseled directly in favor of it., With all this before their eyes, the convention you represent have nominated Mr. Vallandigham for governor of Ohio, and both they and you have declared the purpose to sustain the national Union by all constitutional means., But of course they and you in common reserve to yourselves to decide what are constitutional means; and, unlike the Albany meeting, you omit to state or intimate that in your opinion an army is a constitutional means of saving the Union against a rebellion, or even to intimate that you are conscious of an existing rebellion being in progress with the avowed object of destroying that very Union., At the same time your nominee for governor, in whose behalf you appeal, is known to you and to the world to declare against the use of an army to suppress the rebellion., Your own attitude, therefore, encourages desertion, resistance to the draft, and the like, because it teaches those who incline to desert and to escape the draft to believe it is your purpose to protect them, and to hope that you will become strong enough to do so., After a short personal intercourse with you, gentlemen of the committee, I cannot say I think you desire this effect to follow your attitude; but I assure your that both friends and enemies of the Union look upon it in this light., It is a substantial hope, and by consequence a real strength to the enemy., If it is a false hope, and one which you would willingly dispel, I will make the way exceedingly easy., I send you duplicates of this letter in order that you, or a majority of you, may, if you choose, indorse your names upon one of them and return it thus indorsed to me with the understanding that those signing are thereby committed to the following propositions and to nothing else:  1., That there is now a rebellion in the United States, the object and tendency of which is to destroy the National Union; and that, in your opinion, an army and navy are constitutional means for suppressing that rebellion;  2., That no one of you will do anything which, in his own judgment, will tend to hinder the increase, or favor the decrease, or lessen the efficiency of the army or navy while engaged in the effort to suppress that rebellion; and  3., That each of you will, in his sphere, do all he can to have the officers, soldiers, and seamen of the army and navy, while engaged in the effort to suppress the rebellion, paid, fed, clad, and otherwise well provided for and supported., And with the further understanding that upon receiving the letter and names thus indorsed, I will cause them to be published, which publication shall be, within itself, a revocation of the order in relation to Mr. Vallandigham., It will not escape observation that I consent to the release of Mr. Vallandigham upon terms not embracing any pledge from him or from others as to what he will or will not do., I do this because he is not present to speak for himself, or to authorize others to speak for him; and because I should expect that on his returning he would not put himself practically in antagonism with the position of his friends., But I do it chiefly because I thereby prevail on other influential gentlemen of Ohio to so define their position as to be of immense value to the army--thus more than compensating for the consequences of any mistake in allowing Mr. Vallandigham to return; so that, on the whole, the public safety will not have suffered by it., Still, in regard to Mr. Vallandigham and all others, I must hereafter, as heretofore, do so much as the public safety may seem to require., Your despatch of yesterday received., I really think the attitude of the enemy's army in Pennsylvania presents us the best opportunity we have had since the war began., I think you will not see the foe in New Jersey., I beg you to be assured that no one out of my position can know so well as if he were in it the difficulties and involvements of replacing General McClellan in command, and this aside from any imputations upon him., Please accept my sincere thanks for what you have done and are doing to get troops forward., Do we gain anything by opening one leak to stop another?, Do we gain anything by quieting one merely to open another, and probably a larger one?, I judge by absence of news that the enemy is not crossing or pressing up to the Susquehanna., Please tell me what you know of his movements., ...]"|3
83|[The effect on political position of McKee's arrest will not be relieved any by its not having been made with that purpose., Governor Carney has not asked to [have] General Blunt removed, or interfered with, in his military operations., He has asked that he, the Governor, be allowed to commission officers for troops raised in Kansas, as other governors of loyal States do; and I think he is right in this., He has asked that General Blunt shall not take persons charged with civil crimes out of the hands of the courts and turn them over to mobs to be hung; and I think he is right in this also., He has asked that General Ewing's department be extended to include all Kansas; and I have not determined whether this is right or not., What do you remember about the case of John O., Brown, convicted of mutinous conduct and sentenced to death?, What do you desire about it?, Yours of the 15th has been received, and considered by the Secretary of War and myself., I was pained to be informed this morning by the Provost-Marshal-General that New Jersey is now behind twelve thousand, irrespective of the draft., I did not have time to ascertain by what rules this was made out; and I shall be very glad if it shall, by any means, prove to be incorrect., He also tells me that eight thousand will be about the quota of New Jersey on the first draft; and the Secretary of War says the first draft in that State would not be made for some time in any event., As every man obtained otherwise lessens the draft so much, and this may supersede it altogether, I hope you will push forward your volunteer regiments as fast as possible., It is a very delicate matter to postpone the draft in one State, because of the argument it furnishes others to have postponement also., If we could have a reason in one case which would be good if presented in all cases, we could act upon it., I will thank you, therefore, to inform me, if you can, by what day, at the earliest, you can promise to have ready to be mustered into the United States service the eight thousand men., If you can make a reliable promise (I mean one which you can rely on yourself) of this sort, it will be of great value, if the day is not too remote., I beg you to be assured I wish to avoid the difficulties you dread as much as yourself., I have received and read your letter of the 14th of July., I think the suggestion you make, of discontinuing proceedings against Mr. McKee, a very proper one., While I admit that there is an apparent impropriety in the publication of the letter mentioned, without my consent or yours, it is still a case where no evil could result, and which I am entirely willing to overlook., The following despatch has been placed in my hands., Please look to the subject of it., Yesterday little indorsements of mine went to you in two cases of postmasterships sought for widows whose husbands have fallen in the battles of this war., These cases occurring on the same day brought me to reflect more attentively than I had before done, as to what is fairly due from us herein the dispensing of patronage toward the men who, by fighting our battles, bear the chief burden of serving our country., My conclusion is that, other claims and qualifications being equal, they have the better right and this is especially applicable to the disabled and the soldier, deceased soldier's family., Certain matters have come to my notice, and considered by me, which induce me to believe that it will conduce to the public interest for you to add to the general instructions given to our naval commanders in relation to contraband trade propositions substantially as follows, to wit:  First., You will avoid the reality, and as far as possible the appearance, of using any neutral port to watch neutral vessels and then to dart out and seize them on their departure., Complaint is made that this has been practiced at the port of St Thomas, which practice, if it exists, is disapproved and must cease., Second., You will not in any case detain the crew of a captured neutral vessel or any other subject of a neutral power on board such vessel, as prisoners of war or otherwise, except the small number necessary as witnesses in the prize court., The practice here forbidden is also charged to exist, which, if true, is disapproved and must cease., My dear sir, it is not intended to be insinuated that you have been remiss in the performance of the arduous and responsible duties of your department, which, I take pleasure in affirming, has in your hands been conducted with admirable success., Yet, while your subordinates are almost of necessity brought into angry collision with the subjects of foreign states, the representatives of those states and yourself do not come into immediate contact for the purpose of keeping the peace, in spite of such collisions., At that point there is an ultimate and heavy responsibility upon me., What I propose is in strict accordance with international law, and is therefore unobjectionable; whilst, if it does no other good, it will contribute to sustain a considerable portion of the present British ministry in their places, who, if displaced, are sure to be replaced by others more unfavorable to us., Yours of the 21st is received, and I have taken time and considered and discussed the subject with the Secretary of War and Provost-Marshal General, in order, if possible, to make you a more favorable answer than I finally find myself able to do., It is a vital point with us to not have a special stipulation with the governor of any one State, because it would breed trouble in many, if not all, other States; and my idea was when I wrote you, as it still is, to get a point of time to which we could wait, on the reason that we were not ready ourselves to proceed, and which might enable you to raise the quota of your State, in whole, or in large part, without the draft., The points of time you fix are much farther off than I had hoped., We might have got along in the way I have indicated for twenty, or possibly thirty, days., As it stands, the best I can say is that every volunteer you will present us within thirty days from this date, fit and ready to be mustered into the United States service, on the usual terms, shall be pro tanto an abatement of your quota of the draft., That quota I can now state at eight thousand seven hundred and eighty-three (8783)., No draft from New Jersey, other than for the above quota, will be made before an additional draft, common to [all] the States, shall be required; and I may add that if we get well through with this draft, I entertain a strong hope that any further one may never be needed., This expression of hope, however, must not be construed into a promise., As to conducting the draft by townships, I find it would require such a waste of labor already done, and such an additional amount of it, and such a loss of time, as to make it, I fear, inadmissible., Since writing the above, getting additional information, I am enabled to say that the draft may be made in subdistricts, as the enrolment has been made, or is in process of making., This will amount practically to drafting by townships, as the enrollment subdistricts are generally about the extent of townships., I have not thrown General Hooker away; and therefore I would like to know whether it would be agreeable to you, all things considered, for him to take a corps under you, if he himself is willing to do so., Write me in perfect freedom, with the assurance that I will not subject you to any embarrassment by making your letter or its contents known to any one., I wish to know your wishes before I decide whether to break the subject to him., Do not lean a hair's breadth against your own feelings, or your judgment of the public service, on the idea of gratifying me., Let me explain., In General Grant's first despatch after the fall of Vicksburg, he said, among other things, he would send the Ninth Corps to you., Thinking it would be pleasant to you, I asked the Secretary of War to telegraph you the news., For some reasons never mentioned to us by General Grant, they have not been sent, though we have seen outside intimations that they took part in the expedition against Jackson., General Grant is a copious worker and fighter, but a very meager writer or telegrapher., No doubt he changed his purpose in regard to the Ninth Corps for some sufficient reason, but has forgotten to notify us of it., Seeing General Meade's despatch of yesterday to yourself causes me to fear that he supposes the Government here is demanding of him to bring on a general engagement with Lee as soon as possible., I am claiming no such thing of him., In fact, my judgment is against it; which judgment, of course, I will yield if yours and his are the contrary., If he could not safely engage Lee at Williamsport, it seems absurd to suppose he can safely engage him now, when he has scarcely more than two thirds of the force he had at Williamsport, while it must be that Lee has been reinforced., True, I desired General Meade to pursue Lee across the Potomac, hoping, as has proved true, that he would thereby clear the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, and get some advantages by harassing him on his retreat., These being past, I am unwilling he should now get into a general engagement on the impression that we here are pressing him, and I shall be glad for you to so inform him, unless your own judgment is against it., Can we not renew the effort to organize a force to go to western Texas?, Please consult with the general-in-chief on the subject., If the Governor of New Jersey shall furnish any new regiments, might not they be put into such an expedition?, Please think of it., I believe no local object is now more desirable., It is the duty of every government to give protection to its citizens, of whatever class, color, or condition, and especially to those who are duly organized as soldiers in the public service., The law of nations and the usages and customs of war, as carried on by civilized powers, permit no distinction as to color in the treatment of prisoners of war as public enemies., To sell or enslave any captured person, on account of his color and for no offense against the laws of war, is a relapse into barbarism, and a crime against the civilization of the age., The Government of the United States will give the same protection to all its soldiers; and if the enemy shall sell or enslave any one because of his color, the offense shall be punished by retaliation upon the enemy's prisoners in our possession., It is therefore ordered that for every soldier of the United States killed in violation of the laws of war, a rebel soldier shall be executed; and for every one enslaved by the enemy or sold into slavery, a rebel soldier shall be placed at hard labor on the public works, and continued at such labor until the other shall be released and receive the treatment due to a prisoner of war., Your letter by Mr. Dana was duly received., I now learn that your resignation has reached the War Department., I also learn that an active command has been assigned you by General Grant., The Secretary of War and General Halleck are very partial to you, as you know I also am., We all wish you to reconsider the question of resigning; not that we would wish to retain you greatly against your wish and interest, but that your decision may be at least a very well-considered one., I understand that Senator [William K.] Sebastian, of Arkansas, thinks of offering to resume his place in the Senate., Of course the Senate, and not I, would decide whether to admit or reject him., Still I should feel great interest in the question., It may be so presented as to be one of the very greatest national importance; and it may be otherwise so presented as to be of no more than temporary personal consequence to him., The Emancipation Proclamation applies to Arkansas., I think it is valid in law, and will be so held by the courts., I think I shall not retract or repudiate it., Those who shall have tasted actual freedom I believe can never be slaves or quasi-slaves again., For the rest, I believe some plan substantially being gradual emancipation would be better for both white and black., The Missouri plan recently adopted, I do not object to on account of the time for ending the institution; but I am sorry the beginning should have been postponed for seven years, leaving all that time to agitate for the repeal of the whole thing., It should begin at once, giving at least the new-born a vested interest in freedom which could not be taken away., If Senator Sebastian could come with something of this sort from Arkansas, I, at least, should take great interest in his case; and I believe a single individual will have scarcely done the world so great a service., See him if you can, and read this to him; but charge him not to make it public for the present., Write me again., I ask that the draft be suspended in this State until I can send you a communication I am preparing., By what day may I expect your communication to reach me?, Are you anxious about any part except the city and vicinity?, If Dr. Wright, on trial at Norfolk, has been or shall be convicted, send me a transcript of his trial and conviction, and do not let execution be done upon him until my further order., While I very well know what I would be glad for Louisiana to do, it is quite a different thing for me to assume direction of the matter., I would be glad for her to make a new constitution, recognizing the emancipation proclamation, and adopting emancipation in those parts of the State to which the proclamation does not apply., And while she is at it, I think it would not be objectionable for her to adopt some practical system by which the two races could gradually live themselves out of their old relation to each other, and both come out better prepared for the new., Education for young blacks should be included in the plan., ...]|3
84|"[Our friend William G. Greene has just presented a kind letter in regard to yourself, addressed to me by our other friends Yates, Hatch, and Dubois., I doubt whether your present position is more painful to you than to myself., Grateful for the patriotic stand so early taken by you in this life-and-death struggle of the nation, I have done whatever has appeared practicable to advance you and the public interest together., No charges, with a view to a trial, have been preferred against you by any one; nor do I suppose any will be., All there is, so far as I have heard, is General Grant's statement of his reasons for relieving you., And even this I have not seen or sought to see; because it is a case, as appears to me, in which I could do nothing without doing harm., General Grant and yourself have been conspicuous in our most important successes; and for me to interfere and thus magnify a breach between you could not but be of evil effect., Better leave it where the law of the case has placed it., For me to force you back upon General Grant would be forcing him to resign., I cannot give you a new command, because we have no forces except such as already have commanders., I am constantly pressed by those who scold before they think, or without thinking at all, to give commands respectively to Fremont, McClellan, Butler, Sigel, Curtis, Hunter, Hooker, and perhaps others, when, all else out of the way, I have no commands to give them., This is now your case; which, as I have said, pains me not less than it does you., My belief is that the permanent estimate of what a general does in the field is fixed by the ""cloud of witnesses"" who have been with him in the field, and that, relying on these, he who has the right needs not to fear., Your despatch of this morning is just received, and I fear I do not perfectly understand it., My view of the principle is that every soldier obtained voluntarily leaves one less to be obtained by draft., The only difficulty is in applying the principle properly., Looking to time, as heretofore, I am unwilling to give up a drafted man now, even for the certainty, much less for the mere chance, of getting a volunteer hereafter., Again, after the draft in any district, would it not make trouble to take any drafted man out and put a volunteer in--for how shall it be determined which drafted man is to have the privilege of thus going out, to the exclusion of all the others?, And even before the draft in any district the quota must be fixed; and the draft must be postponed indefinitely if every time a volunteer is offered the officers must stop and reconstruct the quota., At least I fear there might be this difficulty; but, at all events, let credits for volunteers be given up to the last moment which will not produce confusion or delay., That the principle of giving credits for volunteers shall be applied by districts seems fair and proper, though I do not know how far by present statistics it is practicable., When for any cause a fair credit is not given at one time, it should be given as soon thereafter as practicable., My purpose is to be just and fair, and yet to not lose time., Months ago I should have acknowledged the receipt of your book and accompanying kind note; and I now have to beg your pardon for not having done so., For one of my age I have seen very little of the drama., The first presentation of Falstaff I ever saw was yours here, last winter or spring., Perhaps the best compliment I can pay is to say, as I truly can, I am very anxious to see it again., Some of Shakespeare's plays I have never read, while others I have gone over perhaps as frequently as any un-professional reader., Among the latter are Lear, Richard III., Henry VIII., Hamlet, and especially Macbeth., I think nothing equals Macbeth., It is wonderful., Unlike you gentlemen of the profession, I think the soliloquy in Hamlet commencing ""Oh, my offense is rank,"" surpasses that commencing ""To be or not to be."", But pardon this small attempt at criticism., I should like to hear you pronounce the opening speech of Richard III., Will you not soon visit Washington again?, If you do, please call and let me make your personal acquaintance., There seems to be considerable misunderstanding about the recent movement to take possession of the ""New Almaden"" mine., It has no reference to any other mine or mines., In regard to mines and miners generally, no change of policy by the Government has been decided on, or even thought of, so far as I know., The ""New Almaden"" mine was peculiar in this: that its occupants claimed to be the legal owners of it on a Mexican grant, and went into court on that claim., The case found its way into the Supreme Court of the United States, and last term, in and by that court, the claim of the occupants was decided to be utterly fraudulent., Thereupon it was considered the duty of the Government by the Secretary of the Interior, the Attorney-General, and myself to take possession of the premises; and the Attorney-General carefully made out the writ and I signed it., It was not obtained surreptitiously, although I suppose General Halleck thought it had been, when he telegraphed, simply because he thought possession was about being taken by a military order, while he knew no such order had passed through his hands as general-in-chief., The writ was suspended, upon urgent representations from California, simply to keep the peace., It never had any direct or indirect reference to any mine, place, or person, except the ""New Almaden"" mine and the persons connected with it., At this late moment I am appealed to in behalf of William Thompson of Company K, Third Maryland Volunteers, in Twelfth Army Corps, said to be at Kelly's Ford, under sentence to be shot to-day as a deserter., He is represented to me to be very young, with symptoms of insanity., Please postpone the execution till further order., Please send me if you can a transcript of the record in the case of McQuin and Bell, convicted of murder by a military commission., I telegraphed General Strong for it, but he does not answer., I mail the papers to you to-day appointing Johnny to the Naval school., Your letter inviting me to attend a mass meeting of unconditional Union men, to be held at the capital of Illinois, on the 3d day of September, has been received., It would be very agreeable for me thus to meet my old friends at my own home, but I cannot just now be absent from here so long as a visit there would require., The meeting is to be of all those who maintain unconditional devotion to the Union, and I am sure that my old political friends will thank me for tendering, as I do, the nation's gratitude to those other noble men whom no partisan malice or partisan hope can make false to the nation's life., There are those who are dissatisfied with me., To such I would say: You desire peace, and you blame me that we do not have it., But how can we obtain it?, There are but three conceivable ways:  First--to suppress the rebellion by force of arms., This I am trying to do., Are you for it?, If you are, so far we are agreed., If you are not for it, a second way is to give up the Union., I am against this., Are you for it?, If you are you should say so plainly., If you are not for force nor yet for dissolution, there only remains some imaginable compromise., I do not believe that any compromise embracing the maintenance of the Union is now possible., All that I learn leads to a directly opposite belief., The strength of the rebellion is its military, its army., That army dominates all the country and all the people within its range., Any offer of terms made by any man or men within that range, in opposition to that army, is simply nothing for the present; because such man or men have no power whatever to enforce their side of a compromise, if one were made with them., To illustrate: Suppose refugees from the South and peace men of the North get together in convention, and frame and proclaim a compromise embracing a restoration of the Union., In what way can that compromise be used to keep Lee's army out of Pennsylvania?, Meade's army can keep Lee's army out of Pennsylvania, and, I think, can ultimately drive it out of existence., But no paper compromise to which the controllers of Lee's army are not agreed can at all affect that army., In an effort at such compromise we would waste time, which the enemy would improve to our disadvantage; and that would be all., A compromise, to be effective, must be made either with those who control the rebel army, or with the people, first liberated from the domination of that army by the success of our own army., Now allow me to assure you that no word or intimation from that rebel army, or from any of the men controlling it, in relation to any peace compromise, has ever come to my knowledge or belief., All charges and insinuations to the contrary are deceptive and groundless., And I promise you that if any such proposition shall hereafter come, it shall not be rejected and kept a secret from you., I freely acknowledge myself to be the servant of the people, according to the bond of service, the United States Constitution, and that, as such, I am responsible to them., But, to be plain: You are dissatisfied with me about the negro., Quite likely there is a difference of opinion between you and myself upon that subject., I certainly wish that all men could be free, while you, I suppose, do not., Yet, I have neither adopted nor proposed any measure which is not consistent with even your view, provided you are for the Union., I suggested compensated emancipation; to which you replied you wished not to be taxed to buy negroes., But I had not asked you to be taxed to buy negroes, except in such way as to save you from greater taxation to save the Union exclusively by other means., You dislike the Emancipation Proclamation, and perhaps would have it retracted., You say it is unconstitutional., I think differently., I think the Constitution invests its commander-in-chief with the law of war in time of war., The most that can be said, if so much, is, that slaves are property., Is there, has there ever been, any question that by the law of war, property, both of enemies and friends, may be taken when needed?, And is it not needed whenever it helps us and hurts the enemy?, Armies, the world over, destroy enemies' property when they cannot use it, and even destroy their own to keep it from the enemy., Civilized belligerents do all in their power to help themselves or hurt the enemy, except a few things regarded as barbarous or cruel., Among the exceptions are the massacre of vanquished foes and non-combatants, male and female., But the proclamation, as law, either is valid or is not valid., If it is not valid it needs no retraction., If it is valid it cannot be retracted, any more than the dead can be brought to life., ...]"|3
85|"[""I know as fully as one can know the opinions of others that some of the commanders of our armies in the field, who have given us our most important successes, believe the emancipation policy and the use of colored troops constitute the heaviest blow yet dealt to the rebellion, and that at least one of those important successes could not have been achieved when it was, but for the aid of black soldiers., Among the commanders holding these views are some who have never had any affinity with what is called abolitionism, or with Republican party politics, but who hold them purely as military opinions., I submit these opinions as being entitled to some weight against the objections, often urged, that emancipation and arming the blacks are unwise as military measures and were not adopted as such in good faith."", Yours of the 22d was received yesterday., When I wrote you before, I did not intend, nor do I now, to engage in an argument with you on military questions., You had informed me you were impressed through General Halleck that I was dissatisfied with you, and I could not bluntly deny that I was without unjustly implicating him., I therefore concluded to tell you the plain truth, being satisfied the matter would thus appear much smaller than it would if seen by mere glimpses., I repeat that my appreciation of you has not abated., I can never forget whilst I remember anything, that about the end of last year and the beginning of this, you gave us a hard-earned victory, which, had there been a defeat instead, the nation could hardly have lived over., Neither can I forget the check you so opportunely gave to a dangerous sentiment which was spreading in the North., It is not improbable that retaliation for the recent great outrage at Lawrence, in Kansas, may extend to indiscriminate slaughter on the Missouri border, unless averted by very judicious action., I shall be obliged if the general-in-chief can make any suggestions to General Schofield upon the subject., I am mortified this morning to find the letter to you botched up in the Eastern papers, telegraphed from Chicago., How did this happen?, Ordered, That the executive order dated November 21, 1862, prohibiting the exportation from the United States of arms, ammunition, or munitions of war, under which the commandants of departments were, by order of the Secretary of War dated May 13, 1863, directed to prohibit the purchase and sale, for exportation from the United States, of all horses and mules within their respective commands, and to take and appropriate for the use of the United States any horses, mules, and live stock designed for exportation, be so far modified that any arms heretofore imported into the United States may be re-exported to the place of original shipment, and that any live stock raised in any State or Territory bounded by the Pacific Ocean may be exported from, any port of such State or Territory., I have just seen your despatch to the Secretary of War, who is absent., I also send a despatch from Major Hayner of the 3d showing that he had notice of my order, and stating that the people were jubilant over it, as a victory over the Government extorted by fear, and that he had already collected about $4000 of the money., If he has proceeded since, I shall hold him accountable for his contumacy., On the contrary, no dollar shall be refunded by my order until it shall appear that my act in the case has been accepted in the right spirit., All well and no news except that General Burnside has Knoxville, Ten., Burnside has Kingston and Knoxville, and drove the enemy across the river at Loudon, the enemy destroying the bridge there; captured some stores and one or two trains; very little fighting; few wounded and none killed., No other news of consequence., Yours of August 29 just received., I suppose it was intended by Congress that this government should execute the act in question without dependence upon any other government, State, city, or county., It is, however, within the range of practical convenience to confer with the governments of States, while it is quite beyond that range to have correspondence on the subject with counties and cities., They are too numerous., As instances, I have corresponded with Governor Seymour, but Not with Mayor Opdyke; with Governor Curtin, but not with Mayor Henry., Despatch of yesterday just received., I shall try to find the paper you mention and carefully consider it., In the meantime let me urge that you do your utmost to get every man you can, black and white, under arms at the very earliest moment, to guard roads, bridges, and trains, allowing all the better trained soldiers to go forward to Rosecrans., Of course I mean for you to act in co-operation with and not independently of, the military authorities., It would be a generous thing to give General Wheaton a leave of absence for ten or fifteen days, and if you can do so without injury to the service, please do it., Yesterday at the instance of Mr. Blair, senator, I telegraphed General Meade asking him to grant you a leave of absence, to which he replied that you had not applied for such leave, and that you can have it when you do apply., I suppose it is proper for you to know this., All Tennessee is now clear of armed insurrectionists., You need not to be reminded that it is the nick of time for reinaugurating a loyal State government., Not a moment should be lost., You and the co-operating friends there can better judge of the ways and means than can be judged by any here., I only offer a few suggestions., The reinauguration must not be such as to give control of the State and its representation in Congress to the enemies of the Union, driving its friends there into political exile., The whole struggle for Tennessee will have been profitless to both State and nation if it so ends that Governor Johnson is put down and Governor Harris put up., It must not be so., You must have it otherwise., Let the reconstruction be the work of such men only as can be trusted for the Union., Exclude all others, and trust that your government so organized will be recognized here as being the one of republican form to be guaranteed to the State, and to be protected against invasion and domestic violence., It is something on the question of time to remember that it cannot be known who is next to occupy the position I now hold, nor what he will do., I see that you have declared in favor of emancipation in Tennessee, for which may God bless you., Get emancipation into your new State government constitution and there will be no such word as fail for your cause., The raising of colored troops, I think, will greatly help every way., Yours received., A thousand thanks for the late successes you have given us., We cannot allow you to resign until things shall be a little more settled in East Tennessee., If then, purely on your own account, you wish to resign, we will not further refuse you., It is represented to me that Thomas Edds, in your army, is under sentence of death for desertion, to be executed next Monday., It is also said his supposed desertion is comprised in an absence commencing with his falling behind last winter, being captured and paroled by the enemy, and then going home., If this be near the truth, please suspend the execution till further order and send in the record of the trial., The name is ""Thomas Edds"" not ""Eddies"" as in your despatch., The papers left with me do not designate the regiment to which he belongs., The man who gave me the papers, I do not know how to find again., He only told me that Edds is in the Army of the Potomac, and that he fell out of the ranks during Burnside's mud march last winter., If I get further information I will telegraph again., Your niece, Mrs. Kate Sharp, can now have no difficulty in going to Knoxville, Tenn., as that place is within our military lines., Thanks both for the good news you send and for the sending of it., Whereas the Constitution of the United States has ordained that the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended unless when, in cases of rebellion or invasion, the public safety may require it; and:  Whereas a rebellion was existing on the third day of March, 1863, which rebellion is still existing; and:  Whereas by a statute which was approved on that day it was enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States in Congress assembled that during the present insurrection the President of the United States, whenever in his judgment the public safety may require, is authorized to suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus in any case throughout the United States or any part thereof; and:  Whereas, in the judgment of the President, the public safety does require that the privilege of the said writ shall new be suspended throughout the United States in the cases where, by the authority of the President of the United States, military, naval, and civil officers of the United States, or any of them, hold persons under their command or in their custody, either as prisoners of war, spies, or aiders or abettors of the enemy, or officers, soldiers, or seamen enrolled or drafted or mustered or enlisted in or belonging to the land or naval forces of the United States, or as deserters therefrom, or otherwise amenable to military law or the rules and articles of war or the rules or regulations prescribed for the military or naval services by authority of the President of the United States, or for resisting a draft, or for any other offense against the military or naval service., Now, therefore, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States, do hereby proclaim and make known to all whom it may concern that the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus is suspended throughout the United States in the several cases before mentioned, and that this suspension will continue throughout the duration of the said rebellion or until this proclamation shall, by a subsequent one to be issued by the President of the United States, be modified or revoked., And I do hereby require all magistrates, attorneys, and other civil officers within the United States and all officers and others in the military and naval services of the United States to take distinct notice of this suspension and to give it full effect, and all citizens of the United States to conduct and govern themselves accordingly and in conformity with the Constitution of the United States and the laws of Congress in such case made and provided., In testimony whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed, this fifteenth day of September, A.D. 1863, and of the independence of the United States of America the eighty-eighth., If I did not misunderstand General Meade's last despatch, he posts you on facts as well as he can, and desires your views and those of the Government as to what he shall do., My opinion is that he should move upon Lee at once in manner of general attack, leaving to developments whether he will make it a real attack., I think this would develop Lee's real condition and purposes better than the cavalry alone can do., Of course my opinion is not to control you and General Meade., Mr. Holman will not be jostled from his place with my knowledge and consent., Is Albert Jones of Company K, Third Maryland Volunteers, to be shot on Friday next?, If so please state to me the general features of the case., Major Haynor left here several days ago under a promise to put down in writing, in detail, the facts in relation to the misconduct of the people on the eastern shore of Virginia., He has not returned., Please send him over., Yours in relation to Albert Jones is received., I am appealed to in behalf of Richard M. Abrams of Company A, Sixth New Jersey Volunteers, by Governor Parker, Attorney-General Frelinghuysen, Governor Newell, Hon., Mr. Middleton, M. C., of the district, and the marshal who arrested him., I am also appealed to in behalf of Joseph S. Smith, of Company A, Eleventh New Jersey Volunteers, by Governor Parker, Attorney-General Frelinghuysen, and Hon., Marcus C. Ward., Please state the circumstances of their cases to me., Why not name him for the general you fancy most?, This is my suggestion., I have just ordered the discharge of your boy William, as you say, now at Louisville, Ky.  Herewith I send you a paper, substantially the same as the one drawn up by yourself and mentioned in your despatch, but slightly changed in two particulars: First, yours was so drawn as that I authorized you to carry into effect the fourth section, etc., whereas I so modify it as to authorize you to so act as to require the United States to carry into effect that section., Secondly, you had a clause committing me in some sort to the State constitution of Tennessee, which I feared might embarrass you in making a new constitution, if you desire; so I dropped that clause., In addition to the matters contained in the orders and instructions given you by the Secretary of War, you are hereby authorized to exercise such powers as may be necessary and proper to enable the loyal people of Tennessee to present such a republican form of State government as will entitle the State to the guaranty of the United States therefor, and to be protected under such State government by the United States against invasion and domestic violence, all according to the fourth Section of the fourth article of the Constitution of the United States., By General Meade's despatch to you of yesterday it appears that he desires your views and those of the government as to whether he shall advance upon the enemy., I am not prepared to order, or even advise, an advance in this case, wherein I know so little of particulars, and wherein he, in the field, thinks the risk is so great and the promise of advantage so small., And yet the case presents matter for very serious consideration in another aspect., These two armies confront each other across a small river, substantially midway between the two capitals, each defending its own capital, and menacing the other., General Meade estimates the enemy's infantry in front of him at not less than 40,000., Suppose we add fifty per cent., to this for cavalry, artillery, and extra-duty men stretching as far as Richmond, making the whole force of the enemy 60,000., General Meade, as shown by the returns, has with him, and between him and Washington, of the same classes, of well men, over 90,000., Neither can bring the whole of his men into a battle; but each can bring as large a percentage in as the other., For a battle, then, General Meade has three men to General Lee's two., Yet, it having been determined that choosing ground and standing on the defensive gives so great advantage that the three cannot safely attack the two, the three are left simply standing on the defensive also., If the enemy's 60,000 are sufficient to keep our 90,000 away from Richmond, why, by the same rule, may not 40,000 of ours keep their 60,000 away from Washington, leaving us 50,000 to put to some other use?, ...]"|3
86|"[Your immediate duty in regard to Missouri now is to advance the efficiency of that establishment, and to so use it, as far as practicable, to compel the excited people there to let one another alone., Under your recent order, which I have approved, you will only arrest individuals, and suppress assemblies or newspapers, when they may be working palpable injury to the military in your charge; and in no other case will you interfere with the expression of opinion in any form, or allow it to be interfered with violently by others., In this you have a discretion to exercise with great caution, calmness, and forbearance., With the matter of removing the inhabitants of certain counties en masse, and of removing certain individuals from time to time, who are supposed to be mischievous, I am not now interfering, but am leaving to your own discretion., Nor am I interfering with what may still seem to you to be necessary restrictions upon trade and intercourse., I think proper, however, to enjoin upon you the following: Allow no part of the military under your command to be engaged in either returning fugitive slaves or in forcing or enticing slaves from their homes; and, so far as practicable, enforce the same forbearance upon the people., Report to me your opinion upon the availability for good of the enrolled militia of the State., Allow no one to enlist colored troops, except upon orders from you, or from here through you., Allow no one to assume the functions of confiscating property, under the law of Congress, or otherwise, except upon orders from here., At elections see that those, and only those, are allowed to vote who are entitled to do so by the laws of Missouri, including as of those laws the restrictions laid by the Missouri convention upon those who may have participated in the rebellion., So far as practicable, you will, by means of your military force, expel guerrillas, marauders, and murderers, and all who are known to harbor, aid, or abet them., But in like manner you will repress assumptions of unauthorized individuals to perform the same service, because under pretense of doing this they become marauders and murderers themselves., To now restore peace, let the military obey orders, and those not of the military leave each other alone, thus not breaking the peace themselves., In giving the above directions, it is not intended to restrain you in other expedient and necessary matters not falling within their range., I have just seen your despatch to Halleck about Major-General Blunt., If possible, you better allow me to get through with a certain matter here, before adding to the difficulties of it., Meantime supply me the particulars of Major-General Blunt's case., Please give me, as near as you can, the number of slaves you have recruited in Maryland., Of course the number is not to include the free colored., The year that is drawing towards its close has been filled with the blessings of fruitful fields and healthful skies., To these bounties, which are so constantly enjoyed that we are prone to forget the source from which they come, others have been added which are of so extraordinary a nature that they cannot fail to penetrate and soften even the heart which is habitually insensible to the ever-watchful providence of Almighty God., In the midst of a civil war of unequalled magnitude and severity which has sometimes seemed to invite and provoke the aggressions of foreign states; peace has been preserved with all nations, order has been maintained, the laws have been respected and obeyed, and harmony has prevailed everywhere except in the theatre of military conflict; while that theatre has been greatly contracted by the advancing armies and navies of the Union., The needful diversion of wealth and strength from the fields of peaceful industry, to the national defense has not arrested the plough, the shuttle, or the ship: The axe has enlarged the borders of our settlements, and the mines, as well of, iron and coal as of the precious metals, have yielded even more abundantly than heretofore., Population has steadily increased, notwithstanding the waste that has been made in the camp, the siege, and the battle-field; and the country, rejoicing in the consciousness of augmented strength and vigor, is permitted to expect a continuance of years, with large increase of freedom., No human counsel hath devised, nor hath any mortal hand worked out these great things., They are the gracious gifts of the Most High God, who, while dealing with us in anger for our sins, hath nevertheless remembered mercy., It has seemed to me fit and proper that they should be reverently, solemnly, and gratefully acknowledged, as with one heart and voice, by the whole American people., I do, therefore, invite my fellow-citizens in every part of the United States, and also those who are at sea, and those who are sojourning in foreign lands, to set apart and observe the last Thursday of November next as a day of thanksgiving and prayer to our beneficent Father who dwelleth in the heavens., And I recommend to them that, while offering up the ascriptions justly due to Him for such singular deliverances and blessings, they do also, with humble penitence for our national perverseness and disobedience, commend to His tender care all those who have become widows, orphans, mourners, or sufferers in the lamentable civil strife in which we are unavoidably engaged, and fervently implore the interposition of the Almighty hand to heal the wounds of the nation, and to restore it, as soon as may be consistent with divine purposes, to the full enjoyment of peace, harmony, tranquillity, and union., I think you will not have just cause to complain of my action., Yours of yesterday received., If we can hold Chattanooga and East Tennessee, I think the rebellion must dwindle and die., I think you and Burnside can do this, and hence doing so is your main object., Of course to greatly damage or destroy the enemy in your front would be a greater object, because it would include the former and more, but it is not so certainly within your power., I understand the main body of the enemy is very near you, so near that you could ""board at home,"" so to speak, and menace or attack him any day., Would not the doing of this be your best mode of counteracting his raid on your communications?, But this is not an order., I intend doing something like what you suggest whenever the case shall appear ripe enough to have it accepted in the true understanding rather than as a confession of weakness and fear., Your original address, presented on the 30th ult., and the four supplementary ones presented on the 3d inst., have been carefully considered., I hope you will regard the other duties claiming my attention, together with the great length and importance of these documents, as constituting a sufficient apology for not having responded sooner., These papers, framed for a common object, consist of the things demanded and the reasons for demanding them., The things demanded are  First., That General Schofield shall be relieved, and General Butler be appointed as Commander of the Military Department of Missouri., Second., That the system of enrolled militia in Missouri may be broken up, and national forces he substituted for it; and  Third., That at elections persons may not be allowed to vote who are not entitled by law to do so., Among the reasons given, enough of suffering and wrong to Union men is certainly, and I suppose truly, stated., Yet the whole case, as presented, fails to convince me that General Schofield, or the enrolled militia, is responsible for that suffering and wrong., The whole can be explained on a more charitable, and, as I think, a more rational hypothesis., We are in a civil war., In such cases there always is a main question, but in this case that question is a perplexing compound--Union and slavery., It thus becomes a question not of two sides merely, but of at least four sides, even among those who are for the Union, saying nothing of those who are against it., Thus, those who are for the Union with, but not without slavery; those for it without, but not with; those for it with or without, but prefer it with; and those for it with or without, but prefer it without., Among these, again, is a subdivision of those who are for gradual, but not for immediate, and those who are for immediate, but not for gradual extinction of slavery., It is easy to conceive that all these shades of opinion, and even more, may be sincerely entertained by honest and truthful men., Yet, all being for the Union, by reason of these differences each will prefer a different way of sustaining the Union., At once, sincerity is questioned, and motives are assailed., Actual war comming, blood grows hot and blood is spilled., Thought is forced from old channels into confusion., Deception breeds and thrives., Confidence dies, and universal suspicion reigns., Each man feels an impulse to kill his neighbor, lest he be killed by him., Revenge and retaliation follow., And all this, as before said, may be among honest men only., But this is not all., Every foul bird comes abroad, and every dirty reptile rises up., These add crime to confusion., Strong measures deemed indispensable, but harsh at best, such men make worse by maladministration., Murders for old grudges, and murders for self, proceed under any cloak that will best serve for the occasion., These causes amply account for what has occurred in Missouri, without ascribing it to the weakness or wickedness of any general., The newspaper files, those chroniclers of current events, will show that the evils now complained of were quite as prevalent under Fremont, Hunter, Halleck, and Curtis, as under Schofield., If the former had greater force opposed to them, they also had greater force with which to meet it., When the organized rebel army left the State, the main Federal force had to go also, leaving the department commander at home relatively no stronger than before., Without disparaging any, I affirm with confidence that no commander of that department has, in proportion to his means, done better than General Schofield., The first specific charge against General Schofield is, that the enrolled militia was placed under his command, whereas it had not been placed under the command of General Curtis., The fact is, I believe, true; but you do not point out, nor can I conceive, how that did, or could, injure loyal men or the Union cause., You charge that, General Curtis being superseded by General Schofield, Franklin A. Dick was superseded by James O. Broadhead as Provost-Marshal General., No very specific showing is made as to how this did or could injure the Union cause., It recalls, however, the condition of things, as presented to me, which led to a change of commander of that department., To restrain contraband intelligence and trade, a system of searches, seizures, permits, and passes, had been introduced, I think, by General Fremont., When General Halleck came, he found and continued the system, and added an order, applicable to some parts of the State, to levy and collect contributions from noted rebels, to compensate losses and relieve destitution caused by the rebellion., The action of General Fremont and General Halleck, as stated, constituted a sort of system which General Curtis found in full operation when he took command of the department., That there was a necessity for something of the sort was clear; but that it could only be justified by stern necessity, and that it was liable to great abuse in administration, was equally clear., Agents to execute it, contrary to the great prayer, were led into temptation., Some might, while others would not, resist that temptation., It was not possible to hold any to a very strict accountability; and those yielding to the temptation would sell permits and passes to those who would pay most and most readily for them, and would seize property and collect levies in the aptest way to fill their own pockets., Money being the object, the man having money, whether loyal or disloyal, would be a victim., This practice doubtless existed to some extent, and it was, a real additional evil that it could be, and was, plausibly charged to exist in greater extent than it did., When General Curtis took command of the department, Mr. Dick, against whom I never knew anything to allege, had general charge of this system., A controversy in regard to it rapidly grew into almost unmanageable proportions., One side ignored the necessity and magnified the evils of the system, while the other ignored the evils and magnified the necessity; and each bitterly assailed the other., I could not fail to see that the controversy enlarged in the same proportion as the professed Union men there distinctly took sides in two opposing political parties., I exhausted my wits, and very nearly my patience also, in efforts to convince both that the evils they charged on each other were inherent in the case, and could not be cured by giving either party a victory over the other., Plainly, the irritating system was not to be perpetual; and it was plausibly urged that it could be modified at once with advantage., The case could scarcely be worse, and whether it could be made better could only be determined by a trial., In this view, and not to ban or brand General Curtis, or to give a victory to any party, I made the change of commander for the department., I now learn that soon after this change Mr. Dick was removed, and that Mr. Broadhead, a gentleman of no less good character, was put in the place., The mere fact of this change is more distinctly complained of than is any conduct of the new officer, or other consequence of the change., I gave the new commander no instructions as to the administration of the system mentioned, beyond what is contained in the private letter afterwards surreptitiously published, in which I directed him to act solely for the public good, and independently of both parties., Neither any thing you have presented me, nor anything I have otherwise learned, has convinced me that he has been unfaithful to this charge., ...]"|3
87|"[Tad is teasing me to have you forward his pistol to him., I remember receiving nothing from you of the 10th, and I do not comprehend your despatch of to-day., In fact I do not remember, if I ever knew, who you are, and I have very little conception as to what you are telegraphing about., On the point of leaving I am told, by a gentleman to whose statements I attach credit, that the opposition policy for the Presidential campaign will be to ""abstain from voting."", J., More likely to abstain from stopping, once they get at it, until they shall have voted several times each., I do not believe Lee can have over 60,000 effective men., Longstreet's corps would not be sent away to bring an equal force back upon the same road; and there is no other direction for them to have come from., Doubtless, in making the present movement, Lee gathered in all available scraps, and added them to Hill's and Ewell's corps; but that is all, and he made the movement in the belief that four corps had left General Meade; and General Meade's apparently avoiding a collision with him has confirmed him in that belief., If General Meade can now attack him on a field no worse than equal for us, and will do so now with all the skill and courage which he, his officers, and men possess, the honor will be his if he succeeds, and the blame may be mine if he fails., Whereas the term of service of a part of the Volunteer forces of the United States will expire during the coming year; and whereas, in addition to the men raised by the present draft, it is deemed expedient to call out three hundred thousand volunteers to serve for three years or during the war, not, however, exceeding three years:  Now, therefore, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States, and Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy thereof, and of the militia of the several States when called into actual service, do issue this my proclamation, calling upon the governors of the different States to raise, and have enlisted into the United States service, for the various companies and regiments in the field from their respective States, the quotas of three hundred thousand men., I further proclaim that all the volunteers thus called out and duly enlisted shall receive advance pay, premium, and bounty, as heretofore communicated to the governors of States by the War Department through the Provost-Marshal-General's office, by special letters., I further proclaim that all volunteers received under this call, as well as all others not heretofore credited, shall be duly credited and deducted from the quotas established for the next draft., I further proclaim that if any State shall fail to raise the quota assigned to it by the War Department under this call, then a draft for the deficiency in said quota shall be made in said State, or in the districts of said State, for their due proportion of said quota, and the said draft shall commence on the 5th day of January, 1864., And I further proclaim that nothing in this proclamation shall interfere with existing orders, or with those which may be issued for the present draft in the States where it is now in progress, or where it has not yet been commenced., The quotas of the States and districts will be assigned by the War Department through the Provost-Marshal-General's office, due regard being had for the men heretofore furnished, whether by volunteering or drafting; and the recruiting will be conducted in accordance with such instructions as have been or may be issued by that department., In issuing this proclamation, I address myself not only to the governors of the several States, but also to the good and loyal people thereof, invoking them to lend their cheerful, willing, and effective aid to the measures thus adopted, with a view to reinforce our victorious army now in the field, and bring our needful military operations to a prosperous end, thus closing forever the fountains of sedition and civil war., It would be useless for Mrs. Dr. Wright to come here., The subject is a very painful one, but the case is settled., I am grateful for your offer of 100,000 men, but as at present advised I do not consider that Washington is in danger, or that there is any emergency requiring 60 or 90 days men., You do not estimate the holding of East Tennessee more highly than I do., There is no absolute purpose of withdrawing our forces from it, and only a contingent one to withdraw them temporarily for the purpose of not losing the position permanently., I am in great hope of not finding it necessary to withdraw them at all, particularly if you raise new troops rapidly for us there., As I do with others, so I will try to see you when you come., There has been no battle recently at Bull Run., I suppose what you have heard a rumor of was not a general battle, but an ""affair"" at Bristow Station on the railroad, a few miles beyond Manassas Junction toward the Rappahannock, on Wednesday, the 14th., It began by an attack of the enemy upon General Warren, and ended in the enemy being repulsed with a loss of four cannon and from four to seven hundred prisoners., A delegation is here saying that our armed colored troops are at many, if not all, the landings on the Patuxent River, and by their presence with arms in their hands are frightening quiet people and producing great confusion., Have they been sent there by any order, and if so, for what reason?, Please come over here., The fact of one of our officers being killed on the Patuxent is a specimen of what I would avoid., It seems to me we could send white men to recruit better than to send negroes and thus inaugurate homicides on punctilio., Taking all our information together, I think it probable that Ewell's corps has started for East Tennessee by way of Abingdon, marching last Monday, say from Meade's front directly to the railroad at Charlottesville., First, the object of Lee's recent movement against Meade; his destruction of the Alexandria and Orange Railroad, and subsequent withdrawal without more motive, not otherwise apparent, would be explained by this hypothesis., Secondly, the direct statement of Sharpe's men that Ewell has gone to Tennessee., Thirdly, the Irishman's [Northern Spy in Richmond] statement that he has not gone through Richmond, and his further statement of an appeal made to the people at Richmond to go and protect their salt, which could only refer to the works near Abingdon., Fourthly, Graham's statement from Martinsburg that Imboden is in retreat for Harrisonburg., This last matches with the idea that Lee has retained his cavalry, sending Imboden and perhaps other scraps to join Ewell., Upon this probability what is to be done?, If you have a plan matured, I have nothing to say., If you have not, then I suggest that, with all possible expedition, the Army of the Potomac get ready to attack Lee, and that in the meantime a raid shall, at all hazards, break the railroad at or near Lynchburg., Yours of the 12th has been in my hands several days., Inclosed I send the leave of absence for your brother, in as good form as I think I can safely put it., Without knowing whether he would accept it., I have tendered the collectorship at Portland, Maine, to your other brother, the governor., Thanks to both you and our friend Campbell for your kind words and intentions., A second term would be a great honor and a great labor, which, together, perhaps I would not decline if tendered., The writer of the accompanying letter is one of Mrs. Lincoln's numerous cousins., He is a grandson of ""Milliken's Bend,"" near Vicksburg--that is, a grandson of the man who gave name to Milliken's Bend., His father was a brother to MRS. Lincoln's mother., I know not a thing about his loyalty beyond what he says., Supposing he is loyal, can any of his requests be granted, and if any, which of them?, In June last a division was substantially lost at or near Winchester, Va. At the time, it was under General Milroy as immediate commander in the field, General Schenck as department commander at Baltimore, and General Halleck as general-in-chief at Washington., General Milroy, as immediate commander, was put in arrest, and subsequently a court of inquiry examined chiefly with reference to disobedience of orders, and reported the evidence., The foregoing is a synoptical statement of the evidence, together with the judge-advocate-general's conclusions., The disaster, when it came, was a surprise to all., It was very well known to Generals Shenck and Milroy for some time before, that General Halleck thought the division was in great danger of a surprise at Winchester; that it was of no service commensurate with the risk it incurred, and that it ought to be withdrawn; but, although he more than once advised its withdrawal, he never positively ordered it., General Schenck, on the contrary, believed the service of the force at Winchester was worth the hazard, and so did not positively order its withdrawal until it was so late that the enemy cut the wire and prevented the order reaching General Milroy., General Milroy seems to have concurred with General Schenck in the opinion that the force should be kept at Winchester at least until the approach of danger, but he disobeyed no order upon the subject., Some question can be made whether some of General Halleck's dispatches to General Schenk should not have been construed to be orders to withdraw the force, and obeyed accordingly; but no such question can be made against General Milroy., In fact, the last order he received was to be prepared to withdraw, but not to actually withdraw until further order, which further order never reached him., Serious blame is not necessarily due to any serious disaster, and I cannot say that in this case any of the officers are deserving of serious blame., No court-martial is deemed necessary or proper in the case., There have recently reached the War Department, and thence been laid before me, from Missouri, three communications, all similar in import and identical in object., One of them, addressed to nobody, and without place or date, but having the signature of (apparently) the writer, is a letter of eight closely written foolscap pages., The other two are written by a different person, at St. Joseph, Mo., and of the dates, respectively, October 12 and 13, 1863, and each inclosing a large number of affidavits., The general statements of the whole are that the Federal and State authorities are arming the disloyal and disarming the loyal, and that the latter will all be killed or driven out of the State unless there shall be a change., In particular, no loyal man who has been disarmed is named, but the affidavits show by name forty-two persons as disloyal who have been armed., They are as follows: [The names are omitted.], A majority of these are shown to have been in the rebel service., I believe it could be shown that the government here has deliberately armed more than ten times as many captured at Gettysburg, to say nothing of similar operations in East Tennessee., These papers contain altogether thirty--one manuscript pages, and one newspaper in extenso, and yet I do not find it anywhere charged in them that any loyal man has been harmed by reason of being disarmed, or that any disloyal one has harmed anybody by reason of being armed by the Federal or State Government., Of course, I have not had time to carefully examine all; but I have had most of them examined and briefed by others, and the result is as stated., The remarkable fact that the actual evil is yet only anticipated--inferred--induces me to suppose I understand the case; but I do not state my impression, because I might be mistaken, and because your duty and mine is plain in any event., The locality of nearly all this seems to be St. Joseph and Buchanan County., I wish you to give special attention to this region, particularly on election day., Prevent violence from whatever quarter, and see that the soldiers themselves do no wrong., If not too inconvenient, please come at once and have a personal conversation with me., Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, that, before the first meeting of the next Congress, and of every subsequent Congress, the clerk of the next preceding House of Representatives shall make a roll of the Representatives elect, and place thereon the names of all persons, and of such persons only, whose credentials show that they were regularly elected in accordance with the laws of their States respectively, or the laws of the United States., The above act of Congress was passed, as I suppose, for the purpose of shutting out improper applicants for seats in the House of Representatives; and I fear there is some danger that it will be used to shut out proper ones., Iowa, having an entire Union delegation, will be one of the States the attempt will be made, if upon any., The Governor doubtless has made out the certificates, and they are already in the hands of the members., I suggest that they come on with them; but that, for greater caution, you, and perhaps Mr. Harlan with you, consult with the Governor, and have an additional set made out according to the form on the other half of this sheet; and still another set, if you can, by studying the law, think of a form that in your judgment, promises additional security, and quietly bring the whole on with you, to be used in case of necessity., Let what you do be kept still., Below is an act of Congress, passed last session, intended to exclude applicants not entitled to seats, but which, there is reason to fear, will be used to exclude some who are entitled., Please get with the Governor and one or two other discreet friends, study the act carefully, and make certificates in two or three forms, according to your best judgement, and have them sent to me, so as to multiply the chances of the delegation getting their seats., Let it be done without publicity., Below is a form which may answer for one., If you could procure the same to be done for the Oregon member it might be well., Much obliged for the information about deserters contained in your dispatch of yesterday, while I have to beg your pardon for troubling you in regard to some of them, when, as it appears by yours, I had the means of answering my own questions., The Provost-Marshal-General has issued no proclamation at all., He has in no form announced anything recently in regard to troops in New York, except in his letter to Governor Seymour of October 21, which has been published in the newspapers of that State., It has not been announced or decided in any form by the Provost-Marshal-General, or any one else in authority of the Government, that every citizen who has paid his three hundred dollars commutation is liable to be immediately drafted again, or that towns that have just raised the money to pay their quotas will have again to be subject to similar taxation or suffer the operations of the new conscription, nor it is probable that the like of them ever will be announced or decided., No important news., Details of Hooker's night fight do great credit to his command, and particularly to the Eleventh Corps and Geary's part of the Twelfth., No discredit on any., Some days ago I understood you to say that your brother, General Frank Blair, desires to be guided by my wishes as to whether he will occupy his seat in Congress or remain in the field., My wish, then, is compounded of what I believe will be best for the country; and it is that he will come here, put his military commission in my hands, take his seat, go into caucus with our friends, abide the nominations, help elect the nominees, and thus aid to organize a House of Representatives which will really support the Government in the war., If the result shall be the election of himself as Speaker, let him serve in that position., If not, let him retake his commission and return to the army for the benefit of the country., ...]"|3
88|"[What is the news?, I expected to see you here at Cabinet meeting, and to say something about going to Gettysburg., There will be a train to take and return us., The time for starting is not yet fixed, but when it shall be I will notify you., Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal., Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure., We are met on a great battle-field of that war., We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live., It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this., But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate--we can not consecrate--we can not hallow--this ground., The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract., The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here., It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced., It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us--that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain--that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom--and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth., If there is a man by the name of King under sentence to be shot, please suspend execution till further order, and send record., An intelligent woman in deep distress, called this morning, saying her husband, a lieutenant in the Army of Potomac, was to be shot next Monday for desertion, and putting a letter in my hand, upon which I relied for particulars, she left without mentioning a name or other particular by which to identify the case., On opening the letter I found it equally vague, having nothing to identify by, except her own signature, which seems to be ""Mrs. Anna S., King."", I could not again find her., If you have a case which you shall think is probably the one intended, please apply my dispatch of this morning to it., Yours to Governor Chase in behalf of John A Welch is before me., Can there be a worse case than to desert and with letters persuading others to desert?, I cannot interpose without a better showing than you make., When did he desert?, when did he write the letters?, Two despatches since I saw you; one not quite so late on firing as we had before, but giving the points that Burnside thinks he can hold the place, that he is not closely invested, and that he forages across the river., The other brings the firing up to 11 A.M. yesterday, being twenty-three hours later than we had before., Your despatches as to fighting on Monday and Tuesday are here., Well done!, Many thanks to all., Remember Burnside., I have just received and have read your published letter to the HON., Benjamin R. Curtis., Under the circumstances I may not be the most competent judge, but it appears to me to be a paper of great ability, and for the country's sake more than for my own I thank you for it., Reliable information being received that the insurgent force is retreating from East Tennessee, under circumstances rendering it probable that the Union forces cannot hereafter be dislodged from that important position; and esteeming this to be of high national consequence, I recommend that all loyal people do, on receipt of this information, assemble at their places of worship, and render special homage and gratitude to Almighty God for this great advancement of the national cause., Whereas in and by the Constitution of the United States it is provided that the President ""shall have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States, except in cases of impeachment;"" and,  Whereas a rebellion now exists whereby the loyal State governments of several States have for a long time been subverted, and many persons have committed and are now guilty of treason against the United States; and  Whereas, with reference to said rebellion and treason, laws have been enacted by Congress declaring forfeitures and confiscation of property and liberation of slaves, all upon terms and conditions therein stated, and also declaring that the President was thereby authorized at any time thereafter, by proclamation, to extend to persons who may have participated in the existing rebellion in any State or part thereof pardon and amnesty, with such exceptions and at such times and on such conditions as he may deem expedient for the public welfare; and  Whereas the Congressional declaration for limited and conditional pardon accords with well-established judicial exposition of the pardoning power; and  Whereas, with reference to said rebellion, the President of the United States has issued several proclamations with provisions in regard to the liberation of slaves; and  Whereas it is now desired by some persons heretofore engaged in said rebellion to resume their allegiance to the United States and to reinaugurate loyal State governments within and for their respective States:  Therefore, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States, do proclaim, declare, and make known to all persons who have, directly or by implication, participated in the existing rebellion, except as hereinafter excepted, that a full pardon is hereby granted to them and each of them, with restoration of all rights of property, except as to slaves and in property cases where rights of third parties shall have intervened, and upon the condition that every such person shall take and subscribe an oath and thenceforward keep and maintain said oath inviolate, and which oath shall be registered for permanent preservation and shall be of the tenor and effect following, to wit:  ""I, ------, do solemnly swear, in presence of Almighty God, that I will henceforth faithfully support, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States and the Union of the States thereunder; and that I will in like manner abide by and faithfully support all acts of Congress passed during the existing rebellion with reference to slaves, so long and so far as not repealed, modified, or held void by Congress or by decision of the Supreme Court; and that I will in like manner abide by and faithfully support all proclamations of the President made during the existing rebellion having reference to slaves, so long and so far as not modified or declared void by decision of the Supreme Court., So help me God."", The persons excepted from the benefits of the foregoing provisions are all who are or shall have been civil or diplomatic officers or agents of the so-called Confederate Government; all who have left judicial stations under the United States to aid the rebellion; all who are or shall have been military or naval officers of said so-called Confederate Government above the rank of colonel in the army or of lieutenant in the navy; all who left seats in the United States Congress to aid the rebellion; all who resigned commissions in the Army or Navy of the United States and afterwards aided the rebellion; and all who have engaged in any way in treating colored persons, or white persons in charge of such, otherwise than lawfully as prisoners of war, and which persons may have been found in the United States service as soldiers, seamen, or in any other capacity., And I do further proclaim, declare, and make known that whenever, in any of the States of Arkansas, Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee, Alabama, Georgia, Florida, South Carolina, and North Carolina, a number of persons, not less than one-tenth in number of the votes cast in such State at the Presidential election of the year A.D. 1860, each having taken oath aforesaid, and not having since violated it, and being a qualified voter by the election law of the State existing immediately before the so-called act of secession, and excluding all others, shall reestablish a State government which shall be republican and in nowise contravening said oath, such shall be recognized as the true government of the State, and the State shall receive thereunder the benefits of the constitutional provision which declares that ""the United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a republican form of government and shall protect each of them against invasion, and, on application of the legislature, or the EXECUTIVE (when the legislature can not be convened), against domestic violence."", And I do further proclaim, declare, and make known that any provision which may be adopted by such State government in relation to the freed people of such State which shall recognize and declare their permanent freedom, provide for their education, and which may yet be consistent as a temporary arrangement with their present condition as a laboring, landless, and homeless class, will not be objected to by the National EXECUTIVE., And it is suggested as not improper that in constructing a loyal State government in any State the name of the State, the boundary, the subdivisions, the constitution, and the general code of laws as before the rebellion be maintained, subject only to the modifications made necessary by the conditions hereinbefore stated, and such others, if any, not contravening said co and which may be deemed expedient by those framing the new State government., To avoid misunderstanding, it may be proper to say that this proclamation, so far as it relates to State governments, has no reference to States wherein loyal State governments have all the while been maintained., And for the same reason it may be proper to further say that whether members sent to Congress from any State shall be admitted to seats constitutionally rests exclusively with the respective Houses, and not to any extent with the EXECUTIVE., And, still further, that this proclamation is intended to present the people of the States wherein the national authority has been suspended and loyal State governments have been subverted a mode in and by which the national authority and loyal State governments may be re-established within said States or in any of them; and while the mode presented is the best the EXECUTIVE can suggest, with his present impressions, it must not be understood that no other possible mode would be acceptable., Another year of health, and of sufficiently abundant harvests, has passed., For these, and especially for the improved condition cf our national affairs, our renewed and profoundest gratitude to God is due., We remain in peace and friendship with foreign powers., The efforts of disloyal citizens of the United States to involve us in foreign wars, to aid an inexcusable insurrection, have been unavailing., Her Britannic Majesty's government, as was justly expected, have exercised their authority to prevent the departure of new hostile expeditions from British ports., The Emperor of France has, by a like proceeding, promptly vindicated the neutrality which he proclaimed at the beginning of the contest., Questions of great intricacy and importance have arisen out of the blockade, and other belligerent operations, between the Government and several of the maritime powers, but they have been discussed, and, as far as was possible, accommodated, in a spirit of frankness, justice, and mutual good-will., It is especially gratifying that our prize courts, by the impartiality of their adjudications, have commanded the respect and confidence of maritime powers., The supplemental treaty between the United States and Great Britain for the suppression of the African slave-trade, made on the 17th day of February last, has been duly ratified and carried into execution., It is believed that, so far as American ports and American citizens are concerned, that inhuman and odious traffic has been brought to an end., I shall submit, for the consideration of the Senate, a convention for the adjustment of possessory claims in Washington Territory, arising out of the treaty of the 15th of June, 1846, between the United States and Great Britain, and which have been the source of some disquiet among the citizens of that now rapidly improving part of the country., A novel and important question, involving the extent of the maritime jurisdiction of Spain in the waters which surround the island of Cuba, has been debated without reaching an agreement, and it is proposed, in an amicable spirit, to refer it to the arbitrament of a friendly power., A convention for that purpose will be submitted to the Senate., I have thought it proper, subject to the approval of the Senate, to concur with the interested commercial powers in an arrangement for the liquidation of the Scheldt dues upon the principles which have been heretofore adopted in regard to the imposts upon navigation in the waters of Denmark., The long-pending controversy between this government and that of Chile touching the seizure at Sitana, in Peru, by Chilean officers, of a large amount in treasure belonging to citizens of the United States has been brought to a close by the award of His Majesty the King of the Belgians, to whose arbitration the question was referred by the parties., The subject was thoroughly and patiently examined by that justly respected magistrate, and although the sum awarded to the claimants may not have been as large as they expected there is no reason to distrust the wisdom of His Majesty's decision., That decision was promptly complied with by Chile when intelligence in regard to it reached that country., The joint commission under the act of the last session of carrying into effect the convention with Peru on the subject of claims has been organized at Lima, and is engaged in the business intrusted to it., Difficulties concerning interoceanic transit through Nicaragua are in course of amicable adjustment., In conformity with principles set forth in my last annual message, I have received a representative from the United States of Colombia, and have accredited a minister to that Republic., Incidents occurring in the progress of our civil war have forced upon my attention the uncertain state of international questions touching the rights of foreigners in this country and of United States citizens abroad., In regard to some governments these rights are at least partially defined by treaties., In no instance, however, is it expressly stipulated that in the event of civil war a foreigner residing in this country within the lines of the insurgents is to be exempted from the rule which classes him as a belligerent, in whose behalf the government of his country can not expect any privileges or immunities distinct from that character., I regret to say, however, that such claims have been put forward, and in some instances in behalf of foreigners who have lived in the United States the greater part of their lives., There is reason to believe that many persons born in foreign countries who have declared their intention to become citizens, or who have been fully naturalized have evaded the military duty required of them by denying the fact and thereby throwing upon the Government the burden of proof., It has been found difficult or impracticable to obtain this proof from the want of guides to the proper sources of information., These might be supplied by requiring clerks of courts where declarations of intention may be made or naturalizations effected to send periodically lists of the names of the persons naturalized or declaring their intention to become citizens to the Secretary of the Interior, in whose Department those names might be arranged and printed for general information., There is also reason to believe that foreigners frequently become citizens of the United States for the sole purpose of evading duties imposed by the laws of their native countries, to which on becoming naturalized here they at once repair, and though never returning to the United States they still claim the interposition of this government as citizens., Many altercations and great prejudices have heretofore arisen out of this abuse., It is therefore submitted to your serious consideration., It might be advisable to fix a limit beyond which no citizen of the United States residing abroad may claim the interposition of his government., The right of suffrage has often been assumed and exercised by aliens under pretenses of naturalization, which they have disavowed when drafted into the military service., I submit the expediency of such an amendment of the law as will make the fact of voting an estoppe against any plea of exemption from military service or other civil obligation on the ground of alienage., In common with other Western powers, our relations with Japan have been brought into serious jeopardy through the perverse opposition of the hereditary aristocracy of the Empire to the enlightened and liberal policy of the Tycoon, designed to bring the country into the society of nations., It is hoped, although not with entire confidence, that these difficulties may be peacefully overcome., I ask your attention to the claim of the minister residing there for the damages he sustained in the destruction by fire of the residence of the legation at Yedo., Satisfactory arrangements have been made with the Emperor of Russia, which, it is believed, will result in effecting a continuous line of telegraph through that Empire from our Pacific coast., I recommend to your favorable consideration the subject of an international telegraph across the Atlantic Ocean, and also of a telegraph between this capital and the national forts along the Atlantic seaboard and the Gulf of Mexico., Such communications, established with any reasonable outlay, would be economical as well as effective aids to the diplomatic, military, and naval service., The consular system of the United States, under the enactments of the last Congress, begins to be self-sustaining, and there is reason to hope that it may become entirely so with the increase of trade which will ensue whenever peace is restored., Our ministers abroad have been faithful in defending American rights., In protecting commercial interests our consuls have necessarily had to encounter increased labors and responsibilities growing out of the war., These they have for the most part met and discharged with zeal and efficiency., This acknowledgment justly includes those consuls who, residing in Morocco, Egypt, Turkey, Japan, China, and other Oriental countries, are charged with complex functions and extraordinary powers., The condition of the several organized Territories is generally satisfactory, although Indian disturbances in New Mexico have not been entirely suppressed., The mineral resources of Colorado, Nevada, Idaho, New Mexico, and Arizona are proving far richer than has been heretofore understood., I lay before you a communication on this subject from the Governor of New Mexico., I again submit to your consideration the expediency of establishing a system for the encouragement of immigration., Although this source of national wealth and strength is again flowing with greater freedom than for several years before the insurrection occurred, there is still a great deficiency of laborers in every field of industry, especially in agriculture and in our mines, as well of iron and coal as of the precious metals., While the demand for labor is much increased here, tens of thousands of persons, destitute of remunerative occupation, are thronging our foreign consulates and offering to emigrate to the United States if essential, but very cheap, assistance can be afforded them., It is easy to see that under the sharp discipline of civil war the nation is beginning a new life., This noble effort demands the aid and ought to receive the attention and support of the Government., Injuries unforeseen by the Government and unintended may in some cases have been inflicted on the subjects or citizens of foreign countries, both at sea and on land, by persons in the service of the United States., As this government expects redress from other powers when similar injuries are inflicted by persons in their service upon citizens of the United States, we must be prepared to do justice to foreigners., If the existing judicial tribunals are inadequate to this purpose, a special court may be authorized, with power to hear and decide such claims of the character referred to as may have arisen under treaties and the public law., Conventions for adjusting the claims by joint commission have been proposed to some governments, but no definitive answer to the proposition has yet been received from any., ...]"|3
89|"[Subsequent events have satisfied me of its necessity., The details set forth in the report of the Secretary evince the urgent need for immediate legislative action., I commend the benevolent institutions established or patronized by the Government in this District to your generous and fostering care., The attention of Congress during the last session was engaged to some extent with a proposition for enlarging the water communication between the Mississippi River and the northeastern seaboard, which proposition, however, failed for the time., Since then, upon a call of the greatest respectability, a convention has been held at Chicago upon the same subject, a summary of whose views is contained in a memorial addressed to the President and Congress, and which I now have the honor to lay before you., That this interest is one which ere long will force its own way I do not entertain a doubt, while it is submitted entirely to your wisdom as to what can be done now., Augmented interest is given to this subject by the actual commencement of work upon the Pacific Railroad, under auspices so favorable to rapid progress and completion., The enlarged navigation becomes a palpable need to the great road., I transmit the second annual report of the Commissioner of the Department of Agriculture, asking your attention to the developments in that vital interest of the nation., When Congress assembled a year ago, the war had already lasted nearly twenty months, and there had been many conflicts on both land and sea, with varying results; the rebellion had been pressed back into reduced limits; yet the tone of public feeling and opinion, at home and abroad, was not satisfactory., With other signs, the popular elections then just past indicated uneasiness among ourselves, while, amid much that was cold and menacing, the kindest words coming from Europe were uttered in accents of pity that we are too blind to surrender a hopeless cause., Our commerce was suffering greatly by a few armed vessels built upon and furnished from foreign shores, and we were threatened with such additions from the same quarter as would sweep our trade from the sea and raise our blockade., We had failed to elicit from European governments anything hopeful upon this subject., The preliminary emancipation proclamation, issued in September, was running its assigned period to the beginning of the new year., A month later the final proclamation came, including the announcement that colored men of suitable condition would be received into the war service., The policy of emancipation and of employing black soldiers gave to the future a new aspect, about which hope and fear and doubt contended in uncertain conflict., According to our political system, as a matter of civil administration, the General Government had no lawful power to effect emancipation in any State, and for a long time it had been hoped that the rebellion could be suppressed without resorting to it as a military measure., It was all the while deemed possible that the necessity for it might come, and that if it should the crisis of the contest would then be presented., It came, and, as was anticipated, it was followed by dark and doubtful days., Eleven months having now passed, we are permitted to take another review., The rebel borders are pressed still farther back, and by the complete opening of the Mississippi the country dominated by the rebellion is divided into distinct parts, with no practical communication between them., Tennessee and Arkansas have been substantially cleared of insurgent control, and influential citizens in each, owners of slaves and advocates of slavery at the beginning of the rebellion, now declare openly for emancipation in their respective States., Of those States not included in the emancipation proclamation, Maryland and Missouri, neither of which three years ago would tolerate any restraint upon the extension of slavery into new Territories, dispute now only as to the best mode of removing it within their own limits., Of those who were slaves at the beginning of the rebellion full 100,000 are now in the United States military service, about one-half of which number actually bear arms in the ranks, thus giving the double advantage of taking so much labor from the insurgent cause and supplying the places which otherwise must be filled with so many white men., So far as tested, it is difficult to say they are not as good soldiers as any., No servile insurrection or tendency to violence or cruelty has marked the measures of emancipation and arming the blacks., These measures have been much discussed in foreign countries, and, contemporary with such discussion, the tone of public sentiment there is much improved., At home the same measures have been fully discussed, supported, criticized, and denounced, and the annual elections following are highly encouraging to those whose official duty it is to bear the country through this great trial., Thus we have the new reckoning., The crisis which threatened to divide the friends of the Union is past., Looking now to the present and future, and with reference to a resumption of the national authority within the States wherein that authority has been suspended, I have thought fit to issue a proclamation, a copy of which is herewith transmitted., On examination of this proclamation it will appear, as is believed, that nothing will be attempted beyond what is amply justified by the Constitution., True, the form of an oath is given, but no man is coerced to take it., The man is promised a pardon only in case he voluntarily takes the oath., The Constitution authorizes the Executive to grant or withhold the pardon at his own absolute discretion, and this includes the power to grant on terms, as is fully established by judicial and other authorities., It is also proffered that if in any of the States named a State government shall be in the mode prescribed set up, such government shall be recognized and guaranteed by the United States, and that under it the State shall, on the constitutional conditions, be protected against invasion and domestic violence., The constitutional obligation of the United States to guarantee to every State in the Union a republican form of government and to protect the State in the cases stated is explicit and full., But why tender the benefits of this provision only to a State government set up in this particular way?, This section of the Constitution contemplates a case wherein the element within a State favorable to republican government in the Union may be too feeble for an opposite and hostile element external to or even within the State, and such are precisely the cases with which we are now dealing., An attempt to guarantee and protect a revived State government, constructed in whole or in preponderating part from the very element against whose hostility and violence it is to be protected, is simply absurd., There must be a test by which to separate the opposing elements, so as to build only from the sound; and that test is a sufficiently liberal one which accepts as sound whoever will make a sworn recantation of his former unsoundness., But if it be proper to require as a test of admission to the political body an oath of allegiance to the Constitution of the United States and to the Union under it, why also to the laws and proclamations in regard to slavery?, Those laws and proclamations were enacted and put forth for the purpose of aiding in the suppression of the rebellion., To give them their fullest effect there had to be a pledge for their maintenance., In my judgment, they have aided and will further aid the cause for which they were intended., To now abandon them would be not only to relinquish a lever of power, but would also be a cruel and an astounding breach of faith., I may add at this point that while I remain in my present position I shall not attempt to retract or modify the emancipation proclamation, nor shall I return to slavery any person who is free by the terms of that proclamation or by any of the acts of Congress., For these and other reasons it is thought best that support of these measures shall be included in the oath, and it is believed the Executive may lawfully claim it in return for pardon and restoration of forfeited rights, which he has clear constitutional power to withhold altogether or grant upon the terms which he shall deem wisest for the public interest., It should be observed also that this part of the oath is subject to the modifying and abrogating power of legislation and supreme judicial decision., The proposed acquiescence of the National Executive in any reasonable temporary State arrangement for the freed people is made with the view of possibly modifying the confusion and destitution which must at best attend all classes by a total revolution of labor throughout whole States., It is hoped that the already deeply afflicted people in those States may be somewhat more ready to give up the cause of their affliction if to this extent this vital matter be left to themselves, while no power of the National Executive to prevent an abuse is abridged by the proposition., The suggestion in the proclamation as to maintaining the political framework of the States on what is called reconstruction is made in the hope that it may do good without danger of harm., It will save labor and avoid great confusion., But why any proclamation now upon this subject?, This question is beset with the conflicting views that the step might be delayed too long or be taken too soon., In some States the elements for resumption seem ready for action, but remain inactive apparently for want of a rallying point--a plan of action., Why shall A adopt the plan of B rather than B that of A?, And if A and B should agree, how can they know but that the General Government here will reject their plan?, By the proclamation a plan is presented which may be accepted by them as a rallying point, and which they are assured in advance will not be rejected here., This may bring them to act sooner than they otherwise would., The objections to a premature presentation of a plan by the National Executive consist in the danger of committals on points which could be more safely left to further developments., Care has been taken to so shape the document as to avoid embarrassments from this source., Saying that on certain terms certain classes will be pardoned with rights restored, it is not said that other classes or other terms will never be included., Saying that reconstruction will be accepted if presented in a specified way, it is not said it will never be accepted in any other way., The movements by State action for emancipation in several of the States not included in the emancipation proclamation are matters of profound gratulation., And while I do not repeat in detail what I have heretofore so earnestly urged upon this subject my general views and feelings remain unchanged and I trust that Congress will omit no fair opportunity of aiding these important steps to a great consummation., In the midst of other cares, however important we must not lose sight of the fact that the war power is still our main reliance., To that power alone we look yet for a time to give confidence to the people in the contested regions that the insurgent power will not again overrun them., Until that confidence shall be established little can be done anywhere what is called reconstruction., Hence our chiefest care must still be directed to the Army and Navy who have thus far borne their harder part so nobly and well; and it may be esteemed fortunate that giving the greatest efficiency to these indispensable arms we do also honorably recognize the gallant men, from commander to sentinel, who compose them, and to whom more than to others the world must stand indebted for the home of freedom disenthralled, regenerated, enlarged, and perpetuated., In conformity to the law of July 16, 1862, I most cordially recommend that Captain John Rogers United States Navy, receive a vote of thanks from Congress for the eminent skill and gallantry exhibited by him in the engagement with the rebel armed ironclad steamer Fingal, alias Atlanta, whilst in command of the United States ironclad steamer Weehawken, which led to her capture on the 17th June, 1863, and also for the zeal, bravery, and general good conduct shown by this officer on many occasions., This recommendation is specially made in order to comply with the requirements of the ninth section of the aforesaid act, which is in the following words, viz:  That any line officer of the Navy or Marine Corps may be advanced one grade if upon recommendation of the President by name he receives the thanks of Congress for highly distinguished conduct in conflict with the enemy or for extraordinary heroism in the line of his profession., Congress, on my recommendation, passed a resolution, approved 7th February, 1863, tendering its thanks to Commander D. D. Porter ""for the bravery and skill displayed in the attack on the post of Arkansas on the 10th January, 1863,"" and in consideration of those services, together with his efficient labors and vigilance subsequently displayed in thwarting the efforts of the rebels to obstruct the Mississippi and its tributaries and the important part rendered by the squadron under his command, which led to the surrender of Vicksburg., I do therefore, in conformity to the seventh section of the act approved 16th July, 1862, nominate Commander D. D. Porter to be a rear-admiral in the Navy on the active list from the 4th July, 1863, to fill an existing vacancy., Understanding that your lodgment at Chattanooga and Knoxville is now secure, I wish to tender you, and all under your command, my more than thanks, my profoundest gratitude, for the skill, courage, and perseverance with which you and they, over so great difficulties, have effected that important object., God bless you all!, I have to urge my illness, and the preparation of the message, in excuse for not having sooner transmitted you the inclosed from the Secretary of War and Provost Marshal General in response to yours in relation to recruiting in Pennsylvania., Though not quite as you desire, I hope the grounds taken will be reasonably satisfactory to you., Allow me to exchange congratulations with you on the organization of the House of Representatives, and especially on recent military events in Georgia and Tennessee., Please suspend execution in any and all sentences of death in your department until further order., Lieut., Col. James B. Knox, Tenth Regiment Pennsylvania Reserves, offers his resignation under circumstances inducing me to wish to accept it., But I prefer to know your pleasure upon the subject., Please answer., The oath in the proclamation of December 8 is intended for those who may voluntarily take it, and not for those who may be constrained to take it in order to escape actual imprisonment or punishment., It is intended that the latter class shall abide the granting or withholding of the pardoning power in the ordinary way., The President has no authority as to whether you may raffle for the benevolent object you mention., If there is no objection in the Iowa laws, there is none here., Whereas by an act of the Congress of the United States of the 24th of May, 1828, entitled ""An act in addition to an act entitled 'An act concerning discriminating duties of tonnage and impost' and to equalize the duties on Prussian vessels and their cargoes,"" it is provided that upon satisfactory evidence being given to the President of the United States by the government of any foreign nation that no discriminating duties of tonnage or impost are imposed or levied in the ports of the said nation upon vessels wholly belonging to citizens of the United States or upon the produce, manufactures, or merchandise imported in the same from the United States or from any foreign country, the President is thereby authorized to issue his proclamation declaring that the foreign discriminating duties of tonnage and impost within the United States are and shall be suspended and discontinued so far as respects the vessels of the said foreign nation and the produce, manufactures, or merchandise imported into the United States in the same from the said foreign nation or from any other foreign country, the said suspension to take effect from the time of such notification being given to the President of the United States and to continue so long as the reciprocal exemption of vessels belonging to citizens of the United States and their cargoes, as aforesaid, shall be continued, and no longer; and  Whereas satisfactory evidence has lately been received by me through an official communication of Senor Don Luis Molina, Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary of the Republic of Nicaragua, under date of the 28th of November, 1863, that no other or higher duties of tonnage and impost have been imposed or levied since the second day of August, 1838, in the ports of Nicaragua, upon vessels wholly belonging to citizens of the United States, and upon the produce, manufactures, or merchandise imported in the same from the United States, and from any foreign country whatever, than are levied on Nicaraguan ships and their cargoes in the same ports under like circumstances:  Now, therefore, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States of America, do hereby declare and proclaim that so much of the several acts imposing discriminating duties of tonnage and impost within the United States are, and shall be, suspended and discontinued so far as respects the vessels of Nicaragua, and the produce, manufactures, and the merchandise imported into the United States in the same from the dominions of Nicaragua, and from any other foreign country whatever; the said suspension to take effect from the day above mentioned, and to continue thenceforward so long as the reciprocal exemption of the vessels of the United States, and the produce, manufactures, and merchandise imported into the dominions of Nicaragua in the same, as aforesaid, shall be continued on the part of the government of Nicaragua., Herewith I lay before you a letter addressed to myself by a committee of gentlemen representing the freedmen's aid societies in Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and Cincinnati., The subject of the letter, as indicated above, is one of great magnitude and importance, and one which these gentlemen, of known ability and high character, seem to have considered with great attention and care., Not having the time to form a mature judgment of my own as to whether the plan they suggest is the best, I submit the whole subject to Congress, deeming that their attention thereto is almost imperatively demanded., I understand you have under sentence of death, a tall old man, by the name of Henry F. Luckett., I personally knew him, and did not think him a bad man., Please do not let him be executed unless upon further order from me, and in the meantime send me a transcript of the record., The Indiana delegation in Congress, or at least a large part of them, are very anxious that General Milroy shall enter active service again, and I share in this feeling., He is not a difficult man to satisfy, sincerity and courage being his strong traits., Believing in our cause, and wanting to fight for it, is the whole matter with him., Could you, without embarrassment, assign him a place, if directed to report to you?, Sending a note to the Secretary of the Navy, as I promised, he called over and said that the strikes in the ship-yards had thrown the completion of vessels back so much that he thought General Gilimore's proposition entirely proper., ...]"|3
90|"[I am not impressed that the danger is very great or imminent, but I will thank you to give Generals Rosecrans and Curtis, respectively, such orders as may turn their attention thereto and prevent as far as possible the apprehended disturbance., Could you, without it being inconvenient or disagreeable to yourself, immediately take a trip to Arkansas for me?, General Boyle's resignation is accepted, so that your Excellency can give him the appointment proposed., You are directed to have a transport (either a steam or sailing vessel, as may be deemed proper by the Quartermaster-General) sent to the colored colony established by the United States at the island of Vache, on the coast of San Domingo, to bring back to this country such of the colonists there as desire to return., You will have the transport furnished with suitable supplies for that purpose, and detail an officer of the Quartermaster's Department, who, under special instructions to be given, shall have charge of the business., The colonists will be brought to Washington, unless otherwise hereafter directed, and be employed and provided for at the camps for colored persons around that city., Those only will be brought from the island who desire to return, and their effects will be brought with them., Ordered, That a draft of five hundred thousand (500,000) men, to serve for three years or during the war, be made on the tenth (10th) day of March next, for the military service of the United States, crediting and deducting therefrom so many as may have been enlisted or drafted into the service prior to the first (1st) day of March, and not before credited., The United States Government lot in Springfield can be used for a soldiers' home, with the understanding that the Government does not incur any expense in the case., My order to General Steele about an election was made in ignorance of the action your convention had taken or would take., A subsequent letter directs General Steele to aid you on your own plan, and not to thwart or hinder you., Show this to him., ""It had got to be,"" said Mr. Lincoln, ""midsummer, 1862., Things had gone on from bad to worse, until I felt that we had reached the end of our rope on the plan of operations we had been pursuing; that we had about played our last card, and must change our tactics, or lose the game., I now determined upon the adoption of the emancipation policy; and without consultation with, or the knowledge of, the Cabinet, I prepared the original draft of the proclamation, and, after much anxious thought, called a Cabinet meeting upon the subject., This was the last of July or the first part of the month of August, 1862., [The exact date was July 22, 1862.]..., All were present excepting Mr. Blair, the Postmaster-General, who was absent at the opening of the discussion, but came in subsequently., I said to the Cabinet that I had resolved upon this step, and had not called them together to ask their advice, but to lay the subject-matter of a proclamation before them, suggestions as to which would be in order after they had heard it read., Mr. Lovejoy was in error when he informed you that it excited no comment excepting on the part of Secretary Seward., Various suggestions were offered., Secretary Chase wished the language stronger in reference to the arming of the blacks., ""Mr. Blair, after he came in, deprecated the policy on the ground that it would cost the administration the fall elections., Nothing, however, was offered that I had not already fully anticipated and settled in my mind, until Secretary Seward spoke., He said in substance, 'Mr., President, I approve of the proclamation, but I question the expediency of its issue at this juncture., The depression of the public mind, consequent upon our repeated reverses, is so great that I fear the effect of so important a step., It may be viewed as the last measure of an exhausted government, a cry for help; the government stretching forth its hands to Ethiopia, instead of Ethiopia stretching forth her hands to the government.', His idea,"" said the President, ""was that it would be considered our last shriek on the retreat."", [This was his precise expression.], 'Now,' continued Mr. Seward, 'while I approve the measure, I suggest, sir, that you postpone its issue until you can give it to the country supported by military success, instead of issuing it, as would be the case now, upon the greatest disasters of the war.', Mr. Lincoln continued ""The wisdom of the view of the Secretary of State struck me with very great force., It was an aspect of the case that, in all my thought upon the subject, I had entirely overlooked., The result was that I put the draft of the proclamation aside, as you do your sketch for a picture, waiting for a victory., ""From time to time I added or changed a line, touching it up here and there, anxiously watching the process of events., Well, the next news we had was of Pope's disaster at Bull Run., Things looked darker than ever., Finally came the week of the battle of Antietam., I determined to wait no longer., The news came, I think, on Wednesday, that the advantage was on our side., I was then staying at the Soldiers' Home [three miles out of Washington]., Here I finished writing the second draft of the preliminary proclamation; came up on Saturday; called the Cabinet together to hear it, and it was published on the following Monday."", Unless there be some strong reason to the contrary, please send General Kilpatrick to us here, for two or three days., Your letter of [the] second received., Of course Governor Johnson will proceed with reorganization as the exigencies of the case appear to him to require., I do not apprehend he will think it necessary to deviate from my views to any ruinous extent., On one hasty reading I see no such deviation in his program, which you send., When I fixed a plan for an election in Arkansas I did it in ignorance that your convention was doing the same work., Since I learned the latter fact I have been constantly trying to yield my plan to them., I have sent two letters to General Steele, and three or four despatches to you and others, saying that he, General Steele, must be master, but that it will probably be best for him to merely help the convention on its own plan., Some single mind must be master, else there will be no agreement in anything, and General Steele, commanding the military and being on the ground, is the best man to be that master., Even now citizens are telegraphing me to postpone the election to a later day than either that fixed by the convention or by me., This discord must be silenced., The day fixed by the convention for the election is probably the best, but you on the ground, and in consultation with gentlemen there, are to decide., I should have fixed no day for an election, presented no plan for reconstruction, had I known the convention was doing the same things., It is probably best that you merely assist the convention on their own plan, as to election day and all other matters I have already written and telegraphed this half a dozen times., The law only obliges us to keep accounts with States, or at most Congressional Districts, and it would overwhelm us to attempt in counties, cities and towns., Nevertheless we do what we can to oblige in particular cases., In this view I send your dispatch to the Provost-Marshal General, asking him to do the best he can for you., Whereas, by my proclamation of the nineteenth of April, one thousand eight hundred and sixty-one, the ports of the States of South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas were, for reasons therein set forth, placed under blockade; and whereas, the port of Brownsville, in the district of Brazos Santiago, in the State of Texas, has since been blockaded, but as the blockade of said port may now be safely relaxed with advantage to the interests of commerce:  Now, therefore, be it known that I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States, pursuant to the authority in me vested by the fifth section of the act of Congress approved on the 13th of July, 1861, entitled ""An act further to provide for the collection of duties on imports, and for other purposes,"" do hereby declare that the blockade of the said port of Brownsville shall so far cease and determine from and after this date, that commercial intercourse with said port, except as to persons, things, and information hereinafter specified, may, from this date, be carried on, subject to the laws of the United States, to the regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury, and, until the rebellion shall have been suppressed, to such orders as may be promulgated by the general commanding the department, or by an officer duly authorized by him and commanding at said port., This proclamation does not authorize or allow the shipment or conveyance of persons in, or intending to enter, the service of the insurgents, or of things or information intended for their use, or for their aid or comfort, nor, except upon the permission of the Secretary of War, or of some officer duly authorized by him, of the following prohibited articles, namely: cannon, mortars, firearms, pistols, bombs, grenades, powder, saltpeter, sulphur, balls, bullets, pikes, swords, boarding-caps (always excepting the quantity of the said articles which may be necessary for the defense of the ship and those who compose the crew), saddles, bridles, cartridge-bag material, percussion and other caps, clothing adapted for uniforms; sail-cloth of all kinds, hemp and cordage, intoxicating drinks other than beer and light native wines., To vessels clearing from foreign ports and destined to the port of Brownsville, opened by this proclamation, licenses will be granted by consuls of the United States upon satisfactory evidence that the vessel so licensed will convey no persons, property, or information excepted or prohibited above, either to or from the said port; which licenses shall be exhibited to the collector of said port immediately on arrival, and, if required, to any officer in charge of the blockade, and on leaving said port every vessel will be required to have a clearance from the collector of the customs, according to law, showing no violation of the conditions of the license., Any violations of said conditions will involve the forfeiture and condemnation of the vessel and cargo, and the exclusion of all parties concerned from any further privilege of entering the United States during the war for any purpose whatever., In all respects, except as herein specified, the existing blockade remains in full force and effect as hitherto established and maintained, nor is it relaxed by this proclamation except in regard to the port to which relaxation is or has been expressly applied., In witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand, and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed., Done at the city of Washington, this eighteenth day of February, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-four, and of the independence of the United States the eighty-eighth., I desire the case of Midshipman C. Lyon re-examined and if not clearly inconsistent I shall be much obliged to have the recommendation changed., In county and State elections, must citizens of Tennessee take the oath prescribed by Governor Johnson, or will the President's oath of amnesty entitle them to vote?, I have been appointed to hold the March election in Cheatham County, and wish to act understandingly., In county elections you had better stand by Governor Johnson's plan; otherwise you will have conflict and confusion., I have seen his plan., Colonel Sanderson will be ordered to you to-day, a mere omission that it was not done before., The other questions in your despatch I am not yet prepared to answer., Yours of yesterday received., Your conference with citizens approved., Let the election be on the 14th of March as they agreed., General Sickles is not going to Arkansas., He probably will make a tour down the Mississippi and home by the gulf and ocean, but he will not meddle in your affairs., At one time I did intend to have him call on you and explain more fully than I could do by letter or telegraph, so as to avoid a difficulty coming of my having made a plan here, while the convention made one there, for reorganizing Arkansas; but even his doing that has been given up for more than two weeks., Please show this to Governor Murphy to save me telegraphing him., The President directs that the sentences of all deserters who have been condemned by court-martial to death, and that have not been otherwise acted upon by him, be mitigated to imprisonment during the war at the Dry Tortugas, Florida, where they will be sent under suitable guards by orders from army commanders., The commanding generals, who have power to act on proceedings of courts-martial in such cases, are authorized in special cases to restore to duty deserters under sentence, when in their judgment the service will be thereby benefited., Copies of all orders issued under the foregoing instructions will be immediately forwarded to the Adjutant-General and to the Judge-Advocate General., By order of the Secretary of War: B. D. TOWNSEND, Assistant Adjutant-General  I cannot remember at whose request it was that I gave the pass to Mrs., Bulky., Of course detain her, if the evidence of her being a spy is strong against her., I dislike to make changes in office so long as they can be avoided., It multiplies my embarrassments immensely., I dislike two appointments when one will do., Send me the name of some man not the present marshal, and I will nominate him to be Provost-Marshal for Dakota., Your telegram of the twenty-sixth instant asking for a copy of my despatch to Warren Jordan, Esq., at Nashville Press office, has just been referred to me by Governor Johnson., In my reply to Mr. Jordan, which was brief and hurried, I intended to say that in the county and State elections of Tennessee, the oath prescribed in the proclamation of Governor Johnson on the twenty-sixth of January, 1864, ordering an election in Tennessee on the first Saturday in March next, is entirely satisfactory to me as a test of loyalty of all persons proposing or offering to vote in said elections; and coming from him would better be observed and followed., There is no conflict between the oath of amnesty in my proclamation of eighth December, 1863, and that prescribed by Governor Johnson in his proclamation of the twenty-sixth ultimo., No person who has taken the oath of amnesty of eighth December, 1863, and obtained a pardon thereby, and who intends to observe the same in good faith, should have any objection to taking that prescribed by Governor Johnson as a test of loyalty., I have seen and examined Governor Johnson's proclamation, and am entirely satisfied with his plan, which is to restore the State government and place it under the control of citizens truly loyal to the Government of the United States., You ask some instructions from me in relation to the Report of Special Commission constituted by an order of the War Department, dated December 5, 1863, ""to revise the enrolment and quotas of the City and State of New York, and report whether there be any, and what, errors or irregularities therein, and what corrections, if any, should be made."", In the correspondence between the Governor of New York and myself last summer, I understood him to complain that the enrolments in several of the districts of that State had been neither accurately nor honestly made; and in view of this, I, for the draft then immediately ensuing, ordered an arbitrary reduction of the quotas in several of the districts wherein they seemed too large, and said: ""After this drawing, these four districts, and also the seventeenth and twenty-ninth, shall be carefully re-enrolled, and, if you please, agents of yours may witness every step of the process."", In a subsequent letter I believe some additional districts were put into the list of those to be re-enrolled., My idea was to do the work over according to the law, in presence of the complaining party, and thereby to correct anything which might be found amiss., The commission, whose work I am considering, seem to have proceeded upon a totally different idea., ...]"|3
91|"[I will close by saying, God bless the women of America., The honorary membership in your association, as generously tendered, is gratefully accepted., You comprehend, as your address shows, that the existing rebellion means more and tends to do more than the perpetuation of African slavery--that it is, in fact, a war upon the rights of all working people., Partly to show that this view has not escaped my attention, and partly that I cannot better express myself, I read a passage from the message to Congress in December, 1861:  ""It continues to develop that the insurrection is largely, if not exclusively, a war upon the first principle of popular government, the rights of the people., Conclusive evidence of this is found in the most grave and maturely considered public documents, as well as in the General tone of the insurgents., In those documents we find the abridgment of the existing right of suffrage, and the denial to the people of all right to participate in the selection of public officers, except the legislature, boldly advocated, with labored argument to prove that large control of the people in government is the source of all political evil., Monarchy itself is sometimes hinted at as a possible refuge from the power of the people., In my present position I could scarcely be justified were I to omit raising a warning voice against this approach of returning despotism., ""It is not needed, nor fitting here, that a General argument should be made in favor of popular institutions; but there is one point, with its connections, not so hackneyed as most others, to which I ask a brief attention., It is the effort to place capital on an equal footing, if not above labor, in the structure of government., It is assumed that labor is available only in connection with capital; that nobody labors unless somebody else, owning capital, somehow by the use of it induces him to labor., This assumed, it is next considered whether it is best that capital shall hire laborers, and thus induce them to work by their own consent or buy them, and drive them to it without their consent., Having proceeded so it is naturally concluded that all laborers are either hired laborers, or what we call slaves., And, further, it is assumed that whoever is once a hired laborer, is fixed in that condition for life., Now there is no such relation between capital and labor as assumed, nor is there any such thing as a free man being fixed for life in the condition of a hired laborer., Both these assumptions are false, and all inferences from them are groundless., ""Labor is prior to, and independent of, capital., Capital is only the fruit of labor, and could never have existed if labor had not first existed., Labor is the superior of capital, and deserves much the higher consideration., Capital has its rights, which are as worthy of protection as any other rights., Nor is it denied that there is, and probably always will be, a relation between capital and labor, producing mutual benefits., The error is in assuming that the whole labor of a community exists within that relation., A few men own capital, and that few avoid labor themselves, and, with their capital, hire or buy another few to labor for them., A large majority belong to neither class--neither work for others, nor have others working for them., In most of the Southern States, a majority of the whole people, of all colors, are neither slaves nor masters; while in the Northern, a large majority are neither hirers nor hired., Men with their families, wives, sons, and daughters--work for themselves, on their farms, in their houses, and in their shops, taking the whole product to themselves, and asking no favors of capital on the one hand, nor of hired laborers or slaves on the other., It is not forgotten that a considerable number of persons mingle their own labor with capital; that is, they labor with their own hands, and also buy or hire others to labor for them, but this is only a mixed and not a distinct class., No principle stated is disturbed by the existence of this mixed class., ""Again, as has already been said, there is not, of necessity, any such thing as the free hired laborer being fixed to that condition for life., Many independent men everywhere in these States, a few years back in their lives, were hired laborers., The prudent penniless beginner in the world labors for wages a while, saves a surplus with which to buy tools or land for himself, then labors on his own account another while, and at length hires another new beginner to help him., This is the just and generous and prosperous system which opens the way to all--gives hope to all, and consequent energy and progress, and improvement of condition to all., No men living are more worthy to be trusted than those who toil up from poverty--none less inclined to touch or take aught which they have not honestly earned., Let them beware of surrendering a political power they already possess, and which, if surrendered, will surely be used to close the door of advancement against such as they, and to fix new disabilities and burdens upon them, till all of liberty shall be lost."", The views then expressed remain unchanged, nor have I much to add., None are so deeply interested to resist the present rebellion as the working people., Let them beware of prejudices, working division and hostility among themselves., The most notable feature of a disturbance in your city last summer was the hanging of some working people by other working people., It should never be so., The strongest bond of human sympathy, outside of the family relation, should be one uniting all working people, of all nations, and tongues, and kindreds., Nor should this lead to a war upon property, or the owners of property., Property is the fruit of labor; property is desirable; is a positive good in the world., That some should be rich shows that others may become rich, and, hence, is just encouragement to industry and enterprise., Let not him who is houseless pull down the house of another, but let him labor diligently and build one for himself, thus by example assuring that his own shall be safe from violence when built., Hon., W. R. Morrison says he has requested you by letter to effect a special exchange of Lieut., Col. A. F. Rogers, of Eightieth Illinois Volunteers, now in Libby Prison, and I shall be glad if you can effect it., Yours of February 29 reached me only four days ago; but the delay was of little consequence, because I found, on feeling around, I could not invite you here without a difficulty which at least would be unpleasant, and perhaps would be detrimental to the public service., Allow me to suggest that if you wish to remain in the military service, it is very dangerous for you to get temporarily out of it; because, with a major-general once out, it is next to impossible for even the President to get him in again., With my appreciation of your ability and correct principle, of course I would be very glad to have your service for the country in the approaching political canvass; but I fear we cannot properly have it without separating you from the military., Whereas, it has become necessary to define the cases in which insurgent enemies are entitled to the benefits of the Proclamation of the President of the United States, which was made on the 8th day of December, 1863, and the manner in which they shall proceed to avail themselves of these benefits; and whereas the objects of that Proclamation were to suppress the insurrection and to restore the authority of the United States; and whereas the amnesty therein proposed by the President was offered with reference to these objects alone:  Now, therefore, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States, do hereby proclaim and declare that the said Proclamation does not apply to the cases of persons who, at the time when they seek to obtain the benefits thereof by taking the oath thereby prescribed, are in military, naval, or civil confinement or custody, or under bonds, or on parole of the civil, military, or naval authorities, or agents of the United States, as prisoners of war, or persons detained for offences of any kind, either before or after conviction; and that on the contrary it does apply only to those persons who, being yet at large, and free from any arrest, confinement, or duress, shall voluntarily come forward and take the said oath, with the purpose of restoring peace, and establishing the national authority., Persons excluded from the amnesty offered in the said Proclamation may apply to the President for clemency, like all other offenders, and their application will receive due consideration., I do further declare and proclaim that the oath presented in the aforesaid proclamation of the 8th of December, 1863, may be taken and subscribed before any commissioned officer, civil, military, or naval, in the service of the United States, or any civil or military officer of a State or Territory not in insurrection, who, by the laws thereof, may be qualified for administering oaths., All officers who receive such oaths are hereby authorized to give certificates thereof to the persons respectively by whom they are made, and such officers are hereby required to transmit the original records of such oaths, at as early a day as may be convenient, to the Department of State, where they will be deposited, and remain in the archives of the Government., The Secretary of State will keep a registry thereof, and will, on application, in proper cases, issue certificates of such records in the customary form of official certificates., The Governor of Kentucky is here, and desires to have the following points definitely fixed:  First., That the quotas of troops furnished, and to be furnished, by Kentucky may be adjusted upon the basis as actually reduced by able-bodied men of hers having gone into the rebel service; and that she be required to furnish no more than her just quotas upon fair adjustment upon such basis., Second., To whatever extent the enlistment and drafting, one or both, of colored troops may be found necessary within the State, it may be conducted within the law of Congress; and, so far as practicable, free from collateral embarrassments, disorders, and provocations., I think these requests of the Governor are reasonable; and I shall be obliged if you will give him a full hearing, and do the best you can to effect these objects., Your letter to Colonel Townsend, inclosing a slip from the ""Herald,"" and asking a court of inquiry, has been laid before me by the Secretary of War, with the request that I would consider it., It is quite natural that you should feel some sensibility on the subject; yet I am not impressed, nor do I think the country is impressed, with the belief that your honor demands, or the public interest demands, such an inquiry., The country knows that at all events you have done good service; and I believe it agrees with me that it is much better for you to be engaged in trying to do more, than to be diverted, as you necessarily would be, by a court of inquiry., Captain Kinney, of whom I spoke to you as desiring to go on your staff, is now in your camp, in company with Mrs., Senator Dixon., Mrs. Grant and I, and some others, agreed last night that I should, by this despatch, kindly call your attention to Captain Kinney., You ask me to put in writing the substance of what I verbally said the other day, in your presence, to Governor Bramlette and Senator Dixon., It was about as follows:  ""I am naturally anti-slavery., If slavery is not wrong, nothing is wrong., I cannot remember when I did not so think and feel, and yet I have never understood that the Presidency conferred upon me an unrestricted right to act officially upon this judgment and feeling., It was in the oath I took that I would to the best of my ability preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States., I could not take the office without taking the oath., Nor was it my view that I might take an oath to get power, and break the oath in using the power., I understood, too, that in ordinary civil administration this oath even forbade me to practically indulge my primary abstract judgment on the moral question of slavery., I had publicly declared this many times, and in many ways., And I aver that, to this day, I have done no official act in mere deference to my abstract judgment and feeling on slavery., I did understand, however, that my oath to preserve the Constitution to the best of my ability, imposed upon me the duty of preserving, by every indispensable means, that government, that nation, of which that Constitution was the organic law., Was it possible to lose the nation and yet preserve the Constitution?, By General law, life and limb must be protected; yet often a limb must be amputated to save a life; but a life is never wisely given to save a limb., I felt that measures, otherwise unconstitutional, might become lawful, by becoming indispensable to the preservation of the Constitution, through the preservation of the nation., Right or wrong, I assumed this ground, and now avow it., I could not feel that to the best of my ability I had even tried to preserve the Constitution, if, to save slavery, or any minor matter, I should permit the wreck of government, country, and Constitution, altogether., When, early in the war, General Fremont attempted military emancipation, I forbade it, because I did not then think it an indispensable necessity., When, a little later, General Cameron, then Secretary of War, suggested the arming of the blacks, I objected, because I did not yet think it an indispensable necessity., When, still later, General Hunter attempted military emancipation, I again forbade it, because I did not yet think the indispensable necessity had come., When, in March, and May, and July, 1862, I made earnest and successive appeals to the Border States to favor compensated emancipation, I believed the indispensable necessity for military emancipation and arming the blacks would come, unless averted by that measure., They declined the proposition, and I was, in my best judgment, driven to the alternative of either surrendering the Union, and with it the Constitution, or of laying strong hand upon the colored element., I chose the latter., In choosing it, I hoped for greater gain than loss, but of this I was not entirely confident., More than a year of trial now shows no loss by it in our foreign relations, none in our home popular sentiment, none in our white military force, no loss by it any how, or anywhere., On the contrary, it shows a gain of quite one hundred and thirty thousand soldiers, seamen, and laborers., These are palpable facts, about which, as facts, there can be no caviling., We have the men; and we could not have had them without the measure., ""And now let any Union man who complains of the measure test himself by writing down in one line that he is for subduing the rebellion by force of arms; and in the next, that he is for taking these hundred and thirty thousand men from the Union side, and placing them where they would be but for the measure he condemns., If he cannot face his case so stated, it is only because he cannot face the truth."", I add a word which was not in the verbal conversation., In telling this tale I attempt no compliment to my own sagacity., I claim not to have controlled events, but confess plainly that events have controlled me., Now, at the end of three years' struggle, the nation's condition is not what either party, or any man, devised or expected., God alone can claim it., ...]"|3
92|"[I am much gratified to learn that you got out so large a vote, so nearly all the right way, at the late election; and not less so that your State government including the legislature, is organized and in good working order., Whatever I can I will do to protect you; meanwhile you must do your utmost to protect yourselves., Present my greeting to all., I have the honor to transmit herewith an address to the President of the United States, and through him to both Houses of Congress, on the condition and wants of the people of east Tennessee, and asking their attention to the necessity of some action on the part of the Government for their relief, and which address is presented by a committee of an organization called ""The East Tennessee Relief Association."", Deeply commiserating the condition of these most loyal and suffering people, I am unprepared to make any specific recommendation for their relief., The military is doing and will continue to do the best for them within its power., Their address represents that the construction of direct railroad communication between Knoxville and Cincinnati by way of central Kentucky would be of great consequence in the present emergency., It may be remembered that in the annual message of December, 1861, such railroad construction was recommended., I now add that, with the hearty concurrence of Congress, I would yet be pleased to construct a road, both for the relief of these people and for its continuing military importance., In obedience to the resolution of your honorable body, a copy of which is herewith returned, I have the honor to make the following brief statement, which is believed to contain the information sought:  Prior to and at the meeting of the present Congress, Robert C. Schenck, of Ohio, and Frank P. Blair, Jr., of Missouri, members elect thereto, by and with the consent of the Senate held commissions from the Executive as major-generals in the volunteer army., General Schenck tendered the resignation of his said commission, and took his seat in the House of Representatives, at the assembling thereof, upon the distinct verbal understanding with the Secretary of War and the Executive that he might, at any time during the session, at his own pleasure, withdraw said resignation and return to the field., General Blair was, by temporary assignment of General Sherman, in command of a corps through the battles in front of Chattanooga, and in the march to the relief of Knoxville, which occurred in the latter days of November and early days of December last, and of course was not present at the assembling of Congress., When he subsequently arrived here, he sought, and was allowed by the Secretary of War and the Executive, the same conditions and promise as allowed and made to General Schenck., General Schenck has not applied to withdraw his resignation; but when General Grant was made Lieutenant-General, producing some change of commanders, General Blair sought to be assigned to the command of a corps., This was made known to Generals Grant and Sherman, and assented to by them, and the particular corps for him designated., This was all arranged and understood, as now remembered, so much as a month ago; but the formal withdrawal of General Blair's resignation, and making the order assigning him to the command of the corps, were not consummated at the War Department until last week, perhaps on the 23d of April instant., As a summary of the whole, it may be stated that General Blair holds no military commission or appointment other than as herein stated, and that it is believed he is now acting as major-General upon the assumed validity of the commission herein stated, in connection with the facts herein stated, and not otherwise., There are some letters, notes, telegrams, orders, entries, and perhaps other documents in connection with this subject, which it is believed would throw no additional light upon it, but which will be cheerfully furnished if desired., Not expecting to see you before the spring campaign opens, I wish to express in this way my entire satisfaction with what you have done up to this time, so far as I understand it., The particulars of your plans I neither know nor seek to know., You are vigilant and self-reliant; and, pleased with this, I wish not to obtrude any restraints or constraints upon you., While I am very anxious that any great disaster or capture of our men in great number shall be avoided, I know that these points are less likely to escape your attention than they would be mine., If there be anything wanting which is within my power to give, do not fail to let me know it., And now, with a brave army and a just cause, may God sustain you., In compliance with the request contained in your resolution of the 29th ultimo, a copy of which resolution is herewith returned, I have the honor to transmit the following:  The foregoing constitutes all sought by the resolution so far as is remembered or has been found upon diligent search., I have an imploring appeal in behalf of the citizens who say your Order No.8 will compel them to go north of Nashville., This is in no sense an order, nor is it even a request that you will do anything which in the least shall be a drawback upon your military operations, but anything you can do consistently with those operations for those suffering people I shall be glad of., Our mutual friend, Judge Lewis, tells me you do me the honor to inquire for my personal welfare., I have been very anxious for some days in regard to our armies in the field, but am considerably cheered, just now, by favorable news from them., I am sure you will join me in the hope for their further success; while yourself, and other good mothers, wives, sisters, and daughters, do all you and they can, to relieve and comfort the gallant soldiers who compose them., Enough is known of army operations, within the last five days, to claim our special gratitude to God., While what remains undone demands our most sincere prayers to and reliance upon Him (without whom all effort is vain), I recommend that all patriots at their homes, in their places of public worship, and wherever they may be, unite in common thanksgiving and prayer to Almighty God., I am very much obliged to you for the compliment of this call, though I apprehend it is owing more to the good news received to-day from the Army, than to a desire to see me., I am indeed very grateful to the brave men who have been struggling with the enemy in the field, to their noble commanders who have directed them, and especially to our Maker., Our commanders are following up their victories resolutely and successfully., I think, without knowing the particulars of the plans of General Grant, that what has been accomplished is of more importance than at first appears., I believe, I know (and am especially grateful to know) that General Grant has not been jostled in his purposes, that he has made all his points, and to-day he is on his line as he purposed before he moved his armies., I will volunteer to say that I am very glad at what has happened, but there is a great deal still to be done., While we are grateful to all the brave men and officers for the events of the past few days, we should, above all, be very grateful to Almighty God, who gives us victory., There is enough yet before us requiring all loyal men and patriots to perform their share of the labor and follow the example of the modest General at the head of our armies, and sink all personal consideration for the sake of the country., I commend you to keep yourselves in the same tranquil mood that is characteristic of that brave and loyal man., I have said more than I expected when I came before you., Repeating my thanks for this call, I bid you good-bye., Please tell me what is the trouble with Dr. Hawks., Also please ask Bishop Whittington to give me his view of the case., Complaints are coming to me of disturbances in Canoll, Platte, and Buchanan counties., Please ascertain the truth, correct what is found wrong, and telegraph me., I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of the 28th April, in which you offer to replace the present garrison at Port Trumbull with volunteers, which you propose to raise at your own expense., While it seems inexpedient at this time to accept this proposition on account of the special duties now devolving upon the garrison mentioned, I cannot pass unnoticed such a meritorious instance of individual patriotism., Permit me, for the Government, to express my cordial thanks to you for this generous and public-spirited offer, which is worthy of note among the many called forth in these times of national trial., I am very truly, your obedient servant,  In response to your address, allow me to attest the accuracy of its historical statements, indorse the sentiments it expresses, and thank you in the nation's name for the sure promise it gives., Nobly sustained, as the Government has been, by all the churches, I would utter nothing which might in the least appear invidious against any., Yet without this, it may fairly be said, that the Methodist Episcopal Church, not less devoted than the best, is by its greatest numbers the most important of all., It is no fault in others that the Methodist Church sends more soldiers to the field, more nurses to the hospitals, and more prayers to Heaven than--any other., God bless the Methodist Church Bless all the churches; and blessed be God, who in this our great trial giveth us the churches., If any such proclamation has appeared, it is a forgery., Whereas there has been wickedly and traitorously printed and published this morning in the New York World and New York Journal of Commerce, newspapers printed and published in the city of New York, a false and spurious proclamation purporting to be signed by the President and to be countersigned by the Secretary of State, which publication is of a treasonable nature, designed to give aid and comfort to the enemies of the United States and to the rebels now at war against the Government and their aiders and abettors, you are therefore hereby commanded forthwith to arrest and imprison in any fort or military prison in your command, the editors, proprietors, and publishers of the aforesaid newspapers, and all such persons as, after public notice has been given of the falsehood of said publication, print and publish the same with intent to give aid and comfort to the enemy; and you will hold the persons so arrested in close custody until they can be brought to trial before a military commission for their offense., You will also take possession by military force of the printing establishments of the New York World and Journal of Commerce, and hold the same until further orders, and prohibit any further publication therefrom., Until receiving your dispatch of yesterday, the idea of commissions in the volunteers expiring at the end of three years had not occurred to me., I think no trouble will come of it; and, at all events, I shall take care of it so far as in me lies., As to the major-generalships in the regular army, I think I shall not dispose of another, at least until the combined operations now in progress, under direction of General Grant, and within which yourself and command are included, shall be terminated., Meanwhile, on behalf of yourself, officers, and men, please accept my hearty thanks for what you and they have so far done., It is officially announced by the State Department that citizens of the United States holding commissions and recognized as Consuls of foreign powers, are not by law exempt from military service if drafted:  Therefore the mere enrolment of a citizen holding a foreign consulate will not be held to vacate his commission, but if he shall be drafted his exequatur will be revoked unless he shall have previously resigned in order that another Consul may be received., An exequatur bearing date the 3d day of May, 1858, having been issued to Charles Hunt, a citizen of the United States, recognizing him as a Consul of Belgium for St. Louis, Missouri, and declaring him free to exercise and enjoy such functions, powers, and privileges as are allowed to the Consuls of the most favored nations in the United States, and the said Hunt having sought to screen himself from his military duty to his country, in consequence of thus being invested with the consular functions of a foreign power in the United States, it is deemed advisable that the said Charles Hunt should no longer be permitted to continue in the exercise of said functions, powers, and privileges., These are therefore to declare that I no longer recognize the said Hunt as Consul of Belgium, for St. Louis, Missouri, and will not permit him to exercise or enjoy any of the functions, powers or privileges allowed to consuls of that nation, and that I do hereby wholly revoke and annul the said exequatur heretofore given, and do declare the same to be absolutely null and void from this day forward., The getting forward of hundred-day troops to sustain General Sherman's lengthening lines promises much good., Please put your best efforts into the work., I cannot postpone the execution of a convicted spy on a mere telegraphic despatch signed with a name I never heard before., General Wallace may give you a pass to see him if he chooses., Yours to Secretary of War [received] asking for something cheering., We have nothing bad from anywhere., I have just seen a despatch of Grant, of 11 P.M., May 23, on the North Anna and partly across it, which ends as follows: ""Everything looks exceedingly favorable for us."", We have nothing later from him., Mr. J. C. Swift wishes a pass from me to follow your army to pick up rags and cast-off clothing., I will give it to him if you say so, otherwise not., I am again pressed with the claim of Mr. Marshall O. Roberts, for transportation of what was called the Naval Brigade from New York to Fortress Monroe., This force was a special organization got up by one Bartlett, in pretended pursuance of written authority from me, but in fact, pursuing the authority in scarcely anything whatever., The credit given him by Mr. Roberts, was given in the teeth of the express declaration that the Government would not be responsible for the class of expenses to which it belonged., After all some part of the transportation became useful to the Government, and equitably should be paid for; but I have neither time nor means to ascertain this equitable amount, or any appropriation to pay it with if ascertained., If the Quartermaster at New York can ascertain what would compensate for so much of the transportation as did result usefully to the Government, it might be a step towards reaching justice., I write this from memory, but I believe it is substantially correct., Your letter, inviting me to be present at a mass meeting of loyal citizens, to be held at New York on the 4th instant, for the purpose of expressing gratitude to Lieutenant-General Grant for his signal services, was received yesterday., It is impossible for me to attend., I approve, nevertheless, of whatever may tend to strengthen and sustain General Grant and the noble armies now under his direction., My previous high estimate of General Grant has been maintained and heightened by what has occurred in the remarkable campaign he is now conducting, while the magnitude and difficulty of the task before him does not prove less than I expected., He and his brave soldiers are now in the midst of their great trial, and I trust that at your meeting you will so shape your good words that they may turn to men and guns, moving to his and their support., Swett is unquestionably all right., Mr. Holt is a good man, but I had not heard or thought of him for Vice-President., Wish not to interfere about Vice-President., Cannot interfere about platform., Convention must judge for itself., Private James McCarthy, of the One-hundred and fortieth New York Volunteers, is here under sentence to the Dry Tortugas for an attempt to desert., His friends appeal to me and if his colonel and you consent, I will send him to his regiment., Please answer., Yours of to-day received., I am unable to conceive how a message can be less safe by the express than by a staff-officer., If you send a verbal message, the messenger is one additional person let into the secret., I will neither conceal my gratification nor restrain the expression of my gratitude that the Union people, through their convention, in their continued effort to save and advance the nation, have deemed me not unworthy to remain in my present position., I know no reason to doubt that I shall accept the nomination tendered; and yet perhaps I should not declare definitely before reading and considering what is called the platform., I will say now, however, I approve the declaration in favor of so amending the Constitution as to prohibit slavery throughout the nation., ...]"|3
93|"[We accepted this war, and did not begin it., We accepted it for an object, and when that object is accomplished the war will end, and I hope to God that it will never end until that object is accomplished., We are going through with our task, so far as I am concerned, if it takes us three years longer., I have not been in the habit of making predictions, but I am almost tempted now to hazard one., I will., It is, that Grant is this evening in a position, with Meade and Hancock, of Pennsylvania, whence he can never be dislodged by the enemy until Richmond is taken., If I shall discover that General Grant may be greatly facilitated in the capture of Richmond by rapidly pouring to him a large number of armed men at the briefest notice, will you go?, Will you march on with him?, [Cries of ""Yes, yes.""], Then I shall call upon you when it is necessary., By authority of the Constitution, and moved thereto by the fourth section of the act of Congress, entitled ""An act making appropriations for the support of the army for the year ending the thirtieth of June, eighteen hundred and sixty-five, and for other purposes, approved June is, 1864,"" I require your opinion in writing as to what pay, bounty, and clothing are allowed by law to persons of color who were free on the nineteenth day of April, 1861, and who have been enlisted and mustered into the military service of the United States between the month of December, 1862, and the sixteenth of June, 1864., Please answer as you would do, on my requirement, if the act of June 15, 1864, had not been passed, and I will so use your opinion as to satisfy that act., All well and very warm., Tad and I have been to General Grant's army., Returned yesterday safe and sound., Complaint is made to me that General Brown does not do his best to suppress bushwhackers., Please ascertain and report to me., Your letter of the 14th inst.., formally notifying me that I have been nominated by the convention you represent for the Presidency of the United States for four years from the 4th of March next, has been received., The nomination is gratefully accepted, as the resolutions of the convention, called the platform, are heartily approved., While the resolution in regard to the supplanting of republican government upon the Western Continent is fully concurred in, there might be misunderstanding were I not to say that the position of the Government in relation to the action of France in Mexico, as assumed through the State Department and indorsed by the convention among the measures and acts of the Executive, will be faithfully maintained so long as the state of facts shall leave that position pertinent and applicable., I am especially gratified that the soldier and seaman were not forgotten by the convention, as they forever must and will be remembered by the grateful country for whose salvation they devote their lives., Thanking you for the kind and complimentary terms in which you have communicated the nomination and other proceedings of the convention, I subscribe myself,  I understand that Congress declines to admit to seats the persons sent as Senators and Representatives from Arkansas., These persons apprehend that, in consequence, you may not support the new State government there as you otherwise would., My wish is that you give that government and the people there the same support and protection that you would if the members had been admitted, because in no event, nor in any view of the case, can this do any harm, while it will be the best you can do toward suppressing the rebellion., Dr. Worster wishes to visit you with a view of getting your permission to introduce into the army ""Harmon's Sandal Sock."", Shall I give him a pass for that object?, I have nominated you to be Secretary of the Treasury, in place of Governor Chase, who has resigned., Please come without a moment's delay., Complaint is made to me that you are using your official power to defeat Mr. Arnold's nomination to Congress., I am well satisfied with Mr. Arnold as a member of Congress, and I do not know that the man who might supplant him would be as satisfactory; but the correct principle, I think, is that all our friends should have absolute freedom of choice among our friends., My wish, therefore, is that you will do just as you think fit with your own suffrage in the case, and not constrain any of your subordinates to [do] other than [as] he thinks fit with his., This is precisely the rule I inculcated and adhered to on my part, when a certain other nomination, now recently made, was being canvassed for., You say telegraphic communication is re-established with Sandy Hook., Well, what does Sandy Hook say about operations of enemy and of Sigel during to-day?, The President directs me to inform you that a rebel force, variously estimated at from fifteen to twenty thousand men, have invaded the State of Maryland, and have taken Martinsburg and Harper's Ferry, and are threatening other points; that the public safety requires him to call upon the State executives for a militia force to repel this invasion., He therefore directs me to call on you for a militia force of twelve thousand men from your State to serve not more than one hundred days, and to request that you will with the utmost despatch forward the troops to Washington by rail or steamboat as may be most expeditious., Whereas, by a proclamation which was issued on the 15th day of April, 1861, the President of the United States announced and declared that the laws of the United States had been for some time past, and then were, opposed and the execution thereof obstructed in certain States therein mentioned, by combinations too powerful to be suppressed by the ordinary course of judicial proceedings or by the power vested in the marshals by law; and  Whereas, immediately after the issuing of the said proclamation the land and naval forces of the United States were put into activity to suppress the said insurrections and rebellion; and  Whereas, the Congress of the United States, by an act approved on the third day of March, 1863, did enact that during the said rebellion the President of the United States, whenever in his judgment the public safety may require it, is authorized to suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus in any case throughout the United States, or any part thereof; and  Whereas, the said insurrection and rebellion still continue, endangering the existence of the Constitution and Government of the United States; and  Whereas, the military forces of the United States are now actively engaged in suppressing the said insurrection and rebellion in various parts of the States where the said rebellion has been successful in obstructing the laws and public authorities, especially in the States of Virginia and Georgia; and  Whereas, on the fifteenth day of September last, the President of the United States duly issued his proclamation, wherein he declared that the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus should be suspended throughout the United States, in Cases whereby the authority of the President of the United States, the military, naval, and civil officers of the United States, or any of them, hold persons under their command or in their custody, either as prisoners of war, spies, or aiders or abettors of the enemy, or officers, soldiers, or seamen enrolled or drafted, or mustered, or enlisted in, or belonging to the land or naval forces of the United States, or as deserters therefrom, or otherwise amenable to military law, or the rules and articles of war, or the rules and regulations prescribed for the military and naval service by authority of the President of the United States, or for resisting a draft, or for any other offence against the military or naval service; and  Whereas, many citizens of the State of Kentucky have joined the forces of the insurgents, who have on several occasions entered the said State of Kentucky in large force and not without aid and comfort furnished by disaffected and disloyal citizens of the United States residing therein, have not only greatly disturbed the public peace but have overborne the civil authorities and made flagrant civil war, destroying property and life in various parts of the State; and  Whereas, it has been made known to the President of the United States, by the officers commanding the National armies, that combinations have been formed in the said State of Kentucky, with a purpose of inciting the rebel forces to renew the said operations of civil war within the said State, and thereby to embarrass the United States armies now operating in the said States of Virginia and Georgia, and even to endanger their safety., Now, therefore, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws, do hereby declare that in my judgment the public safety especially requires that the suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus so proclaimed in the said proclamation of the 15th of September, 1863, be made effectual and be duly enforced in and throughout the said State of Kentucky, and that martial law be for the present declared therein., I do therefore hereby require of the military officers of the said State that the privilege of the habeas corpus be effectually suspended within the said State, according to the aforesaid proclamation, and that martial law be established therein to take effect from the date of this proclamation, the said suspension and establishment of martial law to continue until this proclamation shall be revoked or modified, but not beyond the period when the said rebellion shall have been suppressed or come to an end., And I do hereby require and command, as well as military officers, all civil officers and authorities existing or found within the said State of Kentucky, to take notice of this proclamation and to give full effect to the same., The martial laws herein proclaimed and the things in that respect herein ordered will not be deemed or taken to interfere with the holding of lawful elections, or with the proceedings of the constitutional Legislature of Kentucky, or with the administration of justice in the courts of law existing therein between citizens of the United States in suits or proceedings which do not affect the military operations or the constituted authorities of the government of the United States., In testimony whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed., Done at the City of Washington this 5th day of July, in the year of our Lord 1864, and of the independence of the United States the eighty-eighth., Whereas, the Senate and House of Representatives at their last session adopted a concurrent resolution, which was approved on the second day of July instant, and which `was in the words following, namely:  That the President of the United States be requested to appoint a day of humiliation and prayer by the people of the United States, that he request his constitutional advisers at the head of the Executive Departments to unite with him, as Chief Magistrate of the nation, at the City of Washington, and the members of Congress, and all magistrates, all civil, military, and naval officers, all soldiers, sailors, and marines, with all loyal and law-abiding people, to convene at their usual places of worship, or wherever they may be, to confess and to repent of their manifold sins, to implore the compassion and forgiveness of the Almighty, that, if consistent with His will, the existing rebellion may be speedily suppressed, and the supremacy of the Constitution and laws of the United States may be established throughout all the States; to implore Him, as the Supreme Ruler of the world, not to destroy us as a people, nor suffer us to be destroyed by the hostility or connivance of other nations, or by obstinate adhesion to our own counsels which may be in conflict with His eternal, purposes, and to implore Him to enlighten the mind of the nation to know and do His will, humbly believing that it is in accordance with His will that our place should be maintained as a united people among the family of nations; to implore Him to grant to our armed defenders, and the masses of the people, that courage, power of resistance, and endurance necessary to secure that result; to implore Him in His infinite goodness to soften the hearts, enlighten the minds, and quicken the conscience of those in rebellion, that they may lay down their arms, and speedily return to their allegiance to the United States, that they may not be utterly destroyed, that the effusion of blood may be stayed, and that unity and fraternity may be restored, and peace established throughout all our borders., Now, therefore, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the `United States, cordially concurring with the Congress of the United States, in the penitential and pious sentiments expressed in the aforesaid resolutions, and heartily approving of the devotional design and purpose thereof, do hereby appoint the first Thursday of August next to be observed by the people of the United States as a day of national humiliation and prayer., I do hereby further invite and request the heads of the Executive Departments of this Government, together with all legislators, all judges and magistrates, and all other persons exercising authority in the land, whether civil, military, or naval, and all soldiers, seamen, and marines in the national service, and all other loyal and law-abiding people of the United States, to assemble in their preferred places of public worship on that day, and there to render to the Almighty and merciful Ruler of the Universe, such homage and such confessions, and to offer to Him such supplications as the Congress of the United States have, in their aforesaid resolution, so solemnly, so earnestly, and so reverently recommended., In testimony whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed., Done at the city of Washington this seventh day of July, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-four, and of the independence of the United States the eighty-ninth., Whereas at the late session Congress passed a bill ""to guarantee to certain states whose governments have been usurped or overthrown a republican form of government,"" a copy of which is hereunto annexed; and  Whereas, the said bill was presented to the President of the United States for his approval less than one hour before the sine die adjournment of said session, and was not signed by him; and  Whereas the said bill contains, among other things, a plan for restoring the States in rebellion to their proper practical relation in the Union, which plan expresses the sense of Congress upon that subject, and which plan it is now thought fit to lay before the people for their consideration:  Now, therefore, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States, do proclaim, declare, and make known that while I am (as I was in December last, when, by proclamation, I propounded a plan for restoration) unprepared by a formal approval of this bill to be inflexibly committed to any single plan of restoration, and while I am also unprepared to declare that the free State constitutions and governments already adopted and installed in Arkansas and Louisiana shall be set aside and held for naught, thereby repelling and discouraging the loyal citizens who have set up the same as to further effort, or to declare a constitutional competency in Congress to abolish slavery in States, but am at the same time sincerely hoping and expecting that a constitutional amendment abolishing slavery throughout the nation may be adopted, nevertheless I am fully satisfied with the system for restoration contained in the bill as one very proper plan for the loyal people of any State choosing to adopt it, and that I am and at all times shall be prepared to give the Executive aid and assistance to any such people so soon as the military resistance to the United States shall have been suppressed in any such States and the people thereof shall have sufficiently returned to their obedience to the Constitution and the laws of the United States, in which cases militia-governors will be appointed with directions to proceed according to the bill., Your letter of the 7th, with inclosures, received., If you can find any person, anywhere, professing to have any proposition of Jefferson Davis in writing, for peace, embracing the restoration of the Union and abandonment of slavery, whatever else it embraces, say to him he may come to me with you; and that if he really brings such proposition, he shall at the least have safe conduct with the paper (and without publicity, if he chooses) to the point where you shall have to meet him., The same if there be two or more persons., What have you heard about a battle at Monocacy to-day?, We have nothing about it here except what you say., I am directed by the President to say that you will rally your forces and make every possible effort to retard the enemy's march on Baltimore., Yours of last night received., I have not a single soldier but whom is being disposed by the military for the best protection of all., By latest accounts the enemy is moving on Washington., They cannot fly to either place., Let us be vigilant, but keep cool., I hope neither Baltimore nor Washington will be sacked., Your dispatch to General Halleck, referring to what I may think in the present emergency, is shown me., General Halleck says we have absolutely no force here fit to go to the field., He thinks that with the hundred-day men and invalids we have here we can defend Washington, and, scarcely, Baltimore., Besides these there are about eight thousand, not very reliable, under Howe, at Harper's Ferry with Hunter approaching that point very slowly, with what number I suppose you know better than I. Wallace, with some odds and ends, and part of what came up with Ricketts, was so badly beaten yesterday at Monocacy, that what is left can attempt no more than to defend Baltimore., What we shall get in from Pennsylvania and New York will scarcely be worth counting, I fear., Now, what I think is, that you should provide to retain your hold where you are, certainly, and bring the rest with you personally, and make a vigorous effort to destroy the enemy's forces in this vicinity., I think there is really a fair chance to do this, if the movement is prompt., This is what I think upon your suggestion, and is not an order., Yours of 10.30 P.M. yesterday received, and very satisfactory., The enemy will learn of Wright's arrival, and then the difficulty will be to unite Wright and Hunter south of the enemy before he will recross the Potomac., Some firing between Rockville and here now., Vague rumors have been reaching us for two or three days that Longstreet's corps is also on its way [to] this vicinity., Look out for its absence from your front., I suppose you received my letter of the 9th., I have just received yours of the 13th, and am disappointed by it., I was not expecting you to send me a letter, but to bring me a man, or men., Mr. Hay goes to you with my answer to yours of the 13th., Yours of the 13th is just received, and I am disappointed that you have not already reached here with those commissioners, if they would consent to come on being shown my letter to you of the 9th instant., Show that and this to them, and if they will come on the terms stated in the former, bring them., I not only intend a sincere effort for peace, but I intend that you shall be a personal witness that it is made., The President of the United States directs that the four persons whose names follow, to wit, HON., Clement C. Clay, HON., Jacob Thompson, Professor James P. Holcombe, George N. Sanders, shall have safe conduct to the city of Washington in company with the HON., HORACE GREELEY, and shall be exempt from arrest or annoyance of any kind from any officer of the United States during their journey to the said city of Washington., In your dispatch of yesterday to General Sherman, I find the following, to wit:  ""I shall make a desperate effort to get a position here, which will hold the enemy without the necessity of so many men."", Pressed as we are by lapse of time I am glad to hear you say this; and yet I do hope you may find a way that the effort shall not be desperate in the sense of great loss of life., Yours of this morning received., You misconceive., The order you complain of was only nominally mine, and was framed by those who really made it with no thought of making you a scapegoat., It seemed to be General Grant's wish that the forces under General Wright and those under you should join and drive at the enemy under General Wright., Wright had the larger part of the force, but you had the rank., It was thought that you would prefer Crook's commanding your part to your serving in person under Wright., That is all of it., General Grant wishes you to remain in command of the department, and I do not wish to order otherwise., I have seen your despatches objecting to agents of Northern States opening recruiting stations near your camps., An act of Congress authorizes this, giving the appointment of agents to the States, and not to the Executive Government., It is not for the War Department, or myself, to restrain or modify the law, in its execution, further than actual necessity may require., To be candid, I was for the passage of the law, not apprehending at the time that it would produce such inconvenience to the armies in the field as you now cause me to fear., Many of the States were very anxious for it, and I hoped that, with their State bounties, and active exertions, they would get out substantial additions to our colored forces, which, unlike white recruits, help us where they come from, as well as where they go to., ...]"|3

P. Fessenden, Secretary of the United States Treasury, must not be hindered by the War, Navy, or any other Department of the Government, or any person engaged under any of said Departments., It is represented to me that there are at Rock Island, Illinois, as rebel prisoners of war, many persons of Northern and foreign birth who are unwilling to be exchanged and sent South, but who wish to take the oath of allegiance and enter the military service of the Union., Colonel Huidekoper, on behalf of the people of some parts of Pennsylvania, wishes to pay the bounties the Government would have to pay to proper persons of this class, have them enter the service of the United States, and be credited to the localities furnishing the bounty money., He will therefore proceed to Rock Island, ascertain the names of such persons (not including any who have attractions Southward), and telegraph them to the Provost-Marshal-General here, whereupon direction will be given to discharge the persons named upon their taking the oath of allegiance; and then upon the official evidence being furnished that they shall have been duly received and mustered into the service of the United States, their number will be credited as may be directed by Colonel Huidekoper., The signal success that Divine Providence has recently vouchsafed to the operations of the United States fleet and army in the harbor of Mobile, and the reduction of Fort Powell, Fort Gaines, and Fort Morgan, and the glorious achievements of the army under Major-General Sherman, in the State of Georgia, resulting in the capture of the city of Atlanta, call for devout acknowledgment to the Supreme Being in whose hands are the destinies of nations., It is therefore requested that on next Sunday, in all places of worship in the United States, thanksgivings be offered to Him for His mercy in preserve our national existence against the insurgent rebels who have been waging a cruel war against the Government of the United States for its overthrow, and also that prayer be made for Divine protection to our brave soldiers and their leaders in the field who have so often and so gallantly periled their lives in battling with the enemy, and for blessings and comfort from the Father of mercies to the sick, wounded, and prisoners, and to the orphans and widows of those who have fallen in the service of their country, and that He will continue to uphold the Government of the United States against all the efforts of public enemies and secret foes., The national thanks are tendered by the President to Admiral Farragut and Major-General Canby, for the skill and harmony with which the recent operations in Mobile Harbor and against Fort Powell, Fort Gaines, and Fort Morgan were planned and carried into execution., Also to Admiral Farragut and Major-General Granger, under whose immediate command they were conducted, and to the gallant commanders on sea and land, and to the sailors and soldiers engaged in the operations, for their energy and courage, which, under the blessing of Providence, have been crowned with brilliant success, and have won for them the applause and thanks of the nation., The national thanks are tendered by the President to Major-General William T. Sherman and the gallant officers and soldiers of his command before Atlanta, for the distinguished ability, courage, and perseverance displayed in the campaign in Georgia, which under Divine power resulted in the capture of the city of Atlanta., The marches, battles, sieges, and other military operations that have signalized this campaign must render it famous in the annals of war, and have entitled those who have participated therein to the applause and thanks of the nation., Ordered: First, That on Monday, the fifth day of September, commencing at the hour of twelve o'clock noon, there shall be given a salute of one hundred guns at the arsenal and navy-yard, at Washington, and on Tuesday, the 6th of September, or on the day after the receipt of this order, at each arsenal and navy-yard in the United States, for the recent brilliant achievements of the fleet and land forces of the United States in the harbor of Mobile, and in the reduction of Fort Powell, Fort Gaines, and Fort Morgan., The Secretary of War and the Secretary of the Navy will issue the necessary directions in their respective departments for the execution of this order., Second, That on Wednesday, the 7th of September, commencing at the hour of twelve o'clock noon, there shall be fired a salute of one hundred guns at the arsenal at Washington, and at New York, Boston, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Pittsburg, Newport (Ky.), and St. Louis, and New Orleans, Mobile, and Pensacola, Hilton Head, and Newbern, the day after the receipt of this order, for the brilliant achievements of the army under command of Major-General Sherman, in the State of Georgia, and for the capture of Atlanta., The Secretary of War will issue directions for the execution of this order., I have not forgotten probably never shall forget the very impressive occasion when yourself and friends visited me on a Sabbath forenoon two years ago--nor has your kind letter, written nearly a year later, even been for gotten., In all, it has been your purpose to strengthen my reliance on God., I am much indebted to the good Christian people of the country for their constant prayer and consolations; and to no one of them, more than to yourself., The purposes of the Almighty are perfect, and must prevail, though we erring mortals may fail to accurately perceive them in advance., We hoped for a happy termination of this terrible war long before this; but God knows best, and has ruled otherwise., We shall yet acknowledge His wisdom, and our own error therein., Mean while we must work earnestly in the best light He gives us, trusting that so working still conduces to the great ends He ordains., Surely He intends some great good to follow this mighty convulsion, which no mortal could make, and no mortal could stay., Your people--the Friends--have had, and are having, a very great trial., On principle, and faith, opposed to both war and oppression, they can only practically oppose oppression by war., For those appealing to me on conscientious grounds, I have done, and shall do, the best I could and can, in my own conscience, under my oath to the law., That you believe this I doubt not, and believing it, I shall still receive, for our country and myself your earnest prayers to our Father in Heaven., I can only say now, as I have often said before, it has always been a sentiment with me, that all mankind should be free., So far as I have been able, so far as came within my sphere, I have always acted as I believed was just and right, and done all I could for the good of mankind., I have, in letters sent forth from this office, expressed myself better than I can now., In regard to the great Book, I have only to say it is the best gift which God has ever given to man., All the good from the Saviour of the world is communicated to us through this book., But for that Book, we could not know right from wrong., All those things desirable to man are contained in it., I return you sincere thanks for this very elegant copy of this great Book of God which you present., The term of one hundred days for which the National Guard of Ohio volunteered having expired, the President directs an official acknowledgment to be made of their patriotic and valuable services during the recent campaigns., The term of service of their enlistment was short, but distinguished by memorable events., In the Valley of the Shenandoah, on the Peninsula, in the operations on the James River, around Petersburg and Richmond, in the battle of Monocacy, and in the intrenchments of Washington, and in other important service, the National Guard of Ohio performed with alacrity the duty of patriotic volunteers, for which they are entitled to and are hereby tendered, through the Governor of their State, the national thanks., Sheridan and Early are facing each other at a dead-lock., Could we not pick up a regiment here and there, to the number of say ten thousand men, and quietly but suddenly concentrate them at Sheridan's camp and enable him to make a strike?, This is but a suggestion., On behalf of the Union, thanks to Maine., ...]"|3
95|"[I am notified that this is a compliment paid me by the loyal Marylanders resident in this District., I infer that the adoption of the new constitution for the State furnishes the occasion, and that in your view the extirpation of slavery constitutes the chief merit of the new constitution., Most heartily do I congratulate you, and Maryland, and the nation, and the world, upon this event., I regret that it did not occur two years sooner, which, I am sure, would have saved the nation more money than would have met all the private loss incident to the measure; but it has come at last, and I sincerely hope its friends may fully realize all their anticipations of good from it, and that its opponents may by its effects be agreeably and profitably disappointed., A word upon another subject., Something said by the Secretary of State in his recent speech at Auburn, has been construed by some into a threat, that if I shall be beaten at the election, I will, between then and the end of my constitutional term, do what I may be able to ruin the Government., Others regard the fact that the Chicago Convention adjourned, not sine die, but to meet again, if called to do so by a particular individual, as the intimation of a purpose that if their nominee shall be elected he will at once seize control of the Government., I hope the good people will permit themselves to suffer no uneasiness on either point., I am struggling to maintain the Government, not to overthrow it., I am struggling especially to prevent others from overthrowing it., I therefore say, that if I live, I shall remain President until the 4th of next March, and that whoever shall be constitutionally elected, in November, shall be duly installed as President on the 4th of March, and in the interval I shall do my utmost that whoever is to hold the helm for the next voyage shall start with the best possible chance of saving the ship., This is due to the people, both on principle and under the Constitution., Their will, constitutionally expressed, is the ultimate law for all., If they should deliberately resolve to have immediate peace, even at the loss of their country and their liberties, I know not the power or the right to resist them., It is their own business, and they must do as they please with their own., I believe, however, they are still resolved to preserve their country and their liberties; and in this, in office or out of it, I am resolved to stand by them., I may add, that in this purpose to save the country and its liberties, no classes of people seem so nearly unanimous as the soldiers in the field and the sailors afloat., Do they not have the hardest of it?, Who should quail while they do not?, God bless the soldiers and seamen, with all their brave commanders., It has pleased Almighty God to prolong our national life another year, defending us with his guardian care against unfriendly designs from abroad, and vouchsafing to us in His mercy many and signal victories over the enemy, who is of our own household., It has also pleased our Heavenly Father to favor as well our citizens in their homes as our soldiers in their camps, and our sailors on the rivers and seas, with unusual health., He has largely augmented our free population by emancipation and by immigration, while he has opened to us new: sources of wealth, and has crowned the labor of our working-men in every department of industry with abundant rewards., Moreover, he has been pleased to animate and inspire our minds and hearts with fortitude, courage, and resolution sufficient for the great trial of civil war into which we have been brought by our adherence as a nation to the cause of freedom and humanity, and to afford to us reasonable hopes of an ultimate and happy deliverance from all our dangers and afflictions., Now, therefore, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States, do hereby appoint and set apart the last Thursday in November next as a day which I desire to be observed by all my fellow-citizens, wherever they may be then, as a day of thanksgiving and praise to Almighty God, the beneficent Creator and Ruler of the Universe., And I do further recommend to my fellow-citizens aforesaid, that on that occasion they do reverently humble themselves in the dust, and from thence offer up penitent and fervent prayers and supplications to the great Disposer of events for a return of the inestimable blessings of peace, union, and harmony throughout the, land which it has pleased him to assign as a dwelling-place for ourselves and for our posterity throughout all generations., In testimony whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed., Done at the city of Washington, this twentieth day of October, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-four, and of the independence of the United States the eighty-ninth., While Curtis is fighting Price, have you any idea where the force under Rosecrans is, or what it is doing?, On the 15th day of this month, as I remember, a printed paper manuscript, with a few manuscript interlineations, called a protest, with your names appended thereto, and accompanied by another printed paper, purporting to be a proclamation by Andrew Johnson, Military Governor of Tennessee, and also a manuscript paper, purporting to be extracts from the Code of Tennessee, were laid before me., The protest, proclamation, and extracts are respectively as follows:  At the time these papers were presented, as before stated, I had never seen either of them, nor heard of the subject to which they related, except in a general way one day previously., Up to the present moment, nothing whatever upon the subject has passed between Governor Johnson, or any one else, connected with the proclamation, and myself., Since receiving the papers, as stated, I have given the subject such brief consideration as I have been able to do, in the midst of so many pressing public duties., My conclusion is, that I can have nothing to do with the matter, either to sustain the plan as the convention and Governor Johnson have initiated it, or to revoke or modify it as you demand., By the Constitution and laws, the President is charged with no duty in the presidential election in any State, nor do I in this case perceive any military reason for his interference in the matter., The movement set on foot by the convention and Governor Johnson does not, as seems to be assumed by you, emanate from the National Executive., In no proper sense can it be considered other than an independent movement of, at least, a portion of the loyal people of Tennessee., I do not perceive in the plan any menace, or violence, or coercion towards any one., Governor Johnson, like any other loyal citizen of Tennessee, has the right to favor any political plan he chooses, and, as military governor, it is his duty to keep peace among and for the loyal people of the State., I cannot discern that by this plan he purposes any more., But you object to the plan., Leaving it alone will be your perfect security against it., It is not proposed to force you into it., Do as you please, on your own account, peaceably and loyally, and Governor Johnson will not molest you, but will protect you against violence as far as in his power., I presume that the conducting of a presidential election in Tennessee in strict accordance with the old Code of the State, is not now a possibility., It is scarcely necessary to add, that if any election shall be held and any votes shall be cast in the State of Tennessee for President and Vice-President of the United States, it will belong, not to the military agents, nor yet to the Executive Department, but exclusively to another department of the Government, to determine whether they are entitled to be counted in conformity with the Constitution and laws of the United States., Except it be to give protection against violence, I decline to interfere in any way with any presidential election., With great pleasure I tender to you and your brave army the thanks of the nation, and my own personal admiration and gratitude, for the month's operations in the Shenandoah Valley; and especially for the splendid work of October 19, 1864., I have received information to-day, having great appearance of authenticity, that there is to be a rebel raid into Western Kentucky; that it is to consist of four thousand infantry and three thousand cavalry, and is to start from Corinth, Mississippi, On the fourth day of November., I have ordered that Milton D. Norton be discharged on taking the oath., Please notify his mother., Whereas the Congress of the United States passed an act, which was approved on the 21st day of March last, entitled ""An act to enable the people of Nevada to form a constitution and State government, and for the admission of such State into the Union on an equal footing with the original States;"" and,  Whereas the said constitution and State government have been formed, pursuant to the conditions prescribed by the fifth section of the act of Congress aforesaid, and the certificate required by the said act and also a copy of the constitution and ordinances have been submitted to the President of the United States:  Now, therefore, be it known that I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States, in accordance with the duty imposed upon me by the act of Congress aforesaid, do hereby declare and proclaim that the said State of Nevada is admitted into the Union on an equal footing with the original States., In witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed  Suspend execution of all the deserters ordered to be executed on Sunday at Louisville, until further order, and send me the records in the cases., Acknowledge receipt., Please forward with all possible despatch to the naval officer commanding at Mobile Bay the following order., Do not on any account, or on any showing of authority whatever, from whomsoever purporting to come, allow the blockade to be violated., Allow me to wish you a great success., With the old fame of the Navy made brighter in the present war you cannot fail., I name none lest I wrong others by omission., To all, from rear-admiral to honest Jack, I tender the nation's admiration and gratitude., Yours received., I have no other notice that the ox is mine., If it be really so, I present it to the Sailors' Fair as a contribution., News from Grant, Sherman, Thomas and Rosecrans satisfactory, but not important., Pirate Florida captured by the Wachusett October 7, on the coast of Brazil., The information is certain., Even before I had been informed by you that this compliment was paid me by loyal citizens of Pennsylvania, friendly to me, I had inferred that you were of that portion of my countrymen who think that the best interests of the nation are to be subserved by the support of the present administration., I do not pretend to say that you, who think so, embrace all the patriotism and loyalty of the country, but I do believe, and I trust without personal interest, that the welfare of the country does require that such support and indorsement should be given., I earnestly believe that the consequences of this day's work, if it be as you assume, and as now seems probable, will be to the lasting advantage, if not to the very salvation, of the country., I cannot at this hour say what has been the result of the election., But, whatever it may be, I have no desire to modify this opinion: that all who have labored to-day in behalf of the Union have wrought for the best interests of the country and the world; not only for the present, but for all future ages., I am thankful to God for this approval of the people; but, while deeply grateful for this mark of their confidence in me, if I know my heart, my gratitude is free from any taint of personal triumph., I do not impugn the motives of any one opposed to me., It is no pleasure to me to triumph over any one, but I give thanks to the Almighty for this evidence of the people's resolution to stand by free government and the rights of humanity., The Maryland soldiers in the Army of the Potomac cast a total vote of fourteen hundred and twenty-eight, out of which we get eleven hundred and sixty majority., This is directly from General Meade and General Grant., It has long been a grave question whether any government, not too strong for the liberties of its people, can be strong enough to maintain its existence in great emergencies., On this point the present rebellion brought our government to a severe test, and a presidential election occurring in regular course during the rebellion, added not a little to the strain., If the loyal people united were put to the utmost of their strength by the rebellion, must they not fail when divided and partially paralyzed by a political war among themselves?, But the election was a necessity., We cannot have free government without elections; and if the election could force us to forego or postpone a national election, it might fairly claim to have already conquered and ruined us., The strife of the election is but human nature practically applied to the facts of the case., What has occurred in this case must ever recur in similar cases., Human nature will not change., In any future great national trial, compared with the men of this, we will have as weak and as strong, as silly and as wise, as bad and as good., Let us, therefore, study the incidents of this as philosophy to learn wisdom from, and none of them as wrongs to be revenged., But the election, along with its incidental and undesirable strife, has done good, too., It has demonstrated that a people's government can sustain a national election in the midst of a great civil war., Until now, it has not been known to the world that this was a possibility., It shows, also, how sound and strong we still are., It shows that even among the candidates of the same party, he who is most devoted to the Union and most opposed to treason can receive most of the people's votes., It shows, also, to the extent yet known, that we have more men now than we had when the war began., Gold is good in its place; but living, brave, and patriotic men are better than gold., But the rebellion continues, and, now that the election is over, may not all have a common interest to reunite in a common effort to save our common country?, For my own part, I have striven and shall strive to avoid placing any obstacle in the way., So long as I have been here, I have not willingly planted a thorn in any man's bosom., While I am duly sensible to the high compliment of a re-election, and duly grateful, as I trust, to Almighty God, for having directed my countrymen to a right conclusion, as I think, for their good, it adds nothing to my satisfaction that any other man may be disappointed by the result., May I ask those who have not differed with me to join with me in this same spirit towards those who have?, And now, let me close by asking three hearty cheers for our brave soldiers and seamen, and their gallant and skillful commanders., I have just received a telegram from Governor Bramlette saying: ""General John B. Houston, a loyal man and prominent citizen, was arrested, and yesterday, started off by General Burbridge, to be sent beyond our lines by way of Catlettsburg, for no other offense than opposition to your re-election,"" and I have answered him as follows below, of which please take notice and report to me., ...]"|3
96|[I solicit your authority to furnish to the republic a gunboat, at moderate cost, to be reimbursed to the United States by instalments., Such a vessel is needed for the safety of that state against the native African races, and in Liberian hands it would be more effective in arresting the African slave-trade than a squadron in our own hands., The possession of the least organized naval force would stimulate a generous ambition in the republic, and the confidence which we should manifest by furnishing it would win forbearance and favor toward the colony from all civilized nations., The proposed overland telegraph between America and Europe, by the way of Bering Straits and Asiatic Russia, which was sanctioned by Congress at the last session, has been undertaken, under very favorable circumstances, by an association of American citizens, with the cordial good-will and support as well of this Government as of those of Great Britain and Russia., Assurances have been received from most of the South American States of their high appreciation of the enterprise and their readiness to co-operate in constructing lines tributary to that world-encircling communication., I learn with much satisfaction that the noble design of a telegraphic communication between the eastern coast of America and Great Britain has been renewed, with full expectation of its early accomplishment., Thus it is hoped that with the return of domestic peace the country will be able to resume with energy and advantage its former high career of commerce and civilization., Our very popular and estimable representative in Egypt died in April last., An unpleasant altercation which arose between the temporary incumbent of the office and the Government of the Pasha resulted in a suspension of intercourse., The evil was promptly corrected on the arrival of the successor in the consulate, and our relations with Egypt, as well as our relations with the Barbary Powers, are entirely satisfactory., The rebellion which has so long been flagrant in China has at last been suppressed, with the co-operating good offices of this Government and of the other Western commercial States., The judicial consular establishment there has become very difficult and onerous, and it will need legislative revision to adapt it to the extension of our commerce and to the more intimate intercourse which has been instituted with the Government and people of that vast Empire., China seems to be accepting with hearty good-will the conventional laws which regulate commercial and social intercourse among the Western nations., Owing to the peculiar situation of Japan and the anomalous form of its Government, the action of that empire in performing treaty stipulations is inconstant and capricious., Nevertheless, good progress has been effected by the Western powers, moving with enlightened concert., Our own pecuniary claims have been allowed or put in course of settlement, and the inland sea has been reopened to commerce., There is reason also to believe that these proceedings have increased rather than diminished the friendship of Japan toward the United States., The ports of Norfolk, Fernandina, and Pensacola have been opened by proclamation., It is hoped that foreign merchants will now consider whether it is not safer and more profitable to themselves, as well as just to the United States, to resort to these and other open ports than it is to pursue, through many hazards and at vast cost, a contraband trade with other ports which are closed, if not by actual military occupation, at least by a lawful and effective blockade., For myself, I have no doubt of the power and duty of the Executive, under the law of nations, to exclude enemies of the human race from an asylum in the United States., If Congress should think that proceedings in such cases lack the authority of law, or ought to be further regulated by it, I recommend that provision be made for effectually preventing foreign slave traders from acquiring domicile and facilities for their criminal occupation in our country., It is possible that if it were a new and open question the maritime powers, with the lights they now enjoy, would not concede the privileges of a naval belligerent to the insurgents of the United States, destitute, as they are, and always have been, equally of ships of war and of ports and harbors., Disloyal emissaries have been neither assiduous nor more successful during the last year than they were before that time in their efforts, under favor of that privilege, to embroil our country in foreign wars., The desire and determination of the governments of the maritime states to defeat that design are believed to be as sincere as and can not be more earnest than our own., Nevertheless, unforeseen political difficulties have arisen, especially in Brazilian and British ports and on the northern boundary of the United States, which have required, and are likely to continue to require, the practice of constant vigilance and a just and conciliatory spirit on the part of the United States, as well as of the nations concerned and their governments., Commissioners have been appointed under the treaty with Great Britain on the adjustment of the claims of the Hudson Bay and Puget Sound Agricultural Companies, in Oregon, and are now proceeding to the execution of the trust assigned to them., In view of the insecurity of life and property in the region adjacent to the Canadian border, by reason of recent assaults and depredations committed by inimical and desperate persons who are harbored there, it has been thought proper to give notice that after the expiration of six months, the period conditionally stipulated in the existing arrangement with Great Britain, the United States must hold themselves at liberty to increase their naval armament upon the Lakes if they shall find that proceeding necessary., The condition of the border will necessarily come into consideration in connection with the question of continuing or modifying the rights of transit from Canada through the United States, as well as the regulation of imposts, which were temporarily established by the reciprocity treaty of the 5th June, 1854., I desire, however, to be understood while making this statement that the colonial authorities of Canada are not deemed to be intentionally unjust or unfriendly toward the United States, but, on the contrary, there is every reason to expect that, with the approval of the Imperial Government, they will take the necessary measures to prevent new incursions across the border., The act passed at the last session for the encouragement of immigration has so far as was possible been put into operation., It seems to need amendment which will enable the officers of the Government to prevent the practice of frauds against the immigrants while on their way and on their arrival in the ports, so as to secure them here a free choice of avocations and places of settlement., A liberal disposition toward this great national policy is manifested by most of the European States, and ought to be reciprocated on our part by giving the immigrants effective national protection., I regard our immigrants as one of the principal replenishing streams which are appointed by Providence to repair the ravages of internal war and its wastes of national strength and health., All that is necessary is to secure the flow of that stream in its present fullness, and to that end the Government must in every way make it manifest that it neither needs nor designs to impose involuntary military service upon those who come from other lands to cast their lot in our country., The financial affairs of the Government have been successfully administered during the last year., The legislation of the last session of Congress has beneficially affected the revenues, although sufficient time has not yet elapsed to experience the full effect of several of the provisions of the acts of Congress imposing increased taxation., The receipts during the year from all sources, upon the basis of warrants signed by the Secretary of the Treasury, including loans and the balance in the Treasury on the 1st day of July, 1863, were $1,394,196,007.62, and the aggregate disbursements, upon the same basis, were $1,298,056,101.89, leaving a balance in the Treasury, as shown by warrants, of $96,739,905.73., Deduct from these amounts the amount of the principal of the public debt redeemed and the amount of issues in substitution therefor, and the actual cash operations of the Treasury were: receipts, $884,076,646.57; disbursements, $865,234,087.86; which leaves a cash balance in the Treasury of $18,842,558.71., Of the receipts there were derived from customs $102,316,152.99, from lands $588,333.29, from direct taxes $475,648.96, from internal revenue $109,741,134.10, from miscellaneous sources $47,511,448.10, and from loans applied to actual expenditures, including former balance, $623,443,929.13., There were disbursed for the civil service $27,505,599.46, for pensions and Indians $7,517,930.97, for the War Department $690,791,842.97, for the Navy Department $85,733,292.77, for interest on the public debt $53,685,421.69, making an aggregate of $865,234,087.86, and leaving a balance in the Treasury of $18,842,558.71, as before stated., For the actual receipts and disbursements for the first quarter and the estimated receipts and disbursements for the three remaining quarters of the current fiscal year, and the general operations of the Treasury in detail, I refer you to the report of the Secretary of the Treasury., I concur with him in the opinion that the proportion of moneys required to meet the expenses consequent upon the war derived from taxation should be still further increased; and I earnestly invite your attention to this subject to the end that there be such additional legislation as shall be required to meet the just expectations of the Secretary., The public debt on the first day of July last, as appears by the books of the Treasury, amounted to $1,740,690,489.49., Probably, should the war continue for another year, that amount may be increased by not far from $500,000,000., Held, as it is, for the most part by our own people, it has become a substantial branch of national, though private, property., For obvious reasons the more nearly this property can be distributed among all the people the better., To favor such general distribution, greater inducements to become owners might, perhaps, with good effect and without injury be presented to persons of limited means., With this view I suggest whether it might not be both competent and expedient for Congress to provide that a limited amount of some future issue of public securities might be held by any bona fide purchaser exempt from taxation and from seizure for debt, under such restrictions and limitations as might be necessary to guard against abuse of so important a privilege., This would enable every prudent person to set aside a small annuity against a possible day of want., Privileges like these would render the possession of such securities to the amount limited most desirable to every person of small means who might be able to save enough for the purpose., The great advantage of citizens being creditors as well as debtors with relation to the public debt is obvious., Men readily perceive that they can not be much oppressed by a debt which they owe to themselves., The public debt on the first day of July last, although somewhat exceeding the estimate of the Secretary of the Treasury made to Congress at the commencement of the last session, falls short of the estimate of that officer made in the preceding December as to its probable amount at the beginning of this year by the sum of $3,995,097.31., This fact exhibits a satisfactory condition and conduct of the operations of the Treasury., The national banking system is proving to be acceptable to capitalists and to the people., On the twenty-fifth day of November five hundred and eighty-four national banks had been organized, a considerable number of which were conversions from State banks., Changes from State systems to the national system are rapidly taking place, and it is hoped that very soon there will be in the United States no banks of issue not authorized by Congress and no bank-note circulation not secured by the Government., That the Government and the people will derive great benefit from this change in the banking systems of the country can hardly be questioned., The national system will create a reliable and permanent influence in support of the national credit and protect the people against losses in the use of paper money., Whether or not any further legislation is advisable for the suppression of State-bank issues, it will be for Congress to determine., It seems quite clear that the Treasury can not be satisfactorily conducted unless the Government can exercise a restraining power over the bank-note circulation of the country., The report of the Secretary of War and the accompanying documents will detail the campaigns of the armies in the field since the date of the last annual message, and also the operations of the several administrative bureaus of the War Department during the last year., It will also specify the measures deemed essential for the national defense and to keep up and supply the requisite military force., The report of the Secretary of the Navy presents a comprehensive and satisfactory exhibit of the affairs of that Department and of the naval service., It is a subject of congratulation and laudable pride to our countrymen that a Navy of such vast proportions has been organized in so brief a period and conducted with so much efficiency and success., The general exhibit of the Navy, including vessels under construction on the first of December, 1864, shows a total of 671 vessels, carrying 4610 guns, and of 510,396 tons, being an actual increase during the year, over and above all losses by shipwreck or in battle, of 83 vessels, 167 guns, and 42,427 tons., The total number of men at this time in the naval service, including officers, is about 51,000., There have been captured by the Navy during the year 324 vessels, and the whole number of naval captures since hostilities commenced is 1379, of which 267 are steamers., The gross proceeds arising from the sale of condemned prize property thus far reported amount to $14,369,250.51., A large amount of such proceeds is still under adjudication and yet to be reported., The total expenditure of the Navy Department of every description, including the cost of the immense squadrons that have been called into existence from the fourth of March, 1861, to the first of November, 1864, is $238,647,262.35., Your favorable consideration is invited to the various recommendations of the Secretary of the Navy, especially in regard to a navy-yard and suitable establishment for the construction and repair of iron vessels and the machinery and armature for our ships, to which reference was made in my last annual message., Your attention is also invited to the views expressed in the report in relation to the legislation of Congress at its last session in respect to prize on our inland waters., I cordially concur in the recommendation of the Secretary as to the propriety of creating the new rank of vice-admiral in our naval service., Your attention is invited to the report of the Postmaster-General for a detailed account of the operations and financial condition of the Post-Office Department., The postal revenues for the year ending June 30, 1864, amounted to $12,438,253.78, and the expenditures to $12,644,786.20, the excess of expenditures over receipts being $206,532.42., The views presented by the Postmaster-General on the subject of special grants by the Government in aid of the establishment of new lines of ocean mail steamships and the policy he recommends for the development of increased commercial intercourse with adjacent and neighboring countries should receive the careful consideration of Congress., It is of noteworthy interest that the steady expansion of population, improvement, and governmental institutions over the new and unoccupied portions of our country have scarcely been checked, much less impeded or destroyed, by our great civil war, which at first glance would seem to have absorbed almost the entire energies of the nation., The organization and admission of the State of Nevada has been completed in conformity with law, and thus our excellent system is firmly established in the mountains, which once seemed a barren and uninhabitable waste between the Atlantic States and those which have grown up on the coast of the Pacific Ocean., The Territories of the Union are generally in a condition of prosperity and rapid growth., Idaho and Montana, by reason of their great distance and the interruption of communication with them by Indian hostilities, have been only partially organized; but it is understood that these difficulties are about to disappear, which will permit their governments, like those of the others, to go into speedy and full operation., As intimately connected with and promotive of this material growth of the nation, I ask the attention of Congress to the valuable information and important recommendations relating to the public lands, Indian affairs, the Pacific Railroad, and mineral discoveries contained in the report of the Secretary of the Interior which is herewith transmitted, and which report also embraces the subjects of patents, pensions, and other topics of public interest pertaining to his Department., The quantity of public land disposed of during the five quarters ending on the thirtieth of September last was 4,221,342 acres, of which 1,538,614 acres were entered under the homestead law., The remainder was located with military land warrants, agricultural scrip certified to States for railroads, and sold for cash., The cash received from sales and location fees was $1,019,446., The income from sales during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1864, was $678,007.21, against $136,077.95 received during the preceding year., The aggregate number of acres surveyed during the year has been equal to the quantity disposed of, and there is open to settlement about 133,000,000 acres of surveyed land., The great enterprise of connecting the Atlantic with the Pacific States by railways and telegraph lines has been entered upon with a vigor that gives assurance of success, notwithstanding the embarrassments arising from the prevailing high prices of materials and labor., The route of the main line of the road has been definitely located for one hundred miles westward from the initial point at Omaha City, Nebraska, and a preliminary location of the Pacific Railroad of California has been made from Sacramento eastward to the great bend of the Truckee River in Nevada., Numerous discoveries of gold, silver, and cinnabar mines have been added to the many heretofore known, and the country occupied by the Sierra Nevada and Rocky mountains and the subordinate ranges now teems with enterprising labor, which is richly remunerative., It is believed that the produce of the mines of precious metals in that region has during the year reached, if not exceeded, $100,000,000 in value., It was recommended in my last annual message that our Indian system be remodeled., Congress at its last session, acting upon the recommendation, did provide for reorganizing the system in California, and it is believed that under the present organization the management of the Indians there will be attended with reasonable success., Much yet remains to be done to provide for the proper government of the Indians in other parts of the country, to render it secure for the advancing settler, and to provide for the welfare of the Indian., The Secretary reiterates his recommendations, and to them the attention of Congress is invited., The liberal provisions made by Congress for paying pensions to invalid soldiers and sailors of the Republic and to the widows, orphans, and dependent mothers of those who have fallen in battle or died of disease contracted or of wounds received in the service of their country have been diligently administered., There have been added to the pension rolls during the year ending the 30th day of June last the names of 16,770 invalid soldiers and of 271 disabled seamen, making the present number of army invalid pensioners 22,767 and of navy invalid pensioners 712., Of widows, orphans, and mothers 22,198 have been placed on the army pension rolls and 248 on the navy rolls., The present number of army pensioners of this class is 25,433 and of navy pensioners 793., At the beginning of the year the number of Revolutionary pensioners was 1430., ...]|3
97|"[The Executive power itself would be greatly diminished by the cessation of actual war., Pardons and remissions of forfeitures, however, would still be within Executive control., In what spirit and temper this control would be exercised can be fairly judged of by the past., A year ago general pardon and amnesty, upon specified terms, were offered to all except certain designated classes, and it was at the same time made known that the excepted classes were still within contemplation of special clemency., During the year many availed themselves of the general provision, and many more would, only that the signs of bad faith in some led to such precautionary measures as rendered the practical process less easy and certain., During the same time also special pardons have been granted to individuals of the excepted classes, and no voluntary application has been denied., Thus practically the door has been for a full year open to all except such as were not in condition to make free choice; that is, such as were in custody or under constraint., It is still so open to all., But the time may come, probably will come, when public duty shall demand that it be closed and that in lieu more rigorous measures than heretofore shall be adopted., In presenting the abandonment of armed resistance to the national authority on the part of the insurgents as the only indispensable condition to ending the war on the part of the Government, I retract nothing heretofore said as to slavery., I repeat the declaration made a year ago, that ""while I remain in my present position I shall not attempt to retract or modify the emancipation proclamation, nor shall I return to slavery any person who is free by the terms of that proclamation or by any of the acts of Congress."", If the people should, by whatever mode or means, make it an Executive duty to re-enslave such persons, another, and not I, must be their instrument to perform it., In stating a single condition of peace I mean simply to say that the war will cease on the part of the Government whenever it shall have ceased on the part of those who began it., I believe I shall never be old enough to speak without embarrassment when I have nothing to talk about., I have no good news to tell you, and yet I have no bad news to tell., We have talked of elections until there is nothing more to say about them., The most interesting news now we have is from Sherman., We all know where he went in at, but I can't tell where he will come out at., I will now close by proposing three cheers for General Sherman and his army., Complaint is made to me of the doings of a man at Hannibal, Mo., by the name of Haywood, who, as I am told, has charge of some militia force, and is not in the United States service., Please inquire into the matter and correct anything you may find amiss if in your power., I am appealed to in behalf of a man by the name of Frank Fairbairns, said to have been for a long time and still in prison, without any definite ground stated., How is it?, ORDERED, First, that Major-General William P. Smith and the Hon., Henry Stanbery be, and they are hereby, appointed special commissioners to investigate and report, for the information of the President; upon the civil and military administration in the military division bordering upon and west of the Mississippi, under such instructions as shall be issued by authority of the President and the War Department., Second, said commissioners shall have power to examine witnesses upon oath, and to take such proofs orally or in writing, upon the subject-matters of investigation as they may deem expedient, and return the same together with their report., Third, all officers and persons in the military, naval and revenue services, or in any branch of the public service under the authority of the United States Government, are required, upon subpoena issued by direction of the said commissioners, to appear before them at such time and place as may be designated in said subpoena and to give testimony on oath touching such matters as may be inquired of by the commissioners, and to produce such books, papers, writings, and documents as they may be notified or required to produce by the commissioners, and as may be in their possession., Fourth, said special commissioners shall also investigate and report upon any other matters that may hereafter be directed by the Secretary of War, and shall with all convenient dispatch make report to him in writing of their investigation, and shall also from time to time make special reports to the Secretary of War upon such matters as they may deem of importance to the public interests., Fifth, the Secretary of War shall assign to the said commissioners such aid and assistance as may be required for the performance of their duties, and make such just and reasonable allowances and compensation for the said commissioners and for the persons employed by them as he may deem proper., Please accept for yourself, officers, and men, the nation's thanks for your good work of yesterday., You made a magnificent beginning; a grand consummation is within your easy reach., Do not let it slip., I have long determined to make public the origin of the greenback and tell the world that it is Dick Taylor's creation., You had always been friendly to me, and when troublous times fell on us, and my shoulders, though broad and willing, were weak, and myself surrounded by such circumstances and such people that I knew not whom to trust, then I said in my extremity: ""I will send for Colonel Taylor; he will know what to do."", I think it was in January, 1862, on or about the 16th, that I did so., You came, and I said to you:  ""What can we do?"", Said you, ""Why, issue Treasury notes bearing no interest, printed on the best banking paper., Issue enough to pay off the Army expenses and declare it legal tender."", Chase thought it a hazardous thing, but we finally accomplished it, and gave the people of this Republic the greatest blessing they ever had--their own paper to pay their own debts., It is due to you, the father of the present greenback, that the people should know it, and I take great pleasure in making it known., How many times have I laughed at you telling me plainly that I was too lazy to be anything but a lawyer., It is said that Harry Walters, a private in the Anderson cavalry, is now and for a long time has been in prison at Chattanooga., Please report to me what is his condition, and for what he is imprisoned., Whereas, by the act approved July 4, 1864, entitled ""An act further to regulate and provide for the enrolling and calling out the national forces, and for other purposes,"" it is provided that the President of the United States may, ""at his discretion, at any time hereafter, call for any number of men, as volunteers for the respective terms of one, two, and three years for military service,"" and ""that in case the quota or any part thereof of any town, township, ward of a city, precinct, or election district, or of any country not so subdivided, shall not be filled within the space of fifty days after such call, then the President shall immediately order a draft for one year to fill such quota or any part thereof which may be unfilled;"" and  Whereas, by the credits allowed in accordance with the act of Congress on the call for 500,000 men, made July 18, 1864, the number of men to be obtained under that call was reduced to 280,000; and  Whereas, the operations of the enemy in certain States have rendered it impracticable to procure from them their full quotas of troops under said call; and  Whereas, from the foregoing causes but 240,000 men have been put into the Army, Navy, and Marine Corps under the said call of July 18, 1864, leaving a deficiency on that call of two hundred and sixty thousand (260,000):  Now, therefore, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States of America, in order to supply the aforesaid deficiency and to provide for casualties in the military and naval service of the United States, do issue this my call for three hundred thousand (300,000) volunteers to serve for one, two, or three years., The quotas of the States, districts, and subdistricts under this call will be assigned by the War Department through the bureau of the Provost-Marshal General of the United States, and ""in case the quota or any part thereof of any town, township, ward of a city, precinct, or election district, or of any county not so subdivided, shall not be filled"" before the fifteenth of February, 1865, then a draft shall be made to fill such quota or any part thereof under this call which may be unfilled on said fifteenth day of February, 1865., In testimony whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixedMany, many thanks for your Christmas gift, the capture of Savannah., When you were about leaving Atlanta for the Atlantic coast, I was anxious, if not fearful; but feeling that you were the better judge, and remembering that ""nothing risked, nothing gained,"" I did not interfere., Now, the undertaking being a success, the honor is all yours; for I believe none of us went further than to acquiesce., And taking the work of General Thomas into the count, as it should be taken, it is indeed a great success., Not only does it afford the obvious and immediate military advantages; but in showing to the world that your army could be divided, putting the stronger part to an important new service, and yet leaving enough to vanquish the old opposing force of the whole,--Hood's army,--it brings those who sat in darkness to see a great light., But what next?, I suppose it will be safe if I leave General Grant and yourself to decide., Please make my grateful acknowledgments to your whole army of officers and men., If within your power send me the particulars of the causes for which Lieutenant-Governor Jacob was arrested and sent away., I have the honor to acknowledge the reception of your note of the twentieth of December, conveying the announcement that the Trustees of the College of New Jersey had conferred upon me the degree of Doctor of Laws., The assurance conveyed by this high compliment, that the course of the Government which I represent, has received the approval of a body of gentlemen of such character and intelligence, in this time of public trial, is most grateful to me., Thoughtful men must feel that the fate of civilization upon this continent is involved in the issue of our contest., Among the most gratifying proofs of this conviction is the hearty devotion everywhere exhibited by our schools and colleges to the national cause., I am most thankful if my labors have seemed to conduct to the preservation of those institutions, under which alone we can expect good government and in its train sound learning, and the progress of the liberal arts., I am, sir, very truly, your obedient servant,  Suspend execution of James R. Mallory, for six weeks from Friday the thirtieth of this month, which time I have given his friends to make proof, if they can, upon certain points., If there be no objection, please tell me what you now understand of the Wilmington expedition, present and prospective., There is a man in Company I, Eleventh Connecticut Volunteers, First Brigade, Third Division, Twenty-fourth Army Corps, at Chapin's Farm, Va.; under the assumed name of William Stanley, but whose real name is Frank R. Judd, and who is under arrest, and probably about to be tried for desertion., He is the son of our present minister to Prussia, who is a close personal friend of Senator Trumbull and myself., We are not willing for the boy to be shot, but we think it as well that his trial go regularly on, suspending execution until further order from me and reporting to me., It is said that you were on the court-martial that tried John Lennon, and that you are disposed to advise his being pardoned and sent to his regiment., If this be true, telegraph me to that effect at once., Let Trumbo's substitute be regularly mustered in, send me the evidence that it is done and I will then discharge Trumbo., I herewith return to your honorable body, in which it originated, a ""joint resolution to correct certain clerical errors in the internal revenue act,"" without my approval., My reason for so doing is that I am informed that this joint resolution was prepared during the last moments of the last session of Congress for the purpose of correcting certain errors of reference in the internal revenue act, which were discovered on an examination of an official copy procured from the State Department a few hours only before the adjournment., It passed the House and went to the Senate, where a vote was taken upon it, but by some accident it was not presented to the President of the Senate for his signature., Since the adjournment of the last session of Congress, other errors of a kind similar to those which this resolution was designed to correct, have been discovered in the law, and it is now thought most expedient to include all the necessary corrections in one act or resolution., The attention of the proper committee of the House has, I am informed, been already directed to the preparation of a bill for this purpose., Richard T. Jacob, Lieutenant-Governor of Kentucky, is at the Spotswood House, in Richmond, under an order of General Burbridge not to return to Kentucky., Please communicate leave to him to pass our lines, and come to me here at Washington., If there is a man at City Point by the name of Waterman Thornton who is in trouble about desertion, please have his case briefly stated to me and do not let him be executed meantime., I transmit to Congress a copy of two treaties between the United States and Belgium, for the extinguishment of the Scheldt dues, etc., concluded on the twentieth of May, 1863, and twentieth of July, 1863, respectively, the ratifications of which were exchanged at Brussels on the twenty-fourth of June last; and I recommend an appropriation to carry into effect the provisions thereof relative to the payment of the proportion of the United States toward the capitalization of the said dues., I transmit herewith the letter of the Secretary of War, with accompanying report of the Adjutant-General, in reply to the resolution of the House of Representatives, dated December 7, 1864, requesting me ""to communicate to the House the report made by Col. Thomas M. Key of an interview between himself and General Howell Cobb on the fourteenth [15th] day of June, 1862, on the banks of the Chickahominy, on the subject of the exchange of prisoners of war."", Whereas the act of Congress of the twenty-eighth of September, 1850, entitled ""An act to create additional collection districts in the State of California, and to change the existing districts therein, and to modify the existing collection districts in the United States,"" extends to merchandise warehoused under bond the privilege of being exported to the British North American provinces adjoining the United States, in the manner prescribed in the act of Congress of the third of March, 1845, which designates certain frontier ports through which merchandise may be exported, and further provides ""that such other ports situated on the frontiers of the United States, adjoining the British North American provinces, as may hereafter be found expedient, may have extended to them the like privileges on the recommendation of the Secretary of the Treasury, and proclamation duly made by the President of the United States, specially designating the ports to which the aforesaid privileges are to be extended;""  Now, therefore, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States of America, in accordance with the recommendation of the Secretary of the Treasury, do hereby declare and proclaim that the port of St. Albans, in the State of Vermont, is, and shall be, entitled to all the privileges in regard to the exportation of merchandise in bond to the British North American provinces adjoining the United States, which are extended to the ports enumerated in the seventh section of the act of Congress of the third of March, 1845, aforesaid, from and after the date of this proclamation., In witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand, and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed., Done at the city of Washington, this tenth day of January, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred-and sixty-five, and of the independence of the United States of America the eighty-ninth., No principal report of yours on the Wilmington expedition has ever reached the War Department, as I am informed there., A preliminary report did reach here, but was returned to General Grant at his request., Of course, leave to publish cannot be given without inspection of the paper, and not then if it should be deemed to be detrimental to the public service., Yours asking leave to come to Washington is received., You have been summoned by the Committee on the Conduct of the War to attend here, which, of course, you will do., Yours announcing ordinance of emancipation received., Thanks to the convention and to you., When do you expect to be here?, Would be glad to have your suggestion as to supplying your place of military governor., It is represented to me that there is so much irregular violence in northern Missouri as to be driving away the people and almost depopulating it., Please gather information, and consider whether an appeal to the people there to go to their homes and let one another alone recognizing as a full right of protection for each that he lets others alone, and banning only him who refuses to let others alone may not enable you to withdraw the troops, their presence itself [being] a cause of irritation and constant apprehension, and thus restore peace and quiet, and returning prosperity., Please consider this and telegraph or write me., You having shown me Mr. Davis's letter to you of the twelfth instant, you may say to him that I have constantly been, am now, and shall continue, ready to receive any agent whom he or any other influential person now resisting the national authority may informally send to me with the view of securing peace to the people of our one common country., Please read and answer this letter as though I was not President, but only a friend., My son, now in his twenty-second year, having graduated at Harvard, wishes to see something of the war before it ends., I do not wish to put him in the ranks, nor yet to give him a commission, to which those who have already served long are better entitled and better qualified to hold., Could he, without embarrassment to you, or detriment to the service, go into your military family with some nominal rank, I, and not the public, furnishing his necessary means?, If no, say so without the least hesitation, because I am as anxious and as deeply interested that you shall not be encumbered as you can be yourself., If Mrs. Beattie, alias Mrs. Wolff, shall be sentenced to death, notify me, and postpone the execution till further order., You have a man in arrest for desertion passing by the name of Stanley., ...]"|3
98|"[Answer me on this., Complaint is made to me, by Vermont, that the assignment of her quota for the draft on the pending call is intrinsically unjust, and also in bad faith of the Government's promise to fairly allow credits for men previously furnished., To illustrate, a supposed case is stated as follows:  Vermont and New Hampshire must between them furnish six thousand men on the pending call; and being equal, each must furnish as many as the other in the long run., But the Government finds that on former calls Vermont furnished a surplus of five hundred, and New Hampshire a surplus, of fifteen hundred., These two surpluses making two thousand and added to the six thousand, making eight thousand to be furnished by the two States, or four thousand each less, by fair credits., Then subtract Vermont's surplus of five hundred from her four thousand, leaves three thousand five hundred as her quota on the pending call; and likewise subtract New Hampshire's surplus of fifteen hundred from her four thousand, leaves two thousand five hundred as her quota on the pending call., These three thousand five hundred and two thousand five hundred make precisely six thousand, which the supposed case requires from the two States, and it is just equal for Vermont to furnish one thousand more now than New Hampshire, because New Hampshire has heretofore furnished one thousand more than Vermont, which equalizes the burdens of the two in the long run., And this result, so far from being bad faith to Vermont, is indispensable to keeping good faith with New Hampshire., By no other result can the six thousand men be obtained from the two States, and, at the same time deal justly and keep faith with both, and we do but confuse ourselves in questioning the process by which the right result is reached., The supposed case is perfect as an illustration., The pending call is not for three hundred thousand men subject to fair credits, but is for three hundred thousand remaining after all fair credits have been deducted, and it is impossible to concede what Vermont asks without coming out short of three hundred thousand men, or making other localities pay for the partiality shown her., This upon the case stated., If there be different reasons for making an allowance to Vermont, let them be presented and considered., The joint resolution entitled ""Joint resolution declaring certain States not entitled to representation in the electoral college"" has been signed by the Executive in deference to the view of Congress implied in its passage and presentation to him., In his own view, however, the two Houses of Congress, convened under the twelfth article of the Constitution, have complete power to exclude from counting all electoral votes deemed by them to be illegal, and it is not competent for the Executive to defeat or obstruct that power by a veto, as would be the case if his action were at all essential in the matter., He disclaims all right of the Executive to interfere in any way in the matter of canvassing or counting electoral votes, and he also disclaims that by signing said resolution he has expressed any opinion on the recitals of the preamble or any judgment of his own upon the subject of the resolution., I am called on by the House of Representatives to give an account of my interview with Messrs. Stephens, Hunter, and Campbell, and it is very desirable to me to put your despatch of February 1, to the Secretary of War, in which, among other things, you say: ""I fear now their going back without any expression from any one in authority will have a bad influence."", I think the despatch does you credit, while I do not see that it can embarrass you., May I use it?, With deep gratitude to my countrymen for this mark of their confidence; with a distrust of my own ability to perform the duty required under the most favorable circumstances, and now rendered doubly difficult by existing national perils; yet with a firm reliance on the strength of our free government, and the eventual loyalty of the people to the just principles upon which it is founded, and above all with an unshaken faith in the Supreme Ruler of nations, I accept this trust., Be pleased to signify this to the respective Houses of Congress., In response to your resolution of the eighth instant, requesting information in relation to a conference recently held in Hampton Roads, I have the honor to state that on the day of the date I gave Francis P. Blair, Sr., a card, written on as follows, to wit:  Allow the bearer, F. P. Blair, Sr., to pass our lines, go South, and return., Your having shown me Mr. Davis's letter to you of the twelfth instant, you may say to him that I have constantly been, am now, and shall continue ready to receive any agent whom he or any other influential person now resisting the national authority may informally send to me with the view of securing peace to the people of our one common country., Afterwards Mr. Blair dictated for and authorized me to make an entry on the back of my retained copy of the letter last above recited, which entry is as follows:  To-day Mr. Blair tells me that on the twenty-first instant he delivered to Mr. Davis the original of which the within is a copy, and left it with him; that at the time of delivering it Mr. Davis read it over twice in Mr. Blair's presence, at the close of which he (Mr. Blair) remarked that the part about ""our one common country"" related to the part of Mr. Davis' letter about ""the two countries,"" to which Mr. Davis replied that he so understood it., Afterwards the Secretary of War placed in my hands the following telegram, indorsed by him, as appears:  You will proceed with the documents placed in your hands, and on reaching General Ord will deliver him the letter addressed to him by the Secretary of War; then, by General Ord's assistance, procure an interview with Messrs. Stephens, Hunter, and Campbell, or any of them., Deliver to him or them the paper on which your own letter is written., Note on the copy which you retain the time of delivery and to whom delivered., Receive their answer in writing, waiting a reasonable time for it, and which, if it contain their decision to come through without further condition, will be your warrant to ask General Ord to pass them through, as directed in the letter of the Secretary of War to him., If by their answer they decline to come, or propose other terms, do not have them pass through., And this being your whole duty, return and report to me., I am instructed by the President of the United States to place this paper in your hands, with the information that if you pass through the United States military lines it will be understood that you do so for the purpose of an informal conference on the basis of the letter a copy of which is on the reverse side of this sheet, and that if you choose to pass on such understanding, and so notify me in writing, I will procure the commanding general to pass you through the lines and to Fortress Monroe under such military precautions as he may deem prudent, and at which place you will be met in due time by some person or persons for the purpose of such informal conference; and, further, that you shall have protection, safe conduct, and safe return in all events., Your having shown me Mr. Davis's letter to you of the twelfth instant, you may say to him that I have constantly been, am now, and shall continue ready to receive any agent whom he or any other influential person now resisting the national authority may informally send to me with the view of securing peace to the people of our one common country., Afterwards, but before Major Eckert had departed, the following dispatch was received from General Grant:  This, it will be perceived, transferred General Ord's agency in the matter to General Grant., I resolved, however, to send Major Eckert forward with his message, and accordingly telegraphed General Grant as follows, to wit:  A messenger is coming to you on the business contained in your despatch., Detain the gentlemen in comfortable quarters until he arrives, and then act upon the message he brings as far as applicable, it having been made up to pass through General Ord's hands, and when the gentlemen were supposed to be beyond our lines., The President desires that you will please procure for the bearer, Major Thomas T. Eckert, an interview with Messrs. Stephens, Hunter, and Campbell, and if on his return to you he requests it pass them through our lines to Fortress Monroe by such route and under such military precautions as you may deem prudent, giving them protection and comfortable quarters while there, and that you let none of this have any effect upon your movements or plans., You will proceed to Fortress Monroe, Va., there to meet and informally confer with Messrs. Stephens, Hunter, and Campbell on the basis of my letter to F. P. Blair, Esq., of January 18, 1865, a copy of which you have., You will make known to them that three things are indispensable, to Wit:  1., The restoration of the national authority throughout all the States., 2., No receding by the Executive of the United States on the slavery question from the position assumed thereon in the late annual message to Congress and in preceding documents., 3., No cessation of hostilities short of an end of the war and the disbanding of all forces hostile to the Government., You will inform them that all propositions of theirs not inconsistent with the above will be considered and passed upon in a spirit of sincere liberality., You will hear all they may choose to say and report it to me., You will not assume to definitely consummate anything., On the day of its date the following telegram was sent to General Grant:  Let nothing which is transpiring change, hinder, or delay your military movements or plans., Call at Fortress Monroe and put yourself under direction of Mr. S., whom you will find there., Say to the gentlemen I will meet them personally at Fortress Monroe as soon as I can get there., Induced by a despatch from General Grant, I join you at Fort Monroe as soon as I can come., Before starting, the following despatch was shown me., I proceeded, nevertheless:  On the night of the 2nd I reached Hampton Roads, found the Secretary of State and Major Eckert on a steamer anchored offshore, and learned of them that the Richmond gentlemen were on another steamer also anchored offshore, in the Roads, and that the Secretary of State had not yet seen or communicated with them., I ascertained that Major Eckert had literally complied with his instructions, and I saw for the first time the answer of the Richmond gentlemen to him, which in his despatch to me of the 1st he characterizes as ""not satisfactory."", That answer is as follows, to wit:  On the morning of the third the three gentlemen, Messrs. Stephens, Hunter, and Campbell, came aboard of our steamer and had an interview with the Secretary of State and myself of several hours' duration., No question of preliminaries to the meeting was then and there made or mentioned; no other person was present; no papers were exchanged or produced; and it was in advance agreed that the conversation was to be informal and verbal merely., On our part the whole substance of the instructions to the Secretary of State hereinbefore recited was stated and insisted upon, and nothing was said inconsistent therewith; while by the other party it was not said that in any event or on any condition they ever would consent to reunion, and yet they equally omitted to declare that they never would consent., They seemed to desire a postponement of that question and the adoption of some other course first, which, as some of them seemed to argue, might or might not lead to reunion, but which course we thought would amount to an indefinite postponement., The conference ended without result., The foregoing, containing, as is believed, all the information sought is respectfully submitted., In answer to the resolution of the Senate of the eighth instant, requesting information concerning recent conversations or communications with insurgents, under executive sanction, I transmit a report from the Secretary of State, to whom the resolution was referred., The Secretary of State, to whom was referred a resolution of the Senate of the 8th instant, requesting ""the President of the United States, if, in his opinion, not incompatible with the public interests, to furnish to the Senate any information in his possession concerning recent conversations or communications with certain rebels, said to have taken place under executive sanction, including communications with the rebel Jefferson Davis, and any correspondence relating thereto,"" has the honor to report that the Senate may properly be referred to a special message of the President bearing upon the subject of the resolution, and transmitted to the House this day., Appended to this report is a copy of an instruction which has been addressed to Charles Francis Adams, Esq., envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary of the United States at London, and which is the only correspondence found in this department touching the subject referred to in the resolution., It is made my agreeable duty to enclose herewith the joint resolution approved 24th January, 1865, tendering the thanks of Congress to yourself, the officers and men under your command for their gallantry and good conduct in the capture of Fort Fisher, and through you to all who participated in that brilliant and decisive victory under your command., I understand that provost-marshals in different parts of Missouri are assuming to decide that the conditions of bonds are forfeited, and therefore are seizing and selling property to pay damages., This, if true, is both outrageous and ridiculous., Do not allow it., The courts, and not provost-marshals, are to decide such questions unless when military necessity makes an exception., Also excuse John Eaton, of Clay County, and Wesley Martin, of Platte, from being sent South, and let them go East if anywhere., While I cannot order as within requested, allow me to say that it is my wish for you to relieve the people from all burdens, harassments, and oppressions, so far as is possible consistently with your military necessities; that the object of the war being to restore and maintain the blessings of peace and good government, I desire you to help, and not hinder, every advance in that direction., Of your military necessities you must judge and execute, but please do so in the spirit and with the purpose above indicated., Yours of yesterday about provost-marshal system received., As part of the same subject, let me say I am now pressed in regard to a pending assessment in St. Louis County., Please examine and satisfy yourself whether this assessment should proceed or be abandoned; and if you decide that it is to proceed, please examine as to the propriety of its application to a gentleman by the name of Charles McLaran., Please ascertain whether General Fisk's administration is as good as it might be, and answer me., Whereas objects of interest to the United States require that the Senate should be convened at twelve o'clock on the fourth of March next to receive and act upon such communications as may be made to it on the part of the Executive;  Now, therefore, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States, have considered it to be my duty to issue this, my proclamation, declaring that an extraordinary occasion requires the Senate of the United States to convene for the transaction of business at the Capitol, in the city of Washington, on the fourth day of March next, at twelve o'clock at noon on that day, of which all who shall at that time be entitled to act as members of that body are hereby required to take notice., Chaplain Fitzgibbon yesterday sent me a despatch invoking Clemency for Jackson, Stewart, and Randall, who are to be shot to-day., The despatch is so vague that there is no means here of ascertaining whether or not the execution of sentence of one or more of them may not already have been ordered., If not suspend execution of sentence m their cases until further orders and forward records of trials for examination., I am in a little perplexity., I was induced to authorize a gentleman to bring Roger A. Pryor here with a view of effecting an exchange of him; but since then I have seen a despatch of yours showing that you specially object to his exchange., Meantime he has reached here and reported to me., It is an ungracious thing for me to send him back to prison, and yet inadmissible for him to remain here long., Cannot you help me out with it?, I can conceive that there may be difference to you in days, and I can keep him a few days to accommodate on that point., I have not heard of my son's reaching you., Please inquire and report to me whether there is any propriety of longer keeping in Gratiott Street Prison a man said to be there by the name of Riley Whiting., General Sheridan's despatch to you, of to-day, in which he says he ""will be off on Monday,"" and that he ""will leave behind about two thousand men,"" causes the Secretary of War and myself considerable anxiety., Have you well considered whether you do not again leave open the Shenandoah Valley entrance to Maryland and Pennsylvania, or, at least, to the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad?, Subsequent reflection, conference with General Halleck, your despatch, and one from General Sheridan, have relieved my anxiety; and so I beg that you will dismiss any concern you may have on my account, in the matter of my last despatch., Your statement to Major-General Hurlbut of the condition of the freedmen of your department, and of your success in the work of their moral and physical elevation, has reached me and given me much pleasure., That we shall be entirely successful in our efforts I firmly believe., The blessing of God and the efforts of good and faithful men will bring us an earlier and happier consummation than the most sanguine friends of the freedmen could reasonably expect., You have not sent contents of Richmond papers for Tuesday or Wednesday., Did you not receive them?, If not, does it indicate anything?, The President directs me to say to you that he wishes you to have no conference with General Lee unless it be for the capitulation of General Lee's army, or on some minor and purely military matter., He instructs me to say that you are not to decide, discuss, or confer upon any political question., Such questions the President holds in his own hands, and will submit them to no military conferences or conventions., Meantime you are to press to the utmost your military advantages., At this second appearing to take the oath of the presidential office there is less occasion for an extended address than there was at the first., ...]"|3
99|"[I have said now more than I intended, and will therefore bid you good-by., Whereas reliable information has been received that hostile Indians, within the limits of the United States, have been furnished with arms and munitions of war by persons dwelling in conterminous foreign territory, and are thereby enabled to prosecute their savage warfare upon the exposed and sparse settlements of the frontier;  Now, therefore, be it known that I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim and direct that all persons detected in that nefarious traffic shall be arrested and tried by court-martial at the nearest military post, and if convicted, shall receive the punishment due to their deserts., In witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand, and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed  I am unwilling for the sentence to stand, and be executed, to any extent in this case., In the absence of a more adequate motive than the evidence discloses, I am wholly unable to believe in the existence of criminal or fraudulent intent on the part of men of such well established good character., If the evidence went as far to establish a guilty profit of one or two hundred thousand dollars, as it does of one or two hundred dollars, the case would, on the question of guilt, bear a far different aspect., That on this contract, involving some twelve hundred thousand dollars, the contractors would plan, and attempt to execute a fraud which, at the most, could profit them only one or two hundred, or even one thousand dollars, is to my mind beyond the power of rational belief., That they did not, in such a case, make far greater gains, proves that they did not, with guilty or fraudulent intent, make at all., The judgment and sentence are disapproved, and declared null, and the defendants are fully discharged., Understanding that the plan of action for Missouri contained in your letter to the Governor of that State, and your other letter to me, is concurred in by the Governor, it is approved by me, and you will be sustained in proceeding upon it., Is it true that George W. Lane is detained at Norfolk without any charge against him?, And if so why is it done?, If you choose to go to New Mexico and reside, I will appoint you chief justice there., What say you?, Please answer., Seeing your despatch about General Crook, and fearing that through misapprehension something unpleasant may occur, I send you below two despatches of General Grant, which I suppose will fully explain General Crook's movements., Allow Mrs. R. S. Ewell the benefit of my amnesty proclamation on her taking the oath., Arrived here all safe about 9 P.M. yesterday., No war news., General Grant does not seem to know very much about Yeatman, but thinks very well of him so far as he does know., I like Mr. Whiting very much, and hence would wish him to remain or resign as best suits himself., Hearing this much from me, do as you think best in the matter., General Lee has sent the Russell letter back, concluding, as I understand from Grant, that their dignity does not admit of their receiving the document from us., Robert just now tells me there was a little rumpus up the line this morning, ending about where it began., I am here within five miles of the scene of this morning's action., I have nothing to add to what General Meade reports except that I have seen the prisoners myself and they look like there might be the number he states--1600., I approve your Fort Sumter programme., Grant don't seem to know Yeatman very well, but thinks very well of him so far as he knows., Thinks it probable that Y. is here now, for the place., I told you this yesterday as well as that you should do as you think best about Mr. Whiting's resignation, but I suppose you did not receive the dispatch., I am on the boat and have no later war news than went to you last night., Yours inclosing Fort Sumter order received., I think of but one suggestion., I feel quite confident that Sumter fell on the 13th, and not on the 14th of April, as you have it., It fell on Saturday, the 13th; the first call for troops on our part was got up on Sunday, the 14th, and given date and issued on Monday, the 15th., Look up the old almanac and other data, and see if I am not right., After your explanation, I think it is little or no difference whether the Fort Sumter ceremony takes place on the 13th or 14th., General Sherman tells me he is well acquainted with James Yeatman, and that he thinks him almost the best man in the country for anything he will undertake., I begin to feel that I ought to be at home and yet I dislike to leave without seeing nearer to the end of General Grant's present movement., He has now been out since yesterday morning and although he has not been diverted from his programme no considerable effort has yet been produced so far as we know here., Last night at 10.15 P. M. when it was dark as a rainy night without a moon could be, a furious cannonade soon joined in by a heavy musketry fire opened near Petersburg and lasted about two hours., The sound was very distinct here as also were the flashes of the guns up the clouds., It seemed to me a great battle, but the older hands here scarcely noticed it and sure enough this morning it was found that very little had been done., At 12.30 P.M. to-day General Grant telegraphed me as follows: ""There has been much hard fighting this morning., The enemy drove our left from near Dabney's house back well toward the Boydton plank road., We are now about to take the offensive at that point, and I hope will more than recover the lost ground."", Later he telegraphed again as follows:  ""Our troops, after being driven back to the Boydton plank road, turned and drove the enemy in turn, and took the White Oak road, which we now have., This gives us the ground occupied by the enemy this morning., I will send you a rebel flag captured by our troops in driving the enemy back., There have been four flags captured to-day."", Judging by the two points from which General Grant telegraphs, I infer that he moved his headquarters about one mile since he sent the first of the two despatches., Yours to Colonel Bowers about the Secretary of War is shown to me., He is not here, nor have I any notice that he is coming., I presume the mistake comes of the fact that the Secretary of State was here., He started back to Washington this morning., I have your two despatches of this morning, and am anxious to hear from Sheridan., I have had two despatches from General Grant since my last to you, but they contain little additional, except that Sheridan also had pretty hot work yesterday, that infantry was sent to his support during the night, and that he (Grant) has not since heard from Sheridan., Mrs. Lincoln has started home, and I will thank you to see that our coachman is at the Arsenal wharf at eight o'clock to-morrow morning, there to wait until she arrives., Despatch just received, showing that Sheridan, aided by Warren, had, at 2 P.M., pushed the enemy back, so as to retake the Five Forks and bring his own headquarters up to J. Boisseau's., The Five Forks were barricaded by the enemy and carried by Devin's division of cavalry., This part of the enemy seem to now be trying to work along the White Oak road, to join the main force in front of Grant, while Sheridan and Warren are pressing them as closely as possible., Yours showing Sheridan's success of to-day is just received and highly appreciated., Having no great deal to do here, I am still sending the substance of your despatches to the Secretary of War., Last night General Grant telegraphed that General Sheridan with his cavalry and the Fifth Corps had captured three brigades of infantry, a train of wagons, and several batteries, prisoners amounting to several thousand., This morning General Grant having ordered an attack along the whole line telegraphs as follows., Robert yesterday wrote a little cheerful note to Captain Penrose, which is all he has heard of him since you left., Last night General Grant telegraphed that General Sheridan, with his cavalry and the Fifth Corps, had captured three brigades of infantry, a train of wagons, and several batteries; the prisoners amounting to several thousand., This morning General Grant, having ordered an attack along the whole line, telegraphs as follows:  ""Both Wright and Parke got through the enemy's lines., The battle now rages furiously., General Sheridan, with his cavalry, the Fifth corps, and Miles's Division of the Second Corps, which was sent to him this morning, is now sweeping down from the west., ""All now looks highly favorable., General Ord is engaged, but I have not yet heard the result in his front."", Despatches are frequently coming in., All is going on finely., Generals Parke, Wright, and Ord's lines are extending from the Appomattox to Hatcher's Run., They have all broken through the enemy's intrenched lines, taking some forts, guns, and prisoners., Sheridan, with his own cavalry, the Fifth Corps, and part of the Second, is coming in from the west on the enemy's flank., Wright is already tearing up the Southside Railroad., ""Everything has been carried from the left of the Ninth Corps., The Sixth Corps alone captured more than three thousand prisoners., The Second and Twenty-fourth Corps captured forts, guns, and prisoners from the enemy, but I cannot tell the numbers., We are now closing around the works of the line immediately enveloping Petersburg., All looks remarkably well., I have not yet heard from Sheridan., His headquarters have been moved up to Banks's house, near the Boydton road, about three miles southwest of Petersburg."", At 4.30 P.M. to-day General Grant telegraphs that he has Petersburg completely enveloped from river below to river above, and has captured, since he started last Wednesday, about twelve thousand prisoners and fifty guns., He suggests that I shall go out and see him in the morning, which I think I will do., Tad and I are both well, and will be glad to see you and your party here at the time you name., Allow me to tender to you and all with you the nation's grateful thanks for this additional and magnificent success., At your kind suggestion I think I will meet you to-morrow., This morning Lieutenant-General Grant reports Petersburg evacuated, and he is confident that Richmond also is., He is pushing forward to cut off, if possible, the retreating rebel army., Yours received., Thanks for your caution, but I have already been to Petersburg., Staid with General Grant an hour and a half and returned here., It is certain now that Richmond is in our hands, and I think I will go there to-morrow., I will take care of myself., General Weitzel telegraphs from Richmond that of railroad stock he found there twenty-eight locomotives, forty-four passenger and baggage cars, and one hundred and six freight cars., At 3.30 this evening General Grant, from Sutherland's Station, ten miles from Petersburg toward Burkevllle, telegraphs as follows:  Yours of to-day received., I think there is no probability of my remaining here more than two days longer., If that is too long come down., ...]"|3
100|"[These twelve thousand persons are thus fully committed to the Union and to perpetuate freedom in the State--committed to the very things, and nearly all things, the nation wants--and they ask the nation's recognition and its assistance to make good this committal., Now, if we reject and spurn them, we do our utmost to disorganize and disperse them., We, in fact, say to the white man: You are worthless or worse; we will neither help you nor be helped by you., To the blacks we say: This cup of liberty which these, your old masters, held to your lips, we will dash from you, and leave you to the chances of gathering the spilled and scattered contents in some vague and undefined when, where, and how., If this course, discouraging and paralyzing both white and black, has any tendency to bring Louisiana into proper practical relations with the Union, I have so far been unable to perceive it., If, on the contrary, we recognize and sustain the new government of Louisiana, the converse of all this is made true., We encourage the hearts and nerve the arms of twelve thousand to adhere to their work, and argue for it, and proselyte for it, and fight for it, and feed it, and grow it, and ripen it to a complete success., The colored man, too, in seeing all united for him, is inspired with vigilance, and energy, and daring to the same end., Grant that he desires the elective franchise, will he not attain it sooner by saving the already advanced steps towards it, than by running backward over them?, Concede that the new government of Louisiana is only to what it should be as the egg is to the fowl, we shall sooner have the fowl by hatching the egg than by smashing it., Again, if we reject Louisiana, we also reject one vote in favor of the proposed amendment to the National Constitution., To meet this proposition, it has been argued that no more than three fourths of those States which have not attempted secession are necessary to validly ratify the amendment., I do not commit myself against this, further than to say that such a ratification would be questionable, and sure to be persistently questioned, while a ratification by three fourths of all the States would be unquestioned and unquestionable., I repeat the question, Can Louisiana be brought into proper practical relation with the Union sooner by sustaining or by discarding her new State government?, What has been said of Louisiana will apply to other States., And yet so great peculiarities pertain to each State, and such important and sudden changes occur in the same State, and withal so new and unprecedented is the whole case, that no exclusive and inflexible plan can safely be prescribed as to details and collaterals., Such exclusive and inflexible plan would surely become a new entanglement., Important principles may and must be inflexible., In the present situation as the phrase goes, it may be my duty to make some new announcement to the people of the South., I am considering, and shall not fail to act, when satisfied that action will be proper., I have seen your despatch to Colonel Hardie about the matter of prayers., I do not remember hearing prayers spoken of while I was in Richmond; but I have no doubt you have acted in what appeared to you to be the spirit and temper manifested by me while there., Is there any sign of the rebel legislature coming together on the understanding of my letter to you?, If there is any such sign, inform me what it is; if there is no such sign, you may withdraw the offer., I have just seen Judge Campbell's letter to you of the 7th., He assumes, as appears to me, that I have called the insurgent legislature of Virginia together, as the rightful legislature of the State, to settle all differences with the United States., I have done no such thing., I spoke of them, not as a legislature, but as ""the gentlemen who have acted as the legislature of Virginia in support of the rebellion."", I did this on purpose to exclude the assumption that I was recognizing them as a rightful body., I deal with them as men having power de facto to do a specific thing, to wit: ""To withdraw the Virginia troops and other support from resistance to the General Government,"" for which, in the paper handed Judge Campbell, I promised a specific equivalent, to wit: a remission to the people of the State, except in certain cases, of the confiscation of their property., I meant this, and no more., Inasmuch, however, as Judge Campbell misconstrues this, and is still pressing for an armistice, contrary to the explicit statement of the paper I gave him, and particularly as General Grant has since captured the Virginia troops, so that giving a consideration for their withdrawal is no longer applicable, let my letter to you and the paper to Judge Campbell both be withdrawn, or countermanded, and he be notified of it., Do not now allow them to assemble, but if any have come, allow them safe return to their homes., Mr. Colfax, I want you to take a message from me to the miners whom you visit., I have very large ideas of the mineral wealth of our nation., I believe it practically inexhaustible., It abounds all over the Western country, from the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific, and its development has scarcely commenced., During the war, when we were adding a couple of millions of dollars every day to our national debt, I did not care about encouraging the increase in the volume of our precious metals., We had the country to save first., But now that the rebellion is overthrown, and we know pretty nearly the amount of our national debt, the more gold and silver we mine, we make the payment of that debt so much the easier., ""Now,"" said he, speaking with more emphasis, ""I am going to encourage that in every possible way., We shall have hundreds of thousands of disbanded soldiers, and many have feared that their return home in such great numbers might paralyze industry, by furnishing, suddenly, a greater supply of labor than there will be demand for., I am going to try to attract them to the hidden wealth of our mountain ranges, where there is room enough for all., Immigration, which even the war has not stopped, will land upon our shores hundreds of thousands more per year from overcrowded Europe., I intend to point them to the gold and silver that wait for them in the West., Tell the miners for me, that I shall promote their interests to the utmost of my ability; because their prosperity is the prosperity of the nation; and,"" said he, his eye kindling with enthusiasm, ""we shall prove, in a very few years, that we are indeed the treasury of the world."", I intend to adopt the advice of my friends and use due precaution...., I thank you for the assurance you give me that I shall be supported by conservative men like yourself, in the efforts I may make to restore the Union, so as to make it, to use your language, a Union of hearts and hands as well as of States., Allow Mr. Ashmer and friend to come in at 9 A.M. to-morrow.   ]"|3
