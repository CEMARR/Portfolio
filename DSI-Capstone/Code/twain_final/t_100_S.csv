0|"[This book is a record of a pleasure trip., If it were a record of a solemn scientific expedition, it would have about it that gravity, that profundity, and that impressive incomprehensibility which are so proper to works of that kind, and withal so attractive., Yet notwithstanding it is only a record of a pic-nic, it has a purpose, which is to suggest to the reader how he would be likely to see Europe and the East if he looked at them with his own eyes instead of the eyes of those who traveled in those countries before him., I make small pretense of showing anyone how he ought to look at objects of interest beyond the sea--other books do that, and therefore, even if I were competent to do it, there is no need., I offer no apologies for any departures from the usual style of travel-writing that may be charged against me--for I think I have seen with impartial eyes, and I am sure I have written at least honestly, whether wisely or not., In this volume I have used portions of letters which I wrote for the Daily Alta California, of San Francisco, the proprietors of that journal having waived their rights and given me the necessary permission., I have also inserted portions of several letters written for the New York Tribune and the New York Herald., For months the great pleasure excursion to Europe and the Holy Land was chatted about in the newspapers everywhere in America and discussed at countless firesides., It was a novelty in the way of excursions--its like had not been thought of before, and it compelled that interest which attractive novelties always command., It was to be a picnic on a gigantic scale., The participants in it, instead of freighting an ungainly steam ferry--boat with youth and beauty and pies and doughnuts, and paddling up some obscure creek to disembark upon a grassy lawn and wear themselves out with a long summer day's laborious frolicking under the impression that it was fun, were to sail away in a great steamship with flags flying and cannon pealing, and take a royal holiday beyond the broad ocean in many a strange clime and in many a land renowned in history!, They were to sail for months over the breezy Atlantic and the sunny Mediterranean; they were to scamper about the decks by day, filling the ship with shouts and laughter--or read novels and poetry in the shade of the smokestacks, or watch for the jelly-fish and the nautilus over the side, and the shark, the whale, and other strange monsters of the deep; and at night they were to dance in the open air, on the upper deck, in the midst of a ballroom that stretched from horizon to horizon, and was domed by the bending heavens and lighted by no meaner lamps than the stars and the magnificent moon--dance, and promenade, and smoke, and sing, and make love, and search the skies for constellations that never associate with the ""Big Dipper"" they were so tired of; and they were to see the ships of twenty navies--the customs and costumes of twenty curious peoples--the great cities of half a world--they were to hob-nob with nobility and hold friendly converse with kings and princes, grand moguls, and the anointed lords of mighty empires!, It was a brave conception; it was the offspring of a most ingenious brain., It was well advertised, but it hardly needed it: the bold originality, the extraordinary character, the seductive nature, and the vastness of the enterprise provoked comment everywhere and advertised it in every household in the land., Who could read the program of the excursion without longing to make one of the party?, I will insert it here., It is almost as good as a map., As a text for this book, nothing could be better:  What was there lacking about that program to make it perfectly irresistible?, Nothing that any finite mind could discover., Paris, England, Scotland, Switzerland, Italy--Garibaldi!, The Grecian Archipelago!, Vesuvius!, Constantinople!, Smyrna!, The Holy Land!, Egypt and ""our friends the Bermudians""!, People in Europe desiring to join the excursion--contagious sickness to be avoided--boating at the expense of the ship--physician on board--the circuit of the globe to be made if the passengers unanimously desired it--the company to be rigidly selected by a pitiless ""Committee on Applications""--the vessel to be as rigidly selected by as pitiless a ""Committee on Selecting Steamer."", Human nature could not withstand these bewildering temptations., I hurried to the treasurer's office and deposited my ten percent., I rejoiced to know that a few vacant staterooms were still left., I did avoid a critical personal examination into my character by that bowelless committee, but I referred to all the people of high standing I could think of in the community who would be least likely to know anything about me., Shortly a supplementary program was issued which set forth that the Plymouth Collection of Hymns would be used on board the ship., I then paid the balance of my passage money., I was provided with a receipt and duly and officially accepted as an excursionist., There was happiness in that but it was tame compared to the novelty of being ""select."", This supplementary program also instructed the excursionists to provide themselves with light musical instruments for amusement in the ship, with saddles for Syrian travel, green spectacles and umbrellas, veils for Egypt, and substantial clothing to use in rough pilgrimizing in the Holy Land., Furthermore, it was suggested that although the ship's library would afford a fair amount of reading matter, it would still be well if each passenger would provide himself with a few guidebooks, a Bible, and some standard works of travel., A list was appended, which consisted chiefly of books relating to the Holy Land, since the Holy Land was part of the excursion and seemed to be its main feature., Reverend Henry Ward Beecher was to have accompanied the expedition, but urgent duties obliged him to give up the idea., There were other passengers who could have been spared better and would have been spared more willingly., Lieutenant General Sherman was to have been of the party also, but the Indian war compelled his presence on the plains., A popular actress had entered her name on the ship's books, but something interfered and she couldn't go., The ""Drummer Boy of the Potomac"" deserted, and lo, we had never a celebrity left!, However, we were to have a ""battery of guns"" from the Navy Department (as per advertisement) to be used in answering royal salutes; and the document furnished by the Secretary of the Navy, which was to make ""General Sherman and party"" welcome guests in the courts and camps of the old world, was still left to us, though both document and battery, I think, were shorn of somewhat of their original august proportions., However, had not we the seductive program still, with its Paris, its Constantinople, Smyrna, Jerusalem, Jericho, and ""our friends the Bermudians?"", What did we care?, Occasionally, during the following month, I dropped in at 117 Wall Street to inquire how the repairing and refurnishing of the vessel was coming on, how additions to the passenger list were averaging, how many people the committee were decreeing not ""select"" every day and banishing in sorrow and tribulation., I was glad to know that we were to have a little printing press on board and issue a daily newspaper of our own., I was glad to learn that our piano, our parlor organ, and our melodeon were to be the best instruments of the kind that could be had in the market., I was proud to observe that among our excursionists were three ministers of the gospel, eight doctors, sixteen or eighteen ladies, several military and naval chieftains with sounding titles, an ample crop of ""Professors"" of various kinds, and a gentleman who had ""COMMISSIONER OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA TO EUROPE, ASIA, AND AFRICA"" thundering after his name in one awful blast!, I had carefully prepared myself to take rather a back seat in that ship because of the uncommonly select material that would alone be permitted to pass through the camel's eye of that committee on credentials; I had schooled myself to expect an imposing array of military and naval heroes and to have to set that back seat still further back in consequence of it maybe; but I state frankly that I was all unprepared for this crusher., I fell under that titular avalanche a torn and blighted thing., I said that if that potentate must go over in our ship, why, I supposed he must --but that to my thinking, when the United States considered it necessary to send a dignitary of that tonnage across the ocean, it would be in better taste, and safer, to take him apart and cart him over in sections in several ships., Ah, if I had only known then that he was only a common mortal, and that his mission had nothing more overpowering about it than the collecting of seeds and uncommon yams and extraordinary cabbages and peculiar bullfrogs for that poor, useless, innocent, mildewed old fossil the Smithsonian Institute, I would have felt so much relieved., During that memorable month I basked in the happiness of being for once in my life drifting with the tide of a great popular movement., Everybody was going to Europe--I, too, was going to Europe., Everybody was going to the famous Paris Exposition--I, too, was going to the Paris Exposition., The steamship lines were carrying Americans out of the various ports of the country at the rate of four or five thousand a week in the aggregate., If I met a dozen individuals during that month who were not going to Europe shortly, I have no distinct remembrance of it now., I walked about the city a good deal with a young Mr.  Blucher, who was booked for the excursion., He was confiding, good-natured, unsophisticated, companionable; but he was not a man to set the river on fire., He had the most extraordinary notions about this European exodus and came at last to consider the whole nation as packing up for emigration to France., We stepped into a store on Broadway one day, where he bought a handkerchief, and when the man could not make change, Mr. B. said:  ""Never mind, I'll hand it to you in Paris."", ""But I am not going to Paris."", ""How is--what did I understand you to say?"", ""I said I am not going to Paris."", ""Not going to Paris!, Not g---- well, then, where in the nation are you going to?"", ""Nowhere at all."", ""Not anywhere whatsoever?--not any place on earth but this?"", ""Not any place at all but just this--stay here all summer."", My comrade took his purchase and walked out of the store without a word --walked out with an injured look upon his countenance., Up the street apiece he broke silence and said impressively: ""It was a lie--that is my opinion of it!"", In the fullness of time the ship was ready to receive her passengers., I was introduced to the young gentleman who was to be my roommate, and found him to be intelligent, cheerful of spirit, unselfish, full of generous impulses, patient, considerate, and wonderfully good-natured., Not any passenger that sailed in the Quaker City will withhold his endorsement of what I have just said., We selected a stateroom forward of the wheel, on the starboard side, ""below decks."", It bad two berths in it, a dismal dead-light, a sink with a washbowl in it, and a long, sumptuously cushioned locker, which was to do service as a sofa--partly --and partly as a hiding place for our things., Notwithstanding all this furniture, there was still room to turn around in, but not to swing a cat in, at least with entire security to the cat., However, the room was large, for a ship's stateroom, and was in every way satisfactory., The vessel was appointed to sail on a certain Saturday early in June., A little after noon on that distinguished Saturday I reached the ship and went on board., All was bustle and confusion., [I have seen that remark before somewhere.], The pier was crowded with carriages and men; passengers were arriving and hurrying on board; the vessel's decks were encumbered with trunks and valises; groups of excursionists, arrayed in unattractive traveling costumes, were moping about in a drizzling rain and looking as droopy and woebegone as so many molting chickens., The gallant flag was up, but it was under the spell, too, and hung limp and disheartened by the mast., Altogether, it was the bluest, bluest spectacle!, It was a pleasure excursion--there was no gainsaying that, because the program said so--it was so nominated in the bond--but it surely hadn't the general aspect of one., Finally, above the banging, and rumbling, and shouting, and hissing of steam rang the order to ""cast off!"", --a sudden rush to the gangways--a scampering ashore of visitors-a revolution of the wheels, and we were off--the pic-nic was begun!, Two very mild cheers went up from the dripping crowd on the pier; we answered them gently from the slippery decks; the flag made an effort to wave, and failed; the ""battery of guns"" spake not--the ammunition was out., We steamed down to the foot of the harbor and came to anchor., It was still raining., And not only raining, but storming., ""Outside"" we could see, ourselves, that there was a tremendous sea on., We must lie still, in the calm harbor, till the storm should abate., Our passengers hailed from fifteen states; only a few of them had ever been to sea before; manifestly it would not do to pit them against a full-blown tempest until they had got their sea-legs on., Toward evening the two steam tugs that had accompanied us with a rollicking champagne-party of young New Yorkers on board who wished to bid farewell to one of our number in due and ancient form departed, and we were alone on the deep., On deep five fathoms, and anchored fast to the bottom., And out in the solemn rain, at that., ...]"|1
1|"[I discovered that if I were to stay there a month, I should still find myself looking at the people instead of the inanimate objects on exhibition., I got a little interested in some curious old tapestries of the thirteenth century, but a party of Arabs came by, and their dusky faces and quaint costumes called my attention away at once., I watched a silver swan, which had a living grace about his movements and a living intelligence in his eyes--watched him swimming about as comfortably and as unconcernedly as if he had been born in a morass instead of a jeweler's shop--watched him seize a silver fish from under the water and hold up his head and go through all the customary and elaborate motions of swallowing it--but the moment it disappeared down his throat some tattooed South Sea Islanders approached and I yielded to their attractions., Presently I found a revolving pistol several hundred years old which looked strangely like a modern Colt, but just then I heard that the Empress of the French was in another part of the building, and hastened away to see what she might look like., We heard martial music--we saw an unusual number of soldiers walking hurriedly about--there was a general movement among the people., We inquired what it was all about and learned that the Emperor of the French and the Sultan of Turkey were about to review twenty-five thousand troops at the Arc de l'Etoile., We immediately departed., I had a greater anxiety to see these men than I could have had to see twenty expositions., We drove away and took up a position in an open space opposite the American minister's house., A speculator bridged a couple of barrels with a board and we hired standing places on it., Presently there was a sound of distant music; in another minute a pillar of dust came moving slowly toward us; a moment more and then, with colors flying and a grand crash of military music, a gallant array of cavalrymen emerged from the dust and came down the street on a gentle trot., After them came a long line of artillery; then more cavalry, in splendid uniforms; and then their imperial majesties Napoleon III and Abdul Aziz., The vast concourse of people swung their hats and shouted--the windows and housetops in the wide vicinity burst into a snowstorm of waving handkerchiefs, and the wavers of the same mingled their cheers with those of the masses below., It was a stirring spectacle., But the two central figures claimed all my attention., Was ever such a contrast set up before a multitude till then?, Napoleon in military uniform--a long-bodied, short-legged man, fiercely moustached, old, wrinkled, with eyes half closed, and such a deep, crafty, scheming expression about them!--Napoleon, bowing ever so gently to the loud plaudits, and watching everything and everybody with his cat eyes from under his depressed hat brim, as if to discover any sign that those cheers were not heartfelt and cordial., Abdul Aziz, absolute lord of the Ottoman empire--clad in dark green European clothes, almost without ornament or insignia of rank; a red Turkish fez on his head; a short, stout, dark man, black-bearded, black-eyed, stupid, unprepossessing--a man whose whole appearance somehow suggested that if he only had a cleaver in his hand and a white apron on, one would not be at all surprised to hear him say: ""A mutton roast today, or will you have a nice porterhouse steak?"", Napoleon III, the representative of the highest modern civilization, progress, and refinement; Abdul-Aziz, the representative of a people by nature and training filthy, brutish, ignorant, unprogressive, superstitious--and a government whose Three Graces are Tyranny, Rapacity, Blood., Here in brilliant Paris, under this majestic Arch of Triumph, the First Century greets the Nineteenth!, NAPOLEON III., Emperor of France!, Surrounded by shouting thousands, by military pomp, by the splendors of his capital city, and companioned by kings and princes--this is the man who was sneered at and reviled and called Bastard--yet who was dreaming of a crown and an empire all the while; who was driven into exile--but carried his dreams with him; who associated with the common herd in America and ran foot races for a wager--but still sat upon a throne in fancy; who braved every danger to go to his dying mother--and grieved that she could not be spared to see him cast aside his plebeian vestments for the purple of royalty; who kept his faithful watch and walked his weary beat a common policeman of London--but dreamed the while of a coming night when he should tread the long-drawn corridors of the Tuileries; who made the miserable fiasco of Strasbourg; saw his poor, shabby eagle, forgetful of its lesson, refuse to perch upon his shoulder; delivered his carefully prepared, sententious burst of eloquence upon unsympathetic ears; found himself a prisoner, the butt of small wits, a mark for the pitiless ridicule of all the world --yet went on dreaming of coronations and splendid pageants as before; who lay a forgotten captive in the dungeons of Ham--and still schemed and planned and pondered over future glory and future power; President of France at last!, a coup d'etat, and surrounded by applauding armies, welcomed by the thunders of cannon, he mounts a throne and waves before an astounded world the sceptre of a mighty empire!, Who talks of the marvels of fiction?, Who speaks of the wonders of romance?, Who prates of the tame achievements of Aladdin and the Magii of Arabia?, ABDUL-AZIZ, Sultan of Turkey, Lord of the Ottoman Empire!, Born to a throne; weak, stupid, ignorant, almost, as his meanest slave; chief of a vast royalty, yet the puppet of his Premier and the obedient child of a tyrannical mother; a man who sits upon a throne--the beck of whose finger moves navies and armies--who holds in his hands the power of life and death over millions--yet who sleeps, sleeps, eats, eats, idles with his eight hundred concubines, and when he is surfeited with eating and sleeping and idling, and would rouse up and take the reins of government and threaten to be a sultan, is charmed from his purpose by wary Fuad Pacha with a pretty plan for a new palace or a new ship--charmed away with a new toy, like any other restless child; a man who sees his people robbed and oppressed by soulless tax-gatherers, but speaks no word to save them; who believes in gnomes and genii and the wild fables of The Arabian Nights, but has small regard for the mighty magicians of to-day, and is nervous in the presence of their mysterious railroads and steamboats and telegraphs; who would see undone in Egypt all that great Mehemet Ali achieved, and would prefer rather to forget than emulate him; a man who found his great empire a blot upon the earth--a degraded, poverty-stricken, miserable, infamous agglomeration of ignorance, crime, and brutality--and will idle away the allotted days of his trivial life and then pass to the dust and the worms and leave it so!, Napoleon has augmented the commercial prosperity of France in ten years to such a degree that figures can hardly compute it., He has rebuilt Paris and has partly rebuilt every city in the state., He condemns a whole street at a time, assesses the damages, pays them, and rebuilds superbly., Then speculators buy up the ground and sell, but the original owner is given the first choice by the government at a stated price before the speculator is permitted to purchase., But above all things, he has taken the sole control of the empire of France into his hands and made it a tolerably free land--for people who will not attempt to go too far in meddling with government affairs., No country offers greater security to life and property than France, and one has all the freedom he wants, but no license--no license to interfere with anybody or make anyone uncomfortable., As for the Sultan, one could set a trap any where and catch a dozen abler men in a night., The bands struck up, and the brilliant adventurer, Napoleon III., the genius of Energy, Persistence, Enterprise; and the feeble Abdul-Aziz, the genius of Ignorance, Bigotry, and Indolence, prepared for the Forward --March!, We saw the splendid review, we saw the white-moustached old Crimean soldier, Canrobert, Marshal of France, we saw--well, we saw every thing, and then we went home satisfied., We went to see the Cathedral of Notre Dame., We had heard of it before., It surprises me sometimes to think how much we do know and how intelligent we are., We recognized the brown old Gothic pile in a moment; it was like the pictures., We stood at a little distance and changed from one point of observation to another and gazed long at its lofty square towers and its rich front, clustered thick with stony, mutilated saints who had been looking calmly down from their perches for ages., The Patriarch of Jerusalem stood under them in the old days of chivalry and romance, and preached the third Crusade, more than six hundred years ago; and since that day they have stood there and looked quietly down upon the most thrilling scenes, the grandest pageants, the most extraordinary spectacles that have grieved or delighted Paris., These battered and broken-nosed old fellows saw many and many a cavalcade of mail-clad knights come marching home from Holy Land; they heard the bells above them toll the signal for the St. Bartholomew's Massacre, and they saw the slaughter that followed; later they saw the Reign of Terror, the carnage of the Revolution, the overthrow of a king, the coronation of two Napoleons, the christening of the young prince that lords it over a regiment of servants in the Tuileries to-day--and they may possibly continue to stand there until they see the Napoleon dynasty swept away and the banners of a great republic floating above its ruins., I wish these old parties could speak., They could tell a tale worth the listening to., They say that a pagan temple stood where Notre Dame now stands, in the old Roman days, eighteen or twenty centuries ago--remains of it are still preserved in Paris; and that a Christian church took its place about A.D. 300; another took the place of that in A.D. 500; and that the foundations of the present cathedral were laid about A.D. 1100., The ground ought to be measurably sacred by this time, one would think., One portion of this noble old edifice is suggestive of the quaint fashions of ancient times., It was built by Jean Sans-Peur, Duke of Burgundy, to set his conscience at rest--he had assassinated the Duke of Orleans., Alas!, Those good old times are gone when a murderer could wipe the stain from his name and soothe his troubles to sleep simply by getting out his bricks and mortar and building an addition to a church., The portals of the great western front are bisected by square pillars., They took the central one away in 1852, on the occasion of thanksgivings for the reinstitution of the presidential power--but precious soon they had occasion to reconsider that motion and put it back again!, And they did., We loitered through the grand aisles for an hour or two, staring up at the rich stained-glass windows embellished with blue and yellow and crimson saints and martyrs, and trying to admire the numberless great pictures in the chapels, and then we were admitted to the sacristy and shown the magnificent robes which the Pope wore when he crowned Napoleon I; a wagon-load of solid gold and silver utensils used in the great public processions and ceremonies of the church; some nails of the true cross, a fragment of the cross itself, a part of the crown of thorns., We had already seen a large piece of the true cross in a church in the Azores, but no nails., They showed us likewise the bloody robe which that archbishop of Paris wore who exposed his sacred person and braved the wrath of the insurgents of 1848, to mount the barricades and hold aloft the olive branch of peace in the hope of stopping the slaughter., His noble effort cost him his life., He was shot dead., They showed us a cast of his face taken after death, the bullet that killed him, and the two vertebrae in which it lodged., These people have a somewhat singular taste in the matter of relics., Ferguson told us that the silver cross which the good archbishop wore at his girdle was seized and thrown into the Seine, where it lay embedded in the mud for fifteen years, and then an angel appeared to a priest and told him where to dive for it; he did dive for it and got it, and now it is there on exhibition at Notre Dame, to be inspected by anybody who feels an interest in inanimate objects of miraculous intervention., Next we went to visit the Morgue, that horrible receptacle for the dead who die mysteriously and leave the manner of their taking off a dismal secret., We stood before a grating and looked through into a room which was hung all about with the clothing of dead men; coarse blouses, water-soaked; the delicate garments of women and children; patrician vestments, hacked and stabbed and stained with red; a hat that was crushed and bloody., On a slanting stone lay a drowned man, naked, swollen, purple; clasping the fragment of a broken bush with a grip which death had so petrified that human strength could not unloose it --mute witness of the last despairing effort to save the life that was doomed beyond all help., A stream of water trickled ceaselessly over the hideous face., We knew that the body and the clothing were there for identification by friends, but still we wondered if anybody could love that repulsive object or grieve for its loss., We grew meditative and wondered if, some forty years ago, when the mother of that ghastly thing was dandling it upon her knee, and kissing it and petting it and displaying it with satisfied pride to the passers-by, a prophetic vision of this dread ending ever flitted through her brain., I half feared that the mother, or the wife or a brother of the dead man might come while we stood there, but nothing of the kind occurred., Men and women came, and some looked eagerly in and pressed their faces against the bars; others glanced carelessly at the body and turned away with a disappointed look --people, I thought, who live upon strong excitements and who attend the exhibitions of the Morgue regularly, just as other people go to see theatrical spectacles every night., When one of these looked in and passed on, I could not help thinking--  ""Now this don't afford you any satisfaction--a party with his head shot off is what you need."", One night we went to the celebrated Jardin Mabille, but only staid a little while., We wanted to see some of this kind of Paris life, however, and therefore the next night we went to a similar place of entertainment in a great garden in the suburb of Asnieres., We went to the railroad depot, toward evening, and Ferguson got tickets for a second-class carriage., Such a perfect jam of people I have not often seen--but there was no noise, no disorder, no rowdyism., Some of the women and young girls that entered the train we knew to be of the demi-monde, but others we were not at all sure about., The girls and women in our carriage behaved themselves modestly and becomingly all the way out, except that they smoked., When we arrived at the garden in Asnieres, we paid a franc or two admission and entered a place which had flower beds in it, and grass plots, and long, curving rows of ornamental shrubbery, with here and there a secluded bower convenient for eating ice cream in., We moved along the sinuous gravel walks, with the great concourse of girls and young men, and suddenly a domed and filigreed white temple, starred over and over and over again with brilliant gas jets, burst upon us like a fallen sun., Nearby was a large, handsome house with its ample front illuminated in the same way, and above its roof floated the Star-Spangled Banner of America., ""Well!"", I said., ""How is this?"", It nearly took my breath away., Ferguson said an American--a New Yorker--kept the place, and was carrying on quite a stirring opposition to the Jardin Mabille., Crowds composed of both sexes and nearly all ages were frisking about the garden or sitting in the open air in front of the flagstaff and the temple, drinking wine and coffee or smoking., The dancing had not begun yet., Ferguson said there was to be an exhibition., The famous Blondin was going to perform on a tightrope in another part of the garden., We went thither., Here the light was dim, and the masses of people were pretty closely packed together., And now I made a mistake which any donkey might make, but a sensible man never., I committed an error which I find myself repeating every day of my life., Standing right before a young lady, I said:  ""Dan, just look at this girl, how beautiful she is!"", ""I thank you more for the evident sincerity of the compliment, sir, than for the extraordinary publicity you have given to it!"", This in good, pure English., We took a walk, but my spirits were very, very sadly dampened., I did not feel right comfortable for some time afterward., Why will people be so stupid as to suppose themselves the only foreigners among a crowd of ten thousand persons?, ...]"|1
2|"[I speak now, of course, in the supposition that the gentle reader has not been abroad, and therefore is not already a consummate ass., If the case be otherwise, I beg his pardon and extend to him the cordial hand of fellowship and call him brother., I shall always delight to meet an ass after my own heart when I shall have finished my travels., On this subject let me remark that there are Americans abroad in Italy who have actually forgotten their mother tongue in three months--forgot it in France., They can not even write their address in English in a hotel register., I append these evidences, which I copied verbatim from the register of a hotel in a certain Italian city:  I love this sort of people., A lady passenger of ours tells of a fellow-citizen of hers who spent eight weeks in Paris and then returned home and addressed his dearest old bosom friend Herbert as Mr., ""Er-bare!"", He apologized, though, and said, ""'Pon my soul it is aggravating, but I cahn't help it--I have got so used to speaking nothing but French, my dear Erbare--damme there it goes again!--got so used to French pronunciation that I cahn't get rid of it--it is positively annoying, I assure you."", This entertaining idiot, whose name was Gordon, allowed himself to be hailed three times in the street before he paid any attention, and then begged a thousand pardons and said he had grown so accustomed to hearing himself addressed as ""M'sieu Gor-r-dong,"" with a roll to the r, that he had forgotten the legitimate sound of his name!, He wore a rose in his button-hole; he gave the French salutation--two flips of the hand in front of the face; he called Paris Pairree in ordinary English conversation; he carried envelopes bearing foreign postmarks protruding from his breast-pocket; he cultivated a moustache and imperial, and did what else he could to suggest to the beholder his pet fancy that he resembled Louis Napoleon--and in a spirit of thankfulness which is entirely unaccountable, considering the slim foundation there was for it, he praised his Maker that he was as he was, and went on enjoying his little life just the same as if he really had been deliberately designed and erected by the great Architect of the Universe., Think of our Whitcombs, and our Ainsworths and our Williamses writing themselves down in dilapidated French in foreign hotel registers!, We laugh at Englishmen, when we are at home, for sticking so sturdily to their national ways and customs, but we look back upon it from abroad very forgivingly., It is not pleasant to see an American thrusting his nationality forward obtrusively in a foreign land, but Oh, it is pitiable to see him making of himself a thing that is neither male nor female, neither fish, flesh, nor fowl--a poor, miserable, hermaphrodite Frenchman!, Among a long list of churches, art galleries, and such things, visited by us in Venice, I shall mention only one--the church of Santa Maria dei Frari., It is about five hundred years old, I believe, and stands on twelve hundred thousand piles., In it lie the body of Canova and the heart of Titian, under magnificent monuments., Titian died at the age of almost one hundred years., A plague which swept away fifty thousand lives was raging at the time, and there is notable evidence of the reverence in which the great painter was held, in the fact that to him alone the state permitted a public funeral in all that season of terror and death., In this church, also, is a monument to the doge Foscari, whose name a once resident of Venice, Lord Byron, has made permanently famous., The monument to the doge Giovanni Pesaro, in this church, is a curiosity in the way of mortuary adornment., It is eighty feet high and is fronted like some fantastic pagan temple., Against it stand four colossal Nubians, as black as night, dressed in white marble garments., The black legs are bare, and through rents in sleeves and breeches, the skin, of shiny black marble, shows., The artist was as ingenious as his funeral designs were absurd., There are two bronze skeletons bearing scrolls, and two great dragons uphold the sarcophagus., On high, amid all this grotesqueness, sits the departed doge., In the conventual buildings attached to this church are the state archives of Venice., We did not see them, but they are said to number millions of documents., ""They are the records of centuries of the most watchful, observant and suspicious government that ever existed--in which every thing was written down and nothing spoken out."", They fill nearly three hundred rooms., Among them are manuscripts from the archives of nearly two thousand families, monasteries and convents., The secret history of Venice for a thousand years is here--its plots, its hidden trials, its assassinations, its commissions of hireling spies and masked bravoes--food, ready to hand, for a world of dark and mysterious romances., Yes, I think we have seen all of Venice., We have seen, in these old churches, a profusion of costly and elaborate sepulchre ornamentation such as we never dreampt of before., We have stood in the dim religious light of these hoary sanctuaries, in the midst of long ranks of dusty monuments and effigies of the great dead of Venice, until we seemed drifting back, back, back, into the solemn past, and looking upon the scenes and mingling with the peoples of a remote antiquity., We have been in a half-waking sort of dream all the time., I do not know how else to describe the feeling., A part of our being has remained still in the nineteenth century, while another part of it has seemed in some unaccountable way walking among the phantoms of the tenth., We have seen famous pictures until our eyes are weary with looking at them and refuse to find interest in them any longer., And what wonder, when there are twelve hundred pictures by Palma the Younger in Venice and fifteen hundred by Tintoretto?, And behold there are Titians and the works of other artists in proportion., We have seen Titian's celebrated Cain and Abel, his David and Goliah, his Abraham's Sacrifice., We have seen Tintoretto's monster picture, which is seventy-four feet long and I do not know how many feet high, and thought it a very commodious picture., We have seen pictures of martyrs enough, and saints enough, to regenerate the world., I ought not to confess it, but still, since one has no opportunity in America to acquire a critical judgment in art, and since I could not hope to become educated in it in Europe in a few short weeks, I may therefore as well acknowledge with such apologies as may be due, that to me it seemed that when I had seen one of these martyrs I had seen them all., They all have a marked family resemblance to each other, they dress alike, in coarse monkish robes and sandals, they are all bald headed, they all stand in about the same attitude, and without exception they are gazing heavenward with countenances which the Ainsworths, the Mortons and the Williamses, et fils, inform me are full of ""expression."", To me there is nothing tangible about these imaginary portraits, nothing that I can grasp and take a living interest in., If great Titian had only been gifted with prophecy, and had skipped a martyr, and gone over to England and painted a portrait of Shakspeare, even as a youth, which we could all have confidence in now, the world down to the latest generations would have forgiven him the lost martyr in the rescued seer., I think posterity could have spared one more martyr for the sake of a great historical picture of Titian's time and painted by his brush--such as Columbus returning in chains from the discovery of a world, for instance., The old masters did paint some Venetian historical pictures, and these we did not tire of looking at, notwithstanding representations of the formal introduction of defunct doges to the Virgin Mary in regions beyond the clouds clashed rather harshly with the proprieties, it seemed to us., But humble as we are, and unpretending, in the matter of art, our researches among the painted monks and martyrs have not been wholly in vain., We have striven hard to learn., We have had some success., We have mastered some things, possibly of trifling import in the eyes of the learned, but to us they give pleasure, and we take as much pride in our little acquirements as do others who have learned far more, and we love to display them full as well., When we see a monk going about with a lion and looking tranquilly up to heaven, we know that that is St. Mark., When we see a monk with a book and a pen, looking tranquilly up to heaven, trying to think of a word, we know that that is St. Matthew., When we see a monk sitting on a rock, looking tranquilly up to heaven, with a human skull beside him, and without other baggage, we know that that is St. Jerome., Because we know that he always went flying light in the matter of baggage., When we see a party looking tranquilly up to heaven, unconscious that his body is shot through and through with arrows, we know that that is St. Sebastian., When we see other monks looking tranquilly up to heaven, but having no trade-mark, we always ask who those parties are., We do this because we humbly wish to learn., We have seen thirteen thousand St. Jeromes, and twenty-two thousand St. Marks, and sixteen thousand St. Matthews, and sixty thousand St. Sebastians, and four millions of assorted monks, undesignated, and we feel encouraged to believe that when we have seen some more of these various pictures, and had a larger experience, we shall begin to take an absorbing interest in them like our cultivated countrymen from Amerique., Now it does give me real pain to speak in this almost unappreciative way of the old masters and their martyrs, because good friends of mine in the ship--friends who do thoroughly and conscientiously appreciate them and are in every way competent to discriminate between good pictures and inferior ones--have urged me for my own sake not to make public the fact that I lack this appreciation and this critical discrimination myself., I believe that what I have written and may still write about pictures will give them pain, and I am honestly sorry for it., I even promised that I would hide my uncouth sentiments in my own breast., But alas!, I never could keep a promise., I do not blame myself for this weakness, because the fault must lie in my physical organization., It is likely that such a very liberal amount of space was given to the organ which enables me to make promises, that the organ which should enable me to keep them was crowded out., But I grieve not., I like no half-way things., I had rather have one faculty nobly developed than two faculties of mere ordinary capacity., I certainly meant to keep that promise, but I find I can not do it., It is impossible to travel through Italy without speaking of pictures, and can I see them through others' eyes?, If I did not so delight in the grand pictures that are spread before me every day of my life by that monarch of all the old masters, Nature, I should come to believe, sometimes, that I had in me no appreciation of the beautiful, whatsoever., It seems to me that whenever I glory to think that for once I have discovered an ancient painting that is beautiful and worthy of all praise, the pleasure it gives me is an infallible proof that it is not a beautiful picture and not in any wise worthy of commendation., This very thing has occurred more times than I can mention, in Venice., In every single instance the guide has crushed out my swelling enthusiasm with the remark:  ""It is nothing--it is of the Renaissance."", I did not know what in the mischief the Renaissance was, and so always I had to simply say,  ""Ah!, so it is--I had not observed it before."", I could not bear to be ignorant before a cultivated negro, the offspring of a South Carolina slave., But it occurred too often for even my self-complacency, did that exasperating ""It is nothing--it is of the Renaissance."", I said at last:  ""Who is this Renaissance?, Where did he come from?, Who gave him permission to cram the Republic with his execrable daubs?"", We learned, then, that Renaissance was not a man; that renaissance was a term used to signify what was at best but an imperfect rejuvenation of art., The guide said that after Titian's time and the time of the other great names we had grown so familiar with, high art declined; then it partially rose again--an inferior sort of painters sprang up, and these shabby pictures were the work of their hands., Then I said, in my heat, that I ""wished to goodness high art had declined five hundred years sooner."", The Renaissance pictures suit me very well, though sooth to say its school were too much given to painting real men and did not indulge enough in martyrs., The guide I have spoken of is the only one we have had yet who knew any thing., He was born in South Carolina, of slave parents., They came to Venice while he was an infant., He has grown up here., He is well educated., He reads, writes, and speaks English, Italian, Spanish, and French, with perfect facility; is a worshipper of art and thoroughly conversant with it; knows the history of Venice by heart and never tires of talking of her illustrious career., He dresses better than any of us, I think, and is daintily polite., Negroes are deemed as good as white people, in Venice, and so this man feels no desire to go back to his native land., His judgment is correct., I have had another shave., ...]"|1
3|"[Close down the curtain., Put out the lights., And so I turned away and went through shop after shop and store after store, far down the long street of the merchants, and called for the wares of Rome and the East, but the tradesmen were gone, the marts were silent, and nothing was left but the broken jars all set in cement of cinders and ashes: the wine and the oil that once had filled them were gone with their owners., In a bake-shop was a mill for grinding the grain, and the furnaces for baking the bread: and they say that here, in the same furnaces, the exhumers of Pompeii found nice, well baked loaves which the baker had not found time to remove from the ovens the last time he left his shop, because circumstances compelled him to leave in such a hurry., In one house (the only building in Pompeii which no woman is now allowed to enter,) were the small rooms and short beds of solid masonry, just as they were in the old times, and on the walls were pictures which looked almost as fresh as if they were painted yesterday, but which no pen could have the hardihood to describe; and here and there were Latin inscriptions--obscene scintillations of wit, scratched by hands that possibly were uplifted to Heaven for succor in the midst of a driving storm of fire before the night was done., In one of the principal streets was a ponderous stone tank, and a water-spout that supplied it, and where the tired, heated toilers from the Campagna used to rest their right hands when they bent over to put their lips to the spout, the thick stone was worn down to a broad groove an inch or two deep., Think of the countless thousands of hands that had pressed that spot in the ages that are gone, to so reduce a stone that is as hard as iron!, They had a great public bulletin board in Pompeii--a place where announcements for gladiatorial combats, elections, and such things, were posted--not on perishable paper, but carved in enduring stone., One lady, who, I take it, was rich and well brought up, advertised a dwelling or so to rent, with baths and all the modern improvements, and several hundred shops, stipulating that the dwellings should not be put to immoral purposes., You can find out who lived in many a house in Pompeii by the carved stone door-plates affixed to them: and in the same way you can tell who they were that occupy the tombs., Every where around are things that reveal to you something of the customs and history of this forgotten people., But what would a volcano leave of an American city, if it once rained its cinders on it?, Hardly a sign or a symbol to tell its story., In one of these long Pompeiian halls the skeleton of a man was found, with ten pieces of gold in one hand and a large key in the other., He had seized his money and started toward the door, but the fiery tempest caught him at the very threshold, and he sank down and died., One more minute of precious time would have saved him., I saw the skeletons of a man, a woman, and two young girls., The woman had her hands spread wide apart, as if in mortal terror, and I imagined I could still trace upon her shapeless face something of the expression of wild despair that distorted it when the heavens rained fire in these streets, so many ages ago., The girls and the man lay with their faces upon their arms, as if they had tried to shield them from the enveloping cinders., In one apartment eighteen skeletons were found, all in sitting postures, and blackened places on the walls still mark their shapes and show their attitudes, like shadows., One of them, a woman, still wore upon her skeleton throat a necklace, with her name engraved upon it--JULIE DI DIOMEDE., But perhaps the most poetical thing Pompeii has yielded to modern research, was that grand figure of a Roman soldier, clad in complete armor; who, true to his duty, true to his proud name of a soldier of Rome, and full of the stern courage which had given to that name its glory, stood to his post by the city gate, erect and unflinching, till the hell that raged around him burned out the dauntless spirit it could not conquer., We never read of Pompeii but we think of that soldier; we can not write of Pompeii without the natural impulse to grant to him the mention he so well deserves., Let us remember that he was a soldier--not a policeman --and so, praise him., Being a soldier, he staid,--because the warrior instinct forbade him to fly., Had he been a policeman he would have staid, also--because he would have been asleep., There are not half a dozen flights of stairs in Pompeii, and no other evidences that the houses were more than one story high., The people did not live in the clouds, as do the Venetians, the Genoese and Neapolitans of to-day., We came out from under the solemn mysteries of this city of the Venerable Past--this city which perished, with all its old ways and its quaint old fashions about it, remote centuries ago, when the Disciples were preaching the new religion, which is as old as the hills to us now--and went dreaming among the trees that grow over acres and acres of its still buried streets and squares, till a shrill whistle and the cry of ""All aboard--last train for Naples!"", woke me up and reminded me that I belonged in the nineteenth century, and was not a dusty mummy, caked with ashes and cinders, eighteen hundred years old., The transition was startling., The idea of a railroad train actually running to old dead Pompeii, and whistling irreverently, and calling for passengers in the most bustling and business-like way, was as strange a thing as one could imagine, and as unpoetical and disagreeable as it was strange., Compare the cheerful life and the sunshine of this day with the horrors the younger Pliny saw here, the 9th of November, A.D. 79, when he was so bravely striving to remove his mother out of reach of harm, while she begged him, with all a mother's unselfishness, to leave her to perish and save himself., After browsing among the stately ruins of Rome, of Baiae, of Pompeii, and after glancing down the long marble ranks of battered and nameless imperial heads that stretch down the corridors of the Vatican, one thing strikes me with a force it never had before: the unsubstantial, unlasting character of fame., Men lived long lives, in the olden time, and struggled feverishly through them, toiling like slaves, in oratory, in generalship, or in literature, and then laid them down and died, happy in the possession of an enduring history and a deathless name., Well, twenty little centuries flutter away, and what is left of these things?, A crazy inscription on a block of stone, which snuffy antiquaries bother over and tangle up and make nothing out of but a bare name (which they spell wrong)--no history, no tradition, no poetry--nothing that can give it even a passing interest., What may be left of General Grant's great name forty centuries hence?, This--in the Encyclopedia for A. D. 5868, possibly:       ""URIAH S. (or Z.), GRAUNT--popular poet of ancient times in the Aztec      provinces of the United States of British America., Some authors say      flourished about A. D. 742; but the learned Ah-ah Foo-foo states      that he was a cotemporary of Scharkspyre, the English poet, and      flourished about A. D. 1328, some three centuries after the Trojan      war instead of before it., He wrote 'Rock me to Sleep, Mother.'"", These thoughts sadden me., I will to bed., Home, again!, For the first time, in many weeks, the ship's entire family met and shook hands on the quarter-deck., They had gathered from many points of the compass and from many lands, but not one was missing; there was no tale of sickness or death among the flock to dampen the pleasure of the reunion., Once more there was a full audience on deck to listen to the sailors' chorus as they got the anchor up, and to wave an adieu to the land as we sped away from Naples., The seats were full at dinner again, the domino parties were complete, and the life and bustle on the upper deck in the fine moonlight at night was like old times--old times that had been gone weeks only, but yet they were weeks so crowded with incident, adventure and excitement, that they seemed almost like years., There was no lack of cheerfulness on board the Quaker City., For once, her title was a misnomer., At seven in the evening, with the western horizon all golden from the sunken sun, and specked with distant ships, the full moon sailing high over head, the dark blue of the sea under foot, and a strange sort of twilight affected by all these different lights and colors around us and about us, we sighted superb Stromboli., With what majesty the monarch held his lonely state above the level sea!, Distance clothed him in a purple gloom, and added a veil of shimmering mist that so softened his rugged features that we seemed to see him through a web of silver gauze., His torch was out; his fires were smoldering; a tall column of smoke that rose up and lost itself in the growing moonlight was all the sign he gave that he was a living Autocrat of the Sea and not the spectre of a dead one., At two in the morning we swept through the Straits of Messina, and so bright was the moonlight that Italy on the one hand and Sicily on the other seemed almost as distinctly visible as though we looked at them from the middle of a street we were traversing., The city of Messina, milk-white, and starred and spangled all over with gaslights, was a fairy spectacle., A great party of us were on deck smoking and making a noise, and waiting to see famous Scylla and Charybdis., And presently the Oracle stepped out with his eternal spy-glass and squared himself on the deck like another Colossus of Rhodes., It was a surprise to see him abroad at such an hour., Nobody supposed he cared anything about an old fable like that of Scylla and Charybdis., One of the boys said:  ""Hello, doctor, what are you doing up here at this time of night?--What do you want to see this place for?"", ""What do I want to see this place for?, Young man, little do you know me, or you wouldn't ask such a question., I wish to see all the places that's mentioned in the Bible."", ""Stuff--this place isn't mentioned in the Bible."", ""It ain't mentioned in the Bible!--this place ain't--well now, what place is this, since you know so much about it?"", ""Why it's Scylla and Charybdis."", ""Scylla and Cha--confound it, I thought it was Sodom and Gomorrah!"", And he closed up his glass and went below., The above is the ship story., Its plausibility is marred a little by the fact that the Oracle was not a biblical student, and did not spend much of his time instructing himself about Scriptural localities.--They say the Oracle complains, in this hot weather, lately, that the only beverage in the ship that is passable, is the butter., He did not mean butter, of course, but inasmuch as that article remains in a melted state now since we are out of ice, it is fair to give him the credit of getting one long word in the right place, anyhow, for once in his life., He said, in Rome, that the Pope was a noble-looking old man, but he never did think much of his Iliad., We spent one pleasant day skirting along the Isles of Greece., They are very mountainous., Their prevailing tints are gray and brown, approaching to red., Little white villages surrounded by trees, nestle in the valleys or roost upon the lofty perpendicular sea-walls., We had one fine sunset--a rich carmine flush that suffused the western sky and cast a ruddy glow far over the sea.--Fine sunsets seem to be rare in this part of the world--or at least, striking ones., They are soft, sensuous, lovely--they are exquisite refined, effeminate, but we have seen no sunsets here yet like the gorgeous conflagrations that flame in the track of the sinking sun in our high northern latitudes., But what were sunsets to us, with the wild excitement upon us of approaching the most renowned of cities!, What cared we for outward visions, when Agamemnon, Achilles, and a thousand other heroes of the great Past were marching in ghostly procession through our fancies?, What were sunsets to us, who were about to live and breathe and walk in actual Athens; yea, and go far down into the dead centuries and bid in person for the slaves, Diogenes and Plato, in the public market-place, or gossip with the neighbors about the siege of Troy or the splendid deeds of Marathon?, We scorned to consider sunsets., We arrived, and entered the ancient harbor of the Piraeus at last., We dropped anchor within half a mile of the village., Away off, across the undulating Plain of Attica, could be seen a little square-topped hill with a something on it, which our glasses soon discovered to be the ruined edifices of the citadel of the Athenians, and most prominent among them loomed the venerable Parthenon., So exquisitely clear and pure is this wonderful atmosphere that every column of the noble structure was discernible through the telescope, and even the smaller ruins about it assumed some semblance of shape., This at a distance of five or six miles., In the valley, near the Acropolis, (the square-topped hill before spoken of,) Athens itself could be vaguely made out with an ordinary lorgnette., Every body was anxious to get ashore and visit these classic localities as quickly as possible., No land we had yet seen had aroused such universal interest among the passengers., But bad news came., The commandant of the Piraeus came in his boat, and said we must either depart or else get outside the harbor and remain imprisoned in our ship, under rigid quarantine, for eleven days!, So we took up the anchor and moved outside, to lie a dozen hours or so, taking in supplies, and then sail for Constantinople., It was the bitterest disappointment we had yet experienced., To lie a whole day in sight of the Acropolis, and yet be obliged to go away without visiting Athens!, Disappointment was hardly a strong enough word to describe the circumstances., All hands were on deck, all the afternoon, with books and maps and glasses, trying to determine which ""narrow rocky ridge"" was the Areopagus, which sloping hill the Pnyx, which elevation the Museum Hill, and so on., And we got things confused., ...]"|1
4|"[I suppose it would be a real treat to a camel to have a keg of nails for supper., While I am speaking of animals, I will mention that I have a horse now by the name of ""Jericho."", He is a mare., I have seen remarkable horses before, but none so remarkable as this., I wanted a horse that could shy, and this one fills the bill., I had an idea that shying indicated spirit., If I was correct, I have got the most spirited horse on earth., He shies at every thing he comes across, with the utmost impartiality., He appears to have a mortal dread of telegraph poles, especially; and it is fortunate that these are on both sides of the road, because as it is now, I never fall off twice in succession on the same side., If I fell on the same side always, it would get to be monotonous after a while., This creature has scared at every thing he has seen to-day, except a haystack., He walked up to that with an intrepidity and a recklessness that were astonishing., And it would fill any one with admiration to see how he preserves his self-possession in the presence of a barley sack., This dare-devil bravery will be the death of this horse some day., He is not particularly fast, but I think he will get me through the Holy Land., He has only one fault., His tail has been chopped off or else he has sat down on it too hard, some time or other, and he has to fight the flies with his heels., This is all very well, but when he tries to kick a fly off the top of his head with his hind foot, it is too much variety., He is going to get himself into trouble that way some day., He reaches around and bites my legs too., I do not care particularly about that, only I do not like to see a horse too sociable., I think the owner of this prize had a wrong opinion about him., He had an idea that he was one of those fiery, untamed steeds, but he is not of that character., I know the Arab had this idea, because when he brought the horse out for inspection in Beirout, he kept jerking at the bridle and shouting in Arabic, ""Ho!, will you?, Do you want to run away, you ferocious beast, and break your neck?"", when all the time the horse was not doing anything in the world, and only looked like he wanted to lean up against something and think., Whenever he is not shying at things, or reaching after a fly, he wants to do that yet., How it would surprise his owner to know this., We have been in a historical section of country all day., At noon we camped three hours and took luncheon at Mekseh, near the junction of the Lebanon Mountains and the Jebel el Kuneiyiseh, and looked down into the immense, level, garden-like Valley of Lebanon., To-night we are camping near the same valley, and have a very wide sweep of it in view., We can see the long, whale-backed ridge of Mount Hermon projecting above the eastern hills., The ""dews of Hermon"" are falling upon us now, and the tents are almost soaked with them., Over the way from us, and higher up the valley, we can discern, through the glasses, the faint outlines of the wonderful ruins of Baalbec, the supposed Baal-Gad of Scripture., Joshua, and another person, were the two spies who were sent into this land of Canaan by the children of Israel to report upon its character--I mean they were the spies who reported favorably., They took back with them some specimens of the grapes of this country, and in the children's picture-books they are always represented as bearing one monstrous bunch swung to a pole between them, a respectable load for a pack-train., The Sunday-school books exaggerated it a little., The grapes are most excellent to this day, but the bunches are not as large as those in the pictures., I was surprised and hurt when I saw them, because those colossal bunches of grapes were one of my most cherished juvenile traditions., Joshua reported favorably, and the children of Israel journeyed on, with Moses at the head of the general government, and Joshua in command of the army of six hundred thousand fighting men., Of women and children and civilians there was a countless swarm., Of all that mighty host, none but the two faithful spies ever lived to set their feet in the Promised Land., They and their descendants wandered forty years in the desert, and then Moses, the gifted warrior, poet, statesman and philosopher, went up into Pisgah and met his mysterious fate., Where he was buried no man knows --for  Then Joshua began his terrible raid, and from Jericho clear to this Baal-Gad, he swept the land like the Genius of Destruction., He slaughtered the people, laid waste their soil, and razed their cities to the ground., He wasted thirty-one kings also., One may call it that, though really it can hardly be called wasting them, because there were always plenty of kings in those days, and to spare., At any rate, he destroyed thirty-one kings, and divided up their realms among his Israelites., He divided up this valley stretched out here before us, and so it was once Jewish territory., The Jews have long since disappeared from it, however., Back yonder, an hour's journey from here, we passed through an Arab village of stone dry-goods boxes (they look like that,) where Noah's tomb lies under lock and key., [Noah built the ark.], Over these old hills and valleys the ark that contained all that was left of a vanished world once floated., I make no apology for detailing the above information., It will be news to some of my readers, at any rate., Noah's tomb is built of stone, and is covered with a long stone building., Bucksheesh let us in., The building had to be long, because the grave of the honored old navigator is two hundred and ten feet long itself!, It is only about four feet high, though., He must have cast a shadow like a lightning-rod., The proof that this is the genuine spot where Noah was buried can only be doubted by uncommonly incredulous people., The evidence is pretty straight., Shem, the son of Noah, was present at the burial, and showed the place to his descendants, who transmitted the knowledge to their descendants, and the lineal descendants of these introduced themselves to us to-day., It was pleasant to make the acquaintance of members of so respectable a family., It was a thing to be proud of., It was the next thing to being acquainted with Noah himself., Noah's memorable voyage will always possess a living interest for me, henceforward., If ever an oppressed race existed, it is this one we see fettered around us under the inhuman tyranny of the Ottoman Empire., I wish Europe would let Russia annihilate Turkey a little--not much, but enough to make it difficult to find the place again without a divining-rod or a diving-bell., The Syrians are very poor, and yet they are ground down by a system of taxation that would drive any other nation frantic., Last year their taxes were heavy enough, in all conscience--but this year they have been increased by the addition of taxes that were forgiven them in times of famine in former years., On top of this the Government has levied a tax of one-tenth of the whole proceeds of the land., This is only half the story., The Pacha of a Pachalic does not trouble himself with appointing tax-collectors., He figures up what all these taxes ought to amount to in a certain district., Then he farms the collection out., He calls the rich men together, the highest bidder gets the speculation, pays the Pacha on the spot, and then sells out to smaller fry, who sell in turn to a piratical horde of still smaller fry., These latter compel the peasant to bring his little trifle of grain to the village, at his own cost., It must be weighed, the various taxes set apart, and the remainder returned to the producer., But the collector delays this duty day after day, while the producer's family are perishing for bread; at last the poor wretch, who can not but understand the game, says, ""Take a quarter--take half--take two-thirds if you will, and let me go!"", It is a most outrageous state of things., These people are naturally good-hearted and intelligent, and with education and liberty, would be a happy and contented race., They often appeal to the stranger to know if the great world will not some day come to their relief and save them., The Sultan has been lavishing money like water in England and Paris, but his subjects are suffering for it now., This fashion of camping out bewilders me., We have boot-jacks and a bath-tub, now, and yet all the mysteries the pack-mules carry are not revealed., What next?, We had a tedious ride of about five hours, in the sun, across the Valley of Lebanon., It proved to be not quite so much of a garden as it had seemed from the hill-sides., It was a desert, weed-grown waste, littered thickly with stones the size of a man's fist., Here and there the natives had scratched the ground and reared a sickly crop of grain, but for the most part the valley was given up to a handful of shepherds, whose flocks were doing what they honestly could to get a living, but the chances were against them., We saw rude piles of stones standing near the roadside, at intervals, and recognized the custom of marking boundaries which obtained in Jacob's time., There were no walls, no fences, no hedges--nothing to secure a man's possessions but these random heaps of stones., The Israelites held them sacred in the old patriarchal times, and these other Arabs, their lineal descendants, do so likewise., An American, of ordinary intelligence, would soon widely extend his property, at an outlay of mere manual labor, performed at night, under so loose a system of fencing as this., The plows these people use are simply a sharpened stick, such as Abraham plowed with, and they still winnow their wheat as he did--they pile it on the house-top, and then toss it by shovel-fulls into the air until the wind has blown all the chaff away., They never invent any thing, never learn any thing., We had a fine race, of a mile, with an Arab perched on a camel., Some of the horses were fast, and made very good time, but the camel scampered by them without any very great effort., ...]"|1
5|"[Ahab, the late King, had left a helpless family behind him, and Jehu killed seventy of the orphan sons., Then he killed all the relatives, and teachers, and servants and friends of the family, and rested from his labors, until he was come near to Samaria, where he met forty-two persons and asked them who they were; they said they were brothers of the King of Judah., He killed them., When he got to Samaria, he said he would show his zeal for the Lord; so he gathered all the priests and people together that worshiped Baal, pretending that he was going to adopt that worship and offer up a great sacrifice; and when they were all shut up where they could not defend themselves, he caused every person of them to be killed., Then Jehu, the good missionary, rested from his labors once more., We went back to the valley, and rode to the Fountain of Ain Jelud., They call it the Fountain of Jezreel, usually., It is a pond about one hundred feet square and four feet deep, with a stream of water trickling into it from under an overhanging ledge of rocks., It is in the midst of a great solitude., Here Gideon pitched his camp in the old times; behind Shunem lay the ""Midianites, the Amalekites, and the Children of the East,"" who were ""as grasshoppers for multitude; both they and their camels were without number, as the sand by the sea-side for multitude."", Which means that there were one hundred and thirty-five thousand men, and that they had transportation service accordingly., Gideon, with only three hundred men, surprised them in the night, and stood by and looked on while they butchered each other until a hundred and twenty thousand lay dead on the field., We camped at Jenin before night, and got up and started again at one o'clock in the morning., Somewhere towards daylight we passed the locality where the best authenticated tradition locates the pit into which Joseph's brethren threw him, and about noon, after passing over a succession of mountain tops, clad with groves of fig and olive trees, with the Mediterranean in sight some forty miles away, and going by many ancient Biblical cities whose inhabitants glowered savagely upon our Christian procession, and were seemingly inclined to practice on it with stones, we came to the singularly terraced and unlovely hills that betrayed that we were out of Galilee and into Samaria at last., We climbed a high hill to visit the city of Samaria, where the woman may have hailed from who conversed with Christ at Jacob's Well, and from whence, no doubt, came also the celebrated Good Samaritan., Herod the Great is said to have made a magnificent city of this place, and a great number of coarse limestone columns, twenty feet high and two feet through, that are almost guiltless of architectural grace of shape and ornament, are pointed out by many authors as evidence of the fact., They would not have been considered handsome in ancient Greece, however., The inhabitants of this camp are particularly vicious, and stoned two parties of our pilgrims a day or two ago who brought about the difficulty by showing their revolvers when they did not intend to use them--a thing which is deemed bad judgment in the Far West, and ought certainly to be so considered any where., In the new Territories, when a man puts his hand on a weapon, he knows that he must use it; he must use it instantly or expect to be shot down where he stands., Those pilgrims had been reading Grimes., There was nothing for us to do in Samaria but buy handfuls of old Roman coins at a franc a dozen, and look at a dilapidated church of the Crusaders and a vault in it which once contained the body of John the Baptist., This relic was long ago carried away to Genoa., Samaria stood a disastrous siege, once, in the days of Elisha, at the hands of the King of Syria., Provisions reached such a figure that ""an ass' head was sold for eighty pieces of silver and the fourth part of a cab of dove's dung for five pieces of silver."", An incident recorded of that heavy time will give one a very good idea of the distress that prevailed within these crumbling walls., As the King was walking upon the battlements one day, ""a woman cried out, saying, Help, my lord, O King!, And the King said, What aileth thee?, and she answered, This woman said unto me, Give thy son, that we may eat him to-day, and we will eat my son to-morrow., So we boiled my son, and did eat him; and I said unto her on the next day, Give thy son that we may eat him; and she hath hid her son."", The prophet Elisha declared that within four and twenty hours the prices of food should go down to nothing, almost, and it was so., The Syrian army broke camp and fled, for some cause or other, the famine was relieved from without, and many a shoddy speculator in dove's dung and ass's meat was ruined., We were glad to leave this hot and dusty old village and hurry on., At two o'clock we stopped to lunch and rest at ancient Shechem, between the historic Mounts of Gerizim and Ebal, where in the old times the books of the law, the curses and the blessings, were read from the heights to the Jewish multitudes below., The narrow canon in which Nablous, or Shechem, is situated, is under high cultivation, and the soil is exceedingly black and fertile., It is well watered, and its affluent vegetation gains effect by contrast with the barren hills that tower on either side., One of these hills is the ancient Mount of Blessings and the other the Mount of Curses and wise men who seek for fulfillments of prophecy think they find here a wonder of this kind--to wit, that the Mount of Blessings is strangely fertile and its mate as strangely unproductive., We could not see that there was really much difference between them in this respect, however., Shechem is distinguished as one of the residences of the patriarch Jacob, and as the seat of those tribes that cut themselves loose from their brethren of Israel and propagated doctrines not in conformity with those of the original Jewish creed., For thousands of years this clan have dwelt in Shechem under strict tabu, and having little commerce or fellowship with their fellow men of any religion or nationality., For generations they have not numbered more than one or two hundred, but they still adhere to their ancient faith and maintain their ancient rites and ceremonies., Talk of family and old descent!, Princes and nobles pride themselves upon lineages they can trace back some hundreds of years., What is this trifle to this handful of old first families of Shechem who can name their fathers straight back without a flaw for thousands --straight back to a period so remote that men reared in a country where the days of two hundred years ago are called ""ancient"" times grow dazed and bewildered when they try to comprehend it!, Here is respectability for you--here is ""family""--here is high descent worth talking about., This sad, proud remnant of a once mighty community still hold themselves aloof from all the world; they still live as their fathers lived, labor as their fathers labored, think as they did, feel as they did, worship in the same place, in sight of the same landmarks, and in the same quaint, patriarchal way their ancestors did more than thirty centuries ago., I found myself gazing at any straggling scion of this strange race with a riveted fascination, just as one would stare at a living mastodon, or a megatherium that had moved in the grey dawn of creation and seen the wonders of that mysterious world that was before the flood., Carefully preserved among the sacred archives of this curious community is a MSS., copy of the ancient Jewish law, which is said to be the oldest document on earth., It is written on vellum, and is some four or five thousand years old., Nothing but bucksheesh can purchase a sight., Its fame is somewhat dimmed in these latter days, because of the doubts so many authors of Palestine travels have felt themselves privileged to cast upon it., Speaking of this MSS., reminds me that I procured from the high-priest of this ancient Samaritan community, at great expense, a secret document of still higher antiquity and far more extraordinary interest, which I propose to publish as soon as I have finished translating it., Joshua gave his dying injunction to the children of Israel at Shechem, and buried a valuable treasure secretly under an oak tree there about the same time., The superstitious Samaritans have always been afraid to hunt for it., They believe it is guarded by fierce spirits invisible to men., About a mile and a half from Shechem we halted at the base of Mount Ebal before a little square area, inclosed by a high stone wall, neatly whitewashed., Across one end of this inclosure is a tomb built after the manner of the Moslems., It is the tomb of Joseph., No truth is better authenticated than this., When Joseph was dying he prophesied that exodus of the Israelites from Egypt which occurred four hundred years afterwards., At the same time he exacted of his people an oath that when they journeyed to the land of Canaan they would bear his bones with them and bury them in the ancient inheritance of his fathers., The oath was kept., ""And the bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel brought up out of Egypt, buried they in Shechem, in a parcel of ground which Jacob bought of the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for a hundred pieces of silver."", Few tombs on earth command the veneration of so many races and men of divers creeds as this of Joseph., ""Samaritan and Jew, Moslem and Christian alike, revere it, and honor it with their visits., The tomb of Joseph, the dutiful son, the affectionate, forgiving brother, the virtuous man, the wise Prince and ruler., Egypt felt his influence--the world knows his history."", In this same ""parcel of ground"" which Jacob bought of the sons of Hamor for a hundred pieces of silver, is Jacob's celebrated well., It is cut in the solid rock, and is nine feet square and ninety feet deep., The name of this unpretending hole in the ground, which one might pass by and take no notice of, is as familiar as household words to even the children and the peasants of many a far-off country., It is more famous than the Parthenon; it is older than the Pyramids., It was by this well that Jesus sat and talked with a woman of that strange, antiquated Samaritan community I have been speaking of, and told her of the mysterious water of life., As descendants of old English nobles still cherish in the traditions of their houses how that this king or that king tarried a day with some favored ancestor three hundred years ago, no doubt the descendants of the woman of Samaria, living there in Shechem, still refer with pardonable vanity to this conversation of their ancestor, held some little time gone by, with the Messiah of the Christians., It is not likely that they undervalue a distinction such as this., Samaritan nature is human nature, and human nature remembers contact with the illustrious, always., For an offense done to the family honor, the sons of Jacob exterminated all Shechem once., We left Jacob's Well and traveled till eight in the evening, but rather slowly, for we had been in the saddle nineteen hours, and the horses were cruelly tired., We got so far ahead of the tents that we had to camp in an Arab village, and sleep on the ground., We could have slept in the largest of the houses; but there were some little drawbacks: it was populous with vermin, it had a dirt floor, it was in no respect cleanly, and there was a family of goats in the only bedroom, and two donkeys in the parlor., Outside there were no inconveniences, except that the dusky, ragged, earnest-eyed villagers of both sexes and all ages grouped themselves on their haunches all around us, and discussed us and criticised us with noisy tongues till midnight., We did not mind the noise, being tired, but, doubtless, the reader is aware that it is almost an impossible thing to go to sleep when you know that people are looking at you., We went to bed at ten, and got up again at two and started once more., Thus are people persecuted by dragomen, whose sole ambition in life is to get ahead of each other., About daylight we passed Shiloh, where the Ark of the Covenant rested three hundred years, and at whose gates good old Eli fell down and ""brake his neck"" when the messenger, riding hard from the battle, told him of the defeat of his people, the death of his sons, and, more than all, the capture of Israel's pride, her hope, her refuge, the ancient Ark her forefathers brought with them out of Egypt., It is little wonder that under circumstances like these he fell down and brake his neck., But Shiloh had no charms for us., We were so cold that there was no comfort but in motion, and so drowsy we could hardly sit upon the horses., After a while we came to a shapeless mass of ruins, which still bears the name of Bethel., It was here that Jacob lay down and had that superb vision of angels flitting up and down a ladder that reached from the clouds to earth, and caught glimpses of their blessed home through the open gates of Heaven., The pilgrims took what was left of the hallowed ruin, and we pressed on toward the goal of our crusade, renowned Jerusalem., The further we went the hotter the sun got, and the more rocky and bare, repulsive and dreary the landscape became., There could not have been more fragments of stone strewn broadcast over this part of the world, if every ten square feet of the land had been occupied by a separate and distinct stonecutter's establishment for an age., There was hardly a tree or a shrub any where., Even the olive and the cactus, those fast friends of a worthless soil, had almost deserted the country., No landscape exists that is more tiresome to the eye than that which bounds the approaches to Jerusalem., The only difference between the roads and the surrounding country, perhaps, is that there are rather more rocks in the roads than in the surrounding country., We passed Ramah, and Beroth, and on the right saw the tomb of the prophet Samuel, perched high upon a commanding eminence., Still no Jerusalem came in sight., We hurried on impatiently., ...]"|1
6|"[Amen., In this place I will print an article which I wrote for the New York Herald the night we arrived., I do it partly because my contract with my publishers makes it compulsory; partly because it is a proper, tolerably accurate, and exhaustive summing up of the cruise of the ship and the performances of the pilgrims in foreign lands; and partly because some of the passengers have abused me for writing it, and I wish the public to see how thankless a task it is to put one's self to trouble to glorify unappreciative people., I was charged with ""rushing into print"" with these compliments., I did not rush., I had written news letters to the Herald sometimes, but yet when I visited the office that day I did not say any thing about writing a valedictory., I did go to the Tribune office to see if such an article was wanted, because I belonged on the regular staff of that paper and it was simply a duty to do it., The managing editor was absent, and so I thought no more about it., At night when the Herald's request came for an article, I did not ""rush."", In fact, I demurred for a while, because I did not feel like writing compliments then, and therefore was afraid to speak of the cruise lest I might be betrayed into using other than complimentary language., However, I reflected that it would be a just and righteous thing to go down and write a kind word for the Hadjis--Hadjis are people who have made the pilgrimage--because parties not interested could not do it so feelingly as I, a fellow-Hadji, and so I penned the valedictory., I have read it, and read it again; and if there is a sentence in it that is not fulsomely complimentary to captain, ship and passengers, I can not find it., If it is not a chapter that any company might be proud to have a body write about them, my judgment is fit for nothing., With these remarks I confidently submit it to the unprejudiced judgment of the reader:       RETURN OF THE HOLY LAND EXCURSIONISTS--THE STORY OF THE CRUISE., TO THE EDITOR OF THE HERALD:       The steamer Quaker City has accomplished at last her extraordinary      voyage and returned to her old pier at the foot of Wall street., The expedition was a success in some respects, in some it was not., Originally it was advertised as a ""pleasure excursion."", Well,      perhaps, it was a pleasure excursion, but certainly it did not look      like one; certainly it did not act like one., Any body's and every      body's notion of a pleasure excursion is that the parties to it will      of a necessity be young and giddy and somewhat boisterous., They      will dance a good deal, sing a good deal, make love, but sermonize      very little., Any body's and every body's notion of a well conducted      funeral is that there must be a hearse and a corpse, and chief      mourners and mourners by courtesy, many old people, much solemnity,      no levity, and a prayer and a sermon withal., Three-fourths of the      Quaker City's passengers were between forty and seventy years of      age!, There was a picnic crowd for you!, It may be supposed that the      other fourth was composed of young girls., But it was not., It was      chiefly composed of rusty old bachelors and a child of six years., Let us average the ages of the Quaker City's pilgrims and set the      figure down as fifty years., Is any man insane enough to imagine      that this picnic of patriarchs sang, made love, danced, laughed,      told anecdotes, dealt in ungodly levity?, In my experience they      sinned little in these matters., No doubt it was presumed here at      home that these frolicsome veterans laughed and sang and romped all      day, and day after day, and kept up a noisy excitement from one end      of the ship to the other; and that they played blind-man's buff or      danced quadrilles and waltzes on moonlight evenings on the      quarter-deck; and that at odd moments of unoccupied time they jotted      a laconic item or two in the journals they opened on such an      elaborate plan when they left home, and then skurried off to their      whist and euchre labors under the cabin lamps., If these things were      presumed, the presumption was at fault., The venerable excursionists      were not gay and frisky., They played no blind-man's buff; they      dealt not in whist; they shirked not the irksome journal, for alas!, most of them were even writing books., They never romped, they      talked but little, they never sang, save in the nightly      prayer-meeting., The pleasure ship was a synagogue, and the pleasure      trip was a funeral excursion without a corpse., (There is nothing      exhilarating about a funeral excursion without a corpse.), A free,      hearty laugh was a sound that was not heard oftener than once in      seven days about those decks or in those cabins, and when it was      heard it met with precious little sympathy., The excursionists      danced, on three separate evenings, long, long ago, (it seems an      age.), quadrilles, of a single set, made up of three ladies and five      gentlemen, (the latter with handkerchiefs around their arms to      signify their sex.), who timed their feet to the solemn wheezing of a      melodeon; but even this melancholy orgie was voted to be sinful, and      dancing was discontinued., The pilgrims played dominoes when too much Josephus or Robinson's      Holy Land Researches, or book-writing, made recreation necessary --     for dominoes is about as mild and sinless a game as any in the      world, perhaps, excepting always the ineffably insipid diversion      they call croquet, which is a game where you don't pocket any balls      and don't carom on any thing of any consequence, and when you are      done nobody has to pay, and there are no refreshments to saw off,      and, consequently, there isn't any satisfaction whatever about it --     they played dominoes till they were rested, and then they      blackguarded each other privately till prayer-time., When they were      not seasick they were uncommonly prompt when the dinner-gong      sounded., Such was our daily life on board the ship--solemnity,      decorum, dinner, dominoes, devotions, slander., It was not lively      enough for a pleasure trip; but if we had only had a corpse it would      have made a noble funeral excursion., It is all over now; but when I      look back, the idea of these venerable fossils skipping forth on a      six months' picnic, seems exquisitely refreshing., The advertised      title of the expedition--""The Grand Holy Land Pleasure Excursion"" --     was a misnomer., ""The Grand Holy Land Funeral Procession"" would have      been better--much better., Wherever we went, in Europe, Asia, or Africa, we made a sensation,      and, I suppose I may add, created a famine., None of us had ever      been any where before; we all hailed from the interior; travel was a      wild novelty to us, and we conducted ourselves in accordance with      the natural instincts that were in us, and trammeled ourselves with      no ceremonies, no conventionalities., We always took care to make it      understood that we were Americans--Americans!, When we found that a      good many foreigners had hardly ever heard of America, and that a      good many more knew it only as a barbarous province away off      somewhere, that had lately been at war with somebody, we pitied the      ignorance of the Old World, but abated no jot of our importance., Many and many a simple community in the Eastern hemisphere will      remember for years the incursion of the strange horde in the year of      our Lord 1867, that called themselves Americans, and seemed to      imagine in some unaccountable way that they had a right to be proud      of it., We generally created a famine, partly because the coffee on      the Quaker City was unendurable, and sometimes the more substantial      fare was not strictly first class; and partly because one naturally      tires of sitting long at the same board and eating from the same      dishes., The people of those foreign countries are very, very ignorant., They      looked curiously at the costumes we had brought from the wilds of      America., They observed that we talked loudly at table sometimes., They noticed that we looked out for expenses, and got what we      conveniently could out of a franc, and wondered where in the      mischief we came from., In Paris they just simply opened their eyes      and stared when we spoke to them in French!, We never did succeed in      making those idiots understand their own language., One of our      passengers said to a shopkeeper, in reference to a proposed return      to buy a pair of gloves, ""Allong restay trankeel--may be ve coom      Moonday;"" and would you believe it, that shopkeeper, a born      Frenchman, had to ask what it was that had been said., Sometimes it      seems to me, somehow, that there must be a difference between      Parisian French and Quaker City French., The people stared at us every where, and we stared at them., We      generally made them feel rather small, too, before we got done with      them, because we bore down on them with America's greatness until we      crushed them., And yet we took kindly to the manners and customs,      and especially to the fashions of the various people we visited., When we left the Azores, we wore awful capotes and used fine tooth      combs--successfully., When we came back from Tangier, in Africa, we      were topped with fezzes of the bloodiest hue, hung with tassels like      an Indian's scalp-lock., In France and Spain we attracted some      attention in these costumes., In Italy they naturally took us for      distempered Garibaldians, and set a gunboat to look for any thing      significant in our changes of uniform., We made Rome howl., We could      have made any place howl when we had all our clothes on., We got no      fresh raiment in Greece--they had but little there of any kind., But      at Constantinople, how we turned out!, Turbans, scimetars, fezzes,      horse-pistols, tunics, sashes, baggy trowsers, yellow slippers--Oh,      we were gorgeous!, The illustrious dogs of Constantinople barked      their under jaws off, and even then failed to do us justice., They      are all dead by this time., They could not go through such a run of      business as we gave them and survive., And then we went to see the Emperor of Russia., We just called on      him as comfortably as if we had known him a century or so, and when      we had finished our visit we variegated ourselves with selections      from Russian costumes and sailed away again more picturesque than      ever., In Smyrna we picked up camel's hair shawls and other dressy      things from Persia; but in Palestine--ah, in Palestine--our splendid      career ended., They didn't wear any clothes there to speak of., We      were satisfied, and stopped., We made no experiments., We did not      try their costume., But we astonished the natives of that country., We astonished them with such eccentricities of dress as we could      muster., We prowled through the Holy Land, from Cesarea Philippi to      Jerusalem and the Dead Sea, a weird procession of pilgrims, gotten      up regardless of expense, solemn, gorgeous, green-spectacled,      drowsing under blue umbrellas, and astride of a sorrier lot of      horses, camels and asses than those that came out of Noah's ark,      after eleven months of seasickness and short rations., If ever those      children of Israel in Palestine forget when Gideon's Band went      through there from America, they ought to be cursed once more and      finished., It was the rarest spectacle that ever astounded mortal      eyes, perhaps., Well, we were at home in Palestine., It was easy to see that that      was the grand feature of the expedition., We had cared nothing much      about Europe., We galloped through the Louvre, the Pitti, the      Ufizzi, the Vatican--all the galleries--and through the pictured and      frescoed churches of Venice, Naples, and the cathedrals of Spain;      some of us said that certain of the great works of the old masters      were glorious creations of genius, (we found it out in the      guide-book, though we got hold of the wrong picture sometimes,) and      the others said they were disgraceful old daubs., We examined modern      and ancient statuary with a critical eye in Florence, Rome, or any      where we found it, and praised it if we saw fit, and if we didn't we      said we preferred the wooden Indians in front of the cigar stores of      America., But the Holy Land brought out all our enthusiasm., We fell      into raptures by the barren shores of Galilee; we pondered at Tabor      and at Nazareth; we exploded into poetry over the questionable      loveliness of Esdraelon; we meditated at Jezreel and Samaria over      the missionary zeal of Jehu; we rioted--fairly rioted among the holy      places of Jerusalem; we bathed in Jordan and the Dead Sea, reckless      whether our accident-insurance policies were extra-hazardous or not,      and brought away so many jugs of precious water from both places      that all the country from Jericho to the mountains of Moab will      suffer from drouth this year, I think., Yet, the pilgrimage part of      the excursion was its pet feature--there is no question about that., After dismal, smileless Palestine, beautiful Egypt had few charms      for us., We merely glanced at it and were ready for home., They wouldn't let us land at Malta--quarantine; they would not let      us land in Sardinia; nor at Algiers, Africa; nor at Malaga, Spain,      nor Cadiz, nor at the Madeira islands., ...]"|1
7|"[I thought some of the things I said were rather fine., But he merely looked around at me, at distant intervals, something as I have seen a benignant old cat look around to see which kitten was meddling with her tail., By and by I subsided into an indignant silence, and so sat until the end, hot and flushed, and execrating him in my heart for an ignorant savage., But he was calm., His conversation with those gentlemen flowed on as sweetly and peacefully and musically as any summer brook., When the audience was ended and we were retiring from the presence, he put his hand on my head, beamed down on me in an admiring way and said to my brother:  ""Ah--your child, I presume?, Boy, or girl?"", Mr. Street was very busy with his telegraphic matters--and considering that he had eight or nine hundred miles of rugged, snowy, uninhabited mountains, and waterless, treeless, melancholy deserts to traverse with his wire, it was natural and needful that he should be as busy as possible., He could not go comfortably along and cut his poles by the road-side, either, but they had to be hauled by ox teams across those exhausting deserts--and it was two days' journey from water to water, in one or two of them., Mr. Street's contract was a vast work, every way one looked at it; and yet to comprehend what the vague words ""eight hundred miles of rugged mountains and dismal deserts"" mean, one must go over the ground in person--pen and ink descriptions cannot convey the dreary reality to the reader., And after all, Mr. S.'s mightiest difficulty turned out to be one which he had never taken into the account at all., Unto Mormons he had sub-let the hardest and heaviest half of his great undertaking, and all of a sudden they concluded that they were going to make little or nothing, and so they tranquilly threw their poles overboard in mountain or desert, just as it happened when they took the notion, and drove home and went about their customary business!, They were under written contract to Mr. Street, but they did not care anything for that., They said they would ""admire"" to see a ""Gentile"" force a Mormon to fulfil a losing contract in Utah!, And they made themselves very merry over the matter., Street said--for it was he that told us these things:  ""I was in dismay., I was under heavy bonds to complete my contract in a given time, and this disaster looked very much like ruin., It was an astounding thing; it was such a wholly unlooked-for difficulty, that I was entirely nonplussed., I am a business man--have always been a business man--do not know anything but business--and so you can imagine how like being struck by lightning it was to find myself in a country where written contracts were worthless!--that main security, that sheet-anchor, that absolute necessity, of business., My confidence left me., There was no use in making new contracts--that was plain., I talked with first one prominent citizen and then another., They all sympathized with me, first rate, but they did not know how to help me., But at last a Gentile said, 'Go to Brigham Young!--these small fry cannot do you any good.', I did not think much of the idea, for if the law could not help me, what could an individual do who had not even anything to do with either making the laws or executing them?, He might be a very good patriarch of a church and preacher in its tabernacle, but something sterner than religion and moral suasion was needed to handle a hundred refractory, half-civilized sub-contractors., But what was a man to do?, I thought if Mr. Young could not do anything else, he might probably be able to give me some advice and a valuable hint or two, and so I went straight to him and laid the whole case before him., He said very little, but he showed strong interest all the way through., He examined all the papers in detail, and whenever there seemed anything like a hitch, either in the papers or my statement, he would go back and take up the thread and follow it patiently out to an intelligent and satisfactory result., Then he made a list of the contractors' names., Finally he said:  ""'Mr., Street, this is all perfectly plain., These contracts are strictly and legally drawn, and are duly signed and certified., These men manifestly entered into them with their eyes open., I see no fault or flaw anywhere.', ""Then Mr. Young turned to a man waiting at the other end of the room and said: 'Take this list of names to So-and-so, and tell him to have these men here at such-and-such an hour.', ""They were there, to the minute., So was I.  Mr. Young asked them a number of questions, and their answers made my statement good., Then he said to them:  ""'You signed these contracts and assumed these obligations of your own free will and accord?', ""'Yes.', ""'Then carry them out to the letter, if it makes paupers of you!, Go!', ""And they did go, too!, They are strung across the deserts now, working like bees., And I never hear a word out of them., ""There is a batch of governors, and judges, and other officials here, shipped from Washington, and they maintain the semblance of a republican form of government--but the petrified truth is that Utah is an absolute monarchy and Brigham Young is king!"", Mr. Street was a fine man, and I believe his story., I knew him well during several years afterward in San Francisco., Our stay in Salt Lake City amounted to only two days, and therefore we had no time to make the customary inquisition into the workings of polygamy and get up the usual statistics and deductions preparatory to calling the attention of the nation at large once more to the matter., I had the will to do it., With the gushing self-sufficiency of youth I was feverish to plunge in headlong and achieve a great reform here--until I saw the Mormon women., Then I was touched., My heart was wiser than my head., It warmed toward these poor, ungainly and pathetically ""homely"" creatures, and as I turned to hide the generous moisture in my eyes, I said, ""No--the man that marries one of them has done an act of Christian charity which entitles him to the kindly applause of mankind, not their harsh censure--and the man that marries sixty of them has done a deed of open-handed generosity so sublime that the nations should stand uncovered in his presence and worship in silence."", It is a luscious country for thrilling evening stories about assassinations of intractable Gentiles., I cannot easily conceive of anything more cosy than the night in Salt Lake which we spent in a Gentile den, smoking pipes and listening to tales of how Burton galloped in among the pleading and defenceless ""Morisites"" and shot them down, men and women, like so many dogs., And how Bill Hickman, a Destroying Angel, shot Drown and Arnold dead for bringing suit against him for a debt., And how Porter Rockwell did this and that dreadful thing., And how heedless people often come to Utah and make remarks about Brigham, or polygamy, or some other sacred matter, and the very next morning at daylight such parties are sure to be found lying up some back alley, contentedly waiting for the hearse., And the next most interesting thing is to sit and listen to these Gentiles talk about polygamy; and how some portly old frog of an elder, or a bishop, marries a girl--likes her, marries her sister--likes her, marries another sister--likes her, takes another--likes her, marries her mother--likes her, marries her father, grandfather, great grandfather, and then comes back hungry and asks for more., And how the pert young thing of eleven will chance to be the favorite wife and her own venerable grandmother have to rank away down toward D 4 in their mutual husband's esteem, and have to sleep in the kitchen, as like as not., And how this dreadful sort of thing, this hiving together in one foul nest of mother and daughters, and the making a young daughter superior to her own mother in rank and authority, are things which Mormon women submit to because their religion teaches them that the more wives a man has on earth, and the more children he rears, the higher the place they will all have in the world to come--and the warmer, maybe, though they do not seem to say anything about that., According to these Gentile friends of ours, Brigham Young's harem contains twenty or thirty wives., They said that some of them had grown old and gone out of active service, but were comfortably housed and cared for in the henery--or the Lion House, as it is strangely named., Along with each wife were her children--fifty altogether., The house was perfectly quiet and orderly, when the children were still., They all took their meals in one room, and a happy and home-like sight it was pronounced to be., None of our party got an opportunity to take dinner with Mr. Young, but a Gentile by the name of Johnson professed to have enjoyed a sociable breakfast in the Lion House., He gave a preposterous account of the ""calling of the roll,"" and other preliminaries, and the carnage that ensued when the buckwheat cakes came in., But he embellished rather too much., He said that Mr. Young told him several smart sayings of certain of his ""two-year-olds,"" observing with some pride that for many years he had been the heaviest contributor in that line to one of the Eastern magazines; and then he wanted to show Mr. Johnson one of the pets that had said the last good thing, but he could not find the child., He searched the faces of the children in detail, but could not decide which one it was., Finally he gave it up with a sigh and said:  ""I thought I would know the little cub again but I don't."", Mr. Johnson said further, that Mr. Young observed that life was a sad, sad thing --""because the joy of every new marriage a man contracted was so apt to be blighted by the inopportune funeral of a less recent bride."", And Mr. Johnson said that while he and Mr. Young were pleasantly conversing in private, one of the Mrs. Youngs came in and demanded a breast-pin, remarking that she had found out that he had been giving a breast-pin to No., 6, and she, for one, did not propose to let this partiality go on without making a satisfactory amount of trouble about it., Mr. Young reminded her that there was a stranger present., Mrs. Young said that if the state of things inside the house was not agreeable to the stranger, he could find room outside., Mr. Young promised the breast-pin, and she went away., But in a minute or two another Mrs. Young came in and demanded a breast-pin., Mr. Young began a remonstrance, but Mrs. Young cut him short., She said No., 6 had got one, and No., 11 was promised one, and it was ""no use for him to try to impose on her--she hoped she knew her rights."", He gave his promise, and she went., And presently three Mrs. Youngs entered in a body and opened on their husband a tempest of tears, abuse, and entreaty., They had heard all about No., 6, No., 11, and No., 14., Three more breast-pins were promised., They were hardly gone when nine more Mrs. Youngs filed into the presence, and a new tempest burst forth and raged round about the prophet and his guest., Nine breast-pins were promised, and the weird sisters filed out again., And in came eleven more, weeping and wailing and gnashing their teeth., Eleven promised breast-pins purchased peace once more., ""That is a specimen,"" said Mr. Young., ""You see how it is., You see what a life I lead., A man can't be wise all the time., ...]"|1
8|"[There was a sudden leap and stir of blood that had been asleep for an hour, and as sudden a rousing of all the drowsing activities in our minds and bodies., We were alive and awake at once--and shaking and quaking with consternation, too., There was an instant halting and dismounting, a bending low and an anxious scanning of the road-bed., Useless, of course; for if a faint depression could not be discerned from an altitude of four or five feet above it, it certainly could not with one's nose nearly against it., We seemed to be in a road, but that was no proof., We tested this by walking off in various directions--the regular snow-mounds and the regular avenues between them convinced each man that he had found the true road, and that the others had found only false ones., Plainly the situation was desperate., We were cold and stiff and the horses were tired., We decided to build a sage-brush fire and camp out till morning., This was wise, because if we were wandering from the right road and the snow-storm continued another day our case would be the next thing to hopeless if we kept on., All agreed that a camp fire was what would come nearest to saving us, now, and so we set about building it., We could find no matches, and so we tried to make shift with the pistols., Not a man in the party had ever tried to do such a thing before, but not a man in the party doubted that it could be done, and without any trouble--because every man in the party had read about it in books many a time and had naturally come to believe it, with trusting simplicity, just as he had long ago accepted and believed that other common book-fraud about Indians and lost hunters making a fire by rubbing two dry sticks together., We huddled together on our knees in the deep snow, and the horses put their noses together and bowed their patient heads over us; and while the feathery flakes eddied down and turned us into a group of white statuary, we proceeded with the momentous experiment., We broke twigs from a sage bush and piled them on a little cleared place in the shelter of our bodies., In the course of ten or fifteen minutes all was ready, and then, while conversation ceased and our pulses beat low with anxious suspense, Ollendorff applied his revolver, pulled the trigger and blew the pile clear out of the county!, It was the flattest failure that ever was., This was distressing, but it paled before a greater horror--the horses were gone!, I had been appointed to hold the bridles, but in my absorbing anxiety over the pistol experiment I had unconsciously dropped them and the released animals had walked off in the storm., It was useless to try to follow them, for their footfalls could make no sound, and one could pass within two yards of the creatures and never see them., We gave them up without an effort at recovering them, and cursed the lying books that said horses would stay by their masters for protection and companionship in a distressful time like ours., We were miserable enough, before; we felt still more forlorn, now., Patiently, but with blighted hope, we broke more sticks and piled them, and once more the Prussian shot them into annihilation., Plainly, to light a fire with a pistol was an art requiring practice and experience, and the middle of a desert at midnight in a snow-storm was not a good place or time for the acquiring of the accomplishment., We gave it up and tried the other., Each man took a couple of sticks and fell to chafing them together., At the end of half an hour we were thoroughly chilled, and so were the sticks., We bitterly execrated the Indians, the hunters and the books that had betrayed us with the silly device, and wondered dismally what was next to be done., At this critical moment Mr. Ballou fished out four matches from the rubbish of an overlooked pocket., To have found four gold bars would have seemed poor and cheap good luck compared to this., One cannot think how good a match looks under such circumstances--or how lovable and precious, and sacredly beautiful to the eye., This time we gathered sticks with high hopes; and when Mr. Ballou prepared to light the first match, there was an amount of interest centred upon him that pages of writing could not describe., The match burned hopefully a moment, and then went out., It could not have carried more regret with it if it had been a human life., The next match simply flashed and died., The wind puffed the third one out just as it was on the imminent verge of success., We gathered together closer than ever, and developed a solicitude that was rapt and painful, as Mr. Ballou scratched our last hope on his leg., It lit, burned blue and sickly, and then budded into a robust flame., Shading it with his hands, the old gentleman bent gradually down and every heart went with him--everybody, too, for that matter--and blood and breath stood still., The flame touched the sticks at last, took gradual hold upon them--hesitated--took a stronger hold --hesitated again--held its breath five heart-breaking seconds, then gave a sort of human gasp and went out., Nobody said a word for several minutes., It was a solemn sort of silence; even the wind put on a stealthy, sinister quiet, and made no more noise than the falling flakes of snow., Finally a sad-voiced conversation began, and it was soon apparent that in each of our hearts lay the conviction that this was our last night with the living., I had so hoped that I was the only one who felt so., When the others calmly acknowledged their conviction, it sounded like the summons itself., Ollendorff said:  ""Brothers, let us die together., And let us go without one hard feeling towards each other., Let us forget and forgive bygones., I know that you have felt hard towards me for turning over the canoe, and for knowing too much and leading you round and round in the snow--but I meant well; forgive me., I acknowledge freely that I have had hard feelings against Mr. Ballou for abusing me and calling me a logarythm, which is a thing I do not know what, but no doubt a thing considered disgraceful and unbecoming in America, and it has scarcely been out of my mind and has hurt me a great deal--but let it go; I forgive Mr. Ballou with all my heart, and--""  Poor Ollendorff broke down and the tears came., He was not alone, for I was crying too, and so was Mr. Ballou., Ollendorff got his voice again and forgave me for things I had done and said., Then he got out his bottle of whisky and said that whether he lived or died he would never touch another drop., He said he had given up all hope of life, and although ill-prepared, was ready to submit humbly to his fate; that he wished he could be spared a little longer, not for any selfish reason, but to make a thorough reform in his character, and by devoting himself to helping the poor, nursing the sick, and pleading with the people to guard themselves against the evils of intemperance, make his life a beneficent example to the young, and lay it down at last with the precious reflection that it had not been lived in vain., He ended by saying that his reform should begin at this moment, even here in the presence of death, since no longer time was to be vouchsafed wherein to prosecute it to men's help and benefit--and with that he threw away the bottle of whisky., Mr. Ballou made remarks of similar purport, and began the reform he could not live to continue, by throwing away the ancient pack of cards that had solaced our captivity during the flood and made it bearable., He said he never gambled, but still was satisfied that the meddling with cards in any way was immoral and injurious, and no man could be wholly pure and blemishless without eschewing them., ""And therefore,"" continued he, ""in doing this act I already feel more in sympathy with that spiritual saturnalia necessary to entire and obsolete reform."", These rolling syllables touched him as no intelligible eloquence could have done, and the old man sobbed with a mournfulness not unmingled with satisfaction., My own remarks were of the same tenor as those of my comrades, and I know that the feelings that prompted them were heartfelt and sincere., We were all sincere, and all deeply moved and earnest, for we were in the presence of death and without hope., I threw away my pipe, and in doing it felt that at last I was free of a hated vice and one that had ridden me like a tyrant all my days., While I yet talked, the thought of the good I might have done in the world and the still greater good I might now do, with these new incentives and higher and better aims to guide me if I could only be spared a few years longer, overcame me and the tears came again., We put our arms about each other's necks and awaited the warning drowsiness that precedes death by freezing., It came stealing over us presently, and then we bade each other a last farewell., A delicious dreaminess wrought its web about my yielding senses, while the snow-flakes wove a winding sheet about my conquered body., Oblivion came., The battle of life was done., I do not know how long I was in a state of forgetfulness, but it seemed an age., A vague consciousness grew upon me by degrees, and then came a gathering anguish of pain in my limbs and through all my body., I shuddered., The thought flitted through my brain, ""this is death--this is the hereafter."", Then came a white upheaval at my side, and a voice said, with bitterness:  ""Will some gentleman be so good as to kick me behind?"", It was Ballou--at least it was a towzled snow image in a sitting posture, with Ballou's voice., I rose up, and there in the gray dawn, not fifteen steps from us, were the frame buildings of a stage station, and under a shed stood our still saddled and bridled horses!, An arched snow-drift broke up, now, and Ollendorff emerged from it, and the three of us sat and stared at the houses without speaking a word., We really had nothing to say., We were like the profane man who could not ""do the subject justice,"" the whole situation was so painfully ridiculous and humiliating that words were tame and we did not know where to commence anyhow., The joy in our hearts at our deliverance was poisoned; well-nigh dissipated, indeed., We presently began to grow pettish by degrees, and sullen; and then, angry at each other, angry at ourselves, angry at everything in general, we moodily dusted the snow from our clothing and in unsociable single file plowed our way to the horses, unsaddled them, and sought shelter in the station., I have scarcely exaggerated a detail of this curious and absurd adventure., It occurred almost exactly as I have stated it., We actually went into camp in a snow-drift in a desert, at midnight in a storm, forlorn and hopeless, within fifteen steps of a comfortable inn., For two hours we sat apart in the station and ruminated in disgust., The mystery was gone, now, and it was plain enough why the horses had deserted us., Without a doubt they were under that shed a quarter of a minute after they had left us, and they must have overheard and enjoyed all our confessions and lamentations., After breakfast we felt better, and the zest of life soon came back., The world looked bright again, and existence was as dear to us as ever., Presently an uneasiness came over me--grew upon me--assailed me without ceasing., Alas, my regeneration was not complete--I wanted to smoke!, I resisted with all my strength, but the flesh was weak., I wandered away alone and wrestled with myself an hour., I recalled my promises of reform and preached to myself persuasively, upbraidingly, exhaustively., But it was all vain, I shortly found myself sneaking among the snow-drifts hunting for my pipe., I discovered it after a considerable search, and crept away to hide myself and enjoy it., I remained behind the barn a good while, asking myself how I would feel if my braver, stronger, truer comrades should catch me in my degradation., At last I lit the pipe, and no human being can feel meaner and baser than I did then., I was ashamed of being in my own pitiful company., Still dreading discovery, I felt that perhaps the further side of the barn would be somewhat safer, and so I turned the corner., As I turned the one corner, smoking, Ollendorff turned the other with his bottle to his lips, and between us sat unconscious Ballou deep in a game of ""solitaire"" with the old greasy cards!, ...]"|1
9|"[And he cleaned 'em, too!, I was there, pard, and I seen it myself."", ""That was very well indeed--at least the impulse was--whether the act was strictly defensible or not., Had deceased any religious convictions?, That is to say, did he feel a dependence upon, or acknowledge allegiance to a higher power?"", More reflection., ""I reckon you've stumped me again, pard., Could you say it over once more, and say it slow?"", ""Well, to simplify it somewhat, was he, or rather had he ever been connected with any organization sequestered from secular concerns and devoted to self-sacrifice in the interests of morality?"", ""All down but nine--set 'em up on the other alley, pard."", ""What did I understand you to say?"", ""Why, you're most too many for me, you know., When you get in with your left I hunt grass every time., Every time you draw, you fill; but I don't seem to have any luck., Lets have a new deal."", ""How?, Begin again?"", ""That's it."", ""Very well., Was he a good man, and--""  ""There--I see that; don't put up another chip till I look at my hand., A good man, says you?, Pard, it ain't no name for it., He was the best man that ever--pard, you would have doted on that man., He could lam any galoot of his inches in America., It was him that put down the riot last election before it got a start; and everybody said he was the only man that could have done it., He waltzed in with a spanner in one hand and a trumpet in the other, and sent fourteen men home on a shutter in less than three minutes., He had that riot all broke up and prevented nice before anybody ever got a chance to strike a blow., He was always for peace, and he would have peace--he could not stand disturbances., Pard, he was a great loss to this town., It would please the boys if you could chip in something like that and do him justice., Here once when the Micks got to throwing stones through the Methodis' Sunday school windows, Buck Fanshaw, all of his own notion, shut up his saloon and took a couple of six-shooters and mounted guard over the Sunday school., Says he, 'No Irish need apply!', And they didn't., He was the bulliest man in the mountains, pard!, He could run faster, jump higher, hit harder, and hold more tangle-foot whisky without spilling it than any man in seventeen counties., Put that in, pard--it'll please the boys more than anything you could say., And you can say, pard, that he never shook his mother."", ""Never shook his mother?"", ""That's it--any of the boys will tell you so."", ""Well, but why should he shake her?"", ""That's what I say--but some people does."", ""Not people of any repute?"", ""Well, some that averages pretty so-so."", ""In my opinion the man that would offer personal violence to his own mother, ought to--""  ""Cheese it, pard; you've banked your ball clean outside the string., What I was a drivin' at, was, that he never throwed off on his mother --don't you see?, No indeedy., He give her a house to live in, and town lots, and plenty of money; and he looked after her and took care of her all the time; and when she was down with the small-pox I'm d---d if he didn't set up nights and nuss her himself!, Beg your pardon for saying it, but it hopped out too quick for yours truly., ""You've treated me like a gentleman, pard, and I ain't the man to hurt your feelings intentional., I think you're white., I think you're a square man, pard., I like you, and I'll lick any man that don't., I'll lick him till he can't tell himself from a last year's corpse!, Put it there!"", [Another fraternal hand-shake--and exit.], The obsequies were all that ""the boys"" could desire., Such a marvel of funeral pomp had never been seen in Virginia., The plumed hearse, the dirge-breathing brass bands, the closed marts of business, the flags drooping at half mast, the long, plodding procession of uniformed secret societies, military battalions and fire companies, draped engines, carriages of officials, and citizens in vehicles and on foot, attracted multitudes of spectators to the sidewalks, roofs and windows; and for years afterward, the degree of grandeur attained by any civic display in Virginia was determined by comparison with Buck Fanshaw's funeral., Scotty Briggs, as a pall-bearer and a mourner, occupied a prominent place at the funeral, and when the sermon was finished and the last sentence of the prayer for the dead man's soul ascended, he responded, in a low voice, but with feelings:  ""AMEN., No Irish need apply."", As the bulk of the response was without apparent relevancy, it was probably nothing more than a humble tribute to the memory of the friend that was gone; for, as Scotty had once said, it was ""his word."", Scotty Briggs, in after days, achieved the distinction of becoming the only convert to religion that was ever gathered from the Virginia roughs; and it transpired that the man who had it in him to espouse the quarrel of the weak out of inborn nobility of spirit was no mean timber whereof to construct a Christian., The making him one did not warp his generosity or diminish his courage; on the contrary it gave intelligent direction to the one and a broader field to the other., If his Sunday-school class progressed faster than the other classes, was it matter for wonder?, I think not., He talked to his pioneer small-fry in a language they understood!, It was my large privilege, a month before he died, to hear him tell the beautiful story of Joseph and his brethren to his class ""without looking at the book."", I leave it to the reader to fancy what it was like, as it fell, riddled with slang, from the lips of that grave, earnest teacher, and was listened to by his little learners with a consuming interest that showed that they were as unconscious as he was that any violence was being done to the sacred proprieties!, The first twenty-six graves in the Virginia cemetery were occupied by murdered men., So everybody said, so everybody believed, and so they will always say and believe., The reason why there was so much slaughtering done, was, that in a new mining district the rough element predominates, and a person is not respected until he has ""killed his man."", That was the very expression used., If an unknown individual arrived, they did not inquire if he was capable, honest, industrious, but--had he killed his man?, If he had not, he gravitated to his natural and proper position, that of a man of small consequence; if he had, the cordiality of his reception was graduated according to the number of his dead., It was tedious work struggling up to a position of influence with bloodless hands; but when a man came with the blood of half a dozen men on his soul, his worth was recognized at once and his acquaintance sought., In Nevada, for a time, the lawyer, the editor, the banker, the chief desperado, the chief gambler, and the saloon keeper, occupied the same level in society, and it was the highest., The cheapest and easiest way to become an influential man and be looked up to by the community at large, was to stand behind a bar, wear a cluster-diamond pin, and sell whisky., I am not sure but that the saloon-keeper held a shade higher rank than any other member of society., His opinion had weight., It was his privilege to say how the elections should go., No great movement could succeed without the countenance and direction of the saloon-keepers., It was a high favor when the chief saloon-keeper consented to serve in the legislature or the board of aldermen., Youthful ambition hardly aspired so much to the honors of the law, or the army and navy as to the dignity of proprietorship in a saloon., To be a saloon-keeper and kill a man was to be illustrious., Hence the reader will not be surprised to learn that more than one man was killed in Nevada under hardly the pretext of provocation, so impatient was the slayer to achieve reputation and throw off the galling sense of being held in indifferent repute by his associates., I knew two youths who tried to ""kill their men"" for no other reason--and got killed themselves for their pains., ""There goes the man that killed Bill Adams"" was higher praise and a sweeter sound in the ears of this sort of people than any other speech that admiring lips could utter., The men who murdered Virginia's original twenty-six cemetery-occupants were never punished., Why?, Because Alfred the Great, when he invented trial by jury and knew that he had admirably framed it to secure justice in his age of the world, was not aware that in the nineteenth century the condition of things would be so entirely changed that unless he rose from the grave and altered the jury plan to meet the emergency, it would prove the most ingenious and infallible agency for defeating justice that human wisdom could contrive., For how could he imagine that we simpletons would go on using his jury plan after circumstances had stripped it of its usefulness, any more than he could imagine that we would go on using his candle-clock after we had invented chronometers?, In his day news could not travel fast, and hence he could easily find a jury of honest, intelligent men who had not heard of the case they were called to try --but in our day of telegraphs and newspapers his plan compels us to swear in juries composed of fools and rascals, because the system rigidly excludes honest men and men of brains., I remember one of those sorrowful farces, in Virginia, which we call a jury trial., A noted desperado killed Mr. B., a good citizen, in the most wanton and cold-blooded way., Of course the papers were full of it, and all men capable of reading, read about it., And of course all men not deaf and dumb and idiotic, talked about it., A jury-list was made out, and Mr. B. L., a prominent banker and a valued citizen, was questioned precisely as he would have been questioned in any court in America:  ""Have you heard of this homicide?"", ""Yes."", ""Have you held conversations upon the subject?"", ""Yes."", ...]"|1
10|"[The main part of his daily life was occupied in looking after ""Fan,"" in a motherly way, and doctoring her for a hundred ailments which existed only in his imagination., The Admiral seldom read newspapers; and when he did he never believed anything they said., He read nothing, and believed in nothing, but ""The Old Guard,"" a secession periodical published in New York., He carried a dozen copies of it with him, always, and referred to them for all required information., If it was not there, he supplied it himself, out of a bountiful fancy, inventing history, names, dates, and every thing else necessary to make his point good in an argument., Consequently he was a formidable antagonist in a dispute., Whenever he swung clear of the record and began to create history, the enemy was helpless and had to surrender., Indeed, the enemy could not keep from betraying some little spark of indignation at his manufactured history--and when it came to indignation, that was the Admiral's very ""best hold."", He was always ready for a political argument, and if nobody started one he would do it himself., With his third retort his temper would begin to rise, and within five minutes he would be blowing a gale, and within fifteen his smoking-room audience would be utterly stormed away and the old man left solitary and alone, banging the table with his fist, kicking the chairs, and roaring a hurricane of profanity., It got so, after a while, that whenever the Admiral approached, with politics in his eye, the passengers would drop out with quiet accord, afraid to meet him; and he would camp on a deserted field., But he found his match at last, and before a full company., At one time or another, everybody had entered the lists against him and been routed, except the quiet passenger Williams., He had never been able to get an expression of opinion out of him on politics., But now, just as the Admiral drew near the door and the company were about to slip out, Williams said:  ""Admiral, are you certain about that circumstance concerning the clergymen you mentioned the other day?"", --referring to a piece of the Admiral's manufactured history., Every one was amazed at the man's rashness., The idea of deliberately inviting annihilation was a thing incomprehensible., The retreat came to a halt; then everybody sat down again wondering, to await the upshot of it., The Admiral himself was as surprised as any one., He paused in the door, with his red handkerchief half raised to his sweating face, and contemplated the daring reptile in the corner., ""Certain of it?, Am I certain of it?, Do you think I've been lying about it?, What do you take me for?, Anybody that don't know that circumstance, don't know anything; a child ought to know it., Read up your history!, Read it up-----, and don't come asking a man if he's certain about a bit of ABC stuff that the very southern niggers know all about."", Here the Admiral's fires began to wax hot, the atmosphere thickened, the coming earthquake rumbled, he began to thunder and lighten., Within three minutes his volcano was in full irruption and he was discharging flames and ashes of indignation, belching black volumes of foul history aloft, and vomiting red-hot torrents of profanity from his crater., Meantime Williams sat silent, and apparently deeply and earnestly interested in what the old man was saying., By and by, when the lull came, he said in the most deferential way, and with the gratified air of a man who has had a mystery cleared up which had been puzzling him uncomfortably:  ""Now I understand it., I always thought I knew that piece of history well enough, but was still afraid to trust it, because there was not that convincing particularity about it that one likes to have in history; but when you mentioned every name, the other day, and every date, and every little circumstance, in their just order and sequence, I said to myself, this sounds something like--this is history--this is putting it in a shape that gives a man confidence; and I said to myself afterward, I will just ask the Admiral if he is perfectly certain about the details, and if he is I will come out and thank him for clearing this matter up for me., And that is what I want to do now--for until you set that matter right it was nothing but just a confusion in my mind, without head or tail to it."", Nobody ever saw the Admiral look so mollified before, and so pleased., Nobody had ever received his bogus history as gospel before; its genuineness had always been called in question either by words or looks; but here was a man that not only swallowed it all down, but was grateful for the dose., He was taken a back; he hardly knew what to say; even his profanity failed him., Now, Williams continued, modestly and earnestly:  ""But Admiral, in saying that this was the first stone thrown, and that this precipitated the war, you have overlooked a circumstance which you are perfectly familiar with, but which has escaped your memory., Now I grant you that what you have stated is correct in every detail--to wit: that on the 16th of October, 1860, two Massachusetts clergymen, named Waite and Granger, went in disguise to the house of John Moody, in Rockport, at dead of night, and dragged forth two southern women and their two little children, and after tarring and feathering them conveyed them to Boston and burned them alive in the State House square; and I also grant your proposition that this deed is what led to the secession of South Carolina on the 20th of December following., Very well."", [Here the company were pleasantly surprised to hear Williams proceed to come back at the Admiral with his own invincible weapon--clean, pure, manufactured history, without a word of truth in it.], ""Very well, I say., But Admiral, why overlook the Willis and Morgan case in South Carolina?, You are too well informed a man not to know all about that circumstance., Your arguments and your conversations have shown you to be intimately conversant with every detail of this national quarrel., You develop matters of history every day that show plainly that you are no smatterer in it, content to nibble about the surface, but a man who has searched the depths and possessed yourself of everything that has a bearing upon the great question., Therefore, let me just recall to your mind that Willis and Morgan case--though I see by your face that the whole thing is already passing through your memory at this moment., On the 12th of August, 1860, two months before the Waite and Granger affair, two South Carolina clergymen, named John H. Morgan and Winthrop L.  Willis, one a Methodist and the other an Old School Baptist, disguised themselves, and went at midnight to the house of a planter named Thompson--Archibald F. Thompson, Vice President under Thomas Jefferson,--and took thence, at midnight, his widowed aunt, (a Northern woman,) and her adopted child, an orphan--named Mortimer Highie, afflicted with epilepsy and suffering at the time from white swelling on one of his legs, and compelled to walk on crutches in consequence; and the two ministers, in spite of the pleadings of the victims, dragged them to the bush, tarred and feathered them, and afterward burned them at the stake in the city of Charleston., You remember perfectly well what a stir it made; you remember perfectly well that even the Charleston Courier stigmatized the act as being unpleasant, of questionable propriety, and scarcely justifiable, and likewise that it would not be matter of surprise if retaliation ensued., And you remember also, that this thing was the cause of the Massachusetts outrage., Who, indeed, were the two Massachusetts ministers?, and who were the two Southern women they burned?, I do not need to remind you, Admiral, with your intimate knowledge of history, that Waite was the nephew of the woman burned in Charleston; that Granger was her cousin in the second degree, and that the woman they burned in Boston was the wife of John H. Morgan, and the still loved but divorced wife of Winthrop L. Willis., Now, Admiral, it is only fair that you should acknowledge that the first provocation came from the Southern preachers and that the Northern ones were justified in retaliating., In your arguments you never yet have shown the least disposition to withhold a just verdict or be in anywise unfair, when authoritative history condemned your position, and therefore I have no hesitation in asking you to take the original blame from the Massachusetts ministers, in this matter, and transfer it to the South Carolina clergymen where it justly belongs."", The Admiral was conquered., This sweet spoken creature who swallowed his fraudulent history as if it were the bread of life; basked in his furious blasphemy as if it were generous sunshine; found only calm, even-handed justice in his rampart partisanship; and flooded him with invented history so sugarcoated with flattery and deference that there was no rejecting it, was ""too many"" for him., He stammered some awkward, profane sentences about the-----Willis and Morgan business having escaped his memory, but that he ""remembered it now,"" and then, under pretence of giving Fan some medicine for an imaginary cough, drew out of the battle and went away, a vanquished man., Then cheers and laughter went up, and Williams, the ship's benefactor was a hero., The news went about the vessel, champagne was ordered, and enthusiastic reception instituted in the smoking room, and everybody flocked thither to shake hands with the conqueror., The wheelman said afterward, that the Admiral stood up behind the pilot house and ""ripped and cursed all to himself"" till he loosened the smokestack guys and becalmed the mainsail., The Admiral's power was broken., After that, if he began argument, somebody would bring Williams, and the old man would grow weak and begin to quiet down at once., And as soon as he was done, Williams in his dulcet, insinuating way, would invent some history (referring for proof, to the old man's own excellent memory and to copies of ""The Old Guard"" known not to be in his possession) that would turn the tables completely and leave the Admiral all abroad and helpless., By and by he came to so dread Williams and his gilded tongue that he would stop talking when he saw him approach, and finally ceased to mention politics altogether, and from that time forward there was entire peace and serenity in the ship., On a certain bright morning the Islands hove in sight, lying low on the lonely sea, and everybody climbed to the upper deck to look., After two thousand miles of watery solitude the vision was a welcome one., As we approached, the imposing promontory of Diamond Head rose up out of the ocean its rugged front softened by the hazy distance, and presently the details of the land began to make themselves manifest: first the line of beach; then the plumed coacoanut trees of the tropics; then cabins of the natives; then the white town of Honolulu, said to contain between twelve and fifteen thousand inhabitants spread over a dead level; with streets from twenty to thirty feet wide, solid and level as a floor, most of them straight as a line and few as crooked as a corkscrew., The further I traveled through the town the better I liked it., Every step revealed a new contrast--disclosed something I was unaccustomed to., In place of the grand mud-colored brown fronts of San Francisco, I saw dwellings built of straw, adobies, and cream-colored pebble-and-shell-conglomerated coral, cut into oblong blocks and laid in cement; also a great number of neat white cottages, with green window-shutters; in place of front yards like billiard-tables with iron fences around them, I saw these homes surrounded by ample yards, thickly clad with green grass, and shaded by tall trees, through whose dense foliage the sun could scarcely penetrate; in place of the customary geranium, calla lily, etc., languishing in dust and general debility, I saw luxurious banks and thickets of flowers, fresh as a meadow after a rain, and glowing with the richest dyes; in place of the dingy horrors of San Francisco's pleasure grove, the ""Willows,"" I saw huge-bodied, wide-spreading forest trees, with strange names and stranger appearance --trees that cast a shadow like a thunder-cloud, and were able to stand alone without being tied to green poles; in place of gold fish, wiggling around in glass globes, assuming countless shades and degrees of distortion through the magnifying and diminishing qualities of their transparent prison houses, I saw cats--Tom-cats, Mary Ann cats, long-tailed cats, bob-tailed cats, blind cats, one-eyed cats, wall-eyed cats, cross-eyed cats, gray cats, black cats, white cats, yellow cats, striped cats, spotted cats, tame cats, wild cats, singed cats, individual cats, groups of cats, platoons of cats, companies of cats, regiments of cats, armies of cats, multitudes of cats, millions of cats, and all of them sleek, fat, lazy and sound asleep., I looked on a multitude of people, some white, in white coats, vests, pantaloons, even white cloth shoes, made snowy with chalk duly laid on every morning; but the majority of the people were almost as dark as negroes--women with comely features, fine black eyes, rounded forms, inclining to the voluptuous, clad in a single bright red or white garment that fell free and unconfined from shoulder to heel, long black hair falling loose, gypsy hats, encircled with wreaths of natural flowers of a brilliant carmine tint; plenty of dark men in various costumes, and some with nothing on but a battered stove-pipe hat tilted on the nose, and a very scant breech-clout; --certain smoke-dried children were clothed in nothing but sunshine --a very neat fitting and picturesque apparel indeed., In place of roughs and rowdies staring and blackguarding on the corners, I saw long-haired, saddle-colored Sandwich Island maidens sitting on the ground in the shade of corner houses, gazing indolently at whatever or whoever happened along; instead of wretched cobble-stone pavements, I walked on a firm foundation of coral, built up from the bottom of the sea by the absurd but persevering insect of that name, with a light layer of lava and cinders overlying the coral, belched up out of fathomless perdition long ago through the seared and blackened crater that stands dead and harmless in the distance now; instead of cramped and crowded street-cars, I met dusky native women sweeping by, free as the wind, on fleet horses and astride, with gaudy riding-sashes, streaming like banners behind them; instead of the combined stenches of Chinadom and Brannan street slaughter-houses, I breathed the balmy fragrance of jessamine, oleander, and the Pride of India; in place of the hurry and bustle and noisy confusion of San Francisco, I moved in the midst of a Summer calm as tranquil as dawn in the Garden of Eden; in place of the Golden City's skirting sand hills and the placid bay, I saw on the one side a frame-work of tall, precipitous mountains close at hand, clad in refreshing green, and cleft by deep, cool, chasm-like valleys--and in front the grand sweep of the ocean; a brilliant, transparent green near the shore, bound and bordered by a long white line of foamy spray dashing against the reef, and further out the dead blue water of the deep sea, flecked with ""white caps,"" and in the far horizon a single, lonely sail --a mere accent-mark to emphasize a slumberous calm and a solitude that were without sound or limit., When the sun sunk down--the one intruder from other realms and persistent in suggestions of them--it was tranced luxury to sit in the perfumed air and forget that there was any world but these enchanted islands., It was such ecstacy to dream, and dream--till you got a bite., A scorpion bite., Then the first duty was to get up out of the grass and kill the scorpion; and the next to bathe the bitten place with alcohol or brandy; and the next to resolve to keep out of the grass in future., Then came an adjournment to the bed-chamber and the pastime of writing up the day's journal with one hand and the destruction of mosquitoes with the other--a whole community of them at a slap., Then, observing an enemy approaching,--a hairy tarantula on stilts--why not set the spittoon on him?, It is done, and the projecting ends of his paws give a luminous idea of the magnitude of his reach., Then to bed and become a promenade for a centipede with forty-two legs on a side and every foot hot enough to burn a hole through a raw-hide., More soaking with alcohol, and a resolution to examine the bed before entering it, in future., Then wait, and suffer, till all the mosquitoes in the neighborhood have crawled in under the bar, then slip out quickly, shut them in and sleep peacefully on the floor till morning., Meantime it is comforting to curse the tropics in occasional wakeful intervals., We had an abundance of fruit in Honolulu, of course., Oranges, pine-apples, bananas, strawberries, lemons, limes, mangoes, guavas, melons, and a rare and curious luxury called the chirimoya, which is deliciousness itself., Then there is the tamarind., I thought tamarinds were made to eat, but that was probably not the idea., I ate several, and it seemed to me that they were rather sour that year., They pursed up my lips, till they resembled the stem-end of a tomato, and I had to take my sustenance through a quill for twenty-four hours., They sharpened my teeth till I could have shaved with them, and gave them a ""wire edge"" that I was afraid would stay; but a citizen said ""no, it will come off when the enamel does""--which was comforting, at any rate., I found, afterward, that only strangers eat tamarinds--but they only eat them once., In my diary of our third day in Honolulu, I find this:  I am probably the most sensitive man in Hawaii to-night--especially about sitting down in the presence of my betters., I have ridden fifteen or twenty miles on horse-back since 5 P.M.  and to tell the honest truth, I have a delicacy about sitting down at all., An excursion to Diamond Head and the King's Coacoanut Grove was planned to-day--time, 4:30 P.M.--the party to consist of half a dozen gentlemen and three ladies., They all started at the appointed hour except myself., I was at the Government prison, (with Captain Fish and another whaleship-skipper, Captain Phillips,) and got so interested in its examination that I did not notice how quickly the time was passing., Somebody remarked that it was twenty minutes past five o'clock, and that woke me up., It was a fortunate circumstance that Captain Phillips was along with his ""turn out,"" as he calls a top-buggy that Captain Cook brought here in 1778, and a horse that was here when Captain Cook came., Captain Phillips takes a just pride in his driving and in the speed of his horse, and to his passion for displaying them I owe it that we were only sixteen minutes coming from the prison to the American Hotel--a distance which has been estimated to be over half a mile., ...]"|1
11|"[He recognized that it was better to move to the wilderness than be moved., By his command the people gathered together their meagre effects, turned their backs upon their homes, and their faces toward the wilderness, and on a bitter night in February filed in sorrowful procession across the frozen Mississippi, lighted on their way by the glare from their burning temple, whose sacred furniture their own hands had fired!, They camped, several days afterward, on the western verge of Iowa, and poverty, want, hunger, cold, sickness, grief and persecution did their work, and many succumbed and died--martyrs, fair and true, whatever else they might have been., Two years the remnant remained there, while Brigham and a small party crossed the country and founded Great Salt Lake City, purposely choosing a land which was outside the ownership and jurisdiction of the hated American nation., Note that., This was in 1847., Brigham moved his people there and got them settled just in time to see disaster fall again., For the war closed and Mexico ceded Brigham's refuge to the enemy--the United States!, In 1849 the Mormons organized a ""free and independent"" government and erected the ""State of Deseret,"" with Brigham Young as its head., But the very next year Congress deliberately snubbed it and created the ""Territory of Utah"" out of the same accumulation of mountains, sage-brush, alkali and general desolation,--but made Brigham Governor of it., Then for years the enormous migration across the plains to California poured through the land of the Mormons and yet the church remained staunch and true to its lord and master., Neither hunger, thirst, poverty, grief, hatred, contempt, nor persecution could drive the Mormons from their faith or their allegiance; and even the thirst for gold, which gleaned the flower of the youth and strength of many nations was not able to entice them!, That was the final test., An experiment that could survive that was an experiment with some substance to it somewhere., Great Salt Lake City throve finely, and so did Utah., One of the last things which Brigham Young had done before leaving Iowa, was to appear in the pulpit dressed to personate the worshipped and lamented prophet Smith, and confer the prophetic succession, with all its dignities, emoluments and authorities, upon ""President Brigham Young!"", The people accepted the pious fraud with the maddest enthusiasm, and Brigham's power was sealed and secured for all time., Within five years afterward he openly added polygamy to the tenets of the church by authority of a ""revelation"" which he pretended had been received nine years before by Joseph Smith, albeit Joseph is amply on record as denouncing polygamy to the day of his death., Now was Brigham become a second Andrew Johnson in the small beginning and steady progress of his official grandeur., He had served successively as a disciple in the ranks; home missionary; foreign missionary; editor and publisher; Apostle; President of the Board of Apostles; President of all Mormondom, civil and ecclesiastical; successor to the great Joseph by the will of heaven; ""prophet,"" ""seer,"" ""revelator."", There was but one dignity higher which he could aspire to, and he reached out modestly and took that--he proclaimed himself a God!, He claims that he is to have a heaven of his own hereafter, and that he will be its God, and his wives and children its goddesses, princes and princesses., Into it all faithful Mormons will be admitted, with their families, and will take rank and consequence according to the number of their wives and children., If a disciple dies before he has had time to accumulate enough wives and children to enable him to be respectable in the next world any friend can marry a few wives and raise a few children for him after he is dead, and they are duly credited to his account and his heavenly status advanced accordingly., Let it be borne in mind that the majority of the Mormons have always been ignorant, simple, of an inferior order of intellect, unacquainted with the world and its ways; and let it be borne in mind that the wives of these Mormons are necessarily after the same pattern and their children likely to be fit representatives of such a conjunction; and then let it be remembered that for forty years these creatures have been driven, driven, driven, relentlessly!, and mobbed, beaten, and shot down; cursed, despised, expatriated; banished to a remote desert, whither they journeyed gaunt with famine and disease, disturbing the ancient solitudes with their lamentations and marking the long way with graves of their dead--and all because they were simply trying to live and worship God in the way which they believed with all their hearts and souls to be the true one., Let all these things be borne in mind, and then it will not be hard to account for the deathless hatred which the Mormons bear our people and our government., That hatred has ""fed fat its ancient grudge"" ever since Mormon Utah developed into a self-supporting realm and the church waxed rich and strong., Brigham as Territorial Governor made it plain that Mormondom was for the Mormons., The United States tried to rectify all that by appointing territorial officers from New England and other anti-Mormon localities, but Brigham prepared to make their entrance into his dominions difficult., Three thousand United States troops had to go across the plains and put these gentlemen in office., And after they were in office they were as helpless as so many stone images., They made laws which nobody minded and which could not be executed., The federal judges opened court in a land filled with crime and violence and sat as holiday spectacles for insolent crowds to gape at--for there was nothing to try, nothing to do nothing on the dockets!, And if a Gentile brought a suit, the Mormon jury would do just as it pleased about bringing in a verdict, and when the judgment of the court was rendered no Mormon cared for it and no officer could execute it., Our Presidents shipped one cargo of officials after another to Utah, but the result was always the same--they sat in a blight for awhile they fairly feasted on scowls and insults day by day, they saw every attempt to do their official duties find its reward in darker and darker looks, and in secret threats and warnings of a more and more dismal nature--and at last they either succumbed and became despised tools and toys of the Mormons, or got scared and discomforted beyond all endurance and left the Territory., If a brave officer kept on courageously till his pluck was proven, some pliant Buchanan or Pierce would remove him and appoint a stick in his place., In 1857 General Harney came very near being appointed Governor of Utah., And so it came very near being Harney governor and Cradlebaugh judge!, --two men who never had any idea of fear further than the sort of murky comprehension of it which they were enabled to gather from the dictionary., Simply (if for nothing else) for the variety they would have made in a rather monotonous history of Federal servility and helplessness, it is a pity they were not fated to hold office together in Utah., Up to the date of our visit to Utah, such had been the Territorial record., The Territorial government established there had been a hopeless failure, and Brigham Young was the only real power in the land., He was an absolute monarch--a monarch who defied our President--a monarch who laughed at our armies when they camped about his capital--a monarch who received without emotion the news that the august Congress of the United States had enacted a solemn law against polygamy, and then went forth calmly and married twenty-five or thirty more wives., B., THE MOUNTAIN MEADOWS MASSACRE., The persecutions which the Mormons suffered so long--and which they consider they still suffer in not being allowed to govern themselves --they have endeavored and are still endeavoring to repay., The now almost forgotten ""Mountain Meadows massacre"" was their work., It was very famous in its day., The whole United States rang with its horrors., A few items will refresh the reader's memory., A great emigrant train from Missouri and Arkansas passed through Salt Lake City and a few disaffected Mormons joined it for the sake of the strong protection it afforded for their escape., In that matter lay sufficient cause for hot retaliation by the Mormon chiefs., Besides, these one hundred and forty-five or one hundred and fifty unsuspecting emigrants being in part from Arkansas, where a noted Mormon missionary had lately been killed, and in part from Missouri, a State remembered with execrations as a bitter persecutor of the saints when they were few and poor and friendless, here were substantial additional grounds for lack of love for these wayfarers., And finally, this train was rich, very rich in cattle, horses, mules and other property--and how could the Mormons consistently keep up their coveted resemblance to the Israelitish tribes and not seize the ""spoil"" of an enemy when the Lord had so manifestly ""delivered it into their hand?"", Wherefore, according to Mrs. C. V. Waite's entertaining book, ""The Mormon Prophet,"" it transpired that--  ""A 'revelation' from Brigham Young, as Great Grand Archee or God, was dispatched to President J. C. Haight, Bishop Higbee and J. D. Lee (adopted son of Brigham), commanding them to raise all the forces they could muster and trust, follow those cursed Gentiles (so read the revelation), attack them disguised as Indians, and with the arrows of the Almighty make a clean sweep of them, and leave none to tell the tale; and if they needed any assistance they were commanded to hire the Indians as their allies, promising them a share of the booty., They were to be neither slothful nor negligent in their duty, and to be punctual in sending the teams back to him before winter set in, for this was the mandate of Almighty God."", The command of the ""revelation"" was faithfully obeyed., A large party of Mormons, painted and tricked out as Indians, overtook the train of emigrant wagons some three hundred miles south of Salt Lake City, and made an attack., But the emigrants threw up earthworks, made fortresses of their wagons and defended themselves gallantly and successfully for five days!, Your Missouri or Arkansas gentleman is not much afraid of the sort of scurvy apologies for ""Indians"" which the southern part of Utah affords., He would stand up and fight five hundred of them., At the end of the five days the Mormons tried military strategy., They retired to the upper end of the ""Meadows,"" resumed civilized apparel, washed off their paint, and then, heavily armed, drove down in wagons to the beleaguered emigrants, bearing a flag of truce!, When the emigrants saw white men coming they threw down their guns and welcomed them with cheer after cheer!, And, all unconscious of the poetry of it, no doubt, they lifted a little child aloft, dressed in white, in answer to the flag of truce!, The leaders of the timely white ""deliverers"" were President Haight and Bishop John D. Lee, of the Mormon Church., Mr. Cradlebaugh, who served a term as a Federal Judge in Utah and afterward was sent to Congress from Nevada, tells in a speech delivered in Congress how these leaders next proceeded:  ""They professed to be on good terms with the Indians, and represented them as being very mad., They also proposed to intercede and settle the matter with the Indians., After several hours parley they, having (apparently) visited the Indians, gave the ultimatum of the savages; which was, that the emigrants should march out of their camp, leaving everything behind them, even their guns., It was promised by the Mormon bishops that they would bring a force and guard the emigrants back to the settlements., The terms were agreed to, the emigrants being desirous of saving the lives of their families., The Mormons retired, and subsequently appeared with thirty or forty armed men., The emigrants were marched out, the women and children in front and the men behind, the Mormon guard being in the rear., When they had marched in this way about a mile, at a given signal the slaughter commenced., The men were almost all shot down at the first fire from the guard., Two only escaped, who fled to the desert, and were followed one hundred and fifty miles before they were overtaken and slaughtered., The women and children ran on, two or three hundred yards further, when they were overtaken and with the aid of the Indians they were slaughtered., Seventeen individuals only, of all the emigrant party, were spared, and they were little children, the eldest of them being only seven years old., Thus, on the 10th day of September, 1857, was consummated one of the most cruel, cowardly and bloody murders known in our history."", The number of persons butchered by the Mormons on this occasion was one hundred and twenty., With unheard-of temerity Judge Cradlebaugh opened his court and proceeded to make Mormondom answer for the massacre., And what a spectacle it must have been to see this grim veteran, solitary and alone in his pride and his pluck, glowering down on his Mormon jury and Mormon auditory, deriding them by turns, and by turns ""breathing threatenings and slaughter!"", An editorial in the Territorial Enterprise of that day says of him and of the occasion:  ""He spoke and acted with the fearlessness and resolution of a Jackson; but the jury failed to indict, or even report on the charges, while threats of violence were heard in every quarter, and an attack on the U.S. troops intimated, if he persisted in his course., ""Finding that nothing could be done with the juries, they were discharged with a scathing rebuke from the judge., And then, sitting as a committing magistrate, he commenced his task alone., He examined witnesses, made arrests in every quarter, and created a consternation in the camps of the saints greater than any they had ever witnessed before, since Mormondom was born., At last accounts terrified elders and bishops were decamping to save their necks; and developments of the most starling character were being made, implicating the highest Church dignitaries in the many murders and robberies committed upon the Gentiles during the past eight years."", Had Harney been Governor, Cradlebaugh would have been supported in his work, and the absolute proofs adduced by him of Mormon guilt in this massacre and in a number of previous murders, would have conferred gratuitous coffins upon certain citizens, together with occasion to use them., But Cumming was the Federal Governor, and he, under a curious pretense of impartiality, sought to screen the Mormons from the demands of justice., On one occasion he even went so far as to publish his protest against the use of the U.S. troops in aid of Cradlebaugh's proceedings., Mrs. C. V. Waite closes her interesting detail of the great massacre with the following remark and accompanying summary of the testimony--and the summary is concise, accurate and reliable:  ""For the benefit of those who may still be disposed to doubt the guilt of Young and his Mormons in this transaction, the testimony is here collated and circumstances given which go not merely to implicate but to fasten conviction upon them by 'confirmations strong as proofs of Holy Writ:'  ""1., The evidence of Mormons themselves, engaged in the affair, as shown by the statements of Judge Cradlebaugh and Deputy U.S.  Marshall Rodgers., ""2., The failure of Brigham Young to embody any account of it in his Report as Superintendent of Indian Affairs., Also his failure to make any allusion to it whatever from the pulpit, until several years after the occurrence  ""3., The flight to the mountains of men high in authority in the Mormon Church and State, when this affair was brought to the ordeal of a judicial investigation., ""4., The failure of the Deseret News, the Church organ, and the only paper then published in the Territory, to notice the massacre until several months afterward, and then only to deny that Mormons were engaged in it., ""5., ...]"|1
12|"[But there's a bigger thing than that, yes bigger----""  ""Why Colonel, you can't want anything bigger!"", said Washington, his eyes blazing., ""Oh, I wish I could go into either of those speculations--I only wish I had money--I wish I wasn't cramped and kept down and fettered with poverty, and such prodigious chances lying right here in sight!, Oh, it is a fearful thing to be poor., But don't throw away those things --they are so splendid and I can see how sure they are., Don't throw them away for something still better and maybe fail in it!, I wouldn't, Colonel., I would stick to these., I wish father were here and were his old self again--Oh, he never in his life had such chances as these are., Colonel; you can't improve on these--no man can improve on them!"", A sweet, compassionate smile played about the Colonel's features, and he leaned over the table with the air of a man who is ""going to show you"" and do it without the least trouble:  ""Why Washington, my boy, these things are nothing., They look large of course--they look large to a novice, but to a man who has been all his life accustomed to large operations--shaw!, They're well enough to while away an idle hour with, or furnish a bit of employment that will give a trifle of idle capital a chance to earn its bread while it is waiting for something to do, but--now just listen a moment--just let me give you an idea of what we old veterans of commerce call 'business.', Here's the Rothschild's proposition--this is between you and me, you understand----""  Washington nodded three or four times impatiently, and his glowing eyes said, ""Yes, yes--hurry--I understand----""  ----""for I wouldn't have it get out for a fortune., They want me to go in with them on the sly--agent was here two weeks ago about it--go in on the sly"" [voice down to an impressive whisper, now,] ""and buy up a hundred and thirteen wild cat banks in Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky, Illinois and Missouri--notes of these banks are at all sorts of discount now--average discount of the hundred and thirteen is forty-four per cent--buy them all up, you see, and then all of a sudden let the cat out of the bag!, Whiz!, the stock of every one of those wildcats would spin up to a tremendous premium before you could turn a handspring--profit on the speculation not a dollar less than forty millions!"", [An eloquent pause, while the marvelous vision settled into W.'s focus.], ""Where's your hogs now?, Why my dear innocent boy, we would just sit down on the front door-steps and peddle banks like lucifer matches!"", Washington finally got his breath and said:  ""Oh, it is perfectly wonderful!, Why couldn't these things have happened in father's day?, And I--it's of no use--they simply lie before my face and mock me., There is nothing for me but to stand helpless and see other people reap the astonishing harvest."", ""Never mind, Washington, don't you worry., I'll fix you., There's plenty of chances., How much money have you got?"", In the presence of so many millions, Washington could not keep from blushing when he had to confess that he had but eighteen dollars in the world., ""Well, all right--don't despair., Other people have been obliged to begin with less., I have a small idea that may develop into something for us both, all in good time., Keep your money close and add to it., I'll make it breed., I've been experimenting (to pass away the time), on a little preparation for curing sore eyes--a kind of decoction nine-tenths water and the other tenth drugs that don't cost more than a dollar a barrel; I'm still experimenting; there's one ingredient wanted yet to perfect the thing, and somehow I can't just manage to hit upon the thing that's necessary, and I don't dare talk with a chemist, of course., But I'm progressing, and before many weeks I wager the country will ring with the fame of Beriah Sellers' Infallible Imperial Oriental Optic Liniment and Salvation for Sore Eyes--the Medical Wonder of the Age!, Small bottles fifty cents, large ones a dollar., Average cost, five and seven cents for the two sizes., ""The first year sell, say, ten thousand bottles in Missouri, seven thousand in Iowa, three thousand in Arkansas, four thousand in Kentucky, six thousand in Illinois, and say twenty-five thousand in the rest of the country., Total, fifty five thousand bottles; profit clear of all expenses, twenty thousand dollars at the very lowest calculation., All the capital needed is to manufacture the first two thousand bottles --say a hundred and fifty dollars--then the money would begin to flow in., The second year, sales would reach 200,000 bottles--clear profit, say, $75,000--and in the meantime the great factory would be building in St. Louis, to cost, say, $100,000., The third year we could, easily sell 1,000,000 bottles in the United States and----""  ""O, splendid!"", said Washington., ""Let's commence right away--let's----""  ""----1,000,000 bottles in the United States--profit at least $350,000 --and then it would begin to be time to turn our attention toward the real idea of the business."", ""The real idea of it!, Ain't $350,000 a year a pretty real----""  ""Stuff!, Why what an infant you are, Washington--what a guileless, short-sighted, easily-contented innocent you, are, my poor little country-bred know-nothing!, Would I go to all that trouble and bother for the poor crumbs a body might pick up in this country?, Now do I look like a man who----does my history suggest that I am a man who deals in trifles, contents himself with the narrow horizon that hems in the common herd, sees no further than the end of his nose?, Now you know that that is not me--couldn't be me., You ought to know that if I throw my time and abilities into a patent medicine, it's a patent medicine whose field of operations is the solid earth!, its clients the swarming nations that inhabit it!, Why what is the republic of America for an eye-water country?, Lord bless you, it is nothing but a barren highway that you've got to cross to get to the true eye-water market!, Why, Washington, in the Oriental countries people swarm like the sands of the desert; every square mile of ground upholds its thousands upon thousands of struggling human creatures--and every separate and individual devil of them's got the ophthalmia!, It's as natural to them as noses are--and sin., It's born with them, it stays with them, it's all that some of them have left when they die., Three years of introductory trade in the orient and what will be the result?, Why, our headquarters would be in Constantinople and our hindquarters in Further India!, Factories and warehouses in Cairo, Ispahan, Bagdad, Damascus, Jerusalem, Yedo, Peking, Bangkok, Delhi, Bombay--and Calcutta!, Annual income--well, God only knows how many millions and millions apiece!"", Washington was so dazed, so bewildered--his heart and his eyes had wandered so far away among the strange lands beyond the seas, and such avalanches of coin and currency had fluttered and jingled confusedly down before him, that he was now as one who has been whirling round and round for a time, and, stopping all at once, finds his surroundings still whirling and all objects a dancing chaos., However, little by little the Sellers family cooled down and crystalized into shape, and the poor room lost its glitter and resumed its poverty., Then the youth found his voice and begged Sellers to drop everything and hurry up the eye-water; and he got his eighteen dollars and tried to force it upon the Colonel--pleaded with him to take it--implored him to do it., But the Colonel would not; said he would not need the capital (in his native magnificent way he called that eighteen dollars Capital) till the eye-water was an accomplished fact., He made Washington easy in his mind, though, by promising that he would call for it just as soon as the invention was finished, and he added the glad tidings that nobody but just they two should be admitted to a share in the speculation., When Washington left the breakfast table he could have worshiped that man., Washington was one of that kind of people whose hopes are in the very, clouds one day and in the gutter the next., He walked on air, now., The Colonel was ready to take him around and introduce him to the employment he had found for him, but Washington begged for a few moments in which to write home; with his kind of people, to ride to-day's new interest to death and put off yesterday's till another time, is nature itself., He ran up stairs and wrote glowingly, enthusiastically, to his mother about the hogs and the corn, the banks and the eye-water--and added a few inconsequential millions to each project., And he said that people little dreamed what a man Col., Sellers was, and that the world would open its eyes when it found out., And he closed his letter thus:  ""So make yourself perfectly easy, mother-in a little while you shall have everything you want, and more., I am not likely to stint you in anything, I fancy., This money will not be for me, alone, but for all of us., I want all to share alike; and there is going to be far more for each than one person can spend., Break it to father cautiously--you understand the need of that--break it to him cautiously, for he has had such cruel hard fortune, and is so stricken by it that great good news might prostrate him more surely than even bad, for he is used to the bad but is grown sadly unaccustomed to the other., Tell Laura--tell all the children., And write to Clay about it if he is not with you yet., You may tell Clay that whatever I get he can freely share in-freely., He knows that that is true--there will be no need that I should swear to that to make him believe it., Good-bye--and mind what I say: Rest perfectly easy, one and all of you, for our troubles are nearly at an end."", Poor lad, he could not know that his mother would cry some loving, compassionate tears over his letter and put off the family with a synopsis of its contents which conveyed a deal of love to then but not much idea of his prospects or projects., And he never dreamed that such a joyful letter could sadden her and fill her night with sighs, and troubled thoughts, and bodings of the future, instead of filling it with peace and blessing it with restful sleep., When the letter was done, Washington and the Colonel sallied forth, and as they walked along Washington learned what he was to be., He was to be a clerk in a real estate office., Instantly the fickle youth's dreams forsook the magic eye-water and flew back to the Tennessee Land., And the gorgeous possibilities of that great domain straightway began to occupy his imagination to such a degree that he could scarcely manage to keep even enough of his attention upon the Colonel's talk to retain the general run of what he was saying., He was glad it was a real estate office--he was a made man now, sure., The Colonel said that General Boswell was a rich man and had a good and growing business; and that Washington's work world be light and he would get forty dollars a month and be boarded and lodged in the General's family--which was as good as ten dollars more; and even better, for he could not live as well even at the ""City Hotel"" as he would there, and yet the hotel charged fifteen dollars a month where a man had a good room., General Boswell was in his office; a comfortable looking place, with plenty of outline maps hanging about the walls and in the windows, and a spectacled man was marking out another one on a long table., The office was in the principal street., The General received Washington with a kindly but reserved politeness., Washington rather liked his looks., He was about fifty years old, dignified, well preserved and well dressed., After the Colonel took his leave, the General talked a while with Washington--his talk consisting chiefly of instructions about the clerical duties of the place., He seemed satisfied as to Washington's ability to take care of the books, he was evidently a pretty fair theoretical bookkeeper, and experience would soon harden theory into practice., By and by dinner-time came, and the two walked to the General's house; and now Washington noticed an instinct in himself that moved him to keep not in the General's rear, exactly, but yet not at his side--somehow the old gentleman's dignity and reserve did not inspire familiarity., ...]"|1
13|"[Money or beauty will open any door., If I were a handsome woman, I shouldn't want any better place than the capital to pick up a prince or a fortune."", ""Thank you,"" replied Laura., ""But I prefer the quiet of home, and the love of those I know;"" and her face wore a look of sweet contentment and unworldliness that finished Mr. Harry Brierly for the day., Nevertheless, the hint that Harry had dropped fell upon good ground, and bore fruit an hundred fold; it worked in her mind until she had built up a plan on it, and almost a career for herself., Why not, she said, why shouldn't I do as other women have done?, She took the first opportunity to see Col., Sellers, and to sound him about the Washington visit., How was he getting on with his navigation scheme, would it be likely to take him from home to Jefferson City; or to Washington, perhaps?, ""Well, maybe., If the people of Napoleon want me to go to Washington, and look after that matter, I might tear myself from my home., It's been suggested to me, but--not a word of it to Mrs., Sellers and the children., Maybe they wouldn't like to think of their father in Washington., But Dilworthy, Senator Dilworthy, says to me, 'Colonel, you are the man, you could influence more votes than any one else on such a measure, an old settler, a man of the people, you know the wants of Missouri; you've a respect for religion too, says he, and know how the cause of the gospel goes with improvements: Which is true enough, Miss Laura, and hasn't been enough thought of in connection with Napoleon., He's an able man, Dilworthy, and a good man., A man has got to be good to succeed as he has., He's only been in Congress a few years, and he must be worth a million., First thing in the morning when he stayed with me he asked about family prayers, whether we had 'em before or after breakfast., I hated to disappoint the Senator, but I had to out with it, tell him we didn't have 'em, not steady., He said he understood, business interruptions and all that, some men were well enough without, but as for him he never neglected the ordinances of religion., He doubted if the Columbus River appropriation would succeed if we did not invoke the Divine Blessing on it."", Perhaps it is unnecessary to say to the reader that Senator Dilworthy had not stayed with Col., Sellers while he was in Hawkeye; this visit to his house being only one of the Colonel's hallucinations--one of those instant creations of his fertile fancy, which were always flashing into his brain and out of his mouth in the course of any conversation and without interrupting the flow of it., During the summer Philip rode across the country and made a short visit in Hawkeye, giving Harry an opportunity to show him the progress that he and the Colonel had made in their operation at Stone's Landing, to introduce him also to Laura, and to borrow a little money when he departed., Harry bragged about his conquest, as was his habit, and took Philip round to see his western prize., Laura received Mr. Philip with a courtesy and a slight hauteur that rather surprised and not a little interested him., He saw at once that she was older than Harry, and soon made up his mind that she was leading his friend a country dance to which he was unaccustomed., At least he thought he saw that, and half hinted as much to Harry, who flared up at once; but on a second visit Philip was not so sure, the young lady was certainly kind and friendly and almost confiding with Harry, and treated Philip with the greatest consideration., She deferred to his opinions, and listened attentively when he talked, and in time met his frank manner with an equal frankness, so that he was quite convinced that whatever she might feel towards Harry, she was sincere with him., Perhaps his manly way did win her liking., Perhaps in her mind, she compared him with Harry, and recognized in him a man to whom a woman might give her whole soul, recklessly and with little care if she lost it., Philip was not invincible to her beauty nor to the intellectual charm of her presence., The week seemed very short that he passed in Hawkeye, and when he bade Laura good by, he seemed to have known her a year., ""We shall see you again, Mr. Sterling,"" she said as she gave him her hand, with just a shade of sadness in her handsome eyes., And when he turned away she followed him with a look that might have disturbed his serenity, if he had not at the moment had a little square letter in his breast pocket, dated at Philadelphia, and signed ""Ruth."", The visit of Senator Abner Dilworthy was an event in Hawkeye., When a Senator, whose place is in Washington moving among the Great and guiding the destinies of the nation, condescends to mingle among the people and accept the hospitalities of such a place as Hawkeye, the honor is not considered a light one., All, parties are flattered by it and politics are forgotten in the presence of one so distinguished among his fellows., Senator Dilworthy, who was from a neighboring state, had been a Unionist in the darkest days of his country, and had thriven by it, but was that any reason why Col., Sellers, who had been a confederate and had not thriven by it, should give him the cold shoulder?, The Senator was the guest of his old friend Gen. Boswell, but it almost appeared that he was indebted to Col., Sellers for the unreserved hospitalities of the town., It was the large hearted Colonel who, in a manner, gave him the freedom of the city., ""You are known here, sir,"" said the Colonel, ""and Hawkeye is proud of you., You will find every door open, and a welcome at every hearthstone., I should insist upon your going to my house, if you were not claimed by your older friend Gen. Boswell., But you will mingle with our people, and you will see here developments that will surprise you."", The Colonel was so profuse in his hospitality that he must have made the impression upon himself that he had entertained the Senator at his own mansion during his stay; at any rate, he afterwards always spoke of him as his guest, and not seldom referred to the Senator's relish of certain viands on his table., He did, in fact, press him to dine upon the morning of the day the Senator was going away., Senator Dilworthy was large and portly, though not tall--a pleasant spoken man, a popular man with the people., He took a lively interest in the town and all the surrounding country, and made many inquiries as to the progress of agriculture, of education, and of religion, and especially as to the condition of the emancipated race., ""Providence,"" he said, ""has placed them in our hands, and although you and I, General, might have chosen a different destiny for them, under the Constitution, yet Providence knows best."", ""You can't do much with 'em,"" interrupted Col., Sellers., ""They are a speculating race, sir, disinclined to work for white folks without security, planning how to live by only working for themselves., Idle, sir, there's my garden just a ruin of weeds., Nothing practical in 'em."", ""There is some truth in your observation, Colonel, but you must educate them."", ""You educate the niggro and you make him more speculating than he was before., If he won't stick to any industry except for himself now, what will he do then?"", ""But, Colonel, the negro when educated will be more able to make his speculations fruitful."", ""Never, sir, never., He would only have a wider scope to injure himself., A niggro has no grasp, sir., Now, a white man can conceive great operations, and carry them out; a niggro can't."", ""Still,"" replied the Senator, ""granting that he might injure himself in a worldly point of view, his elevation through education would multiply his chances for the hereafter--which is the important thing after all, Colonel., And no matter what the result is, we must fulfill our duty by this being."", ""I'd elevate his soul,"" promptly responded the Colonel; ""that's just it; you can't make his soul too immortal, but I wouldn't touch him, himself., Yes, sir!, make his soul immortal, but don't disturb the niggro as he is."", Of course one of the entertainments offered the Senator was a public reception, held in the court house, at which he made a speech to his fellow citizens., Col., Sellers was master of ceremonies., He escorted the band from the city hotel to Gen. Boswell's; he marshalled the procession of Masons, of Odd Fellows, and of Firemen, the Good Templars, the Sons of Temperance, the Cadets of Temperance, the Daughters of Rebecca, the Sunday School children, and citizens generally, which followed the Senator to the court house; he bustled about the room long after every one else was seated, and loudly cried ""Order!"", in the dead silence which preceded the introduction of the Senator by Gen. Boswell., The occasion was one to call out his finest powers of personal appearance, and one he long dwelt on with pleasure., This not being an edition of the Congressional Globe it is impossible to give Senator Dilworthy's speech in full., He began somewhat as follows:  ""Fellow citizens: It gives me great pleasure to thus meet and mingle with you, to lay aside for a moment the heavy duties of an official and burdensome station, and confer in familiar converse with my friends in your great state., The good opinion of my fellow citizens of all sections is the sweetest solace in all my anxieties., I look forward with longing to the time when I can lay aside the cares of office--"" [""dam sight,"" shouted a tipsy fellow near the door., Cries of ""put him out.""], ""My friends, do not remove him., Let the misguided man stay., I see that he is a victim of that evil which is swallowing up public virtue and sapping the foundation of society., As I was saying, when I can lay down the cares of office and retire to the sweets of private life in some such sweet, peaceful, intelligent, wide-awake and patriotic place as Hawkeye (applause)., I have traveled much, I have seen all parts of our glorious union, but I have never seen a lovelier village than yours, or one that has more signs of commercial and industrial and religious prosperity --(more applause)."", The Senator then launched into a sketch of our great country, and dwelt for an hour or more upon its prosperity and the dangers which threatened it., He then touched reverently upon the institutions of religion, and upon the necessity of private purity, if we were to have any public morality., ""I trust,"" he said, ""that there are children within the sound of my voice,"" and after some remarks to them, the Senator closed with an apostrophe to ""the genius of American Liberty, walking with the Sunday School in one hand and Temperance in the other up the glorified steps of the National Capitol."", Col., Sellers did not of course lose the opportunity to impress upon so influential a person as the Senator the desirability of improving the navigation of Columbus river., He and Mr. Brierly took the Senator over to Napoleon and opened to him their plan., It was a plan that the Senator could understand without a great deal of explanation, for he seemed to be familiar with the like improvements elsewhere., When, however, they reached Stone's Landing the Senator looked about him and inquired,  ""Is this Napoleon?"", ""This is the nucleus, the nucleus,"" said the Colonel, unrolling his map., ""Here is the deepo, the church, the City Hall and so on."", ""Ah, I see., How far from here is Columbus River?, Does that stream empty----""  ""That, why, that's Goose Run., ...]"|1
14|"[A second's thought would have convinced every one that getting out was impossible, and that the only effect of a rush would be to crash people to death., But a second's thought was not given., A few cried:  ""Sit down, sit down,"" but the mass was turned towards the door., Women were down and trampled on in the aisles, and stout men, utterly lost to self-control, were mounting the benches, as if to run a race over the mass to the entrance., Philip who had forced the girls to keep their seats saw, in a flash, the new danger, and sprang to avert it., In a second more those infuriated men would be over the benches and crushing Ruth and Alice under their boots., He leaped upon the bench in front of them and struck out before him with all his might, felling one man who was rushing on him, and checking for an instant the movement, or rather parting it, and causing it to flow on either side of him., But it was only for an instant; the pressure behind was too great, and, the next Philip was  dashed backwards over the seat., And yet that instant of arrest had probably saved the girls, for as Philip fell, the orchestra struck up ""Yankee Doodle"" in the liveliest manner., The familiar tune caught the ear of the mass, which paused in wonder, and gave the conductor's voice a chance to be heard--""It's a false alarm!"", The tumult was over in a minute, and the next, laughter was heard, and not a few said, ""I knew it wasn't anything."", ""What fools people are at such a time."", The concert was over, however., A good many people were hurt, some of them seriously, and among them Philip Sterling was found bent across the seat, insensible, with his left arm hanging limp and a bleeding wound on his head., When he was carried into the air he revived, and said it was nothing., A surgeon was called, and it was thought best to drive at once to the Bolton's, the surgeon supporting Philip, who did not speak the whole way., His arm was set and his head dressed, and the surgeon said he would come round all right in his mind by morning; he was very weak., Alice who was not much frightened while the panic lasted in the hall, was very much unnerved by seeing Philip so pale and bloody., Ruth assisted the surgeon with the utmost coolness and with skillful hands helped to dress Philip's wounds., And there was a certain intentness and fierce energy in what she did that might have revealed something to Philip if he had been in his senses., But he was not, or he would not have murmured ""Let Alice do it, she is not too tall."", It was Ruth's first case., Washington's delight in his beautiful sister was measureless., He said that she had always been the queenliest creature in the land, but that she was only commonplace before, compared to what she was now, so extraordinary was the improvement wrought by rich fashionable attire., ""But your criticisms are too full of brotherly partiality to be depended on, Washington., Other people will judge differently."", ""Indeed they won't., You'll see., There will never be a woman in Washington that can compare with you., You'll be famous within a fortnight, Laura., Everybody will want to know you., You wait--you'll see."", Laura wished in her heart that the prophecy might come true; and privately she even believed it might--for she had brought all the women whom she had seen since she left home under sharp inspection, and the result had not been unsatisfactory to her., During a week or two Washington drove about the city every day with her and familiarized her with all of its salient features., She was beginning to feel very much at home with the town itself, and she was also fast acquiring ease with the distinguished people she met at the Dilworthy table, and losing what little of country timidity she had brought with her from Hawkeye., She noticed with secret pleasure the little start of admiration that always manifested itself in the faces of the guests when she entered the drawing-room arrayed in evening costume: she took comforting note of the fact that these guests directed a very liberal share of their conversation toward her; she observed with surprise, that famous statesmen and soldiers did not talk like gods, as a general thing, but said rather commonplace things for the most part; and she was filled with gratification to discover that she, on the contrary, was making a good many shrewd speeches and now and then a really brilliant one, and furthermore, that they were beginning to be repeated in social circles about the town., Congress began its sittings, and every day or two Washington escorted her to the galleries set apart for lady members of the households of Senators and Representatives., Here was a larger field and a wider competition, but still she saw that many eyes were uplifted toward her face, and that first one person and then another called a neighbor's attention to her; she was not too dull to perceive that the speeches of some of the younger statesmen were delivered about as much and perhaps more at her than to the presiding officer; and she was not sorry to see that the dapper young Senator from Iowa came at once and stood in the open space before the president's desk to exhibit his feet as soon as she entered the gallery, whereas she had early learned from common report that his usual custom was to prop them on his desk and enjoy them himself with a selfish disregard of other people's longings., Invitations began to flow in upon her and soon she was fairly ""in society."", ""The season"" was now in full bloom, and the first select reception was at hand that is to say, a reception confined to invited guests., Senator Dilworthy had become well convinced; by this time, that his judgment of the country-bred Missouri girl had not deceived him--it was plain that she was going to be a peerless missionary in the field of labor he designed her for, and therefore it would be perfectly safe and likewise judicious to send her forth well panoplied for her work.--So he had added new and still richer costumes to her wardrobe, and assisted their attractions with costly jewelry-loans on the future land sale., This first select reception took place at a cabinet minister's--or rather a cabinet secretary's mansion., When Laura and the Senator arrived, about half past nine or ten in the evening, the place was already pretty well crowded, and the white-gloved negro servant at the door was still receiving streams of guests.--The drawing-rooms were brilliant with gaslight, and as hot as ovens., The host and hostess stood just within the door of entrance; Laura was presented, and then she passed on into the maelstrom of be-jeweled and richly attired low-necked ladies and white-kid-gloved and steel pen-coated gentlemen and wherever she moved she was followed by a buzz of admiration that was grateful to all her senses--so grateful, indeed, that her white face was tinged and its beauty heightened by a perceptible suffusion of color., She caught such remarks as, ""Who is she?"", ""Superb woman!"", ""That is the new beauty from the west,"" etc., etc., Whenever she halted, she was presently surrounded by Ministers, Generals, Congressmen, and all manner of aristocratic, people., Introductions followed, and then the usual original question, ""How do you like Washington, Miss Hawkins?"", supplemented by that other usual original question, ""Is this your first visit?"", These two exciting topics being exhausted, conversation generally drifted into calmer channels, only to be interrupted at frequent intervals by new introductions and new inquiries as to how Laura liked the capital and whether it was her first visit or not., And thus for an hour or more the Duchess moved through the crush in a rapture of happiness, for her doubts were dead and gone, now she knew she could conquer here., A familiar face appeared in the midst of the multitude and Harry Brierly fought his difficult way to her side, his eyes shouting their gratification, so to speak:  ""Oh, this is a happiness!, Tell me, my dear Miss Hawkins--""  ""Sh!, I know what you are going to ask., I do like Washington--I like it ever so much!"", ""No, but I was going to ask--""  ""Yes, I am coming to it, coming to it as fast as I can., It is my first visit., I think you should know that yourself."", And straightway a wave of the crowd swept her beyond his reach., ""Now what can the girl mean?, Of course she likes Washington--I'm not such a dummy as to have to ask her that., And as to its being her first visit, why bang it, she knows that I knew it was., Does she think I have turned idiot?, Curious girl, anyway., But how they do swarm about her!, She is the reigning belle of Washington after this night., She'll know five hundred of the heaviest guns in the town before this night's nonsense is over., And this isn't even the beginning., Just as I used to say--she'll be a card in the matter of--yes sir!, She shall turn the men's heads and I'll turn the women's!, What a team that will be in politics here., I wouldn't take a quarter of a million for what I can do in this present session--no indeed I wouldn't., Now, here--I don't altogether like this., That insignificant secretary of legation is--why, she's smiling on him as if he--and now on the Admiral!, Now she's illuminating that, stuffy Congressman from Massachusetts--vulgar ungrammatcal shovel-maker--greasy knave of spades., I don't like this sort of thing., She doesn't appear to be much distressed about me--she hasn't looked this way once., All right, my bird of Paradise, if it suits you, go on., But I think I know your sex., I'll go to smiling around a little, too, and see what effect that will have on you""  And he did ""smile around a little,"" and got as near to her as he could to watch the effect, but the scheme was a failure--he could not get her attention., She seemed wholly unconscious of him, and so he could not flirt with any spirit; he could only talk disjointedly; he could not keep his eyes on the charmers he talked to; he grew irritable, jealous, and very, unhappy., He gave up his enterprise, leaned his shoulder against a fluted pilaster and pouted while he kept watch upon Laura's every movement., His other shoulder stole the bloom from many a lovely cheek that brushed him in the surging crush, but he noted it not., He was too busy cursing himself inwardly for being an egotistical imbecile., An hour ago he had thought to take this country lass under his protection and show her ""life"" and enjoy her wonder and delight--and here she was, immersed in the marvel up to her eyes, and just a trifle more at home in it than he was himself., And now his angry comments ran on again:  ""Now she's sweetening old Brother Balaam; and he--well he is inviting her to the Congressional prayer-meeting, no doubt--better let old Dilworthy alone to see that she doesn't overlook that., And now its Splurge, of New York; and now its Batters of New Hampshire--and now the Vice President!, Well I may as well adjourn., I've got enough."", But he hadn't., He got as far as the door--and then struggled back to take one more look, hating himself all the while for his weakness., Toward midnight, when supper was announced, the crowd thronged to the supper room where a long table was decked out with what seemed a rare repast, but which consisted of things better calculated to feast the eye than the appetite., The ladies were soon seated in files along the wall, and in groups here and there, and the colored waiters filled the plates and glasses and the, male guests moved hither and thither conveying them to the privileged sex., Harry took an ice and stood up by the table with other gentlemen, and listened to the buzz of conversation while he ate., From these remarks he learned a good deal about Laura that was news to him., For instance, that she was of a distinguished western family; that she was highly educated; that she was very rich and a great landed heiress; that she was not a professor of religion, and yet was a Christian in the truest and best sense of the word, for her whole heart was devoted to the accomplishment of a great and noble enterprise--none other than the sacrificing of her landed estates to the uplifting of the down-trodden negro and the turning of his erring feet into the way of light and righteousness., Harry observed that as soon as one listener had absorbed the story, he turned about and delivered it to his next neighbor and the latter individual straightway passed it on., And thus he saw it travel the round of the gentlemen and overflow rearward among the ladies., He could not trace it backward to its fountain head, and so he could not tell who it was that started it., ...]"|1
15|"[That's my notion., Boutwell's got the right notion about the value of paper, but he lacks courage., I should like to run the treasury department about six months., I'd make things plenty, and business look up.'"", The Colonel had access to the departments., He knew all the senators and representatives, and especially, the lobby., He was consequently a great favorite in Newspaper Row, and was often lounging in the offices there, dropping bits of private, official information, which were immediately, caught up and telegraphed all over the country., But it need to surprise even the Colonel when he read it, it was embellished to that degree that he hardly recognized it, and the hint was not lost on him., He began to exaggerate his heretofore simple conversation to suit the newspaper demand., People used to wonder in the winters of 187- and 187-, where the ""Specials"" got that remarkable information with which they every morning surprised the country, revealing the most secret intentions of the President and his cabinet, the private thoughts of political leaders, the hidden meaning of every movement., This information was furnished by Col., Sellers., When he was asked, afterwards, about the stolen copy of the Alabama Treaty which got into the ""New York Tribune,"" he only looked mysterious, and said that neither he nor Senator Dilworthy knew anything about it., But those whom he was in the habit of meeting occasionally felt almost certain that he did know., It must not be supposed that the Colonel in his general patriotic labors neglected his own affairs., The Columbus River Navigation Scheme absorbed only a part of his time, so he was enabled to throw quite a strong reserve force of energy into the Tennessee Land plan, a vast enterprise commensurate with his abilities, and in the prosecution of which he was greatly aided by Mr. Henry Brierly, who was buzzing about the capitol and the hotels day and night, and making capital for it in some mysterious way., ""We must create, a public opinion,"" said Senator Dilworthy., ""My only interest in it is a public one, and if the country wants the institution, Congress will have to yield."", It may have been after a conversation between the Colonel and Senator Dilworthy that the following special despatch was sent to a New York newspaper:       ""We understand that a philanthropic plan is on foot in relation to      the colored race that will, if successful, revolutionize the whole      character of southern industry., An experimental institution is in      contemplation in Tennessee which will do for that state what the      Industrial School at Zurich did for Switzerland., We learn that      approaches have been made to the heirs of the late Hon., Silas      Hawkins of Missouri, in reference to a lease of a portion of their      valuable property in East Tennessee., Senator Dilworthy, it is      understood, is inflexibly opposed to any arrangement that will not      give the government absolute control., Private interests must give      way to the public good., It is to be hoped that Col., Sellers, who      represents the heirs, will be led to see the matter in this light."", When Washington Hawkins read this despatch, he went to the Colonel in some anxiety., He was for a lease, he didn't want to surrender anything., What did he think the government would offer?, Two millions?, ""May be three, may be four,"" said the Colonel, ""it's worth more than the bank of England."", ""If they will not lease,"" said Washington, ""let 'em make it two millions for an undivided half., I'm not going to throw it away, not the whole of it."", Harry told the Colonel that they must drive the thing through, he couldn't be dallying round Washington when Spring opened., Phil wanted him, Phil had a great thing on hand up in Pennsylvania., ""What is that?"", inquired the Colonel, always ready to interest himself in anything large., ""A mountain of coal; that's all., He's going to run a tunnel into it in the Spring."", ""Does he want any capital?, "", asked the Colonel, in the tone of a man who is given to calculating carefully before he makes an investment., ""No., Old man Bolton's behind him., He has capital, but I judged that he wanted my experience in starting."", ""If he wants me, tell him I'll come, after Congress adjourns., I should like to give him a little lift., He lacks enterprise--now, about that Columbus River., He doesn't see his chances., But he's a good fellow, and you can tell him that Sellers won't go back on him."", ""By the way,"" asked Harry, ""who is that rather handsome party that's hanging 'round Laura?, I see him with her everywhere, at the Capitol, in the horse cars, and he comes to Dilworthy's., If he weren't lame, I should think he was going to run off with her."", ""Oh, that's nothing., Laura knows her business., He has a cotton claim., Used to be at Hawkeye during the war., ""Selby's his name, was a Colonel., Got a wife and family., Very respectable people, the Selby's."", ""Well, that's all right,"" said Harry, ""if it's business., But if a woman looked at me as I've seen her at Selby, I should understand it., And it's talked about, I can tell you."", Jealousy had no doubt sharpened this young gentleman's observation., Laura could not have treated him with more lofty condescension if she had been the Queen of Sheba, on a royal visit to the great republic., And he resented it, and was ""huffy"" when he was with her, and ran her errands, and brought her gossip, and bragged of his intimacy with the lovely creature among the fellows at Newspaper Row., Laura's life was rushing on now in the full stream of intrigue and fashionable dissipation., She was conspicuous at the balls of the fastest set, and was suspected of being present at those doubtful suppers that began late and ended early., If Senator Dilworthy remonstrated about appearances, she had a way of silencing him., Perhaps she had some hold on him, perhaps she was necessary to his plan for ameliorating the condition the tube colored race., She saw Col. Selby, when the public knew and when it did not know., She would see him, whatever excuses he made, and however he avoided her., She was urged on by a fever of love and hatred and jealousy, which alternately possessed her., Sometimes she petted him, and coaxed him and tried all her fascinations., And again she threatened him and reproached him., What was he doing?, Why had he taken no steps to free himself?, Why didn't he send his wife home?, She should have money soon., They could go to Europe--anywhere., What did she care for talk?, And he promised, and lied, and invented fresh excuses for delay, like a cowardly gambler and roue as he was, fearing to break with her, and half the time unwilling to give her up., ""That woman doesn't know what fear is,"" he said to himself, ""and she watches me like a hawk."", He told his wife that this woman was a lobbyist, whom he had to tolerate and use in getting through his claims, and that he should pay her and have done with her, when he succeeded., Henry Brierly was at the Dilworthy's constantly and on such terms of intimacy that he came and went without question., The Senator was not an inhospitable man, he liked to have guests in his house, and Harry's gay humor and rattling way entertained him; for even the most devout men and busy statesmen must have hours of relaxation., Harry himself believed that he was of great service in the University business, and that the success of the scheme depended upon him to a great degree., He spent many hours in talking it over with the Senator after dinner., He went so far as to consider whether it would be worth his while to take the professorship of civil engineering in the new institution., But it was not the Senator's society nor his dinners--at which this scapegrace remarked that there was too much grace and too little wine --which attracted him to the horse., The fact was the poor fellow hung around there day after day for the chance of seeing Laura for five minutes at a time., For her presence at dinner he would endure the long bore of the Senator's talk afterwards, while Laura was off at some assembly, or excused herself on the plea of fatigue., Now and then he accompanied her to some reception, and rarely, on off nights, he was blessed with her company in the parlor, when he sang, and was chatty and vivacious and performed a hundred little tricks of imitation and ventriloquism, and made himself as entertaining as a man could be., It puzzled him not a little that all his fascinations seemed to go for so little with Laura; it was beyond his experience with women., Sometimes Laura was exceedingly kind and petted him a little, and took the trouble to exert her powers of pleasing, and to entangle him deeper and deeper., But this, it angered him afterwards to think, was in private; in public she was beyond his reach, and never gave occasion to the suspicion that she had any affair with him., He was never permitted to achieve the dignity of a serious flirtation with her in public., ""Why do you treat me so?"", he once said, reproachfully., ""Treat you how?"", asked Laura in a sweet voice, lifting her eyebrows., ...]"|1
16|"[If Mr. Bolton had been on his way to market to buy a dinner for his family with the only dollar he had in the world in his pocket, he would have given it to a chance beggar who asked him for it., Mrs. Bolton only asked (and the question showed that she was no mere provident than her husband where her heart was interested),  ""But has thee provided money for Philip to use in opening the coal mine?"", ""Yes, I have set apart as much as it ought to cost to open the mine, as much as we can afford to lose if no coal is found., Philip has the control of it, as equal partner in the venture, deducting the capital invested., He has great confidence in his success, and I hope for his sake he won't be disappointed."", Philip could not but feel that he was treated very much like one of the Bolton-family--by all except Ruth., His mother, when he went home after his recovery from his accident, had affected to be very jealous of Mrs. Bolton, about whom and Ruth she asked a thousand questions --an affectation of jealousy which no doubt concealed a real heartache, which comes to every mother when her son goes out into the world and forms new ties., And to Mrs. Sterling; a widow, living on a small income in a remote Massachusetts village, Philadelphia was a city of many splendors., All its inhabitants seemed highly favored, dwelling in ease and surrounded by superior advantages., Some of her neighbors had relations living in Philadelphia, and it seemed to them somehow a guarantee of respectability to have relations in Philadelphia., Mrs. Sterling was not sorry to have Philip make his way among such well-to-do people, and she was sure that no good fortune could be too good for his deserts., ""So, sir,"" said Ruth, when Philip came from New York, ""you have been assisting in a pretty tragedy., I saw your name in the papers., Is this woman a specimen of your western friends?"", ""My only assistance,"" replied Philip, a little annoyed, was in trying to keep Harry out of a bad scrape, and I failed after all., He walked into her trap, and he has been punished for it., I'm going to take him up to Ilium to see if he won't work steadily at one thing, and quit his nonsense."", ""Is she as beautiful as the newspapers say she is?"", ""I don't know, she has a kind of beauty--she is not like--'  ""Not like Alice?"", ""Well, she is brilliant; she was called the handsomest woman in Washington--dashing, you know, and sarcastic and witty., Ruth, do you believe a woman ever becomes a devil?"", ""Men do, and I don't know why women shouldn't., But I never saw one."", ""Well, Laura Hawkins comes very near it., But it is dreadful to think of her fate."", ""Why, do you suppose they will hang a woman?, Do you suppose they will be so barbarous as that?"", ""I wasn't thinking of that--it's doubtful if a New York jury would find a woman guilty of any such crime., But to think of her life if she is acquitted."", ""It is dreadful,"" said Ruth, thoughtfully, ""but the worst of it is that you men do not want women educated to do anything, to be able to earn an honest living by their own exertions., They are educated as if they were always to be petted and supported, and there was never to be any such thing as misfortune., I suppose, now, that you would all choose to have me stay idly at home, and give up my profession."", ""Oh, no,"" said Philip, earnestly, ""I  respect your resolution., But, Ruth, do you think you would be happier or do more good in following your profession than in having a home of your own?"", ""What is to hinder having a home of my, own?"", ""Nothing, perhaps, only you never would be in it--you would be away day and night, if you had any practice; and what sort of a home would that make for your husband?"", ""What sort of a home is it for the wife whose husband is always away riding about in his doctor's gig?"", ""Ah, you know that is not fair., The woman makes the home."", Philip and Ruth often had this sort of discussion, to which Philip was always trying to give a personal turn., He was now about to go to Ilium for the season, and he did not like to go without some assurance from Ruth that she might perhaps love him some day; when he was worthy of it, and when he could offer her something better than a partnership in his poverty., ""I should work with a great deal better heart, Ruth,"" he said the morning he was taking leave, ""if I knew you cared for me a little."", Ruth was looking down; the color came faintly to her cheeks, and she hesitated., She needn't be looking down, he thought, for she was ever so much shorter than tall Philip., ""It's not much of a place, Ilium,"" Philip went on, as if a little geographical remark would fit in here as well as anything else, ""and I shall have plenty of time to think over the responsibility I have taken, and--"" his observation did not seem to be coming out any where., But Ruth looked up, and there was a light in her eyes that quickened Phil's pulse., She took his hand, and said with serious sweetness:  ""Thee mustn't lose heart, Philip."", And then she added, in another mood, ""Thee knows I graduate in the summer and shall have my diploma., And if any thing happens--mines explode sometimes--thee can send for me., Farewell."", The opening of the Ilium coal mine was begun with energy, but without many omens of success., Philip was running a tunnel into the breast of the mountain, in faith that the coal stratum ran there as it ought to., How far he must go in he believed he knew, but no one could tell exactly., Some of the miners said that they should probably go through the mountain, and that the hole could be used for a railway tunnel., The mining camp was a busy place at any rate., Quite a settlement of board and log shanties had gone up, with a blacksmith shop, a small machine shop, and a temporary store for supplying the wants of the workmen., Philip and Harry pitched a commodious tent, and lived in the full enjoyment of the free life., There is no difficulty in digging a bole in the ground, if you have money enough to pay for the digging, but those who try this sort of work are always surprised at the large amount of money necessary to make a small hole., The earth is never willing to yield one product, hidden in her bosom, without an equivalent for it., And when a person asks of her coal, she is quite apt to require gold in exchange., It was exciting work for all concerned in it., As the tunnel advanced into the rock every day promised to be the golden day., This very blast might disclose the treasure., The work went on week after week, and at length during the night as well as the daytime., Gangs relieved each other, and the tunnel was every hour, inch by inch and foot by foot, crawling into the mountain., Philip was on the stretch of hope and excitement., Every pay day he saw his funds melting away, and still there was only the faintest show of what the miners call ""signs."", The life suited Harry, whose buoyant hopefulness was never disturbed., He made endless calculations, which nobody could understand, of the probable position of the vein., He stood about among the workmen with the busiest air., When he was down at Ilium he called himself the engineer of the works, and he used to spend hours smoking his pipe with the Dutch landlord on the hotel porch, and astonishing the idlers there with the stories of his railroad operations in Missouri., He talked with the landlord, too, about enlarging his hotel, and about buying some village lots, in the prospect of a rise, when the mine was opened., He taught the Dutchman how to mix a great many cooling drinks for the summer time, and had a bill at the hotel, the growing length of which Mr. Dusenheimer contemplated with pleasant anticipations., Mr. Brierly was a very useful and cheering person wherever he went., Midsummer arrived: Philip could report to Mr. Bolton only progress, and this was not a cheerful message for him to send to Philadelphia in reply to inquiries that he thought became more and more anxious., Philip himself was a prey to the constant fear that the money would give out before the coal was struck., At this time Harry was summoned to New York, to attend the trial of Laura Hawkins., It was possible that Philip would have to go also, her lawyer wrote, but they hoped for a postponement., There was important evidence that they could not yet obtain, and he hoped the judge would not force them to a trial unprepared., There were many reasons for a delay, reasons which of course are never mentioned, but which it would seem that a New York judge sometimes must understand, when he grants a postponement upon a motion that seems to the public altogether inadequate., Harry went, but he soon came back., The trial was put off., Every week we can gain, said the learned counsel, Braham, improves our chances., The popular rage never lasts long., ""We've struck it!"", This was the announcement at the tent door that woke Philip out of a sound sleep at dead of night, and shook all the sleepiness out of him in a trice., ""What!, Where is it?, When?, Coal?, Let me see it., What quality is it?"", were some of the rapid questions that Philip poured out as he hurriedly dressed., ""Harry, wake up, my boy, the coal train is coming., Struck it, eh?, Let's see?"", The foreman put down his lantern, and handed Philip a black lump., There was no mistake about it, it was the hard, shining anthracite, and its freshly fractured surface, glistened in the light like polished steel., Diamond never shone with such lustre in the eyes of Philip., Harry was exuberant, but Philip's natural caution found expression in his next remark., ...]"|1
17|"[The servant maid knocked at the door and passed in a telegram, saying it had come while they were gone., The Colonel tore it open and read with the voice of a man-of-war's broadside:  ""VERDICT OF JURY, NOT GUILTY AND LAURA IS FREE!"", The court room was packed on the morning on which the verdict of the jury was expected, as it had been every day of the trial, and by the same spectators, who had followed its progress with such intense interest., There is a delicious moment of excitement which the frequenter of trials well knows, and which he would not miss for the world., It is that instant when the foreman of the jury stands up to give the verdict, and before he has opened his fateful lips., The court assembled and waited., It was an obstinate jury., It even had another question--this intelligent jury--to ask the judge this morning., The question was this: ""Were the doctors clear that the deceased had no disease which might soon have carried him off, if he had not been shot?"", There was evidently one jury man who didn't want to waste life, and was willing to stake a general average, as the jury always does in a civil case, deciding not according to the evidence but reaching the verdict by some occult mental process., During the delay the spectators exhibited unexampled patience, finding amusement and relief in the slightest movements of the court, the prisoner and the lawyers., Mr. Braham divided with Laura the attention of the house., Bets were made by the Sheriff's deputies on the verdict, with large odds in favor of a disagreement., It was afternoon when it was announced that the jury was coming in., The reporters took their places and were all attention; the judge and lawyers were in their seats; the crowd swayed and pushed in eager expectancy, as the jury walked in and stood up in silence., Judge., ""Gentlemen, have you agreed upon your verdict?"", Foreman., ""We have."", Judge., ""What is it?"", Foreman., ""NOT GUILTY."", A shout went up from the entire room and a tumult of cheering which the court in vain attempted to quell., For a few moments all order was lost., The spectators crowded within the bar and surrounded Laura who, calmer than anyone else, was supporting her aged mother, who had almost fainted from excess of joy., And now occurred one of those beautiful incidents which no fiction-writer would dare to imagine, a scene of touching pathos, creditable to our fallen humanity., In the eyes of the women of the audience Mr. Braham was the hero of the occasion; he had saved the life of the prisoner; and besides he was such a handsome man., The women could not restrain their long pent-up emotions., They threw themselves upon Mr. Braham in a transport of gratitude; they kissed him again and again, the young as well as the advanced in years, the married as well as the ardent single women; they improved the opportunity with a touching self-sacrifice; in the words of a newspaper of the day they ""lavished him with kisses."", It was something sweet to do; and it would be sweet for a woman to remember in after years, that she had kissed Braham!, Mr. Braham himself received these fond assaults with the gallantry of his nation, enduring the ugly, and heartily paying back beauty in its own coin., This beautiful scene is still known in New York as ""the kissing of Braham."", When the tumult of congratulation had a little spent itself, and order was restored, Judge O'Shaunnessy said that it now became his duty to provide for the proper custody and treatment of the acquitted., The verdict of the jury having left no doubt that the woman was of an unsound mind, with a kind of insanity dangerous to the safety of the community, she could not be permitted to go at large., ""In accordance with the directions of the law in such cases,"" said the Judge, ""and in obedience to the dictates of a wise humanity, I hereby commit Laura Hawkins to the care of the Superintendent of the State Hospital for Insane Criminals, to be held in confinement until the State Commissioners on Insanity shall order her discharge., Mr. Sheriff, you will attend at once to the execution of this decree."", Laura was overwhelmed and terror-stricken., She had expected to walk forth in freedom in a few moments., The revulsion was terrible., Her mother appeared like one shaken with an ague fit., Laura insane!, And about to be locked up with madmen!, She had never contemplated this., Mr. Graham said he should move at once for a writ of 'habeas corpus'., But the judge could not do less than his duty, the law must have its way., As in the stupor of a sudden calamity, and not fully comprehending it, Mrs. Hawkins saw Laura led away by the officer., With little space for thought she was, rapidly driven to the railway station, and conveyed to the Hospital for Lunatic Criminals., It was only when she was within this vast and grim abode of madness that she realized the horror of her situation., It was only when she was received by the kind physician and read pity in his eyes, and saw his look of hopeless incredulity when she attempted to tell him that she was not insane; it was only when she passed through the ward to which she was consigned and saw the horrible creatures, the victims of a double calamity, whose dreadful faces she was hereafter to see daily, and was locked into the small, bare room that was to be her home, that all her fortitude forsook her., She sank upon the bed, as soon as she was left alone--she had been searched by the matron--and tried to think., But her brain was in a whirl., She recalled Braham's speech, she recalled the testimony regarding her lunacy., She wondered if she were not mad; she felt that she soon should be among these loathsome creatures., Better almost to have died, than to slowly go mad in this confinement., --We beg the reader's pardon., This is not history, which has just been written., It is really what would have occurred if this were a novel., If this were a work of fiction, we should not dare to dispose of Laura otherwise., True art and any attention to dramatic proprieties required it., The novelist who would turn loose upon society an insane murderess could not escape condemnation., Besides, the safety of society, the decencies of criminal procedure, what we call our modern civilization, all would demand that Laura should be disposed of in the manner we have described., Foreigners, who read this sad story, will be unable to understand any other termination of it., But this is history and not fiction., There is no such law or custom as that to which his Honor is supposed to have referred; Judge O'Shaunnessy would not probably pay any attention to it if there were., There is no Hospital for Insane Criminals; there is no State commission of lunacy., What actually occurred when the tumult in the court room had subsided the sagacious reader will now learn., Laura left the court room, accompanied by her mother and other friends, amid the congratulations of those assembled, and was cheered as she entered a carriage, and drove away., How sweet was the sunlight, how exhilarating the sense of freedom!, Were not these following cheers the expression of popular approval and affection?, Was she not the heroine of the hour?, It was with a feeling of triumph that Laura reached her hotel, a scornful feeling of victory over society with its own weapons., Mrs. Hawkins shared not at all in this feeling; she was broken with the disgrace and the long anxiety., ""Thank God, Laura,"" she said, ""it is over., Now we will go away from this hateful city., Let us go home at once."", ""Mother,"" replied Laura, speaking with some tenderness, ""I cannot go with you., There, don't cry, I cannot go back to that life."", Mrs. Hawkins was sobbing., This was more cruel than anything else, for she had a dim notion of what it would be to leave Laura to herself., ""No, mother, you have been everything to me., You know how dearly I love you., But I cannot go back."", A boy brought in a telegraphic despatch., Laura took it and read:  ""The bill is lost., Dilworthy ruined., (Signed) WASHINGTON."", For a moment the words swam before her eyes., The next her eyes flashed fire as she handed the dispatch to her m other and bitterly said,  ""The world is against me., Well, let it be, let it., I am against it."", ""This is a cruel disappointment,"" said Mrs. Hawkins, to whom one grief more or less did not much matter now, ""to you and, Washington; but we must humbly bear it."", ""Bear it;""  replied Laura scornfully, ""I've all my life borne it, and fate has thwarted me at every step."", A servant came to the door to say that there was a gentleman below who wished to speak with Miss Hawkins., ""J. Adolphe Griller"" was the name Laura read on the card., ""I do not know such a person., He probably comes from Washington., Send him up."", Mr. Griller entered., He was a small man, slovenly in dress, his tone confidential, his manner wholly void of animation, all his features below the forehead protruding--particularly the apple of his throat--hair without a kink in it, a hand with no grip, a meek, hang-dog countenance., ...]"|1
18|"[Here I followed instructions, and divested myself of all my clothing, and put on a waterproof jacket and overalls., This costume is picturesque, but not beautiful., A guide, similarly dressed, led the way down a flight of winding stairs, which wound and wound, and still kept on winding long after the thing ceased to be a novelty, and then terminated long before it had begun to be a pleasure., We were then well down under the precipice, but still considerably above the level of the river., We now began to creep along flimsy bridges of a single plank, our persons shielded from destruction by a crazy wooden railing, to which I clung with both hands--not because I was afraid, but because I wanted to., Presently the descent became steeper and the bridge flimsier, and sprays from the American Fall began to rain down on us in fast increasing sheets that soon became blinding, and after that our progress was mostly in the nature of groping., Nova a furious wind began to rush out from behind the waterfall, which seemed determined to sweep us from the bridge, and scatter us on the rocks and among the torrents below., I remarked that I wanted to go home; but it was too late., We were almost under the monstrous wall of water thundering down from above, and speech was in vain in the midst of such a pitiless crash of sound., In another moment the guide disappeared behind the deluge, and bewildered by the thunder, driven helplessly by the wind, and smitten by the arrowy tempest of rain, I followed., All was darkness., Such a mad storming, roaring, and bellowing of warring wind and water never crazed my ears before., I bent my head, and seemed to receive the Atlantic on my back., The world seemed going to destruction., I could not see anything, the flood poured down savagely., I raised my head, with open mouth, and the most of the American cataract went down my throat., If I had sprung a leak now I had been lost., And at this moment I discovered that the bridge had ceased, and we must trust for a foothold to the slippery and precipitous rocks., I never was so scared before and survived it., But we got through at last, and emerged into the open day, where we could stand in front of the laced and frothy and seething world of descending water, and look at it., When I saw how much of it there was, and how fearfully in earnest it was, I was sorry I had gone behind it., The noble Red Man has always been a friend and darling of mine., I love to read about him in tales and legends and romances., I love to read of his inspired sagacity, and his love of the wild free life of mountain and forest, and his general nobility of character, and his stately metaphorical manner of speech, and his chivalrous love for the dusky maiden, and the picturesque pomp of his dress and accoutrements., Especially the picturesque pomp of his dress and accoutrements., When I found the shops at Niagara Falls full of dainty Indian beadwork, and stunning moccasins, and equally stunning toy figures representing human beings who carried their weapons in holes bored through their arms and bodies, and had feet shaped like a pie, I was filled with emotion., I knew that now, at last, I was going to come face to face with the noble Red Man., A lady clerk in a shop told me, indeed, that all her grand array of curiosities were made by the Indians, and that they were plenty about the Falls, and that they were friendly, and it would not be dangerous to speak to them., And sure enough, as I approached the bridge leading over to Luna Island, I came upon a noble Son of the Forest sitting under a tree, diligently at work on a bead reticule., He wore a slouch hat and brogans, and had a short black pipe in his mouth., Thus does the baneful contact with our effeminate civilization dilute the picturesque pomp which is so natural to the Indian when far removed from us in his native haunts., I addressed the relic as follows:  ""Is the Wawhoo-Wang-Wang of the Whack-a-Whack happy?, Does the great Speckled Thunder sigh for the war-path, or is his heart contented with dreaming of the dusky maiden, the Pride of the Forest?, Does the mighty Sachem yearn to drink the blood of his enemies, or is he satisfied to make bead reticules for the pappooses of the paleface?, Speak, sublime relic of bygone grandeur--venerable ruin, speak!"", The relic said:  ""An' is it mesilf, Dennis Hooligan, that ye'd be takon' for a dirty Injin, ye drawlin', lantern-jawed, spider-legged divil!, By the piper that played before Moses, I'll ate ye!"", I went away from there., By and by, in the neighborhood of the Terrapin Tower, I came upon a gentle daughter of the aborigines in fringed and beaded buckskin moccasins and leggins, seated on a bench with her pretty wares about her., She had just carved out a wooden chief that had a strong family resemblance to a clothes-pin, and was now boring a hole through his abdomen to put his bow through., I hesitated a moment, and then addressed her:  ""Is the heart of the forest maiden heavy?, Is the Laughing Tadpole lonely?, Does she mourn over the extinguished council-fires of her race, and the vanished glory of her ancestors?, Or does her sad spirit wander afar toward the hunting-grounds whither her brave Gobbler-of-the- Lightnings is gone?, Why is my daughter silent?, Has she ought against the paleface stranger?"", The maiden said:  ""Faix, an' is it Biddy Malone ye dare to be callin' names?, Lave this, or I'll shy your lean carcass over the cataract, ye sniveling blaggard!"", I adjourned from there also., ""Confound these Indians!"", I said., ""They told me they were tame; but, if appearances go for anything, I should say they were all on the warpath."", I made one more attempt to fraternize with them, and only one., I came upon a camp of them gathered in the shade of a great tree, making wampum and moccasins, and addressed them in the language of friendship:  ""Noble Red Men, Braves, Grand Sachems, War Chiefs, Squaws, and High Muck-a-Mucks, the paleface from the land of the setting sun greets you!, You, Beneficent Polecat--you, Devourer of Mountains--you, Roaring Thundergust --you, Bully Boy with a Glass eye--the paleface from beyond the great waters greets you all!, War and pestilence have thinned your ranks and destroyed your once proud nation., Poker and seven-up, and a vain modern expense for soap, unknown to your glorious ancestors, have depleted your purses., Appropriating, in your simplicity, the property of others has gotten you into trouble., Misrepresenting facts, in your simple innocence, has damaged your reputation with the soulless usurper., Trading for forty-rod whisky, to enable you to get drunk and happy and tomahawk your families, has played the everlasting mischief with the picturesque pomp of your dress, and here you are, in the broad light of the nineteenth century, gotten up like the ragtag and bobtail of the purlieus of New York., For shame!, Remember your ancestors!, Recall their mighty deeds!, Remember Uncas!--and Red jacket!, and Hole in the Day!--and Whoopdedoodledo!, Emulate their achievements!, Unfurl yourselves under my banner, noble savages, illustrious guttersnipes--""  ""Down wid him!"", ""Scoop the blaggard!"", ""Burn him!"", ""Bang him!"", ""Dhround him!"", It was the quickest operation that ever was., I simply saw a sudden flash in the air of clubs, brickbats, fists, bead-baskets, and moccasins--a single flash, and they all appeared to hit me at once, and no two of them in the same place., In the next instant the entire tribe was upon me., They tore half the clothes off me; they broke my arms and legs; they gave me a thump that dented the top of my head till it would hold coffee like a saucer; and, to crown their disgraceful proceedings and add insult to injury, they threw me over the Niagara Falls, and I got wet., About ninety or a hundred feet from the top, the remains of my vest caught on a projecting rock, and I was almost drowned before I could get loose., I finally fell, and brought up in a world of white foam at the foot of the Fall, whose celled and bubbly masses towered up several inches above my head., Of course I got into the eddy., I sailed round and round in it forty-four times--chasing a chip and gaining on it--each round trip a half-mile--reaching for the same bush on the bank forty-four times, and just exactly missing it by a hair's-breadth every time., At last a man walked down and sat down close to that bush, and put a pipe in his mouth, and lit a match, and followed me with one eye and kept the other on the match, while he sheltered it in his hands from the wind., Presently a puff of wind blew it out., The next time I swept around he said:  ""Got a match?"", ""Yes; in my other vest., Help me out, please."", ""Not for Joe."", When I came round again, I said:  ""Excuse the seemingly impertinent curiosity of a drowning man, but will you explain this singular conduct of yours?"", ""With pleasure., I am the coroner., Don't hurry on my account., I can wait for you., But I wish I had a match."", I said: ""Take my place, and I'll go and get you one."", He declined., This lack of confidence on his part created a coldness between us, and from that time forward I avoided him., It was my idea, in case anything happened to me, to so time the occurrence as to throw my custom into the hands of the opposition coroner on the American side., At last a policeman came along, and arrested me for disturbing the peace by yelling at people on shore for help., The judge fined me, but had the advantage of him., My money was with my pantaloons, and my pantaloons were with the Indians., Thus I escaped., I am now lying in a very critical condition., ...]"|1

C.  She wore a pink satin dress, plain in front but with a good deal of rake to it--to the train, I mean; it was said to be two or three yards long., One could see it creeping along the floor some little time after the woman was gone., Mrs. C. wore also a white bodice, cut bias, with Pompadour sleeves, flounced with ruches; low neck, with the inside handkerchief not visible, with white kid gloves., She had on a pearl necklace, which glinted lonely, high up the midst of that barren waste of neck and shoulders., Her hair was frizzled into a tangled chaparral, forward of her ears, aft it was drawn together, and compactly bound and plaited into a stump like a pony's tail, and furthermore was canted upward at a sharp angle, and ingeniously supported by a red velvet crupper, whose forward extremity was made fast with a half-hitch around a hairpin on the top of her head., Her whole top hamper was neat and becoming., She had a beautiful complexion when she first came, but it faded out by degrees in an unaccountable way., However, it is not lost for good., I found the most of it on my shoulder afterward., (I stood near the door when she squeezed out with the throng.), There were other ladies present, but I only took notes of one as a specimen., I would gladly enlarge upon the subject were I able to do it justice., RILEY-NEWSPAPER CORRESPONDENT  One of the best men in Washington--or elsewhere--is RILEY, correspondent of one of the great San Francisco dailies., Riley is full of humor, and has an unfailing vein of irony, which makes his conversation to the last degree entertaining (as long as the remarks are about somebody else)., But notwithstanding the possession of these qualities, which should enable a man to write a happy and an appetizing letter, Riley's newspaper letters often display a more than earthly solemnity, and likewise an unimaginative devotion to petrified facts, which surprise and distress all men who know him in his unofficial character., He explains this curious thing by saying that his employers sent him to Washington to write facts, not fancy, and that several times he has come near losing his situation by inserting humorous remarks which, not being looked for at headquarters, and consequently not understood, were thought to be dark and bloody speeches intended to convey signals and warnings to murderous secret societies, or something of that kind, and so were scratched out with a shiver and a prayer and cast into the stove., Riley says that sometimes he is so afflicted with a yearning to write a sparkling and absorbingly readable letter that he simply cannot resist it, and so he goes to his den and revels in the delight of untrammeled scribbling; and then, with suffering such as only a mother can know, he destroys the pretty children of his fancy and reduces his letter to the required dismal accuracy., Having seen Riley do this very thing more than once, I know whereof I speak., Often I have laughed with him over a happy passage, and grieved to see him plow his pen through it., He would say, ""I had to write that or die; and I've got to scratch it out or starve., They wouldn't stand it, you know."", I think Riley is about the most entertaining company I ever saw., We lodged together in many places in Washington during the winter of '67-8, moving comfortably from place to place, and attracting attention by paying our board--a course which cannot fail to make a person conspicuous in Washington., Riley would tell all about his trip to California in the early days, by way of the Isthmus and the San Juan River; and about his baking bread in San Francisco to gain a living, and setting up tenpins, and practising law, and opening oysters, and delivering lectures, and teaching French, and tending bar, and reporting for the newspapers, and keeping dancing-schools, and interpreting Chinese in the courts--which latter was lucrative, and Riley was doing handsomely and laying up a little money when people began to find fault because his translations were too ""free,"" a thing for which Riley considered he ought not to be held responsible, since he did not know a word of the Chinese tongue, and only adopted interpreting as a means of gaining an honest livelihood., Through the machinations of enemies he was removed from the position of official interpreter, and a man put in his place who was familiar with the Chinese language, but did not know any English., And Riley used to tell about publishing a newspaper up in what is Alaska now, but was only an iceberg then, with a population composed of bears, walruses, Indians, and other animals; and how the iceberg got adrift at last, and left all his paying subscribers behind, and as soon as the commonwealth floated out of the jurisdiction of Russia the people rose and threw off their allegiance and ran up the English flag, calculating to hook on and become an English colony as they drifted along down the British Possessions; but a land breeze and a crooked current carried them by, and they ran up the Stars and Stripes and steered for California, missed the connection again and swore allegiance to Mexico, but it wasn't any use; the anchors came home every time, and away they went with the northeast trades drifting off sideways toward the Sandwich Islands, whereupon they ran up the Cannibal flag and had a grand human barbecue in honor of it, in which it was noticed that the better a man liked a friend the better he enjoyed him; and as soon as they got fairly within the tropics the weather got so fearfully hot that the iceberg began to melt, and it got so sloppy under foot that it was almost impossible for ladies to get about at all; and at last, just as they came in sight of the islands, the melancholy remnant of the once majestic iceberg canted first to one side and then to the other, and then plunged under forever, carrying the national archives along with it--and not only the archives and the populace, but some eligible town lots which had increased in value as fast as they diminished in size in the tropics, and which Riley could have sold at thirty cents a pound and made himself rich if he could have kept the province afloat ten hours longer and got her into port., Riley is very methodical, untiringly accommodating, never forgets anything that is to be attended to, is a good son, a stanch friend, and a permanent reliable enemy., He will put himself to any amount of trouble to oblige a body, and therefore always has his hands full of things to be done for the helpless and the shiftless., And he knows how to do nearly everything, too., He is a man whose native benevolence is a well-spring that never goes dry., He stands always ready to help whoever needs help, as far as he is able--and not simply with his money, for that is a cheap and common charity, but with hand and brain, and fatigue of limb and sacrifice of time., This sort of men is rare., Riley has a ready wit, a quickness and aptness at selecting and applying quotations, and a countenance that is as solemn and as blank as the back side of a tombstone when he is delivering a particularly exasperating joke., One night a negro woman was burned to death in a house next door to us, and Riley said that our landlady would be oppressively emotional at breakfast, because she generally made use of such opportunities as offered, being of a morbidly sentimental turn, and so we should find it best to let her talk along and say nothing back--it was the only way to keep her tears out of the gravy., Riley said there never was a funeral in the neighborhood but that the gravy was watery for a week., And, sure enough, at breakfast the landlady was down in the very sloughs of woe--entirely brokenhearted., Everything she looked at reminded her of that poor old negro woman, and so the buckwheat cakes made her sob, the coffee forced a groan, and when the beefsteak came on she fetched a wail that made our hair rise., Then she got to talking about deceased, and kept up a steady drizzle till both of us were soaked through and through., Presently she took a fresh breath and said, with a world of sobs:  ""Ah, to think of it, only to think of it!--the poor old faithful creature., For she was so faithful., Would you believe it, she had been a servant in that selfsame house and that selfsame family for twenty seven years come Christmas, and never a cross word and never a lick!, And, oh, to think she should meet such a death at last!--a-sitting over the red hot stove at three o'clock in the morning and went to sleep and fell on it and was actually roasted!, Not just frizzled up a bit, but literally roasted to a crisp!, Poor faithful creature, how she was cooked!, I am but a poor woman, but even if I have to scrimp to do it, I will put up a tombstone over that lone sufferer's grave--and Mr. Riley if you would have the goodness to think up a little epitaph to put on it which would sort of describe the awful way in which she met her--""  ""Put it, 'Well done, good and faithful servant,'"" said Riley, and never smiled., A FINE OLD MAN  John Wagner, the oldest man in Buffalo--one hundred and four years old --recently walked a mile and a half in two weeks., He is as cheerful and bright as any of these other old men that charge around so persistently and tiresomely in the newspapers, and in every way as remarkable., Last November he walked five blocks in a rainstorm, without any shelter but an umbrella, and cast his vote for Grant, remarking that he had voted for forty-seven presidents--which was a lie., His ""second crop"" of rich brown hair arrived from New York yesterday, and he has a new set of teeth coming from Philadelphia., He is to be married next week to a girl one hundred and two years old, who still takes in washing., They have been engaged eighty years, but their parents persistently refused their consent until three days ago., John Wagner is two years older than the Rhode Island veteran, and yet has never tasted a drop of liquor in his life--unless-unless you count whisky., SCIENCE V.S., LUCK  At that time, in Kentucky (said the Hon., Mr. K-----); the law was very strict against what is termed ""games of chance."", About a dozen of the boys were detected playing ""seven up"" or ""old sledge"" for money, and the grand jury found a true bill against them., Jim Sturgis was retained to defend them when the case came up, of course., The more he studied over the matter, and looked into the evidence, the plainer it was that he must lose a case at last--there was no getting around that painful fact., Those boys had certainly been betting money on a game of chance., Even public sympathy was roused in behalf of Sturgis., People said it was a pity to see him mar his successful career with a big prominent case like this, which must go against him., But after several restless nights an inspired idea flashed upon Sturgis, and he sprang out of bed delighted., He thought he saw his way through., The next day he whispered around a little among his clients and a few friends, and then when the case came up in court he acknowledged the seven-up and the betting, and, as his sole defense, had the astounding effrontery to put in the plea that old sledge was not a game of chance!, There was the broadest sort of a smile all over the faces of that sophisticated audience., The judge smiled with the rest., But Sturgis maintained a countenance whose earnestness was even severe., The opposite counsel tried to ridicule him out of his position, and did not succeed., The judge jested in a ponderous judicial way about the thing, but did not move him., The matter was becoming grave., The judge lost a little of his patience, and said the joke had gone far enough., Jim Sturgis said he knew of no joke in the matter--his clients could not be punished for indulging in what some people chose to consider a game of chance until it was proven that it was a game of chance., Judge and counsel said that would be an easy matter, and forthwith called Deacons Job, Peters, Burke, and Johnson, and Dominies Wirt and Miggles, to testify; and they unanimously and with strong feeling put down the legal quibble of Sturgis by pronouncing that old sledge was a game of chance., ""What do you call it now?"", said the judge., ""I call it a game of science!"", retorted Sturgis; ""and I'll prove it, too!"", They saw his little game., He brought in a cloud of witnesses, and produced an overwhelming mass of testimony, to show that old sledge was not a game of chance but a game of science., Instead of being the simplest case in the world, it had somehow turned out to be an excessively knotty one., The judge scratched his head over it awhile, and said there was no way of coming to a determination, because just as many men could be brought into court who would testify on one side as could be found to testify on the other., But he said he was willing to do the fair thing by all parties, and would act upon any suggestion Mr. Sturgis would make for the solution of the difficulty., Mr. Sturgis was on his feet in a second., ""Impanel a jury of six of each, Luck versus Science., Give them candles and a couple of decks of cards., ...]"|1

we all have our benignant, fatherly moods at one time or another, I suppose., I chose to kill the petrifaction mania with a delicate, a very delicate satire., But maybe it was altogether too delicate, for nobody ever perceived the satire part of it at all., I put my scheme in the shape of the discovery of a remarkably petrified man., I had had a temporary falling out with Mr.----, the new coroner and justice of the peace of Humboldt, and thought I might as well touch him up a little at the same time and make him ridiculous, and thus combine pleasure with business., So I told, in patient, belief-compelling detail, all about the finding of a petrified-man at Gravelly Ford (exactly a hundred and twenty miles, over a breakneck mountain trail from where ---- lived); how all the savants of the immediate neighborhood had been to examine it (it was notorious that there was not a living creature within fifty miles of there, except a few starving Indians; some crippled grasshoppers, and four or five buzzards out of meat and too feeble to get away); how those savants all pronounced the petrified man to have been in a state of complete petrifaction for over ten generations; and then, with a seriousness that I ought to have been ashamed to assume, I stated that as soon as Mr.----heard the news he summoned a jury, mounted his mule, and posted off, with noble reverence for official duty, on that awful five days' journey, through alkali, sage brush, peril of body, and imminent starvation, to hold an inquest on this man that had been dead and turned to everlasting stone for more than three hundred years!, And then, my hand being ""in,"" so to speak, I went on, with the same unflinching gravity, to state that the jury returned a verdict that deceased came to his death from protracted exposure., This only moved me to higher flights of imagination, and I said that the jury, with that charity so characteristic of pioneers, then dug a grave, and were about to give the petrified man Christian burial, when they found that for ages a limestone sediment had been trickling down the face of the stone against which he was sitting, and this stuff had run under him and cemented him fast to the ""bed-rock""; that the jury (they were all silver-miners) canvassed the difficulty a moment, and then got out their powder and fuse, and proceeded to drill a hole under him, in order to blast him from his position, when Mr.----, ""with that delicacy so characteristic of him, forbade them, observing that it would be little less than sacrilege to do such a thing."", From beginning to end the ""Petrified Man"" squib was a string of roaring absurdities, albeit they were told with an unfair pretense of truth that even imposed upon me to some extent, and I was in some danger of believing in my own fraud., But I really had no desire to deceive anybody, and no expectation of doing it., I depended on the way the petrified man was sitting to explain to the public that he was a swindle., Yet I purposely mixed that up with other things, hoping to make it obscure--and I did., I would describe the position of one foot, and then say his right thumb was against the side of his nose; then talk about his other foot, and presently come back and say the fingers of his right hand were spread apart; then talk about the back of his head a little, and return and say the left thumb was hooked into the right little finger; then ramble off about something else, and by and by drift back again and remark that the fingers of the left hand were spread like those of the right., But I was too ingenious., I mixed it up rather too much; and so all that description of the attitude, as a key to the humbuggery of the article, was entirely lost, for nobody but me ever discovered and comprehended the peculiar and suggestive position of the petrified man's hands., As a satire on the petrifaction mania, or anything else, my petrified Man was a disheartening failure; for everybody received him in innocent good faith, and I was stunned to see the creature I had begotten to pull down the wonder-business with, and bring derision upon it, calmly exalted to the grand chief place in the list of the genuine marvels our Nevada had produced., I was so disappointed at the curious miscarriage of my scheme, that at first I was angry, and did not like to think about it; but by and by, when the exchanges began to come in with the Petrified Man copied and guilelessly glorified, I began to feel a soothing secret satisfaction; and as my gentleman's field of travels broadened, and by the exchanges I saw that he steadily and implacably penetrated territory after territory, state after state, and land after land, till he swept the great globe and culminated in sublime and unimpeached legitimacy in the august London Lancet, my cup was full, and I said I was glad I had done it., I think that for about eleven months, as nearly as I can remember, Mr.----'s daily mail-bag continued to be swollen by the addition of half a bushel of newspapers hailing from many climes with the Petrified Man in them, marked around with a prominent belt of ink., I sent them to him., I did it for spite, not for fun., He used to shovel them into his back yard and curse., And every day during all those months the miners, his constituents (for miners never quit joking a person when they get started), would call on him and ask if he could tell them where they could get hold of a paper with the Petrified Man in it., He could have accommodated a continent with them., I hated-----in those days, and these things pacified me and pleased me., I could not have gotten more real comfort out of him without killing him., MY BLOODY MASSACRE  The other burlesque I have referred to was my fine satire upon the financial expedients of ""cooking dividends,"" a thing which became shamefully frequent on the Pacific coast for a while., Once more, in my self-complacent simplicity I felt that the time had arrived for me to rise up and be a reformer., I put this reformatory satire, in the shape of a fearful ""Massacre at Empire City."", The San Francisco papers were making a great outcry about the iniquity of the Daney Silver-Mining Company, whose directors had declared a ""cooked"" or false dividend, for the purpose of increasing the value of their stock, so that they could sell out at a comfortable figure, and then scramble from under the tumbling concern., And while abusing the Daney, those papers did not forget to urge the public to get rid of all their silver stocks and invest in, sound and safe San Francisco stocks, such as the Spring Valley Water Company, etc., But right at this unfortunate juncture, behold the Spring Valley cooked a dividend too!, And so, under the insidious mask of an invented ""bloody massacre,"" I stole upon the public unawares with my scathing satire upon the dividend cooking system., In about half a column of imaginary human carnage I told how a citizen hard murdered his wife and nine children, and then committed suicide., And I said slyly, at the bottom, that the sudden madness of which this melancholy massacre was the result had been brought about by his having allowed himself to be persuaded by the California papers to sell his sound and lucrative Nevada silver stocks, and buy into Spring Valley just in time to get cooked along with that company's fancy dividend, and sink every cent he had in the world., Ah, it was a deep, deep satire, and most ingeniously contrived., But I made the horrible details so carefully and conscientiously interesting that the public devoured them greedily, and wholly overlooked the following distinctly stated facts, to wit: The murderer was perfectly well known to every creature in the land as a bachelor, and consequently he could not murder his wife and nine children; he murdered them ""in his splendid dressed-stone mansion just in the edge of the great pine forest between Empire City and Dutch Nick's,"" when even the very pickled oysters that came on our tables knew that there was not a ""dressed-stone mansion"" in all Nevada Territory; also that, so far from there being a ""great pine forest between Empire City and Dutch Nick's,"" there wasn't a solitary tree within fifteen miles of either place; and, finally, it was patent and notorious that Empire City and Dutch Nick's were one and the same place, and contained only six houses anyhow, and consequently there could be no forest between them; and on top of all these absurdities I stated that this diabolical murderer, after inflicting a wound upon himself that the reader ought to have seen would kill an elephant in the twinkling of an eye, jumped on his horse and rode four miles, waving his wife's reeking scalp in the air, and thus performing entered Carson City with tremendous eclat, and dropped dead in front of the chief saloon, the envy and admiration of all beholders., Well, in all my life I never saw anything like the sensation that little satire created., It was the talk of the town, it was the talk of the territory., Most of the citizens dropped gently into it at breakfast, and they never finished their meal., There was something about those minutely faithful details that was a sufficing substitute for food., Few people that were able to read took food that morning., Dan and I (Dan was my reportorial associate) took our seats on either side of our customary table in the ""Eagle Restaurant,"" and, as I unfolded the shred they used to call a napkin in that establishment, I saw at the next table two stalwart innocents with that sort of vegetable dandruff sprinkled about their clothing which was the sign and evidence that they were in from the Truckee with a load of hay., The one facing me had the morning paper folded to a long, narrow strip, and I knew, without any telling, that that strip represented the column that contained my pleasant financial satire., From the way he was excitedly mumbling, I saw that the heedless son of a hay-mow was skipping with all his might, in order to get to the bloody details as quickly as possible; and so he was missing the guide-boards I had set up to warn him that the whole thing was a fraud., Presently his eyes spread wide open, just as his jaws swung asunder to take in a potato approaching it on a fork; the potato halted, the face lit up redly, and the whole man was on fire with excitement., Then he broke into a disjointed checking off of the particulars--his potato cooling in mid-air meantime, and his mouth making a reach for it occasionally; but always bringing up suddenly against a new and still more direful performance of my hero., At last he looked his stunned and rigid comrade impressively in the face, and said, with an expression of concentrated awe:  ""Jim, he b'iled his baby, and he took the old 'oman's skelp., Cuss'd if I want any breakfast!"", And he laid his lingering potato reverently down, and he and his friend departed from the restaurant empty but satisfied., He never got down to where the satire part of it began., ...]"|1
21|"[I have chosen the general title of MEMORANDA for this department because it is plain and simple, and makes no fraudulent promises., I can print under it statistics, hotel arrivals, or anything that comes handy, without violating faith with the reader., 4., Puns cannot be allowed a place in this department., Inoffensive ignorance, benignant stupidity, and unostentatious imbecility will always be welcomed and cheerfully accorded a corner, and even the feeblest humour will be admitted, when we can do no better; but no circumstances, however dismal, will ever be considered a sufficient excuse for the admission of that last--and saddest evidence of intellectual poverty, the Pun., ABOUT SMELLS  In a recent issue of the ""Independent,"" the Rev., T. De Witt Talmage, of Brooklyn, has the following utterance on the subject of ""Smells"":       I have a good Christian friend who, if he sat in the front pew in      church, and a working man should enter the door at the other end,      would smell him instantly., My friend is not to blame for the      sensitiveness of his nose, any more than you would flog a pointer      for being keener on the scent than a stupid watch dog., The fact is,      if you, had all the churches free, by reason of the mixing up of the      common people with the uncommon, you would keep one-half of      Christendom sick at their stomach., If you are going to kill the      church thus with bad smells, I will have nothing to do with this      work of evangelization., We have reason to believe that there will be labouring men in heaven; and also a number of negroes, and Esquimaux, and Terra del Fuegans, and Arabs, and a few Indians, and possibly even some Spaniards and Portuguese., All things are possible with God., We shall have all these sorts of people in heaven; but, alas!, in getting them we shall lose the society of Dr. Talmage., Which is to say, we shall lose the company of one who could give more real ""tone"" to celestial society than any other contribution Brooklyn could furnish., And what would eternal happiness be without the Doctor?, Blissful, unquestionably--we know that well enough but would it be 'distingue,' would it be 'recherche' without him?, St. Matthew without stockings or sandals; St. Jerome bare headed, and with a coarse brown blanket robe dragging the ground; St. Sebastian with scarcely any raiment at all--these we should see, and should enjoy seeing them; but would we not miss a spike-tailed coat and kids, and turn away regretfully, and say to parties from the Orient: ""These are well enough, but you ought to see Talmage of Brooklyn."", I fear me that in the better world we shall not even have Dr. Talmage's ""good Christian friend."", For if he were sitting under the glory of the Throne, and the keeper of the keys admitted a Benjamin Franklin or other labouring man, that ""friend,"" with his fine natural powers infinitely augmented by emancipation from hampering flesh, would detect him with a single sniff, and immediately take his hat and ask to be excused., To all outward seeming, the Rev., T. De Witt Talmage is of the same material as that used in the construction of his early predecessors in the ministry; and yet one feels that there must be a difference somewhere between him and the Saviour's first disciples., It may be because here, in the nineteenth century, Dr. T.  has had advantages which Paul and Peter and the others could not and did not have., There was a lack of polish about them, and a looseness of etiquette, and a want of exclusiveness, which one cannot help noticing., They healed the very beggars, and held intercourse with people of a villainous odour every day., If the subject of these remarks had been chosen among the original Twelve Apostles, he would not have associated with the rest, because he could not have stood the fishy smell of some of his comrades who came from around the Sea of Galilee., He would have resigned his commission with some such remark as he makes in the extract quoted above: ""Master, if thou art going to kill the church thus with bad smells, I will have nothing to do with this work of evangelization."", He is a disciple, and makes that remark to the Master; the only difference is, that he makes it in the nineteenth instead of the first century., Is there a choir in Mr. T.'s church?, And does it ever occur that they have no better manners than to sing that hymn which is so suggestive of labourers and mechanics:            ""Son of the Carpenter!, receive           This humble work of mine?"", Now, can it be possible that in a handful of centuries the Christian character has fallen away from an imposing heroism that scorned even the stake, the cross, and the axe, to a poor little effeminacy that withers and wilts under an unsavoury smell?, We are not prepared to believe so, the reverend Doctor and his friend to the contrary notwithstanding., A COUPLE OF SAD EXPERIENCES  When I published a squib recently in which I said I was going to edit an Agricultural Department in this magazine, I certainly did not desire to deceive anybody., I had not the remotest desire to play upon any one's confidence with a practical joke, for he is a pitiful creature indeed who will degrade the dignity of his humanity to the contriving of the witless inventions that go by that name., I purposely wrote the thing as absurdly and as extravagantly as it could be written, in order to be sure and not mislead hurried or heedless readers: for I spoke of launching a triumphal barge upon a desert, and planting a tree of prosperity in a mine--a tree whose fragrance should slake the thirst of the naked, and whose branches should spread abroad till they washed the chorea of, etc., etc., I thought that manifest lunacy like that would protect the reader., But to make assurance absolute, and show that I did not and could not seriously mean to attempt an Agricultural Department, I stated distinctly in my postscript that I did not know anything about Agriculture., But alas!, right there is where I made my worst mistake--for that remark seems to have recommended my proposed Agriculture more than anything else., It lets a little light in on me, and I fancy I perceive that the farmers feel a little bored, sometimes, by the oracular profundity of agricultural editors who ""know it all."", In fact, one of my correspondents suggests this (for that unhappy squib has deluged me with letters about potatoes, and cabbages, and hominy, and vermicelli, and maccaroni, and all the other fruits, cereals, and vegetables that ever grew on earth; and if I get done answering questions about the best way of raising these things before I go raving crazy, I shall be thankful, and shall never write obscurely for fun any more)., Shall I tell the real reason why I have unintentionally succeeded in fooling so many people?, It is because some of them only read a little of the squib I wrote and jumped to the conclusion that it was serious, and the rest did not read it at all, but heard of my agricultural venture at second-hand., Those cases I could not guard against, of course., To write a burlesque so wild that its pretended facts will not be accepted in perfect good faith by somebody, is, very nearly an impossible thing to do., It is because, in some instances, the reader is a person who never tries to deceive anybody himself, and therefore is not expecting any one to wantonly practise a deception upon him; and in this case the only person dishonoured is the man who wrote the burlesque., In other instances the ""nub"" or moral of the burlesque--if its object be to enforce a truth--escapes notice in the superior glare of something in the body of the burlesque itself., And very often this ""moral"" is tagged on at the bottom, and the reader, not knowing that it is the key of the whole thing and the only important paragraph in the article, tranquilly turns up his nose at it and leaves it unread., One can deliver a satire with telling force through the insidious medium of a travesty, if he is careful not to overwhelm the satire with the extraneous interest of the travesty, and so bury it from the reader's sight and leave him a joked and defrauded victim, when the honest intent was to add to either his knowledge or his wisdom., I have had a deal of experience in burlesques and their unfortunate aptness to deceive the public, and this is why I tried hard to make that agricultural one so broad and so perfectly palpable that even a one-eyed potato could see it; and yet, as I speak the solemn truth, it fooled one of the ablest agricultural editors in America!, DAN MURPHY  One of the saddest things that ever came under my notice (said the banker's clerk) was there in Corning, during the war., Dan Murphy enlisted as a private, and fought very bravely., The boys all liked him, and when a wound by and by weakened him down till carrying a musket was too heavy work for him, they clubbed together and fixed him up as a sutler., He made money then, and sent it always to his wife to bank for him., She was a washer and ironer, and knew enough by hard experience to keep money when she got it., She didn't waste a penny., On the contrary, she began to get miserly as her bank account grew., She grieved to part with a cent, poor creature, for twice in her hard-working life she had known what it was to be hungry, cold, friendless, sick, and without a dollar in the world, and she had a haunting dread of suffering so again., Well, at last Dan died; and the boys, in testimony of their esteem and respect for him, telegraphed to Mrs.  Murphy to know if she would like to have him embalmed and sent home, when you know the usual custom was to dump a poor devil like him into a shallow hole, and then inform his friends what had become of him., Mrs.  Murphy jumped to the conclusion that it would only cost two or three dollars to embalm her dead husband, and so she telegraphed ""Yes."", It was at the ""wake"" that the bill for embalming arrived and was presented to the widow., She uttered a wild, sad wail, that pierced every heart, and said: ""Sivinty-foive dollars for stoofhn' Dan, blister their sowls!, Did thim divils suppose I was goin' to stairt a Museim, that I'd be dalin' in such expinsive curiassities!"", The banker's clerk said there was not a dry eye in the house., THE ""TOURNAMENT"" IN A. D. 1870  Lately there appeared an item to this effect, and the same went the customary universal round of the press:       A telegraph station has just been established upon the traditional      site of the Garden of Eden., As a companion to that, nothing fits so aptly and so perfectly as this:       Brooklyn has revived the knightly tournament of the Middle Ages., It is hard to tell which is the most startling, the idea of that highest achievement of human genius and intelligence, the telegraph, prating away about the practical concerns of the world's daily life in the heart and home of ancient indolence, ignorance, and savagery, or the idea of that happiest expression of the brag, vanity, and mock-heroics of our ancestors, the ""tournament,"" coming out of its grave to flaunt its tinsel trumpery and perform its ""chivalrous"" absurdities in the high noon of the nineteenth century, and under the patronage of a great, broad-awake city and an advanced civilisation., A ""tournament"" in Lynchburg is a thing easily within the comprehension of the average mind; but no commonly gifted person can conceive of such a spectacle in Brooklyn without straining his powers., Brooklyn is part and parcel of the city of New York, and there is hardly romance enough in the entire metropolis to re-supply a Virginia ""knight"" with ""chivalry,"" in case he happened to run out of it., Let the reader calmly and dispassionately picture to himself ""lists"" in Brooklyn; heralds, pursuivants, pages, garter king-at-arms--in Brooklyn; the marshalling of the fantastic hosts of ""chivalry"" in slashed doublets, velvet trunks, ruffles, and plumes--in Brooklyn; mounted on omnibus and livery-stable patriarchs, promoted, and referred to in cold blood as ""steeds,"" ""destriers,"" and ""chargers,"" and divested of their friendly, humble names these meek old ""Jims"" and ""Bobs"" and ""Charleys,"" and renamed ""Mohammed,"" ""Bucephalus,"" and ""Saladin""--in Brooklyn; mounted thus, and armed with swords and shields and wooden lances, and cased in paste board hauberks, morions, greaves, and gauntlets, and addressed as ""Sir"" Smith, and ""Sir"" Jones, and bearing such titled grandeurs as ""The Disinherited Knight,"" the ""Knight of Shenandoah,"" the ""Knight of the Blue Ridge,"" the ""Knight of Maryland,"" and the ""Knight of the Secret Sorrow""--in Brooklyn; and at the toot of the horn charging fiercely upon a helpless ring hung on a post, and prodding at it in trepidly with their wooden sticks, and by and by skewering it and cavorting back to the judges' stand covered with glory this in Brooklyn; and each noble success like this duly and promptly announced by an applauding toot from the herald's horn, and ""the band playing three bars of an old circus tune""--all in Brooklyn, in broad daylight., And let the reader remember, and also add to his picture, as follows, to wit: when the show was all over, the party who had shed the most blood and overturned and hacked to pieces the most knights, or at least had prodded the most muffin-rings, was accorded the ancient privilege of naming and crowning the Queen of Love and Beauty--which naming had in reality been done for, him by the ""cut-and-dried"" process, and long in advance, by a committee of ladies, but the crowning he did in person, though suffering from loss of blood, and then was taken to the county hospital on a shutter to have his wounds dressed--these curious things all occurring in Brooklyn, and no longer ago than one or two yesterdays., It seems impossible, and yet it is true., This was doubtless the first appearance of the ""tournament"" up here among the rolling-mills and factories, and will probably be the last., It will be well to let it retire permanently to the rural districts of Virginia, where, it is said, the fine mailed and plumed, noble-natured, maiden-rescuing, wrong-redressing, adventure-seeking knight of romance is accepted and believed in by the peasantry with pleasing simplicity, while they reject with scorn the plain, unpolished verdict whereby history exposes him as a braggart, a ruffian, a fantastic vagabond; and an ignoramus., All romance aside, what shape would our admiration of the heroes of Ashby de la Zouch be likely to take, in this practical age, if those worthies were to rise up and come here and perform again the chivalrous deeds of that famous passage of arms?, Nothing but a New York jury and the insanity plea could save them from hanging, from the amiable Bois-Guilbert and the pleasant Front-de-Boeuf clear down to the nameless ruffians that entered the riot with unpictured shields and did their first murder and acquired their first claim to respect that day., The doings of the so-called ""chivalry"" of the Middle Ages were absurd enough, even when they were brutally and bloodily in earnest, and when their surroundings of castles and donjons, savage landscapes and half-savage peoples, were in keeping; but those doings gravely reproduced with tinsel decorations and mock pageantry, by bucolic gentlemen with broomstick lances, and with muffin-rings to represent the foe, and all in the midst of the refinement and dignity of a carefully-developed modern civilisation, is absurdity gone crazy., Now, for next exhibition, let us have a fine representation of one of those chivalrous wholesale butcheries and burnings of Jewish women and children, which the crusading heroes of romance used to indulge in in their European homes, just before starting to the Holy Land, to seize and take to their protection the Sepulchre and defend it from ""pollution."", CURIOUS RELIC FOR SALE       ""For sale, for the benefit of the Fund for the Relief of the Widows      and Orphans of Deceased Firemen, a Curious Ancient Bedouin Pipe,      procured at the city of Endor in Palestine, and believed to have      once belonged to the justly-renowned Witch of Endor., Parties      desiring to examine this singular relic with a view to purchasing,      can do so by calling upon Daniel S.. 119 and 121 William street, New      York""  As per advertisement in the ""Herald."", A curious old relic indeed, as I had a good personal right to know., In a single instant of time, a long drawn panorama of sights and scenes in the Holy Land flashed through my memory--town and grove, desert, camp, and caravan clattering after each other and disappearing, leaping me with a little of the surprised and dizzy feeling which I have experienced at sundry times when a long express train has overtaken me at some quiet curve and gone whizzing, car by car, around the corner and out of sight., In that prolific instant I saw again all the country from the Sea of Galilee and Nazareth clear to Jerusalem, and thence over the hills of Judea and through the Vale of Sharon to Joppa, down by the ocean., Leaving out unimportant stretches of country and details of incident, I saw and experienced the following described matters and things., Immediately three years fell away from my age, and a vanished time was restored to me September, 1867., It was a flaming Oriental day--this one that had come up out of the past and brought along its actors, its stage-properties, and scenic effects--and our party had just ridden through the squalid hive of human vermin which still holds the ancient Biblical name of Endor; I was bringing up the rear on my grave four-dollar steed, who was about beginning to compose himself for his usual noon nap., My!, only fifteen minutes before how the black, mangy, nine-tenths naked, ten-tenths filthy, ignorant, bigoted, besotted, hungry, lazy, malignant, screeching, crowding, struggling, wailing, begging, cursing, hateful spawn of the original Witch had swarmed out of the caves in the rocks and the holes and crevices in the earth, and blocked our horses' way, besieged us, threw themselves in the animals' path, clung to their manes, saddle-furniture, and tails, asking, beseeching, demanding ""bucksheesh!, bucksheesh!, BUCKSHEESH!"", We had rained small copper Turkish coins among them, as fugitives fling coats and hats to pursuing wolves, and then had spurred our way through as they stopped to scramble for the largess., I was fervently thankful when we had gotten well up on the desolate hillside and outstripped them and left them jawing and gesticulating in the rear., What a tempest had seemingly gone roaring and crashing by me and left its dull thunders pulsing in my ears!, I was in the rear, as I was saying., Our pack-mules and Arabs were far ahead, and Dan, Jack, Moult, Davis, Denny, Church, and Birch (these names will do as well as any to represent the boys) were following close after them., As my horse nodded to rest, I heard a sort of panting behind me, and turned and saw that a tawny youth from the village had overtaken me --a true remnant and representative of his ancestress the Witch--a galvanised scurvy, wrought into the human shape and garnished with ophthalmia and leprous scars--an airy creature with an invisible shirt-front that reached below the pit of his stomach, and no other clothing to speak of except a tobacco-pouch, an ammunition-pocket, and a venerable gun, which was long enough to club any game with that came within shooting distance, but far from efficient as an article of dress., I thought to myself, ""Now this disease with a human heart in it is going to shoot me."", I smiled in derision at the idea of a Bedouin daring to touch off his great-grandfather's rusty gun and getting his head blown off for his pains., But then it occurred to me, in simple school-boy language, ""Suppose he should take deliberate aim and 'haul off' and fetch me with the butt-end of it?"", ...]"|1
22|"[""Oh yes--I've seen whole families in the same fix."", ""Smarty!, You think you're SOME, now, DON'T you?, Oh, what a hat!"", ""You can lump that hat if you don't like it., I dare you to knock it off--and anybody that'll take a dare will suck eggs."", ""You're a liar!"", ""You're another."", ""You're a fighting liar and dasn't take it up."", ""Aw--take a walk!"", ""Say--if you give me much more of your sass I'll take and bounce a rock off'n your head."", ""Oh, of COURSE you will."", ""Well I WILL."", ""Well why don't you DO it then?, What do you keep SAYING you will for?, Why don't you DO it?, It's because you're afraid."", ""I AIN'T afraid."", ""You are."", ""I ain't."", ""You are."", Another pause, and more eying and sidling around each other., Presently they were shoulder to shoulder., Tom said:  ""Get away from here!"", ""Go away yourself!"", ""I won't."", ""I won't either."", So they stood, each with a foot placed at an angle as a brace, and both shoving with might and main, and glowering at each other with hate., But neither could get an advantage., After struggling till both were hot and flushed, each relaxed his strain with watchful caution, and Tom said:  ""You're a coward and a pup., I'll tell my big brother on you, and he can thrash you with his little finger, and I'll make him do it, too."", ""What do I care for your big brother?, I've got a brother that's bigger than he is--and what's more, he can throw him over that fence, too."", [Both brothers were imaginary.], ""That's a lie."", ""YOUR saying so don't make it so."", Tom drew a line in the dust with his big toe, and said:  ""I dare you to step over that, and I'll lick you till you can't stand up., Anybody that'll take a dare will steal sheep."", The new boy stepped over promptly, and said:  ""Now you said you'd do it, now let's see you do it."", ""Don't you crowd me now; you better look out."", ""Well, you SAID you'd do it--why don't you do it?"", ""By jingo!, for two cents I WILL do it."", The new boy took two broad coppers out of his pocket and held them out with derision., Tom struck them to the ground., In an instant both boys were rolling and tumbling in the dirt, gripped together like cats; and for the space of a minute they tugged and tore at each other's hair and clothes, punched and scratched each other's nose, and covered themselves with dust and glory., Presently the confusion took form, and through the fog of battle Tom appeared, seated astride the new boy, and pounding him with his fists., ""Holler 'nuff!"", said he., The boy only struggled to free himself., He was crying--mainly from rage., ""Holler 'nuff!"", --and the pounding went on., At last the stranger got out a smothered ""'Nuff!"", and Tom let him up and said:  ""Now that'll learn you., Better look out who you're fooling with next time."", The new boy went off brushing the dust from his clothes, sobbing, snuffling, and occasionally looking back and shaking his head and threatening what he would do to Tom the ""next time he caught him out."", To which Tom responded with jeers, and started off in high feather, and as soon as his back was turned the new boy snatched up a stone, threw it and hit him between the shoulders and then turned tail and ran like an antelope., Tom chased the traitor home, and thus found out where he lived., He then held a position at the gate for some time, daring the enemy to come outside, but the enemy only made faces at him through the window and declined., At last the enemy's mother appeared, and called Tom a bad, vicious, vulgar child, and ordered him away., So he went away; but he said he ""'lowed"" to ""lay"" for that boy., He got home pretty late that night, and when he climbed cautiously in at the window, he uncovered an ambuscade, in the person of his aunt; and when she saw the state his clothes were in her resolution to turn his Saturday holiday into captivity at hard labor became adamantine in its firmness., SATURDAY morning was come, and all the summer world was bright and fresh, and brimming with life., There was a song in every heart; and if the heart was young the music issued at the lips., There was cheer in every face and a spring in every step., The locust-trees were in bloom and the fragrance of the blossoms filled the air., Cardiff Hill, beyond the village and above it, was green with vegetation and it lay just far enough away to seem a Delectable Land, dreamy, reposeful, and inviting., Tom appeared on the sidewalk with a bucket of whitewash and a long-handled brush., He surveyed the fence, and all gladness left him and a deep melancholy settled down upon his spirit., Thirty yards of board fence nine feet high., Life to him seemed hollow, and existence but a burden., Sighing, he dipped his brush and passed it along the topmost plank; repeated the operation; did it again; compared the insignificant whitewashed streak with the far-reaching continent of unwhitewashed fence, and sat down on a tree-box discouraged., Jim came skipping out at the gate with a tin pail, and singing Buffalo Gals., Bringing water from the town pump had always been hateful work in Tom's eyes, before, but now it did not strike him so., He remembered that there was company at the pump., White, mulatto, and negro boys and girls were always there waiting their turns, resting, trading playthings, quarrelling, fighting, skylarking., And he remembered that although the pump was only a hundred and fifty yards off, Jim never got back with a bucket of water under an hour--and even then somebody generally had to go after him., Tom said:  ""Say, Jim, I'll fetch the water if you'll whitewash some."", Jim shook his head and said:  ""Can't, Mars Tom., Ole missis, she tole me I got to go an' git dis water an' not stop foolin' roun' wid anybody., She say she spec' Mars Tom gwine to ax me to whitewash, an' so she tole me go 'long an' 'tend to my own business--she 'lowed SHE'D 'tend to de whitewashin'."", ""Oh, never you mind what she said, Jim., That's the way she always talks., Gimme the bucket--I won't be gone only a a minute., SHE won't ever know."", ""Oh, I dasn't, Mars Tom., Ole missis she'd take an' tar de head off'n me., 'Deed she would."", ""SHE!, She never licks anybody--whacks 'em over the head with her thimble--and who cares for that, I'd like to know., She talks awful, but talk don't hurt--anyways it don't if she don't cry., Jim, I'll give you a marvel., I'll give you a white alley!"", Jim began to waver., ""White alley, Jim!, And it's a bully taw."", ""My!, Dat's a mighty gay marvel, I tell you!, But Mars Tom I's powerful 'fraid ole missis--""  ""And besides, if you will I'll show you my sore toe."", ...]"|1
23|"[So it's the same with Muff Potter, of course., But if a man was dead sober, I reckon maybe that whack might fetch him; I dono."", After another reflective silence, Tom said:  ""Hucky, you sure you can keep mum?"", ""Tom, we GOT to keep mum., You know that., That Injun devil wouldn't make any more of drownding us than a couple of cats, if we was to squeak 'bout this and they didn't hang him., Now, look-a-here, Tom, less take and swear to one another--that's what we got to do--swear to keep mum."", ""I'm agreed., It's the best thing., Would you just hold hands and swear that we--""  ""Oh no, that wouldn't do for this., That's good enough for little rubbishy common things--specially with gals, cuz THEY go back on you anyway, and blab if they get in a huff--but there orter be writing 'bout a big thing like this., And blood."", Tom's whole being applauded this idea., It was deep, and dark, and awful; the hour, the circumstances, the surroundings, were in keeping with it., He picked up a clean pine shingle that lay in the moonlight, took a little fragment of ""red keel"" out of his pocket, got the moon on his work, and painfully scrawled these lines, emphasizing each slow down-stroke by clamping his tongue between his teeth, and letting up the pressure on the up-strokes., [See next page.], ""Huck Finn and     Tom Sawyer swears     they will keep mum     about This and They     wish They may Drop     down dead in Their     Tracks if They ever     Tell and Rot."", Huckleberry was filled with admiration of Tom's facility in writing, and the sublimity of his language., He at once took a pin from his lapel and was going to prick his flesh, but Tom said:  ""Hold on!, Don't do that., A pin's brass., It might have verdigrease on it."", ""What's verdigrease?"", ""It's p'ison., That's what it is., You just swaller some of it once --you'll see."", So Tom unwound the thread from one of his needles, and each boy pricked the ball of his thumb and squeezed out a drop of blood., In time, after many squeezes, Tom managed to sign his initials, using the ball of his little finger for a pen., Then he showed Huckleberry how to make an H and an F, and the oath was complete., They buried the shingle close to the wall, with some dismal ceremonies and incantations, and the fetters that bound their tongues were considered to be locked and the key thrown away., A figure crept stealthily through a break in the other end of the ruined building, now, but they did not notice it., ""Tom,"" whispered Huckleberry, ""does this keep us from EVER telling --ALWAYS?"", ""Of course it does., It don't make any difference WHAT happens, we got to keep mum., We'd drop down dead--don't YOU know that?"", ""Yes, I reckon that's so."", They continued to whisper for some little time., Presently a dog set up a long, lugubrious howl just outside--within ten feet of them., The boys clasped each other suddenly, in an agony of fright., ""Which of us does he mean?"", gasped Huckleberry., ""I dono--peep through the crack., Quick!"", ""No, YOU, Tom!"", ""I can't--I can't DO it, Huck!"", ""Please, Tom., There 'tis again!"", ""Oh, lordy, I'm thankful!"", whispered Tom., ""I know his voice., It's Bull Harbison."", *  [* If Mr. Harbison owned a slave named Bull, Tom would have spoken of him as ""Harbison's Bull,"" but a son or a dog of that name was ""Bull Harbison.""], ""Oh, that's good--I tell you, Tom, I was most scared to death; I'd a bet anything it was a STRAY dog."", The dog howled again., The boys' hearts sank once more., ""Oh, my!, that ain't no Bull Harbison!"", whispered Huckleberry., ""DO, Tom!"", Tom, quaking with fear, yielded, and put his eye to the crack., His whisper was hardly audible when he said:  ""Oh, Huck, IT S A STRAY DOG!"", ""Quick, Tom, quick!, Who does he mean?"", ""Huck, he must mean us both--we're right together."", ""Oh, Tom, I reckon we're goners., I reckon there ain't no mistake 'bout where I'LL go to., I been so wicked."", ""Dad fetch it!, This comes of playing hookey and doing everything a feller's told NOT to do., I might a been good, like Sid, if I'd a tried --but no, I wouldn't, of course., But if ever I get off this time, I lay I'll just WALLER in Sunday-schools!"", And Tom began to snuffle a little., ""YOU bad!"", and Huckleberry began to snuffle too., ""Consound it, Tom Sawyer, you're just old pie, 'longside o' what I am., Oh, LORDY, lordy, lordy, I wisht I only had half your chance."", Tom choked off and whispered:  ""Look, Hucky, look!, He's got his BACK to us!"", Hucky looked, with joy in his heart., ""Well, he has, by jingoes!, Did he before?"", ""Yes, he did., But I, like a fool, never thought., Oh, this is bully, you know., NOW who can he mean?"", The howling stopped., Tom pricked up his ears., ""Sh!, What's that?"", he whispered., ""Sounds like--like hogs grunting., No--it's somebody snoring, Tom."", ""That IS it!, Where 'bouts is it, Huck?"", ""I bleeve it's down at 'tother end., Sounds so, anyway., Pap used to sleep there, sometimes, 'long with the hogs, but laws bless you, he just lifts things when HE snores., Besides, I reckon he ain't ever coming back to this town any more."", The spirit of adventure rose in the boys' souls once more., ""Hucky, do you das't to go if I lead?"", ...]"|1
24|"[Tom stood a moment, to gather his dismembered faculties; and when he stepped forward to go to his punishment the surprise, the gratitude, the adoration that shone upon him out of poor Becky's eyes seemed pay enough for a hundred floggings., Inspired by the splendor of his own act, he took without an outcry the most merciless flaying that even Mr. Dobbins had ever administered; and also received with indifference the added cruelty of a command to remain two hours after school should be dismissed--for he knew who would wait for him outside till his captivity was done, and not count the tedious time as loss, either., Tom went to bed that night planning vengeance against Alfred Temple; for with shame and repentance Becky had told him all, not forgetting her own treachery; but even the longing for vengeance had to give way, soon, to pleasanter musings, and he fell asleep at last with Becky's latest words lingering dreamily in his ear--  ""Tom, how COULD you be so noble!"", VACATION was approaching., The schoolmaster, always severe, grew severer and more exacting than ever, for he wanted the school to make a good showing on ""Examination"" day., His rod and his ferule were seldom idle now--at least among the smaller pupils., Only the biggest boys, and young ladies of eighteen and twenty, escaped lashing., Mr. Dobbins' lashings were very vigorous ones, too; for although he carried, under his wig, a perfectly bald and shiny head, he had only reached middle age, and there was no sign of feebleness in his muscle., As the great day approached, all the tyranny that was in him came to the surface; he seemed to take a vindictive pleasure in punishing the least shortcomings., The consequence was, that the smaller boys spent their days in terror and suffering and their nights in plotting revenge., They threw away no opportunity to do the master a mischief., But he kept ahead all the time., The retribution that followed every vengeful success was so sweeping and majestic that the boys always retired from the field badly worsted., At last they conspired together and hit upon a plan that promised a dazzling victory., They swore in the sign-painter's boy, told him the scheme, and asked his help., He had his own reasons for being delighted, for the master boarded in his father's family and had given the boy ample cause to hate him., The master's wife would go on a visit to the country in a few days, and there would be nothing to interfere with the plan; the master always prepared himself for great occasions by getting pretty well fuddled, and the sign-painter's boy said that when the dominie had reached the proper condition on Examination Evening he would ""manage the thing"" while he napped in his chair; then he would have him awakened at the right time and hurried away to school., In the fulness of time the interesting occasion arrived., At eight in the evening the schoolhouse was brilliantly lighted, and adorned with wreaths and festoons of foliage and flowers., The master sat throned in his great chair upon a raised platform, with his blackboard behind him., He was looking tolerably mellow., Three rows of benches on each side and six rows in front of him were occupied by the dignitaries of the town and by the parents of the pupils., To his left, back of the rows of citizens, was a spacious temporary platform upon which were seated the scholars who were to take part in the exercises of the evening; rows of small boys, washed and dressed to an intolerable state of discomfort; rows of gawky big boys; snowbanks of girls and young ladies clad in lawn and muslin and conspicuously conscious of their bare arms, their grandmothers' ancient trinkets, their bits of pink and blue ribbon and the flowers in their hair., All the rest of the house was filled with non-participating scholars., The exercises began., A very little boy stood up and sheepishly recited, ""You'd scarce expect one of my age to speak in public on the stage,"" etc.--accompanying himself with the painfully exact and spasmodic gestures which a machine might have used--supposing the machine to be a trifle out of order., But he got through safely, though cruelly scared, and got a fine round of applause when he made his manufactured bow and retired., A little shamefaced girl lisped, ""Mary had a little lamb,"" etc., performed a compassion-inspiring curtsy, got her meed of applause, and sat down flushed and happy., Tom Sawyer stepped forward with conceited confidence and soared into the unquenchable and indestructible ""Give me liberty or give me death"" speech, with fine fury and frantic gesticulation, and broke down in the middle of it., A ghastly stage-fright seized him, his legs quaked under him and he was like to choke., True, he had the manifest sympathy of the house but he had the house's silence, too, which was even worse than its sympathy., The master frowned, and this completed the disaster., Tom struggled awhile and then retired, utterly defeated., There was a weak attempt at applause, but it died early., ""The Boy Stood on the Burning Deck"" followed; also ""The Assyrian Came Down,"" and other declamatory gems., Then there were reading exercises, and a spelling fight., The meagre Latin class recited with honor., The prime feature of the evening was in order, now--original ""compositions"" by the young ladies., Each in her turn stepped forward to the edge of the platform, cleared her throat, held up her manuscript (tied with dainty ribbon), and proceeded to read, with labored attention to ""expression"" and punctuation., The themes were the same that had been illuminated upon similar occasions by their mothers before them, their grandmothers, and doubtless all their ancestors in the female line clear back to the Crusades., ""Friendship"" was one; ""Memories of Other Days""; ""Religion in History""; ""Dream Land""; ""The Advantages of Culture""; ""Forms of Political Government Compared and Contrasted""; ""Melancholy""; ""Filial Love""; ""Heart Longings,"" etc., etc., A prevalent feature in these compositions was a nursed and petted melancholy; another was a wasteful and opulent gush of ""fine language""; another was a tendency to lug in by the ears particularly prized words and phrases until they were worn entirely out; and a peculiarity that conspicuously marked and marred them was the inveterate and intolerable sermon that wagged its crippled tail at the end of each and every one of them., No matter what the subject might be, a brain-racking effort was made to squirm it into some aspect or other that the moral and religious mind could contemplate with edification., The glaring insincerity of these sermons was not sufficient to compass the banishment of the fashion from the schools, and it is not sufficient to-day; it never will be sufficient while the world stands, perhaps., There is no school in all our land where the young ladies do not feel obliged to close their compositions with a sermon; and you will find that the sermon of the most frivolous and the least religious girl in the school is always the longest and the most relentlessly pious., But enough of this., Homely truth is unpalatable., Let us return to the ""Examination."", The first composition that was read was one entitled ""Is this, then, Life?"", Perhaps the reader can endure an extract from it:    ""In the common walks of life, with what delightful    emotions does the youthful mind look forward to some    anticipated scene of festivity!, Imagination is busy    sketching rose-tinted pictures of joy., In fancy, the    voluptuous votary of fashion sees herself amid the    festive throng, 'the observed of all observers.', Her    graceful form, arrayed in snowy robes, is whirling    through the mazes of the joyous dance; her eye is    brightest, her step is lightest in the gay assembly., ""In such delicious fancies time quickly glides by,    and the welcome hour arrives for her entrance into    the Elysian world, of which she has had such bright    dreams., How fairy-like does everything appear to    her enchanted vision!, Each new scene is more charming    than the last., But after a while she finds that    beneath this goodly exterior, all is vanity, the    flattery which once charmed her soul, now grates    harshly upon her ear; the ball-room has lost its    charms; and with wasted health and imbittered heart,    she turns away with the conviction that earthly    pleasures cannot satisfy the longings of the soul!"", And so forth and so on., There was a buzz of gratification from time to time during the reading, accompanied by whispered ejaculations of ""How sweet!"", ""How eloquent!"", ""So true!"", etc., and after the thing had closed with a peculiarly afflicting sermon the applause was enthusiastic., Then arose a slim, melancholy girl, whose face had the ""interesting"" paleness that comes of pills and indigestion, and read a ""poem."", Two stanzas of it will do:     ""A MISSOURI MAIDEN'S FAREWELL TO ALABAMA     ""Alabama, good-bye!, I love thee well!, But yet for a while do I leave thee now!, Sad, yes, sad thoughts of thee my heart doth swell,       And burning recollections throng my brow!, For I have wandered through thy flowery woods;       Have roamed and read near Tallapoosa's stream;     Have listened to Tallassee's warring floods,       And wooed on Coosa's side Aurora's beam., ""Yet shame I not to bear an o'er-full heart,       Nor blush to turn behind my tearful eyes;     'Tis from no stranger land I now must part,       'Tis to no strangers left I yield these sighs., Welcome and home were mine within this State,       Whose vales I leave--whose spires fade fast from me     And cold must be mine eyes, and heart, and tete,       When, dear Alabama!, they turn cold on thee!"", There were very few there who knew what ""tete"" meant, but the poem was very satisfactory, nevertheless., Next appeared a dark-complexioned, black-eyed, black-haired young lady, who paused an impressive moment, assumed a tragic expression, and began to read in a measured, solemn tone:    ""A VISION     ""Dark and tempestuous was night., Around the    throne on high not a single star quivered; but    the deep intonations of the heavy thunder    constantly vibrated upon the ear; whilst the    terrific lightning revelled in angry mood    through the cloudy chambers of heaven, seeming    to scorn the power exerted over its terror by    the illustrious Franklin!, Even the boisterous    winds unanimously came forth from their mystic    homes, and blustered about as if to enhance by    their aid the wildness of the scene., ""At such a time, so dark, so dreary, for human    sympathy my very spirit sighed; but instead thereof,     ""'My dearest friend, my counsellor, my comforter    and guide--My joy in grief, my second bliss    in joy,' came to my side., She moved like one of    those bright beings pictured in the sunny walks    of fancy's Eden by the romantic and young, a    queen of beauty unadorned save by her own    transcendent loveliness., So soft was her step, it    failed to make even a sound, and but for the    magical thrill imparted by her genial touch, as    other unobtrusive beauties, she would have glided    away un-perceived--unsought., A strange sadness    rested upon her features, like icy tears upon    the robe of December, as she pointed to the    contending elements without, and bade me contemplate    the two beings presented."", This nightmare occupied some ten pages of manuscript and wound up with a sermon so destructive of all hope to non-Presbyterians that it took the first prize., This composition was considered to be the very finest effort of the evening., The mayor of the village, in delivering the prize to the author of it, made a warm speech in which he said that it was by far the most ""eloquent"" thing he had ever listened to, and that Daniel Webster himself might well be proud of it., It may be remarked, in passing, that the number of compositions in which the word ""beauteous"" was over-fondled, and human experience referred to as ""life's page,"" was up to the usual average., Now the master, mellow almost to the verge of geniality, put his chair aside, turned his back to the audience, and began to draw a map of America on the blackboard, to exercise the geography class upon., But he made a sad business of it with his unsteady hand, and a smothered titter rippled over the house., He knew what the matter was, and set himself to right it., He sponged out lines and remade them; but he only distorted them more than ever, and the tittering was more pronounced., He threw his entire attention upon his work, now, as if determined not to be put down by the mirth., He felt that all eyes were fastened upon him; he imagined he was succeeding, and yet the tittering continued; it even manifestly increased., And well it might., There was a garret above, pierced with a scuttle over his head; and down through this scuttle came a cat, suspended around the haunches by a string; she had a rag tied about her head and jaws to keep her from mewing; as she slowly descended she curved upward and clawed at the string, she swung downward and clawed at the intangible air., The tittering rose higher and higher--the cat was within six inches of the absorbed teacher's head--down, down, a little lower, and she grabbed his wig with her desperate claws, clung to it, and was snatched up into the garret in an instant with her trophy still in her possession!, And how the light did blaze abroad from the master's bald pate--for the sign-painter's boy had GILDED it!, That broke up the meeting., The boys were avenged., Vacation had come., NOTE:--The pretended ""compositions"" quoted in    this chapter are taken without alteration from a    volume entitled ""Prose and Poetry, by a Western    Lady""--but they are exactly and precisely after    the schoolgirl pattern, and hence are much    happier than any mere imitations could be., TOM joined the new order of Cadets of Temperance, being attracted by the showy character of their ""regalia."", He promised to abstain from smoking, chewing, and profanity as long as he remained a member., Now he found out a new thing--namely, that to promise not to do a thing is the surest way in the world to make a body want to go and do that very thing., ...]"|1
25|"[But I hope we won't get lost., It would be so awful!"", and the girl shuddered at the thought of the dreadful possibilities., They started through a corridor, and traversed it in silence a long way, glancing at each new opening, to see if there was anything familiar about the look of it; but they were all strange., Every time Tom made an examination, Becky would watch his face for an encouraging sign, and he would say cheerily:  ""Oh, it's all right., This ain't the one, but we'll come to it right away!"", But he felt less and less hopeful with each failure, and presently began to turn off into diverging avenues at sheer random, in desperate hope of finding the one that was wanted., He still said it was ""all right,"" but there was such a leaden dread at his heart that the words had lost their ring and sounded just as if he had said, ""All is lost!"", Becky clung to his side in an anguish of fear, and tried hard to keep back the tears, but they would come., At last she said:  ""Oh, Tom, never mind the bats, let's go back that way!, We seem to get worse and worse off all the time."", ""Listen!"", said he., Profound silence; silence so deep that even their breathings were conspicuous in the hush., Tom shouted., The call went echoing down the empty aisles and died out in the distance in a faint sound that resembled a ripple of mocking laughter., ""Oh, don't do it again, Tom, it is too horrid,"" said Becky., ""It is horrid, but I better, Becky; they might hear us, you know,"" and he shouted again., The ""might"" was even a chillier horror than the ghostly laughter, it so confessed a perishing hope., The children stood still and listened; but there was no result., Tom turned upon the back track at once, and hurried his steps., It was but a little while before a certain indecision in his manner revealed another fearful fact to Becky--he could not find his way back!, ""Oh, Tom, you didn't make any marks!"", ""Becky, I was such a fool!, Such a fool!, I never thought we might want to come back!, No--I can't find the way., It's all mixed up."", ""Tom, Tom, we're lost!, we're lost!, We never can get out of this awful place!, Oh, why DID we ever leave the others!"", She sank to the ground and burst into such a frenzy of crying that Tom was appalled with the idea that she might die, or lose her reason., He sat down by her and put his arms around her; she buried her face in his bosom, she clung to him, she poured out her terrors, her unavailing regrets, and the far echoes turned them all to jeering laughter., Tom begged her to pluck up hope again, and she said she could not., He fell to blaming and abusing himself for getting her into this miserable situation; this had a better effect., She said she would try to hope again, she would get up and follow wherever he might lead if only he would not talk like that any more., For he was no more to blame than she, she said., So they moved on again--aimlessly--simply at random--all they could do was to move, keep moving., For a little while, hope made a show of reviving--not with any reason to back it, but only because it is its nature to revive when the spring has not been taken out of it by age and familiarity with failure., By-and-by Tom took Becky's candle and blew it out., This economy meant so much!, Words were not needed., Becky understood, and her hope died again., She knew that Tom had a whole candle and three or four pieces in his pockets--yet he must economize., By-and-by, fatigue began to assert its claims; the children tried to pay attention, for it was dreadful to think of sitting down when time was grown to be so precious, moving, in some direction, in any direction, was at least progress and might bear fruit; but to sit down was to invite death and shorten its pursuit., At last Becky's frail limbs refused to carry her farther., She sat down., Tom rested with her, and they talked of home, and the friends there, and the comfortable beds and, above all, the light!, Becky cried, and Tom tried to think of some way of comforting her, but all his encouragements were grown threadbare with use, and sounded like sarcasms., Fatigue bore so heavily upon Becky that she drowsed off to sleep., Tom was grateful., He sat looking into her drawn face and saw it grow smooth and natural under the influence of pleasant dreams; and by-and-by a smile dawned and rested there., The peaceful face reflected somewhat of peace and healing into his own spirit, and his thoughts wandered away to bygone times and dreamy memories., While he was deep in his musings, Becky woke up with a breezy little laugh--but it was stricken dead upon her lips, and a groan followed it., ""Oh, how COULD I sleep!, I wish I never, never had waked!, No!, No, I don't, Tom!, Don't look so!, I won't say it again."", ""I'm glad you've slept, Becky; you'll feel rested, now, and we'll find the way out."", ""We can try, Tom; but I've seen such a beautiful country in my dream., I reckon we are going there."", ""Maybe not, maybe not., Cheer up, Becky, and let's go on trying."", They rose up and wandered along, hand in hand and hopeless., They tried to estimate how long they had been in the cave, but all they knew was that it seemed days and weeks, and yet it was plain that this could not be, for their candles were not gone yet., A long time after this--they could not tell how long--Tom said they must go softly and listen for dripping water--they must find a spring., They found one presently, and Tom said it was time to rest again., Both were cruelly tired, yet Becky said she thought she could go a little farther., She was surprised to hear Tom dissent., She could not understand it., They sat down, and Tom fastened his candle to the wall in front of them with some clay., Thought was soon busy; nothing was said for some time., Then Becky broke the silence:  ""Tom, I am so hungry!"", Tom took something out of his pocket., ""Do you remember this?"", said he., Becky almost smiled., ""It's our wedding-cake, Tom."", ""Yes--I wish it was as big as a barrel, for it's all we've got."", ""I saved it from the picnic for us to dream on, Tom, the way grown-up people do with wedding-cake--but it'll be our--""  She dropped the sentence where it was., Tom divided the cake and Becky ate with good appetite, while Tom nibbled at his moiety., There was abundance of cold water to finish the feast with., By-and-by Becky suggested that they move on again., Tom was silent a moment., Then he said:  ""Becky, can you bear it if I tell you something?"", Becky's face paled, but she thought she could., ""Well, then, Becky, we must stay here, where there's water to drink., That little piece is our last candle!"", Becky gave loose to tears and wailings., Tom did what he could to comfort her, but with little effect., At length Becky said:  ""Tom!"", ""Well, Becky?"", ""They'll miss us and hunt for us!"", ""Yes, they will!, Certainly they will!"", ""Maybe they're hunting for us now, Tom."", ""Why, I reckon maybe they are., ...]"|1
26|"[My head kept humming, ""A blue trip slip for an eight-cent fare, a buff trip slip for a six-cent fare,"" and so on and so on, without peace or respite., The day's work was ruined--I could see that plainly enough., I gave up and drifted down-town, and presently discovered that my feet were keeping time to that relentless jingle., When I could stand it no longer I altered my step., But it did no good; those rhymes accommodated themselves to the new step and went on harassing me just as before., I returned home, and suffered all the afternoon; suffered all through an unconscious and unrefreshing dinner; suffered, and cried, and jingled all through the evening; went to bed and rolled, tossed, and jingled right along, the same as ever; got up at midnight frantic, and tried to read; but there was nothing visible upon the whirling page except ""Punch!, punch in the presence of the passenjare."", By sunrise I was out of my mind, and everybody marveled and was distressed at the idiotic burden of my ravings--""Punch!, oh, punch!, punch in the presence of the passenjare!"", Two days later, on Saturday morning, I arose, a tottering wreck, and went forth to fulfil an engagement with a valued friend, the Rev., Mr.------, to walk to the Talcott Tower, ten miles distant., He stared at me, but asked no questions., We started., Mr.------ talked, talked, talked as is his wont., I said nothing; I heard nothing., At the end of a mile, Mr.------ said  ""Mark, are you sick?, I never saw a man look so haggard and worn and absent-minded., Say something, do!"", Drearily, without enthusiasm, I said: ""Punch brothers, punch with care!, Punch in the presence of the passenjare!"", My friend eyed me blankly, looked perplexed, they said:  ""I do not think I get your drift, Mark., Then does not seem to be any relevancy in what you have said, certainly nothing sad; and yet--maybe it was the way you said the words--I never heard anything that sounded so pathetic., What is--""  But I heard no more., I was already far away with my pitiless, heartbreaking ""blue trip slip for an eight-cent fare, buff trip slip for a six-cent fare, pink trip slip for a three-cent fare; punch in the presence of the passenjare."", I do not know what occurred during the other nine miles., However, all of a sudden Mr.------ laid his hand on my shoulder and shouted:  ""Oh, wake up!, wake up!, wake up!, Don't sleep all day!, Here we are at the Tower, man!, I have talked myself deaf and dumb and blind, and never got a response., Just look at this magnificent autumn landscape!, Look at it!, look at it!, Feast your eye on it!, You have traveled; you have seen boaster landscapes elsewhere., Come, now, deliver an honest opinion., What do you say to this?"", I sighed wearily; and murmured:  ""A buff trip slip for a six-cent fare, a pink trip slip for a three-cent fare, punch in the presence of the passenjare."", Rev., Mr. ------ stood there, very grave, full of concern, apparently, and looked long at me; then he said:  ""Mark, there is something about this that I cannot understand., Those are about the same words you said before; there does not seem to be anything in them, and yet they nearly break my heart when you say them., Punch in the--how is it they go?"", I began at the beginning and repeated all the lines., My friend's face lighted with interest., He said:  ""Why, what a captivating jingle it is!, It is almost music., It flows along so nicely., I have nearly caught the rhymes myself., Say them over just once more, and then I'll have them, sure."", I said them over., Then Mr. ------ said them., He made one little mistake, which I corrected., The next time and the next he got them right., Now a great burden seemed to tumble from my shoulders., That torturing jingle departed out of my brain, and a grateful sense of rest and peace descended upon me., I was light-hearted enough to sing; and I did sing for half an hour, straight along, as we went jogging homeward., Then my freed tongue found blessed speech again, and the pent talk of many a weary hour began to gush and flow., It flowed on and on, joyously, jubilantly, until the fountain was empty and dry., As I wrung my friend's hand at parting, I said:  ""Haven't we had a royal good time!, But now I remember, you haven't said a word for two hours., Come, come, out with something!"", The Rev., Mr.------ turned a lack-luster eye upon me, drew a deep sigh, and said, without animation, without apparent consciousness:  ""Punch, brothers, punch with care!, Punch in the presence of the passenjare!"", A pang shot through me as I said to myself, ""Poor fellow, poor fellow!, he has got it, now."", I did not see Mr.------ for two or three days after that., Then, on Tuesday evening, he staggered into my presence and sank dejectedly into a seat., He was pale, worn; he was a wreck., He lifted his faded eyes to my face and said:  ""Ah, Mark, it was a ruinous investment that I made in those heartless rhymes., They have ridden me like a nightmare, day and night, hour after hour, to this very moment., Since I saw you I have suffered the torments of the lost., Saturday evening I had a sudden call, by telegraph, and took the night train for Boston., The occasion was the death of a valued old friend who had requested that I should preach his funeral sermon., I took my seat in the cars and set myself to framing the discourse., But I never got beyond the opening paragraph; for then the train started and the car-wheels began their 'clack, clack-clack-clack-clack!, clack-clack!, --clack-clack-clack!', and right away those odious rhymes fitted themselves to that accompaniment., For an hour I sat there and set a syllable of those rhymes to every separate and distinct clack the car-wheels made., Why, I was as fagged out, then, as if I had been chopping wood all day., My skull was splitting with headache., It seemed to me that I must go mad if I sat there any longer; so I undressed and went to bed., I stretched myself out in my berth, and--well, you know what the result was., The thing went right along, just the same., 'Clack-clack clack, a blue trip slip, clack-clack-clack, for an eight cent fare; clack-clack-clack, a buff trip slip, clack clack-clack, for a six-cent fare, and so on, and so on, and so on punch in the presence of the passenjare!', Sleep?, Not a single wink!, I was almost a lunatic when I got to Boston., Don't ask me about the funeral., I did the best I could, but every solemn individual sentence was meshed and tangled and woven in and out with 'Punch, brothers, punch with care, punch in the presence of the passenjare.', And the most distressing thing was that my delivery dropped into the undulating rhythm of those pulsing rhymes, and I could actually catch absent-minded people nodding time to the swing of it with their stupid heads., And, Mark, you may believe it or not, but before I got through the entire assemblage were placidly bobbing their heads in solemn unison, mourners, undertaker, and all., The moment I had finished, I fled to the anteroom in a state bordering on frenzy., Of course it would be my luck to find a sorrowing and aged maiden aunt of the deceased there, who had arrived from Springfield too late to get into the church., She began to sob, and said:  ""'Oh, oh, he is gone, he is gone, and I didn't see him before he died!', ""'Yes!', I said, 'he is gone, he is gone, he is gone--oh, will this suffering never cease!', ...]"|1
27|"[In that instant that far-off raft appeared for a second against the red disk, its needlelike oar and diminutive signal cut sharp and black against the bright surface, and in the next instant was thrust away into the dusk again., But that ship, that captain, and that pregnant instant had had their work appointed for them in the dawn of time and could not fail of the performance., The chronometer of God never errs!"", There was deep, thoughtful silence for some moments., Then the grave, pale young man said:  ""What is the chronometer of God?"", II  At dinner, six o'clock, the same people assembled whom we had talked with on deck and seen at luncheon and breakfast this second day out, and at dinner the evening before., That is to say, three journeying ship-masters, a Boston merchant, and a returning Bermudian who had been absent from his Bermuda thirteen years; these sat on the starboard side., On the port side sat the Reverend in the seat of honor; the pale young man next to him; I next; next to me an aged Bermudian, returning to his sunny islands after an absence of twenty-seven years., Of course, our captain was at the head of the table, the purser at the foot of it., A small company, but small companies are pleasantest., No racks upon the table; the sky cloudless, the sun brilliant, the blue sea scarcely ruffled; then what had become of the four married couples, the three bachelors, and the active and obliging doctor from the rural districts of Pennsylvania?--for all these were on deck when we sailed down New York harbor., This is the explanation., I quote from my note-book:       Thursday, 3.30 P.M., Under way, passing the Battery., The large      party, of four married couples, three bachelors, and a cheery,      exhilarating doctor from the wilds of Pennsylvania, are evidently      traveling together., All but the doctor grouped in camp-chairs on      deck., Passing principal fort., The doctor is one of those people who has      an infallible preventive of seasickness; is flitting from friend to      friend administering it and saying, ""Don't you be afraid; I know      this medicine; absolutely infallible; prepared under my own      supervision."", Takes a dose himself, intrepidly., 4.15 P.M.  Two of those ladies have struck their colors,      notwithstanding the ""infallible."", They have gone below., The other      two begin to show distress., 5 P.M.  Exit one husband and one bachelor., These still had their      infallible in cargo when they started, but arrived at the      companionway without it., 5.10., Lady No., 3, two bachelors, and one married man have gone      below with their own opinion of the infallible., 5.20., Passing Quarantine Hulk., The infallible has done the      business for all the party except the Scotchman's wife and the      author of that formidable remedy., Nearing the Light-Ship., Exit the Scotchman's wife, head drooped on      stewardess's shoulder., Entering the open sea., Exit doctor!, The rout seems permanent; hence the smallness of the company at table since the voyage began., Our captain is a grave, handsome Hercules of thirty-five, with a brown hand of such majestic size that one cannot eat for admiring it and wondering if a single kid or calf could furnish material for gloving it., Conversation not general; drones along between couples., One catches a sentence here and there., Like this, from Bermudian of thirteen years' absence: ""It is the nature of women to ask trivial, irrelevant, and pursuing questions--questions that pursue you from a beginning in nothing to a run-to-cover in nowhere."", Reply of Bermudian of twenty-seven years' absence:  ""Yes; and to think they have logical, analytical minds and argumentative ability., You see 'em begin to whet up whenever they smell argument in the air."", Plainly these be philosophers., Twice since we left port our engines have stopped for a couple of minutes at a time., Now they stop again., Says the pale young man, meditatively, ""There!--that engineer is sitting down to rest again."", Grave stare from the captain, whose mighty jaws cease to work, and whose harpooned potato stops in midair on its way to his open, paralyzed mouth., Presently he says in measured tones, ""Is it your idea that the engineer of this ship propels her by a crank turned by his own hands?"", The pale young man studies over this a moment, then lifts up his guileless eyes, and says, ""Don't he?"", Thus gently falls the death-blow to further conversation, and the dinner drags to its close in a reflective silence, disturbed by no sounds but the murmurous wash of the sea and the subdued clash of teeth., After a smoke and a promenade on deck, where is no motion to discompose our steps, we think of a game of whist., We ask the brisk and capable stewardess from Ireland if there are any cards in the ship., ""Bless your soul, dear, indeed there is., Not a whole pack, true for ye, but not enough missing to signify."", However, I happened by accident to bethink me of a new pack in a morocco case, in my trunk, which I had placed there by mistake, thinking it to be a flask of something., So a party of us conquered the tedium of the evening with a few games and were ready for bed at six bells, mariner's time, the signal for putting out the lights., There was much chat in the smoking-cabin on the upper deck after luncheon to-day, mostly whaler yarns from those old sea-captains., Captain Tom Bowling was garrulous., He had that garrulous attention to minor detail which is born of secluded farm life or life at sea on long voyages, where there is little to do and time no object., He would sail along till he was right in the most exciting part of a yarn, and then say, ""Well, as I was saying, the rudder was fouled, ship driving before the gale, head-on, straight for the iceberg, all hands holding their breath, turned to stone, top-hamper giving 'way, sails blown to ribbons, first one stick going, then another, boom!, smash!, crash!, duck your head and stand from under!, when up comes Johnny Rogers, capstan-bar in hand, eyes a-blazing, hair a-flying ., ., ., no, 'twa'n't Johnny Rogers., ., ., lemme see ., ., seems to me Johnny Rogers wa'n't along that voyage; he was along one voyage, I know that mighty well, but somehow it seems to me that he signed the articles for this voyage, but--but--whether he come along or not, or got left, or something happened--""  And so on and so on till the excitement all cooled down and nobody cared whether the ship struck the iceberg or not., In the course of his talk he rambled into a criticism upon New England degrees of merit in ship building., Said he, ""You get a vessel built away down Maine-way; Bath, for instance; what's the result?, First thing you do, you want to heave her down for repairs--that's the result!, Well, sir, she hain't been hove down a week till you can heave a dog through her seams., You send that vessel to sea, and what's the result?, She wets her oakum the first trip!, Leave it to any man if 'tain't so., Well, you let our folks build you a vessel--down New Bedford-way., What's the result?, Well, sir, you might take that ship and heave her down, and keep her hove down six months, and she'll never shed a tear!"", Everybody, landsmen and all, recognized the descriptive neatness of that figure, and applauded, which greatly pleased the old man., A moment later, the meek eyes of the pale young fellow heretofore mentioned came up slowly, rested upon the old man's face a moment, and the meek mouth began to open., ""Shet your head!"", shouted the old mariner., It was a rather startling surprise to everybody, but it was effective in the matter of its purpose., So the conversation flowed on instead of perishing., There was some talk about the perils of the sea, and a landsman delivered himself of the customary nonsense about the poor mariner wandering in far oceans, tempest-tossed, pursued by dangers, every storm-blast and thunderbolt in the home skies moving the friends by snug firesides to compassion for that poor mariner, and prayers for his succor., Captain Bowling put up with this for a while, and then burst out with a new view of the matter., ""Come, belay there!, I have read this kind of rot all my life in poetry and tales and such-like rubbage., Pity for the poor mariner!, sympathy for the poor mariner!, All right enough, but not in the way the poetry puts it., Pity for the mariner's wife!, all right again, but not in the way the poetry puts it., Look-a here!, whose life's the safest in the whole world The poor mariner's., You look at the statistics, you'll see., So don't you fool away any sympathy on the poor mariner's dangers and privations and sufferings., ...]"|1
28|"[Well, a cat does--but you let a cat get excited once; you let a cat get to pulling fur with another cat on a shed, nights, and you'll hear grammar that will give you the lockjaw., Ignorant people think it's the NOISE which fighting cats make that is so aggravating, but it ain't so; it's the sickening grammar they use., Now I've never heard a jay use bad grammar but very seldom; and when they do, they are as ashamed as a human; they shut right down and leave., ""You may call a jay a bird., Well, so he is, in a measure --but he's got feathers on him, and don't belong to no church, perhaps; but otherwise he is just as much human as you be., And I'll tell you for why., A jay's gifts, and instincts, and feelings, and interests, cover the whole ground., A jay hasn't got any more principle than a Congressman., A jay will lie, a jay will steal, a jay will deceive, a jay will betray; and four times out of five, a jay will go back on his solemnest promise., The sacredness of an obligation is such a thing which you can't cram into no bluejay's head., Now, on top of all this, there's another thing; a jay can out-swear any gentleman in the mines., You think a cat can swear., Well, a cat can; but you give a bluejay a subject that calls for his reserve-powers, and where is your cat?, Don't talk to ME--I know too much about this thing; in the one little particular of scolding--just good, clean, out-and-out scolding --a bluejay can lay over anything, human or divine., Yes, sir, a jay is everything that a man is., A jay can cry, a jay can laugh, a jay can feel shame, a jay can reason and plan and discuss, a jay likes gossip and scandal, a jay has got a sense of humor, a jay knows when he is an ass just as well as you do--maybe better., If a jay ain't human, he better take in his sign, that's all., Now I'm going to tell you a perfectly true fact about some bluejays."", ""When I first begun to understand jay language correctly, there was a little incident happened here., Seven years ago, the last man in this region but me moved away., There stands his house--been empty ever since; a log house, with a plank roof--just one big room, and no more; no ceiling--nothing between the rafters and the floor., Well, one Sunday morning I was sitting out here in front of my cabin, with my cat, taking the sun, and looking at the blue hills, and listening to the leaves rustling so lonely in the trees, and thinking of the home away yonder in the states, that I hadn't heard from in thirteen years, when a bluejay lit on that house, with an acorn in his mouth, and says, 'Hello, I reckon I've struck something.', When he spoke, the acorn dropped out of his mouth and rolled down the roof, of course, but he didn't care; his mind was all on the thing he had struck., It was a knot-hole in the roof., He cocked his head to one side, shut one eye and put the other one to the hole, like a possum looking down a jug; then he glanced up with his bright eyes, gave a wink or two with his wings--which signifies gratification, you understand--and says, 'It looks like a hole, it's located like a hole--blamed if I don't believe it IS a hole!', ""Then he cocked his head down and took another look; he glances up perfectly joyful, this time; winks his wings and his tail both, and says, 'Oh, no, this ain't no fat thing, I reckon!, If I ain't in luck!, --Why it's a perfectly elegant hole!', So he flew down and got that acorn, and fetched it up and dropped it in, and was just tilting his head back, with the heavenliest smile on his face, when all of a sudden he was paralyzed into a listening attitude and that smile faded gradually out of his countenance like breath off'n a razor, and the queerest look of surprise took its place., Then he says, 'Why, I didn't hear it fall!', He cocked his eye at the hole again, and took a long look; raised up and shook his head; stepped around to the other side of the hole and took another look from that side; shook his head again., He studied a while, then he just went into the Details --walked round and round the hole and spied into it from every point of the compass., No use., Now he took a thinking attitude on the comb of the roof and scratched the back of his head with his right foot a minute, and finally says, 'Well, it's too many for ME, that's certain; must be a mighty long hole; however, I ain't got no time to fool around here, I got to ""tend to business""; I reckon it's all right--chance it, anyway.', ""So he flew off and fetched another acorn and dropped it in, and tried to flirt his eye to the hole quick enough to see what become of it, but he was too late., He held his eye there as much as a minute; then he raised up and sighed, and says, 'Confound it, I don't seem to understand this thing, no way; however, I'll tackle her again.', He fetched another acorn, and done his level best to see what become of it, but he couldn't., He says, 'Well, I never struck no such a hole as this before; I'm of the opinion it's a totally new kind of a hole.', Then he begun to get mad., He held in for a spell, walking up and down the comb of the roof and shaking his head and muttering to himself; but his feelings got the upper hand of him, presently, and he broke loose and cussed himself black in the face., I never see a bird take on so about a little thing., When he got through he walks to the hole and looks in again for half a minute; then he says, 'Well, you're a long hole, and a deep hole, and a mighty singular hole altogether--but I've started in to fill you, and I'm damned if I DON'T fill you, if it takes a hundred years!', ""And with that, away he went., You never see a bird work so since you was born., He laid into his work like a nigger, and the way he hove acorns into that hole for about two hours and a half was one of the most exciting and astonishing spectacles I ever struck., He never stopped to take a look anymore--he just hove 'em in and went for more., Well, at last he could hardly flop his wings, he was so tuckered out., He comes a-dropping down, once more, sweating like an ice-pitcher, dropped his acorn in and says, 'NOW I guess I've got the bulge on you by this time!', So he bent down for a look., If you'll believe me, when his head come up again he was just pale with rage., He says, 'I've shoveled acorns enough in there to keep the family thirty years, and if I can see a sign of one of 'em I wish I may land in a museum with a belly full of sawdust in two minutes!', ""He just had strength enough to crawl up on to the comb and lean his back agin the chimbly, and then he collected his impressions and begun to free his mind., I see in a second that what I had mistook for profanity in the mines was only just the rudiments, as you may say., ""Another jay was going by, and heard him doing his devotions, and stops to inquire what was up., The sufferer told him the whole circumstance, and says, 'Now yonder's the hole, and if you don't believe me, go and look for yourself.', So this fellow went and looked, and comes back and says, 'How many did you say you put in there?', 'Not any less than two tons,' says the sufferer., The other jay went and looked again., He couldn't seem to make it out, so he raised a yell, and three more jays come., They all examined the hole, they all made the sufferer tell it over again, then they all discussed it, and got off as many leather-headed opinions about it as an average crowd of humans could have done., ""They called in more jays; then more and more, till pretty soon this whole region 'peared to have a blue flush about it., There must have been five thousand of them; and such another jawing and disputing and ripping and cussing, you never heard., Every jay in the whole lot put his eye to the hole and delivered a more chuckle-headed opinion about the mystery than the jay that went there before him., They examined the house all over, too., The door was standing half open, and at last one old jay happened to go and light on it and look in., Of course, that knocked the mystery galley-west in a second., There lay the acorns, scattered all over the floor.., He flopped his wings and raised a whoop., 'Come here!', he says, 'Come here, everybody; hang'd if this fool hasn't been trying to fill up a house with acorns!', They all came a-swooping down like a blue cloud, and as each fellow lit on the door and took a glance, the whole absurdity of the contract that that first jay had tackled hit him home and he fell over backward suffocating with laughter, and the next jay took his place and done the same., ""Well, sir, they roosted around here on the housetop and the trees for an hour, and guffawed over that thing like human beings., It ain't any use to tell me a bluejay hasn't got a sense of humor, because I know better., And memory, too., They brought jays here from all over the United States to look down that hole, every summer for three years., Other birds, too., And they could all see the point except an owl that come from Nova Scotia to visit the Yo Semite, and he took this thing in on his way back., He said he couldn't see anything funny in it., But then he was a good deal disappointed about Yo Semite, too."", The summer semester was in full tide; consequently the most frequent figure in and about Heidelberg was the student., Most of the students were Germans, of course, but the representatives of foreign lands were very numerous., They hailed from every corner of the globe--for instruction is cheap in Heidelberg, and so is living, too., The Anglo-American Club, composed of British and American students, had twenty-five members, and there was still much material left to draw from., Nine-tenths of the Heidelberg students wore no badge or uniform; the other tenth wore caps of various colors, and belonged to social organizations called ""corps."", There were five corps, each with a color of its own; there were white caps, blue caps, and red, yellow, and green ones., The famous duel-fighting is confined to the ""corps"" boys., The ""KNEIP"" seems to be a specialty of theirs, too., Kneips are held, now and then, to celebrate great occasions, like the election of a beer king, for instance., The solemnity is simple; the five corps assemble at night, and at a signal they all fall loading themselves with beer, out of pint-mugs, as fast as possible, and each man keeps his own count--usually by laying aside a lucifer match for each mud he empties., The election is soon decided., When the candidates can hold no more, a count is instituted and the one who has drank the greatest number of pints is proclaimed king., I was told that the last beer king elected by the corps--or by his own capabilities--emptied his mug seventy-five times., No stomach could hold all that quantity at one time, of course--but there are ways of frequently creating a vacuum, which those who have been much at sea will understand., One sees so many students abroad at all hours, that he presently begins to wonder if they ever have any working-hours., Some of them have, some of them haven't., Each can choose for himself whether he will work or play; for German university life is a very free life; it seems to have no restraints., The student does not live in the college buildings, but hires his own lodgings, in any locality he prefers, and he takes his meals when and where he pleases., He goes to bed when it suits him, and does not get up at all unless he wants to., He is not entered at the university for any particular length of time; so he is likely to change about., He passes no examinations upon entering college., ...]"|1
29|"[In the chancel was a twisted stone column, and the captain told us a legend about it, of course, for in the matter of legends he could not seem to restrain himself; but I do not repeat his tale because there was nothing plausible about it except that the Hero wrenched this column into its present screw-shape with his hands --just one single wrench., All the rest of the legend was doubtful., But Hirschhorn is best seen from a distance, down the river., Then the clustered brown towers perched on the green hilltop, and the old battlemented stone wall, stretching up and over the grassy ridge and disappearing in the leafy sea beyond, make a picture whose grace and beauty entirely satisfy the eye., We descended from the church by steep stone stairways which curved this way and that down narrow alleys between the packed and dirty tenements of the village., It was a quarter well stocked with deformed, leering, unkempt and uncombed idiots, who held out hands or caps and begged piteously., The people of the quarter were not all idiots, of course, but all that begged seemed to be, and were said to be., I was thinking of going by skiff to the next town, Necharsteinach; so I ran to the riverside in advance of the party and asked a man there if he had a boat to hire., I suppose I must have spoken High German--Court German--I intended it for that, anyway--so he did not understand me., I turned and twisted my question around and about, trying to strike that man's average, but failed., He could not make out what I wanted., Now Mr. X arrived, faced this same man, looked him in the eye, and emptied this sentence on him, in the most glib and confident way: ""Can man boat get here?"", The mariner promptly understood and promptly answered., I can comprehend why he was able to understand that particular sentence, because by mere accident all the words in it except ""get"" have the same sound and the same meaning in German that they have in English; but how he managed to understand Mr. X's next remark puzzled me., I will insert it, presently., X turned away a moment, and I asked the mariner if he could not find a board, and so construct an additional seat., I spoke in the purest German, but I might as well have spoken in the purest Choctaw for all the good it did., The man tried his best to understand me; he tried, and kept on trying, harder and harder, until I saw it was really of no use, and said:  ""There, don't strain yourself--it is of no consequence."", Then X turned to him and crisply said:  ""MACHEN SIE a flat board."", I wish my epitaph may tell the truth about me if the man did not answer up at once, and say he would go and borrow a board as soon as he had lit the pipe which he was filling., We changed our mind about taking a boat, so we did not have to go., I have given Mr. X's two remarks just as he made them., Four of the five words in the first one were English, and that they were also German was only accidental, not intentional; three out of the five words in the second remark were English, and English only, and the two German ones did not mean anything in particular, in such a connection., X always spoke English to Germans, but his plan was to turn the sentence wrong end first and upside down, according to German construction, and sprinkle in a German word without any essential meaning to it, here and there, by way of flavor., Yet he always made himself understood., He could make those dialect-speaking raftsmen understand him, sometimes, when even young Z had failed with them; and young Z was a pretty good German scholar., For one thing, X always spoke with such confidence--perhaps that helped., And possibly the raftsmen's dialect was what is called PLATT-DEUTSCH, and so they found his English more familiar to their ears than another man's German., Quite indifferent students of German can read Fritz Reuter's charming platt-Deutch tales with some little facility because many of the words are English., I suppose this is the tongue which our Saxon ancestors carried to England with them., By and by I will inquire of some other philologist., However, in the mean time it had transpired that the men employed to calk the raft had found that the leak was not a leak at all, but only a crack between the logs--a crack that belonged there, and was not dangerous, but had been magnified into a leak by the disordered imagination of the mate., Therefore we went aboard again with a good degree of confidence, and presently got to sea without accident., As we swam smoothly along between the enchanting shores, we fell to swapping notes about manners and customs in Germany and elsewhere., As I write, now, many months later, I perceive that each of us, by observing and noting and inquiring, diligently and day by day, had managed to lay in a most varied and opulent stock of misinformation., But this is not surprising; it is very difficult to get accurate details in any country., For example, I had the idea once, in Heidelberg, to find out all about those five student-corps., I started with the White Cap corps., I began to inquire of this and that and the other citizen, and here is what I found out:  1., It is called the Prussian Corps, because none but Prussians are admitted to it., 2., It is called the Prussian Corps for no particular reason., It has simply pleased each corps to name itself after some German state., 3., It is not named the Prussian Corps at all, but only the White Cap Corps., 4., Any student can belong to it who is a German by birth., 5., Any student can belong to it who is European by birth., 6., Any European-born student can belong to it, except he be a Frenchman., 7., Any student can belong to it, no matter where he was born., 8., No student can belong to it who is not of noble blood., 9., No student can belong to it who cannot show three full generations of noble descent., 10., Nobility is not a necessary qualification., 11., No moneyless student can belong to it., 12., Money qualification is nonsense--such a thing has never been thought of., I got some of this information from students themselves --students who did not belong to the corps., I finally went to headquarters--to the White Caps--where I would have gone in the first place if I had been acquainted., But even at headquarters I found difficulties; I perceived that there were things about the White Cap Corps which one member knew and another one didn't., It was natural; for very few members of any organization know ALL that can be known about it., I doubt there is a man or a woman in Heidelberg who would not answer promptly and confidently three out of every five questions about the White Cap Corps which a stranger might ask; yet it is a very safe bet that two of the three answers would be incorrect every time., There is one German custom which is universal--the bowing courteously to strangers when sitting down at table or rising up from it., This bow startles a stranger out of his self-possession, the first time it occurs, and he is likely to fall over a chair or something, in his embarrassment, but it pleases him, nevertheless., One soon learns to expect this bow and be on the lookout and ready to return it; but to learn to lead off and make the initial bow one's self is a difficult matter for a diffident man., One thinks, ""If I rise to go, and tender my box, and these ladies and gentlemen take it into their heads to ignore the custom of their nation, and not return it, how shall I feel, in case I survive to feel anything."", Therefore he is afraid to venture., He sits out the dinner, and makes the strangers rise first and originate the bowing., A table d'ho^te dinner is a tedious affair for a man who seldom touches anything after the three first courses; therefore I used to do some pretty dreary waiting because of my fears., It took me months to assure myself that those fears were groundless, but I did assure myself at last by experimenting diligently through my agent., I made Harris get up and bow and leave; invariably his bow was returned, then I got up and bowed myself and retired., Thus my education proceeded easily and comfortably for me, but not for Harris., Three courses of a table d'ho^te dinner were enough for me, but Harris preferred thirteen., Even after I had acquired full confidence, and no longer needed the agent's help, I sometimes encountered difficulties., Once at Baden-Baden I nearly lost a train because I could not be sure that three young ladies opposite me at table were Germans, since I had not heard them speak; they might be American, they might be English, it was not safe to venture a bow; but just as I had got that far with my thought, one of them began a German remark, to my great relief and gratitude; and before she got out her third word, our bows had been delivered and graciously returned, and we were off., There is a friendly something about the German character which is very winning., When Harris and I were making a pedestrian tour through the Black Forest, we stopped at a little country inn for dinner one day; two young ladies and a young gentleman entered and sat down opposite us., They were pedestrians, too., Our knapsacks were strapped upon our backs, but they had a sturdy youth along to carry theirs for them., All parties were hungry, so there was no talking., By and by the usual bows were exchanged, and we separated., As we sat at a late breakfast in the hotel at Allerheiligen, next morning, these young people and took places near us without observing us; but presently they saw us and at once bowed and smiled; not ceremoniously, but with the gratified look of people who have found acquaintances where they were expecting strangers., Then they spoke of the weather and the roads., We also spoke of the weather and the roads., Next, they said they had had an enjoyable walk, notwithstanding the weather., We said that that had been our case, too., Then they said they had walked thirty English miles the day before, and asked how many we had walked., I could not lie, so I told Harris to do it., Harris told them we had made thirty English miles, too., That was true; we had ""made"" them, though we had had a little assistance here and there., After breakfast they found us trying to blast some information out of the dumb hotel clerk about routes, and observing that we were not succeeding pretty well, they went and got their maps and things, and pointed out and explained our course so clearly that even a New York detective could have followed it., And when we started they spoke out a hearty good-by and wished us a pleasant journey., Perhaps they were more generous with us than they might have been with native wayfarers because we were a forlorn lot and in a strange land; I don't know; I only know it was lovely to be treated so., Very well, I took an American young lady to one of the fine balls in Baden-Baden, one night, and at the entrance-door upstairs we were halted by an official--something about Miss Jones's dress was not according to rule;

31|"[One must have a silk veil, to protect his face from snow, sleet, hail and gale, and colored goggles to protect his eyes from that dangerous enemy, snow-blindness., Finally, there must be some porters, to carry provisions, wine and scientific instruments, and also blanket bags for the party to sleep in., I closed my readings with a fearful adventure which Mr. Whymper once had on the Matterhorn when he was prowling around alone, five thousand feet above the town of Breil., He was edging his way gingerly around the corner of a precipice where the upper edge of a sharp declivity of ice-glazed snow joined it., This declivity swept down a couple of hundred feet, into a gully which curved around and ended at a precipice eight hundred feet high, overlooking a glacier., His foot slipped, and he fell., He says:  ""My knapsack brought my head down first, and I pitched into some rocks about a dozen feet below; they caught something, and tumbled me off the edge, head over heels, into the gully; the baton was dashed from my hands, and I whirled downward in a series of bounds, each longer than the last; now over ice, now into rocks, striking my head four or five times, each time with increased force., The last bound sent me spinning through the air in a leap of fifty or sixty feet, from one side of the gully to the other, and I struck the rocks, luckily, with the whole of my left side., They caught my clothes for a moment, and I fell back on to the snow with motion arrested., My head fortunately came the right side up, and a few frantic catches brought me to a halt, in the neck of the gully and on the verge of the precipice., Baton, hat, and veil skimmed by and disappeared, and the crash of the rocks--which I had started--as they fell on to the glacier, told how narrow had been the escape from utter destruction., As it was, I fell nearly two hundred feet in seven or eight bounds., Ten feet more would have taken me in one gigantic leaps of eight hundred feet on to the glacier below., ""The situation was sufficiently serious., The rocks could not be let go for a moment, and the blood was spurting out of more than twenty cuts., The most serious ones were in the head, and I vainly tried to close them with one hand, while holding on with the other., It was useless; the blood gushed out in blinding jets at each pulsation., At last, in a moment of inspiration, I kicked out a big lump of snow and struck it as plaster on my head., The idea was a happy one, and the flow of blood diminished., Then, scrambling up, I got, not a moment too soon, to a place of safety, and fainted away., The sun was setting when consciousness returned, and it was pitch-dark before the Great Staircase was descended; but by a combination of luck and care, the whole four thousand seven hundred feet of descent to Breil was accomplished without a slip, or once missing the way."", His wounds kept him abed some days., Then he got up and climbed that mountain again., That is the way with a true Alp-climber; the more fun he has, the more he wants., After I had finished my readings, I was no longer myself; I was tranced, uplifted, intoxicated, by the almost incredible perils and adventures I had been following my authors through, and the triumphs I had been sharing with them., I sat silent some time, then turned to Harris and said:  ""My mind is made up."", Something in my tone struck him: and when he glanced at my eye and read what was written there, his face paled perceptibly., He hesitated a moment, then said:  ""Speak."", I answered, with perfect calmness:  ""I will ascend the Riffelberg."", If I had shot my poor friend he could not have fallen from his chair more suddenly., If I had been his father he could not have pleaded harder to get me to give up my purpose., But I turned a deaf ear to all he said., When he perceived at last that nothing could alter my determination, he ceased to urge, and for a while the deep silence was broken only by his sobs., I sat in marble resolution, with my eyes fixed upon vacancy, for in spirit I was already wrestling with the perils of the mountains, and my friend sat gazing at me in adoring admiration through his tears., At last he threw himself upon me in a loving embrace and exclaimed in broken tones:  ""Your Harris will never desert you., We will die together."", I cheered the noble fellow with praises, and soon his fears were forgotten and he was eager for the adventure., He wanted to summon the guides at once and leave at two in the morning, as he supposed the custom was; but I explained that nobody was looking at that hour; and that the start in the dark was not usually made from the village but from the first night's resting-place on the mountain side., I said we would leave the village at 3 or 4 P.M. on the morrow; meantime he could notify the guides, and also let the public know of the attempt which we proposed to make., I went to bed, but not to sleep., No man can sleep when he is about to undertake one of these Alpine exploits., I tossed feverishly all night long, and was glad enough when I heard the clock strike half past eleven and knew it was time to get up for dinner., I rose, jaded and rusty, and went to the noon meal, where I found myself the center of interest and curiosity; for the news was already abroad., It is not easy to eat calmly when you are a lion; but it is very pleasant, nevertheless., As usual, at Zermatt, when a great ascent is about to be undertaken, everybody, native and foreign, laid aside his own projects and took up a good position to observe the start., The expedition consisted of 198 persons, including the mules; or 205, including the cows., As follows:  CHIEFS OF SERVICE SUBORDINATES  Myself 1 Veterinary Surgeon Mr. Harris 1 Butler 17 Guides 12 Waiters 4 Surgeons 1 Footman 1 Geologist 1 Barber 1 Botanist 1 Head Cook 3 Chaplains 9 Assistants 15 Barkeepers 1 Confectionery Artist 1 Latinist  TRANSPORTATION, ETC., 27 Porters 3 Coarse Washers and Ironers 44 Mules 1 Fine ditto 44 Muleteers 7 Cows 2 Milkers  Total, 154 men, 51 animals., Grand Total, 205., RATIONS, ETC., APPARATUS  16 Cases Hams 25 Spring Mattresses 2 Barrels Flour 2 Hair ditto 22 Barrels Whiskey Bedding for same 1 Barrel Sugar 2 Mosquito-nets 1 Keg Lemons 29 Tents 2,000 Cigars Scientific Instruments 1 Barrel Pies 97 Ice-axes 1 Ton of Pemmican 5 Cases Dynamite 143 Pair Crutches 7 Cans Nitroglycerin 2 Barrels Arnica 22 40-foot Ladders 1 Bale of Lint 2 Miles of Rope 27 Kegs Paregoric 154 Umbrellas  It was full four o'clock in the afternoon before my cavalcade was entirely ready., At that hour it began to move., In point of numbers and spectacular effect, it was the most imposing expedition that had ever marched from Zermatt., I commanded the chief guide to arrange the men and animals in single file, twelve feet apart, and lash them all together on a strong rope., He objected that the first two miles was a dead level, with plenty of room, and that the rope was never used except in very dangerous places., But I would not listen to that., My reading had taught me that many serious accidents had happened in the Alps simply from not having the people tied up soon enough; I was not going to add one to the list., The guide then obeyed my order., When the procession stood at ease, roped together, and ready to move, I never saw a finer sight., It was 3,122 feet long--over half a mile; every man and me was on foot, and had on his green veil and his blue goggles, and his white rag around his hat, and his coil of rope over one shoulder and under the other, and his ice-ax in his belt, and carried his alpenstock in his left hand, his umbrella (closed) in his right, and his crutches slung at his back., The burdens of the pack-mules and the horns of the cows were decked with the Edelweiss and the Alpine rose., I and my agent were the only persons mounted., We were in the post of danger in the extreme rear, and tied securely to five guides apiece., Our armor-bearers carried our ice-axes, alpenstocks, and other implements for us., We were mounted upon very small donkeys, as a measure of safety; in time of peril we could straighten our legs and stand up, and let the donkey walk from under., Still, I cannot recommend this sort of animal--at least for excursions of mere pleasure--because his ears interrupt the view., I and my agent possessed the regulation mountaineering costumes, but concluded to leave them behind., Out of respect for the great numbers of tourists of both sexes who would be assembled in front of the hotels to see us pass, and also out of respect for the many tourists whom we expected to encounter on our expedition, we decided to make the ascent in evening dress., We watered the caravan at the cold stream which rushes down a trough near the end of the village, and soon afterward left the haunts of civilization behind us., About half past five o'clock we arrived at a bridge which spans the Visp, and after throwing over a detachment to see if it was safe, the caravan crossed without accident., The way now led, by a gentle ascent, carpeted with fresh green grass, to the church at Winkelmatten., Without stopping to examine this edifice, I executed a flank movement to the right and crossed the bridge over the Findelenbach, after first testing its strength., Here I deployed to the right again, and presently entered an inviting stretch of meadowland which was unoccupied save by a couple of deserted huts toward the furthest extremity., These meadows offered an excellent camping-place., We pitched our tents, supped, established a proper grade, recorded the events of the day, and then went to bed., We rose at two in the morning and dressed by candle-light., It was a dismal and chilly business., A few stars were shining, but the general heavens were overcast, and the great shaft of the Matterhorn was draped in a cable pall of clouds., The chief guide advised a delay; he said he feared it was going to rain., We waited until nine o'clock, and then got away in tolerably clear weather., Our course led up some terrific steeps, densely wooded with larches and cedars, and traversed by paths which the rains had guttered and which were obstructed by loose stones., To add to the danger and inconvenience, we were constantly meeting returning tourists on foot and horseback, and as constantly being crowded and battered by ascending tourists who were in a hurry and wanted to get by., Our troubles thickened., About the middle of the afternoon the seventeen guides called a halt and held a consultation., After consulting an hour they said their first suspicion remained intact--that is to say, they believed they were lost., I asked if they did not KNOW it?, No, they said, they COULDN'T absolutely know whether they were lost or not, because none of them had ever been in that part of the country before., They had a strong instinct that they were lost, but they had no proofs--except that they did not know where they were., They had met no tourists for some time, and they considered that a suspicious sign., Plainly we were in an ugly fix., The guides were naturally unwilling to go alone and seek a way out of the difficulty; so we all went together., For better security we moved slow and cautiously, for the forest was very dense., We did not move up the mountain, but around it, hoping to strike across the old trail., Toward nightfall, when we were about tired out, we came up against a rock as big as a cottage., This barrier took all the remaining spirit out of the men, and a panic of fear and despair ensued., They moaned and wept, and said they should never see their homes and their dear ones again., Then they began to upbraid me for bringing them upon this fatal expedition., Some even muttered threats against me., Clearly it was no time to show weakness., So I made a speech in which I said that other Alp-climbers had been in as perilous a position as this, and yet by courage and perseverance had escaped., ...]"|1
32|"[I was looking in at a window at a very pretty string of beads, suitable for a child., I was only admiring them; I had no use for them; I hardly ever wear beads., The shopwoman came out and offered them to me for thirty-five francs., I said it was cheap, but I did not need them., ""Ah, but monsieur, they are so beautiful!"", I confessed it, but said they were not suitable for one of my age and simplicity of character., She darted in and brought them out and tried to force them into my hands, saying:  ""Ah, but only see how lovely they are!, Surely monsieur will take them; monsieur shall have them for thirty francs., There, I have said it--it is a loss, but one must live."", I dropped my hands, and tried to move her to respect my unprotected situation., But no, she dangled the beads in the sun before my face, exclaiming, ""Ah, monsieur CANNOT resist them!"", She hung them on my coat button, folded her hand resignedly, and said: ""Gone,--and for thirty francs, the lovely things--it is incredible!--but the good God will sanctify the sacrifice to me."", I removed them gently, returned them, and walked away, shaking my head and smiling a smile of silly embarrassment while the passers-by halted to observe., The woman leaned out of her door, shook the beads, and screamed after me:  ""Monsieur shall have them for twenty-eight!"", I shook my head., ""Twenty-seven!, It is a cruel loss, it is ruin --but take them, only take them."", I still retreated, still wagging my head., ""MON DIEU, they shall even go for twenty-six!, There, I have said it., Come!"", I wagged another negative., A nurse and a little English girl had been near me, and were following me, now., The shopwoman ran to the nurse, thrust the beads into her hands, and said:  ""Monsieur shall have them for twenty-five!, Take them to the hotel--he shall send me the money tomorrow --next day--when he likes."", Then to the child: ""When thy father sends me the money, come thou also, my angel, and thou shall have something oh so pretty!"", I was thus providentially saved., The nurse refused the beads squarely and firmly, and that ended the matter., The ""sights"" of Geneva are not numerous., I made one attempt to hunt up the houses once inhabited by those two disagreeable people, Rousseau and Calvin, but I had no success., Then I concluded to go home., I found it was easier to propose to do that than to do it; for that town is a bewildering place., I got lost in a tangle of narrow and crooked streets, and stayed lost for an hour or two., Finally I found a street which looked somewhat familiar, and said to myself, ""Now I am at home, I judge."", But I was wrong; this was ""HELL street."", Presently I found another place which had a familiar look, and said to myself, ""Now I am at home, sure."", It was another error., This was ""PURGATORY street."", After a little I said, ""NOW I've got the right place, anyway ... no, this is 'PARADISE street'; I'm further from home than I was in the beginning."", Those were queer names--Calvin was the author of them, likely., ""Hell"" and ""Purgatory"" fitted those two streets like a glove, but the ""Paradise"" appeared to be sarcastic., I came out on the lake-front, at last, and then I knew where I was., I was walking along before the glittering jewelry shops when I saw a curious performance., A lady passed by, and a trim dandy lounged across the walk in such an apparently carefully timed way as to bring himself exactly in front of her when she got to him; he made no offer to step out of the way; he did not apologize; he did not even notice her., She had to stop still and let him lounge by., I wondered if he had done that piece of brutality purposely., He strolled to a chair and seated himself at a small table; two or three other males were sitting at similar tables sipping sweetened water., I waited; presently a youth came by, and this fellow got up and served him the same trick., Still, it did not seem possible that any one could do such a thing deliberately., To satisfy my curiosity I went around the block, and, sure enough, as I approached, at a good round speed, he got up and lounged lazily across my path, fouling my course exactly at the right moment to receive all my weight., This proved that his previous performances had not been accidental, but intentional., I saw that dandy's curious game played afterward, in Paris, but not for amusement; not with a motive of any sort, indeed, but simply from a selfish indifference to other people's comfort and rights., One does not see it as frequently in Paris as he might expect to, for there the law says, in effect, ""It is the business of the weak to get out of the way of the strong."", We fine a cabman if he runs over a citizen; Paris fines the citizen for being run over., At least so everybody says--but I saw something which caused me to doubt; I saw a horseman run over an old woman one day--the police arrested him and took him away., That looked as if they meant to punish him., It will not do for me to find merit in American manners --for are they not the standing butt for the jests of critical and polished Europe?, Still, I must venture to claim one little matter of superiority in our manners; a lady may traverse our streets all day, going and coming as she chooses, and she will never be molested by any man; but if a lady, unattended, walks abroad in the streets of London, even at noonday, she will be pretty likely to be accosted and insulted--and not by drunken sailors, but by men who carry the look and wear the dress of gentlemen., It is maintained that these people are not gentlemen, but are a lower sort, disguised as gentlemen., The case of Colonel Valentine Baker obstructs that argument, for a man cannot become an officer in the British army except he hold the rank of gentleman., This person, finding himself alone in a railway compartment with an unprotected girl--but it is an atrocious story, and doubtless the reader remembers it well enough., London must have been more or less accustomed to Bakers, and the ways of Bakers, else London would have been offended and excited., Baker was ""imprisoned""--in a parlor; and he could not have been more visited, or more overwhelmed with attentions, if he had committed six murders and then --while the gallows was preparing--""got religion""--after the manner of the holy Charles Peace, of saintly memory., Arkansaw--it seems a little indelicate to be trumpeting forth our own superiorities, and comparisons are always odious, but still--Arkansaw would certainly have hanged Baker., I do not say she would have tried him first, but she would have hanged him, anyway., Even the most degraded woman can walk our streets unmolested, her sex and her weakness being her sufficient protection., She will encounter less polish than she would in the old world, but she will run across enough humanity to make up for it., The music of a donkey awoke us early in the morning, and we rose up and made ready for a pretty formidable walk--to Italy; but the road was so level that we took the train.. We lost a good deal of time by this, but it was no matter, we were not in a hurry., We were four hours going to Chamb`ery., The Swiss trains go upward of three miles an hour, in places, but they are quite safe., That aged French town of Chamb`ery was as quaint and crooked as Heilbronn., A drowsy reposeful quiet reigned in the back streets which made strolling through them very pleasant, barring the almost unbearable heat of the sun., In one of these streets, which was eight feet wide, gracefully curved, and built up with small antiquated houses, I saw three fat hogs lying asleep, and a boy (also asleep) taking care of them., From queer old-fashioned windows along the curve projected boxes of bright flowers, and over the edge of one of these boxes hung the head and shoulders of a cat--asleep., The five sleeping creatures were the only living things visible in that street., There was not a sound; absolute stillness prevailed., It was Sunday; one is not used to such dreamy Sundays on the continent., In our part of the town it was different that night., A regiment of brown and battered soldiers had arrived home from Algiers, and I judged they got thirsty on the way., They sang and drank till dawn, in the pleasant open air., We left for Turin at ten the next morning by a railway which was profusely decorated with tunnels., We forgot to take a lantern along, consequently we missed all the scenery., Our compartment was full., A ponderous tow-headed Swiss woman, who put on many fine-lady airs, but was evidently more used to washing linen than wearing it, sat in a corner seat and put her legs across into the opposite one, propping them intermediately with her up-ended valise., In the seat thus pirated, sat two Americans, greatly incommoded by that woman's majestic coffin-clad feet., One of them begged, politely, to remove them., She opened her wide eyes and gave him a stare, but answered nothing., By and by he proferred his request again, with great respectfulness., She said, in good English, and in a deeply offended tone, that she had paid her passage and was not going to be bullied out of her ""rights"" by ill-bred foreigners, even if she was alone and unprotected., ""But I have rights, also, madam., My ticket entitles me to a seat, but you are occupying half of it."", ""I will not talk with you, sir., What right have you to speak to me?, I do not know you., One would know you came from a land where there are no gentlemen., No GENTLEMAN would treat a lady as you have treated me."", ""I come from a region where a lady would hardly give me the same provocation."", ""You have insulted me, sir!, You have intimated that I am not a lady--and I hope I am NOT one, after the pattern of your country."", ""I beg that you will give yourself no alarm on that head, madam; but at the same time I must insist--always respectfully--that you let me have my seat."", ...]"|1
33|"[Perhaps a four-line sermon in a Saturday paper is the sufficient German equivalent of the eight or ten columns of sermons which the New-Yorkers get in their Monday morning papers., The latest news (two days old) follows the four-line sermon, under the pica headline ""Telegrams""--these are ""telegraphed"" with a pair of scissors out of the AUGSBURGER ZEITUNG of the day before., These telegrams consist of fourteen and two-thirds lines from Berlin, fifteen lines from Vienna, and two and five-eights lines from Calcutta., Thirty-three small-pica lines news in a daily journal in a King's Capital of one hundred and seventy thousand inhabitants is surely not an overdose., Next we have the pica heading, ""News of the Day,"" under which the following facts are set forth: Prince Leopold is going on a visit to Vienna, six lines; Prince Arnulph is coming back from Russia, two lines; the Landtag will meet at ten o'clock in the morning and consider an election law, three lines and one word over; a city government item, five and one-half lines; prices of tickets to the proposed grand Charity Ball, twenty-three lines--for this one item occupies almost one-fourth of the entire first page; there is to be a wonderful Wagner concert in Frankfurt-on-the-Main, with an orchestra of one hundred and eight instruments, seven and one-half lines., That concludes the first page., Eighty-five lines, altogether, on that page, including three headlines., About fifty of those lines, as one perceives, deal with local matters; so the reporters are not overworked., Exactly one-half of the second page is occupied with an opera criticism, fifty-three lines (three of them being headlines), and ""Death Notices,"" ten lines., The other half of the second page is made up of two paragraphs under the head of ""Miscellaneous News."", One of these paragraphs tells about a quarrel between the Czar of Russia and his eldest son, twenty-one and a half lines; and the other tells about the atrocious destruction of a peasant child by its parents, forty lines, or one-fifth of the total of the reading-matter contained in the paper., Consider what a fifth part of the reading-matter of an American daily paper issued in a city of one hundred and seventy thousand inhabitants amounts to!, Think what a mass it is., Would any one suppose I could so snugly tuck away such a mass in a chapter of this book that it would be difficult to find it again in the reader lost his place?, Surely not., I will translate that child-murder word for word, to give the reader a realizing sense of what a fifth part of the reading-matter of a Munich daily actually is when it comes under measurement of the eye:  ""From Oberkreuzberg, January 21st, the DONAU ZEITUNG receives a long account of a crime, which we shortened as follows: In Rametuach, a village near Eppenschlag, lived a young married couple with two children, one of which, a boy aged five, was born three years before the marriage., For this reason, and also because a relative at Iggensbach had bequeathed M400 ($100) to the boy, the heartless father considered him in the way; so the unnatural parents determined to sacrifice him in the cruelest possible manner., They proceeded to starve him slowly to death, meantime frightfully maltreating him--as the village people now make known, when it is too late., The boy was shut in a hole, and when people passed by he cried, and implored them to give him bread., His long-continued tortures and deprivations destroyed him at last, on the third of January., The sudden (sic) death of the child created suspicion, the more so as the body was immediately clothed and laid upon the bier., Therefore the coroner gave notice, and an inquest was held on the 6th., What a pitiful spectacle was disclosed then!, The body was a complete skeleton., The stomach and intestines were utterly empty; they contained nothing whatsoever., The flesh on the corpse was not as thick as the back of a knife, and incisions in it brought not one drop of blood., There was not a piece of sound skin the size of a dollar on the whole body; wounds, scars, bruises, discolored extravasated blood, everywhere--even on the soles of the feet there were wounds., The cruel parents asserted that the boy had been so bad that they had been obliged to use severe punishments, and that he finally fell over a bench and broke his neck., However, they were arrested two weeks after the inquest and put in the prison at Deggendorf."", Yes, they were arrested ""two weeks after the inquest."", What a home sound that has., That kind of police briskness rather more reminds me of my native land than German journalism does., I think a German daily journal doesn't do any good to speak of, but at the same time it doesn't do any harm., That is a very large merit, and should not be lightly weighted nor lightly thought of., The German humorous papers are beautifully printed upon fine paper, and the illustrations are finely drawn, finely engraved, and are not vapidly funny, but deliciously so., So also, generally speaking, are the two or three terse sentences which accompany the pictures., I remember one of these pictures: A most dilapidated tramp is ruefully contemplating some coins which lie in his open palm., He says: ""Well, begging is getting played out., Only about five marks ($1.25) for the whole day; many an official makes more!"", And I call to mind a picture of a commercial traveler who is about to unroll his samples:  MERCHANT (pettishly).--NO, don't., I don't want to buy anything!, DRUMMER.--If you please, I was only going to show you--  MERCHANT.--But I don't wish to see them!, DRUMMER (after a pause, pleadingly).--But do you you mind letting ME look at them!, I haven't seen them for three weeks!, I will set down a tale as it was told to me by one who had it of his father, which latter had it of HIS father, this last having in like manner had it of HIS father--and so on, back and still back, three hundred years and more, the fathers transmitting it to the sons and so preserving it., It may be history, it may be only a legend, a tradition., It may have happened, it may not have happened:  but it COULD have happened., It may be that the wise and the learned believed it in the old days; it may be that only the unlearned and the simple loved it and credited it., In the ancient city of London, on a certain autumn day in the second quarter of the sixteenth century, a boy was born to a poor family of the name of Canty, who did not want him., On the same day another English child was born to a rich family of the name of Tudor, who did want him., All England wanted him too., England had so longed for him, and hoped for him, and prayed God for him, that, now that he was really come, the people went nearly mad for joy., Mere acquaintances hugged and kissed each other and cried., Everybody took a holiday, and high and low, rich and poor, feasted and danced and sang, and got very mellow; and they kept this up for days and nights together., By day, London was a sight to see, with gay banners waving from every balcony and housetop, and splendid pageants marching along., By night, it was again a sight to see, with its great bonfires at every corner, and its troops of revellers making merry around them., There was no talk in all England but of the new baby, Edward Tudor, Prince of Wales, who lay lapped in silks and satins, unconscious of all this fuss, and not knowing that great lords and ladies were tending him and watching over him--and not caring, either., But there was no talk about the other baby, Tom Canty, lapped in his poor rags, except among the family of paupers whom he had just come to trouble with his presence., Let us skip a number of years., London was fifteen hundred years old, and was a great town--for that day., It had a hundred thousand inhabitants--some think double as many., The streets were very narrow, and crooked, and dirty, especially in the part where Tom Canty lived, which was not far from London Bridge., The houses were of wood, with the second story projecting over the first, and the third sticking its elbows out beyond the second., The higher the houses grew, the broader they grew., They were skeletons of strong criss-cross beams, with solid material between, coated with plaster., The beams were painted red or blue or black, according to the owner's taste, and this gave the houses a very picturesque look., The windows were small, glazed with little diamond-shaped panes, and they opened outward, on hinges, like doors., The house which Tom's father lived in was up a foul little pocket called Offal Court, out of Pudding Lane., It was small, decayed, and rickety, but it was packed full of wretchedly poor families., Canty's tribe occupied a room on the third floor., The mother and father had a sort of bedstead in the corner; but Tom, his grandmother, and his two sisters, Bet and Nan, were not restricted--they had all the floor to themselves, and might sleep where they chose., There were the remains of a blanket or two, and some bundles of ancient and dirty straw, but these could not rightly be called beds, for they were not organised; they were kicked into a general pile, mornings, and selections made from the mass at night, for service., Bet and Nan were fifteen years old--twins., They were good-hearted girls, unclean, clothed in rags, and profoundly ignorant., Their mother was like them., But the father and the grandmother were a couple of fiends., They got drunk whenever they could; then they fought each other or anybody else who came in the way; they cursed and swore always, drunk or sober; John Canty was a thief, and his mother a beggar., They made beggars of the children, but failed to make thieves of them., Among, but not of, the dreadful rabble that inhabited the house, was a good old priest whom the King had turned out of house and home with a pension of a few farthings, and he used to get the children aside and teach them right ways secretly., Father Andrew also taught Tom a little Latin, and how to read and write; and would have done the same with the girls, but they were afraid of the jeers of their friends, who could not have endured such a queer accomplishment in them., All Offal Court was just such another hive as Canty's house., Drunkenness, riot and brawling were the order, there, every night and nearly all night long., Broken heads were as common as hunger in that place., Yet little Tom was not unhappy., He had a hard time of it, but did not know it., It was the sort of time that all the Offal Court boys had, therefore he supposed it was the correct and comfortable thing., When he came home empty-handed at night, he knew his father would curse him and thrash him first, and that when he was done the awful grandmother would do it all over again and improve on it; and that away in the night his starving mother would slip to him stealthily with any miserable scrap or crust she had been able to save for him by going hungry herself, notwithstanding she was often caught in that sort of treason and soundly beaten for it by her husband., No, Tom's life went along well enough, especially in summer., He only begged just enough to save himself, for the laws against mendicancy were stringent, and the penalties heavy; so he put in a good deal of his time listening to good Father Andrew's charming old tales and legends about giants and fairies, dwarfs and genii, and enchanted castles, and gorgeous kings and princes., His head grew to be full of these wonderful things, and many a night as he lay in the dark on his scant and offensive straw, tired, hungry, and smarting from a thrashing, he unleashed his imagination and soon forgot his aches and pains in delicious picturings to himself of the charmed life of a petted prince in a regal palace., One desire came in time to haunt him day and night:  it was to see a real prince, with his own eyes., He spoke of it once to some of his Offal Court comrades; but they jeered him and scoffed him so unmercifully that he was glad to keep his dream to himself after that., He often read the priest's old books and got him to explain and enlarge upon them., His dreamings and readings worked certain changes in him, by-and-by., His dream-people were so fine that he grew to lament his shabby clothing and his dirt, and to wish to be clean and better clad., He went on playing in the mud just the same, and enjoying it, too; but, instead of splashing around in the Thames solely for the fun of it, he began to find an added value in it because of the washings and cleansings it afforded., Tom could always find something going on around the Maypole in Cheapside, and at the fairs; and now and then he and the rest of London had a chance to see a military parade when some famous unfortunate was carried prisoner to the Tower, by land or boat., One summer's day he saw poor Anne Askew and three men burned at the stake in Smithfield, and heard an ex-Bishop preach a sermon to them which did not interest him., Yes, Tom's life was varied and pleasant enough, on the whole., By-and-by Tom's reading and dreaming about princely life wrought such a strong effect upon him that he began to ACT the prince, unconsciously., ...]"|1
34|"[""No, good your Majesty, my punishment was appointed for this day, and peradventure it may be annulled, as unbefitting the season of mourning that is come upon us; I know not, and so have made bold to come hither and remind your Grace about your gracious promise to intercede in my behalf--""  ""With the master?, To save thee thy whipping?"", ""Ah, thou dost remember!"", ""My memory mendeth, thou seest., Set thy mind at ease--thy back shall go unscathed--I will see to it."", ""Oh, thanks, my good lord!"", cried the boy, dropping upon his knee again., ""Mayhap I have ventured far enow; and yet--""  Seeing Master Humphrey hesitate, Tom encouraged him to go on, saying he was ""in the granting mood."", ""Then will I speak it out, for it lieth near my heart., Sith thou art no more Prince of Wales but King, thou canst order matters as thou wilt, with none to say thee nay; wherefore it is not in reason that thou wilt longer vex thyself with dreary studies, but wilt burn thy books and turn thy mind to things less irksome., Then am I ruined, and mine orphan sisters with me!"", ""Ruined?, Prithee how?"", ""My back is my bread, O my gracious liege!, if it go idle, I starve., An' thou cease from study mine office is gone thou'lt need no whipping-boy., Do not turn me away!"", Tom was touched with this pathetic distress., He said, with a right royal burst of generosity--  ""Discomfort thyself no further, lad., Thine office shall be permanent in thee and thy line for ever."", Then he struck the boy a light blow on the shoulder with the flat of his sword, exclaiming, ""Rise, Humphrey Marlow, Hereditary Grand Whipping-Boy to the Royal House of England!, Banish sorrow--I will betake me to my books again, and study so ill that they must in justice treble thy wage, so mightily shall the business of thine office be augmented."", The grateful Humphrey responded fervidly--  ""Thanks, O most noble master, this princely lavishness doth far surpass my most distempered dreams of fortune., Now shall I be happy all my days, and all the house of Marlow after me."", Tom had wit enough to perceive that here was a lad who could be useful to him., He encouraged Humphrey to talk, and he was nothing loath., He was delighted to believe that he was helping in Tom's 'cure'; for always, as soon as he had finished calling back to Tom's diseased mind the various particulars of his experiences and adventures in the royal school-room and elsewhere about the palace, he noticed that Tom was then able to 'recall' the circumstances quite clearly., At the end of an hour Tom found himself well freighted with very valuable information concerning personages and matters pertaining to the Court; so he resolved to draw instruction from this source daily; and to this end he would give order to admit Humphrey to the royal closet whenever he might come, provided the Majesty of England was not engaged with other people., Humphrey had hardly been dismissed when my Lord Hertford arrived with more trouble for Tom., He said that the Lords of the Council, fearing that some overwrought report of the King's damaged health might have leaked out and got abroad, they deemed it wise and best that his Majesty should begin to dine in public after a day or two--his wholesome complexion and vigorous step, assisted by a carefully guarded repose of manner and ease and grace of demeanour, would more surely quiet the general pulse--in case any evil rumours HAD gone about--than any other scheme that could be devised., Then the Earl proceeded, very delicately, to instruct Tom as to the observances proper to the stately occasion, under the rather thin disguise of 'reminding' him concerning things already known to him; but to his vast gratification it turned out that Tom needed very little help in this line--he had been making use of Humphrey in that direction, for Humphrey had mentioned that within a few days he was to begin to dine in public; having gathered it from the swift-winged gossip of the Court., Tom kept these facts to himself, however., Seeing the royal memory so improved, the Earl ventured to apply a few tests to it, in an apparently casual way, to find out how far its amendment had progressed., The results were happy, here and there, in spots--spots where Humphrey's tracks remained--and on the whole my lord was greatly pleased and encouraged., So encouraged was he, indeed, that he spoke up and said in a quite hopeful voice--  ""Now am I persuaded that if your Majesty will but tax your memory yet a little further, it will resolve the puzzle of the Great Seal--a loss which was of moment yesterday, although of none to-day, since its term of service ended with our late lord's life., May it please your Grace to make the trial?"", Tom was at sea--a Great Seal was something which he was totally unacquainted with., After a moment's hesitation he looked up innocently and asked--  ""What was it like, my lord?"", The Earl started, almost imperceptibly, muttering to himself, ""Alack, his wits are flown again!--it was ill wisdom to lead him on to strain them"" --then he deftly turned the talk to other matters, with the purpose of sweeping the unlucky seal out of Tom's thoughts--a purpose which easily succeeded., The next day the foreign ambassadors came, with their gorgeous trains; and Tom, throned in awful state, received them., The splendours of the scene delighted his eye and fired his imagination at first, but the audience was long and dreary, and so were most of the addresses --wherefore, what began as a pleasure grew into weariness and home-sickness by-and-by., Tom said the words which Hertford put into his mouth from time to time, and tried hard to acquit himself satisfactorily, but he was too new to such things, and too ill at ease to accomplish more than a tolerable success., He looked sufficiently like a king, but he was ill able to feel like one., He was cordially glad when the ceremony was ended., The larger part of his day was 'wasted'--as he termed it, in his own mind--in labours pertaining to his royal office., Even the two hours devoted to certain princely pastimes and recreations were rather a burden to him than otherwise, they were so fettered by restrictions and ceremonious observances., However, he had a private hour with his whipping-boy which he counted clear gain, since he got both entertainment and needful information out of it., The third day of Tom Canty's kingship came and went much as the others had done, but there was a lifting of his cloud in one way--he felt less uncomfortable than at first; he was getting a little used to his circumstances and surroundings; his chains still galled, but not all the time; he found that the presence and homage of the great afflicted and embarrassed him less and less sharply with every hour that drifted over his head., But for one single dread, he could have seen the fourth day approach without serious distress--the dining in public; it was to begin that day., There were greater matters in the programme--for on that day he would have to preside at a council which would take his views and commands concerning the policy to be pursued toward various foreign nations scattered far and near over the great globe; on that day, too, Hertford would be formally chosen to the grand office of Lord Protector; other things of note were appointed for that fourth day, also; but to Tom they were all insignificant compared with the ordeal of dining all by himself with a multitude of curious eyes fastened upon him and a multitude of mouths whispering comments upon his performance,--and upon his mistakes, if he should be so unlucky as to make any., Still, nothing could stop that fourth day, and so it came., It found poor Tom low-spirited and absent-minded, and this mood continued; he could not shake it off., The ordinary duties of the morning dragged upon his hands, and wearied him., Once more he felt the sense of captivity heavy upon him., Late in the forenoon he was in a large audience-chamber, conversing with the Earl of Hertford and dully awaiting the striking of the hour appointed for a visit of ceremony from a considerable number of great officials and courtiers., After a little while, Tom, who had wandered to a window and become interested in the life and movement of the great highway beyond the palace gates--and not idly interested, but longing with all his heart to take part in person in its stir and freedom--saw the van of a hooting and shouting mob of disorderly men, women, and children of the lowest and poorest degree approaching from up the road., ""I would I knew what 'tis about!"", he exclaimed, with all a boy's curiosity in such happenings., ""Thou art the King!"", solemnly responded the Earl, with a reverence., ""Have I your Grace's leave to act?"", ""O blithely, yes!, O gladly, yes!"", exclaimed Tom excitedly, adding to himself with a lively sense of satisfaction, ""In truth, being a king is not all dreariness--it hath its compensations and conveniences."", The Earl called a page, and sent him to the captain of the guard with the order--  ""Let the mob be halted, and inquiry made concerning the occasion of its movement., By the King's command!"", A few seconds later a long rank of the royal guards, cased in flashing steel, filed out at the gates and formed across the highway in front of the multitude., A messenger returned, to report that the crowd were following a man, a woman, and a young girl to execution for crimes committed against the peace and dignity of the realm., Death--and a violent death--for these poor unfortunates!, The thought wrung Tom's heart-strings., The spirit of compassion took control of him, to the exclusion of all other considerations; he never thought of the offended laws, or of the grief or loss which these three criminals had inflicted upon their victims; he could think of nothing but the scaffold and the grisly fate hanging over the heads of the condemned., His concern made him even forget, for the moment, that he was but the false shadow of a king, not the substance; and before he knew it he had blurted out the command--  ""Bring them here!"", Then he blushed scarlet, and a sort of apology sprung to his lips; but observing that his order had wrought no sort of surprise in the Earl or the waiting page, he suppressed the words he was about to utter., The page, in the most matter-of-course way, made a profound obeisance and retired backwards out of the room to deliver the command., Tom experienced a glow of pride and a renewed sense of the compensating advantages of the kingly office., He said to himself, ""Truly it is like what I was used to feel when I read the old priest's tales, and did imagine mine own self a prince, giving law and command to all, saying 'Do this, do that,' whilst none durst offer let or hindrance to my will."", Now the doors swung open; one high-sounding title after another was announced, the personages owning them followed, and the place was quickly half-filled with noble folk and finery., But Tom was hardly conscious of the presence of these people, so wrought up was he and so intensely absorbed in that other and more interesting matter., He seated himself absently in his chair of state, and turned his eyes upon the door with manifestations of impatient expectancy; seeing which, the company forbore to trouble him, and fell to chatting a mixture of public business and court gossip one with another., In a little while the measured tread of military men was heard approaching, and the culprits entered the presence in charge of an under-sheriff and escorted by a detail of the king's guard., The civil officer knelt before Tom, then stood aside; the three doomed persons knelt, also, and remained so; the guard took position behind Tom's chair., Tom scanned the prisoners curiously., Something about the dress or appearance of the man had stirred a vague memory in him., ""Methinks I have seen this man ere now ., ., ., but the when or the where fail me""--such was Tom's thought., Just then the man glanced quickly up and quickly dropped his face again, not being able to endure the awful port of sovereignty; but the one full glimpse of the face which Tom got was sufficient., He said to himself: ""Now is the matter clear; this is the stranger that plucked Giles Witt out of the Thames, and saved his life, that windy, bitter, first day of the New Year--a brave good deed--pity he hath been doing baser ones and got himself in this sad case ., ., ., I have not forgot the day, neither the hour; by reason that an hour after, upon the stroke of eleven, I did get a hiding by the hand of Gammer Canty which was of so goodly and admired severity that all that went before or followed after it were but fondlings and caresses by comparison."", Tom now ordered that the woman and the girl be removed from the presence for a little time; then addressed himself to the under-sheriff, saying--  ""Good sir, what is this man's offence?"", The officer knelt, and answered--  ""So please your Majesty, he hath taken the life of a subject by poison."", Tom's compassion for the prisoner, and admiration of him as the daring rescuer of a drowning boy, experienced a most damaging shock., ""The thing was proven upon him?"", he asked., ""Most clearly, sire."", Tom sighed, and said--  ""Take him away--he hath earned his death., 'Tis a pity, for he was a brave heart--na--na, I mean he hath the LOOK of it!"", ...]"|1
35|"[The prisoners entered it through a massive archway of masonry, and were placed in file, standing, with their backs against the wall., A rope was stretched in front of them, and they were also guarded by their officers., It was a chill and lowering morning, and a light snow which had fallen during the night whitened the great empty space and added to the general dismalness of its aspect., Now and then a wintry wind shivered through the place and sent the snow eddying hither and thither., In the centre of the court stood two women, chained to posts., A glance showed the King that these were his good friends., He shuddered, and said to himself, ""Alack, they are not gone free, as I had thought., To think that such as these should know the lash!--in England!, Ay, there's the shame of it--not in Heathennesse, Christian England!, They will be scourged; and I, whom they have comforted and kindly entreated, must look on and see the great wrong done; it is strange, so strange, that I, the very source of power in this broad realm, am helpless to protect them., But let these miscreants look well to themselves, for there is a day coming when I will require of them a heavy reckoning for this work., For every blow they strike now, they shall feel a hundred then."", A great gate swung open, and a crowd of citizens poured in., They flocked around the two women, and hid them from the King's view., A clergyman entered and passed through the crowd, and he also was hidden., The King now heard talking, back and forth, as if questions were being asked and answered, but he could not make out what was said., Next there was a deal of bustle and preparation, and much passing and repassing of officials through that part of the crowd that stood on the further side of the women; and whilst this proceeded a deep hush gradually fell upon the people., Now, by command, the masses parted and fell aside, and the King saw a spectacle that froze the marrow in his bones., Faggots had been piled about the two women, and a kneeling man was lighting them!, The women bowed their heads, and covered their faces with their hands; the yellow flames began to climb upward among the snapping and crackling faggots, and wreaths of blue smoke to stream away on the wind; the clergyman lifted his hands and began a prayer--just then two young girls came flying through the great gate, uttering piercing screams, and threw themselves upon the women at the stake., Instantly they were torn away by the officers, and one of them was kept in a tight grip, but the other broke loose, saying she would die with her mother; and before she could be stopped she had flung her arms about her mother's neck again., She was torn away once more, and with her gown on fire., Two or three men held her, and the burning portion of her gown was snatched off and thrown flaming aside, she struggling all the while to free herself, and saying she would be alone in the world, now; and begging to be allowed to die with her mother., Both the girls screamed continually, and fought for freedom; but suddenly this tumult was drowned under a volley of heart-piercing shrieks of mortal agony--the King glanced from the frantic girls to the stake, then turned away and leaned his ashen face against the wall, and looked no more., He said, ""That which I have seen, in that one little moment, will never go out from my memory, but will abide there; and I shall see it all the days, and dream of it all the nights, till I die., Would God I had been blind!"", Hendon was watching the King., He said to himself, with satisfaction, ""His disorder mendeth; he hath changed, and groweth gentler., If he had followed his wont, he would have stormed at these varlets, and said he was King, and commanded that the women be turned loose unscathed., Soon his delusion will pass away and be forgotten, and his poor mind will be whole again., God speed the day!"", That same day several prisoners were brought in to remain over night, who were being conveyed, under guard, to various places in the kingdom, to undergo punishment for crimes committed., The King conversed with these --he had made it a point, from the beginning, to instruct himself for the kingly office by questioning prisoners whenever the opportunity offered --and the tale of their woes wrung his heart., One of them was a poor half-witted woman who had stolen a yard or two of cloth from a weaver --she was to be hanged for it., Another was a man who had been accused of stealing a horse; he said the proof had failed, and he had imagined that he was safe from the halter; but no--he was hardly free before he was arraigned for killing a deer in the King's park; this was proved against him, and now he was on his way to the gallows., There was a tradesman's apprentice whose case particularly distressed the King; this youth said he found a hawk, one evening, that had escaped from its owner, and he took it home with him, imagining himself entitled to it; but the court convicted him of stealing it, and sentenced him to death., The King was furious over these inhumanities, and wanted Hendon to break jail and fly with him to Westminster, so that he could mount his throne and hold out his sceptre in mercy over these unfortunate people and save their lives., ""Poor child,"" sighed Hendon, ""these woeful tales have brought his malady upon him again; alack, but for this evil hap, he would have been well in a little time."", Among these prisoners was an old lawyer--a man with a strong face and a dauntless mien., Three years past, he had written a pamphlet against the Lord Chancellor, accusing him of injustice, and had been punished for it by the loss of his ears in the pillory, and degradation from the bar, and in addition had been fined 3,000 pounds and sentenced to imprisonment for life., Lately he had repeated his offence; and in consequence was now under sentence to lose WHAT REMAINED OF HIS EARS, pay a fine of 5,000 pounds, be branded on both cheeks, and remain in prison for life., ""These be honourable scars,"" he said, and turned back his grey hair and showed the mutilated stubs of what had once been his ears., The King's eye burned with passion., He said--  ""None believe in me--neither wilt thou., But no matter--within the compass of a month thou shalt be free; and more, the laws that have dishonoured thee, and shamed the English name, shall be swept from the statute books., The world is made wrong; kings should go to school to their own laws, at times, and so learn mercy."", Meantime Miles was growing sufficiently tired of confinement and inaction., But now his trial came on, to his great gratification, and he thought he could welcome any sentence provided a further imprisonment should not be a part of it., But he was mistaken about that., He was in a fine fury when he found himself described as a 'sturdy vagabond' and sentenced to sit two hours in the stocks for bearing that character and for assaulting the master of Hendon Hall., His pretensions as to brothership with his prosecutor, and rightful heirship to the Hendon honours and estates, were left contemptuously unnoticed, as being not even worth examination., He raged and threatened on his way to punishment, but it did no good; he was snatched roughly along by the officers, and got an occasional cuff, besides, for his irreverent conduct., The King could not pierce through the rabble that swarmed behind; so he was obliged to follow in the rear, remote from his good friend and servant., The King had been nearly condemned to the stocks himself for being in such bad company, but had been let off with a lecture and a warning, in consideration of his youth., When the crowd at last halted, he flitted feverishly from point to point around its outer rim, hunting a place to get through; and at last, after a deal of difficulty and delay, succeeded., There sat his poor henchman in the degrading stocks, the sport and butt of a dirty mob--he, the body servant of the King of England!, Edward had heard the sentence pronounced, but he had not realised the half that it meant., His anger began to rise as the sense of this new indignity which had been put upon him sank home; it jumped to summer heat, the next moment, when he saw an egg sail through the air and crush itself against Hendon's cheek, and heard the crowd roar its enjoyment of the episode., He sprang across the open circle and confronted the officer in charge, crying--  ""For shame!, This is my servant--set him free!, I am the--""  ""Oh, peace!"", exclaimed Hendon, in a panic, ""thou'lt destroy thyself., Mind him not, officer, he is mad."", ""Give thyself no trouble as to the matter of minding him, good man, I have small mind to mind him; but as to teaching him somewhat, to that I am well inclined."", He turned to a subordinate and said, ""Give the little fool a taste or two of the lash, to mend his manners."", ""Half a dozen will better serve his turn,"" suggested Sir Hugh, who had ridden up, a moment before, to take a passing glance at the proceedings., The King was seized., He did not even struggle, so paralysed was he with the mere thought of the monstrous outrage that was proposed to be inflicted upon his sacred person., History was already defiled with the record of the scourging of an English king with whips--it was an intolerable reflection that he must furnish a duplicate of that shameful page., He was in the toils, there was no help for him; he must either take this punishment or beg for its remission., Hard conditions; he would take the stripes--a king might do that, but a king could not beg., But meantime, Miles Hendon was resolving the difficulty., ""Let the child go,"" said he; ""ye heartless dogs, do ye not see how young and frail he is?, Let him go--I will take his lashes."", ""Marry, a good thought--and thanks for it,"" said Sir Hugh, his face lighting with a sardonic satisfaction., ""Let the little beggar go, and give this fellow a dozen in his place--an honest dozen, well laid on."", The King was in the act of entering a fierce protest, but Sir Hugh silenced him with the potent remark, ""Yes, speak up, do, and free thy mind--only, mark ye, that for each word you utter he shall get six strokes the more."", Hendon was removed from the stocks, and his back laid bare; and whilst the lash was applied the poor little King turned away his face and allowed unroyal tears to channel his cheeks unchecked., ""Ah, brave good heart,"" he said to himself, ""this loyal deed shall never perish out of my memory., I will not forget it--and neither shall THEY!"", he added, with passion., Whilst he mused, his appreciation of Hendon's magnanimous conduct grew to greater and still greater dimensions in his mind, and so also did his gratefulness for it., Presently he said to himself, ""Who saves his prince from wounds and possible death--and this he did for me --performs high service; but it is little--it is nothing--oh, less than nothing!--when 'tis weighed against the act of him who saves his prince from SHAME!"", Hendon made no outcry under the scourge, but bore the heavy blows with soldierly fortitude., This, together with his redeeming the boy by taking his stripes for him, compelled the respect of even that forlorn and degraded mob that was gathered there; and its gibes and hootings died away, and no sound remained but the sound of the falling blows., The stillness that pervaded the place, when Hendon found himself once more in the stocks, was in strong contrast with the insulting clamour which had prevailed there so little a while before., The King came softly to Hendon's side, and whispered in his ear--  ""Kings cannot ennoble thee, thou good, great soul, for One who is higher than kings hath done that for thee; but a king can confirm thy nobility to men."", He picked up the scourge from the ground, touched Hendon's bleeding shoulders lightly with it, and whispered, ""Edward of England dubs thee Earl!"", Hendon was touched., The water welled to his eyes, yet at the same time the grisly humour of the situation and circumstances so undermined his gravity that it was all he could do to keep some sign of his inward mirth from showing outside., To be suddenly hoisted, naked and gory, from the common stocks to the Alpine altitude and splendour of an Earldom, seemed to him the last possibility in the line of the grotesque., He said to himself, ""Now am I finely tinselled, indeed!, The spectre-knight of the Kingdom of Dreams and Shadows is become a spectre-earl--a dizzy flight for a callow wing!, An' this go on, I shall presently be hung like a very maypole with fantastic gauds and make-believe honours., But I shall value them, all valueless as they are, for the love that doth bestow them., Better these poor mock dignities of mine, that come unasked, from a clean hand and a right spirit, than real ones bought by servility from grudging and interested power."", The dreaded Sir Hugh wheeled his horse about, and as he spurred away, the living wall divided silently to let him pass, and as silently closed together again., And so remained; nobody went so far as to venture a remark in favour of the prisoner, or in compliment to him; but no matter --the absence of abuse was a sufficient homage in itself., A late comer who was not posted as to the present circumstances, and who delivered a sneer at the 'impostor,' and was in the act of following it with a dead cat, was promptly knocked down and kicked out, without any words, and then the deep quiet resumed sway once more., When Hendon's term of service in the stocks was finished, he was released and ordered to quit the region and come back no more., ...]"|1
36|"[However, I did not feel discouraged long., I judged that it was best to make some allowances, for doubtless Mr. Bixby was 'stretching.', Presently he pulled a rope and struck a few strokes on the big bell., The stars were all gone now, and the night was as black as ink., I could hear the wheels churn along the bank, but I was not entirely certain that I could see the shore., The voice of the invisible watchman called up from the hurricane deck--  'What's this, sir?', 'Jones's plantation.', I said to myself, I wish I might venture to offer a small bet that it isn't., But I did not chirp., I only waited to see., Mr. Bixby handled the engine bells, and in due time the boat's nose came to the land, a torch glowed from the forecastle, a man skipped ashore, a darky's voice on the bank said, 'Gimme de k'yarpet-bag, Mars' Jones,' and the next moment we were standing up the river again, all serene., I reflected deeply awhile, and then said--but not aloud--'Well, the finding of that plantation was the luckiest accident that ever happened; but it couldn't happen again in a hundred years.', And I fully believed it was an accident, too., By the time we had gone seven or eight hundred miles up the river, I had learned to be a tolerably plucky up-stream steersman, in daylight, and before we reached St. Louis I had made a trifle of progress in night- work, but only a trifle., I had a note-book that fairly bristled with the names of towns, 'points,' bars, islands, bends, reaches, etc., ; but the information was to be found only in the notebook--none of it was in my head., It made my heart ache to think I had only got half of the river set down; for as our watch was four hours off and four hours on, day and night, there was a long four-hour gap in my book for every time I had slept since the voyage began., My chief was presently hired to go on a big New Orleans boat, and I packed my satchel and went with him., She was a grand affair., When I stood in her pilot-house I was so far above the water that I seemed perched on a mountain; and her decks stretched so far away, fore and aft, below me, that I wondered how I could ever have considered the little 'Paul Jones' a large craft., There were other differences, too., The 'Paul Jones's' pilot-house was a cheap, dingy, battered rattle-trap, cramped for room: but here was a sumptuous glass temple; room enough to have a dance in; showy red and gold window-curtains; an imposing sofa; leather cushions and a back to the high bench where visiting pilots sit, to spin yarns and 'look at the river;' bright, fanciful 'cuspadores' instead of a broad wooden box filled with sawdust; nice new oil-cloth on the floor; a hospitable big stove for winter; a wheel as high as my head, costly with inlaid work; a wire tiller-rope; bright brass knobs for the bells; and a tidy, white-aproned, black 'texas-tender,' to bring up tarts and ices and coffee during mid-watch, day and night., Now this was 'something like,' and so I began to take heart once more to believe that piloting was a romantic sort of occupation after all., The moment we were under way I began to prowl about the great steamer and fill myself with joy., She was as clean and as dainty as a drawing-room; when I looked down her long, gilded saloon, it was like gazing through a splendid tunnel; she had an oil-picture, by some gifted sign-painter, on every stateroom door; she glittered with no end of prism-fringed chandeliers; the clerk's office was elegant, the bar was marvelous, and the bar-keeper had been barbered and upholstered at incredible cost., The boiler deck (i.e., the second story of the boat, so to speak) was as spacious as a church, it seemed to me; so with the forecastle; and there was no pitiful handful of deckhands, firemen, and roustabouts down there, but a whole battalion of men., The fires were fiercely glaring from a long row of furnaces, and over them were eight huge boilers!, This was unutterable pomp., The mighty engines--but enough of this., I had never felt so fine before., And when I found that the regiment of natty servants respectfully 'sir'd' me, my satisfaction was complete., WHEN I returned to the pilot-house St. Louis was gone and I was lost., Here was a piece of river which was all down in my book, but I could make neither head nor tail of it:  you understand, it was turned around., I had seen it when coming up-stream, but I had never faced about to see how it looked when it was behind me., My heart broke again, for it was plain that I had got to learn this troublesome river BOTH WAYS., The pilot-house was full of pilots, going down to 'look at the river.', What is called the 'upper river' (the two hundred miles between St. Louis and Cairo, where the Ohio comes in) was low; and the Mississippi changes its channel so constantly that the pilots used to always find it necessary to run down to Cairo to take a fresh look, when their boats were to lie in port a week; that is, when the water was at a low stage., A deal of this 'looking at the river' was done by poor fellows who seldom had a berth, and whose only hope of getting one lay in their being always freshly posted and therefore ready to drop into the shoes of some reputable pilot, for a single trip, on account of such pilot's sudden illness, or some other necessity., And a good many of them constantly ran up and down inspecting the river, not because they ever really hoped to get a berth, but because (they being guests of the boat) it was cheaper to 'look at the river' than stay ashore and pay board., In time these fellows grew dainty in their tastes, and only infested boats that had an established reputation for setting good tables., All visiting pilots were useful, for they were always ready and willing, winter or summer, night or day, to go out in the yawl and help buoy the channel or assist the boat's pilots in any way they could., They were likewise welcome because all pilots are tireless talkers, when gathered together, and as they talk only about the river they are always understood and are always interesting., Your true pilot cares nothing about anything on earth but the river, and his pride in his occupation surpasses the pride of kings., We had a fine company of these river-inspectors along, this trip., There were eight or ten; and there was abundance of room for them in our great pilot-house., Two or three of them wore polished silk hats, elaborate shirt-fronts, diamond breast-pins, kid gloves, and patent-leather boots., They were choice in their English, and bore themselves with a dignity proper to men of solid means and prodigious reputation as pilots., The others were more or less loosely clad, and wore upon their heads tall felt cones that were suggestive of the days of the Commonwealth., I was a cipher in this august company, and felt subdued, not to say torpid., I was not even of sufficient consequence to assist at the wheel when it was necessary to put the tiller hard down in a hurry; the guest that stood nearest did that when occasion required--and this was pretty much all the time, because of the crookedness of the channel and the scant water., I stood in a corner; and the talk I listened to took the hope all out of me., One visitor said to another--  'Jim, how did you run Plum Point, coming up?', 'It was in the night, there, and I ran it the way one of the boys on the ""Diana"" told me; started out about fifty yards above the wood pile on the false point, and held on the cabin under Plum Point till I raised the reef--quarter less twain--then straightened up for the middle bar till I got well abreast the old one-limbed cotton-wood in the bend, then got my stern on the cotton-wood and head on the low place above the point, and came through a-booming--nine and a half.', 'Pretty square crossing, an't it?', 'Yes, but the upper bar 's working down fast.', Another pilot spoke up and said--  'I had better water than that, and ran it lower down; started out from the false point--mark twain--raised the second reef abreast the big snag in the bend, and had quarter less twain.', One of the gorgeous ones remarked--  'I don't want to find fault with your leadsmen, but that's a good deal of water for Plum Point, it seems to me.', There was an approving nod all around as this quiet snub dropped on the boaster and 'settled' him., And so they went on talk-talk-talking., Meantime, the thing that was running in my mind was, 'Now if my ears hear aright, I have not only to get the names of all the towns and islands and bends, and so on, by heart, but I must even get up a warm personal acquaintanceship with every old snag and one-limbed cotton-wood and obscure wood pile that ornaments the banks of this river for twelve hundred miles; and more than that, I must actually know where these things are in the dark, unless these guests are gifted with eyes that can pierce through two miles of solid blackness; I wish the piloting business was in Jericho and I had never thought of it.', At dusk Mr. Bixby tapped the big bell three times (the signal to land), and the captain emerged from his drawing-room in the forward end of the texas, and looked up inquiringly., Mr. Bixby said--  'We will lay up here all night, captain.', 'Very well, sir.', That was all., The boat came to shore and was tied up for the night., It seemed to me a fine thing that the pilot could do as he pleased, without asking so grand a captain's permission., I took my supper and went immediately to bed, discouraged by my day's observations and experiences., My late voyage's note-booking was but a confusion of meaningless names., It had tangled me all up in a knot every time I had looked at it in the daytime., I now hoped for respite in sleep; but no, it reveled all through my head till sunrise again, a frantic and tireless nightmare., Next morning I felt pretty rusty and low-spirited., We went booming along, taking a good many chances, for we were anxious to 'get out of the river' (as getting out to Cairo was called) before night should overtake us., But Mr. Bixby's partner, the other pilot, presently grounded the boat, and we lost so much time in getting her off that it was plain that darkness would overtake us a good long way above the mouth., This was a great misfortune, especially to certain of our visiting pilots, whose boats would have to wait for their return, no matter how long that might be., It sobered the pilot-house talk a good deal., Coming up-stream, pilots did not mind low water or any kind of darkness; nothing stopped them but fog., But down-stream work was different; a boat was too nearly helpless, with a stiff current pushing behind her; so it was not customary to run down-stream at night in low water., There seemed to be one small hope, however:  if we could get through the intricate and dangerous Hat Island crossing before night, we could venture the rest, for we would have plainer sailing and better water., But it would be insanity to attempt Hat Island at night., So there was a deal of looking at watches all the rest of the day, and a constant ciphering upon the speed we were making; Hat Island was the eternal subject; sometimes hope was high and sometimes we were delayed in a bad crossing, and down it went again., For hours all hands lay under the burden of this suppressed excitement; it was even communicated to me, and I got to feeling so solicitous about Hat Island, and under such an awful pressure of responsibility, that I wished I might have five minutes on shore to draw a good, full, relieving breath, and start over again., We were standing no regular watches., Each of our pilots ran such portions of the river as he had run when coming up-stream, because of his greater familiarity with it; but both remained in the pilot house constantly., An hour before sunset, Mr. Bixby took the wheel and Mr. W----stepped aside., For the next thirty minutes every man held his watch in his hand and was restless, silent, and uneasy., At last somebody said, with a doomful sigh--  'Well, yonder's Hat Island--and we can't make it.', All the watches closed with a snap, everybody sighed and muttered something about its being 'too bad, too bad--ah, if we could only have got here half an hour sooner!', and the place was thick with the atmosphere of disappointment., Some started to go out, but loitered, hearing no bell-tap to land., The sun dipped behind the horizon, the boat went on., Inquiring looks passed from one guest to another; and one who had his hand on the door-knob and had turned it, waited, then presently took away his hand and let the knob turn back again., We bore steadily down the bend., More looks were exchanged, and nods of surprised admiration--but no words., Insensibly the men drew together behind Mr. Bixby, as the sky darkened and one or two dim stars came out., The dead silence and sense of waiting became oppressive., Mr. Bixby pulled the cord, and two deep, mellow notes from the big bell floated off on the night., Then a pause, and one more note was struck., The watchman's voice followed, from the hurricane deck--  'Labboard lead, there!, Stabboard lead!', ...]"|1
37|"[I said, ""It's my nature; how can I change it?"", She says, ""Well, do go to bed and get some rest."", I said, ""Not till that poor, noble young man has got his money."", So I set up all night, and this morning out I shot, and the first man I struck told me you had shipped on the ""Grand Turk"" and gone to New Orleans., Well, sir, I had to lean up against a building and cry., So help me goodness, I couldn't help it., The man that owned the place come out cleaning up with a rag, and said he didn't like to have people cry against his building, and then it seemed to me that the whole world had turned against me, and it wasn't any use to live any more; and coming along an hour ago, suffering no man knows what agony, I met Jim Wilson and paid him the two hundred and fifty dollars on account; and to think that here you are, now, and I haven't got a cent!, But as sure as I am standing here on this ground on this particular brick,--there, I've scratched a mark on the brick to remember it by,--I'll borrow that money and pay it over to you at twelve o'clock sharp, tomorrow!, Now, stand so; let me look at you just once more.', And so on., Yates's life became a burden to him., He could not escape his debtor and his debtor's awful sufferings on account of not being able to pay., He dreaded to show himself in the street, lest he should find Stephen lying in wait for him at the corner., Bogart's billiard saloon was a great resort for pilots in those days., They met there about as much to exchange river news as to play., One morning Yates was there; Stephen was there, too, but kept out of sight., But by and by, when about all the pilots had arrived who were in town, Stephen suddenly appeared in the midst, and rushed for Yates as for a long-lost brother., 'OH, I am so glad to see you!, Oh my soul, the sight of you is such a comfort to my eyes!, Gentlemen, I owe all of you money; among you I owe probably forty thousand dollars., I want to pay it; I intend to pay it every last cent of it., You all know, without my telling you, what sorrow it has cost me to remain so long under such deep obligations to such patient and generous friends; but the sharpest pang I suffer--by far the sharpest--is from the debt I owe to this noble young man here; and I have come to this place this morning especially to make the announcement that I have at last found a method whereby I can pay off all my debts!, And most especially I wanted HIM to be here when I announced it., Yes, my faithful friend,--my benefactor, I've found the method!, I've found the method to pay off all my debts, and you'll get your money!', Hope dawned in Yates's eye; then Stephen, beaming benignantly, and placing his hand upon Yates's head, added, 'I am going to pay them off in alphabetical order!', Then he turned and disappeared., The full significance of Stephen's 'method' did not dawn upon the perplexed and musing crowd for some two minutes; and then Yates murmured with a sigh--  'Well, the Y's stand a gaudy chance., He won't get any further than the C's in THIS world, and I reckon that after a good deal of eternity has wasted away in the next one, I'll still be referred to up there as ""that poor, ragged pilot that came here from St. Louis in the early days!"", DURING the two or two and a half years of my apprenticeship, I served under many pilots, and had experience of many kinds of steamboatmen and many varieties of steamboats; for it was not always convenient for Mr. Bixby to have me with him, and in such cases he sent me with somebody else., I am to this day profiting somewhat by that experience; for in that brief, sharp schooling, I got personally and familiarly acquainted with about all the different types of human nature that are to be found in fiction, biography, or history., The fact is daily borne in upon me, that the average shore-employment requires as much as forty years to equip a man with this sort of an education., When I say I am still profiting by this thing, I do not mean that it has constituted me a judge of men--no, it has not done that; for judges of men are born, not made., My profit is various in kind and degree; but the feature of it which I value most is the zest which that early experience has given to my later reading., When I find a well-drawn character in fiction or biography, I generally take a warm personal interest in him, for the reason that I have known him before--met him on the river., The figure that comes before me oftenest, out of the shadows of that vanished time, is that of Brown, of the steamer 'Pennsylvania'--the man referred to in a former chapter, whose memory was so good and tiresome., He was a middle-aged, long, slim, bony, smooth-shaven, horse-faced, ignorant, stingy, malicious, snarling, fault hunting, mote-magnifying tyrant., I early got the habit of coming on watch with dread at my heart., No matter how good a time I might have been having with the off-watch below, and no matter how high my spirits might be when I started aloft, my soul became lead in my body the moment I approached the pilot-house., I still remember the first time I ever entered the presence of that man., The boat had backed out from St. Louis and was 'straightening down;' I ascended to the pilot-house in high feather, and very proud to be semi- officially a member of the executive family of so fast and famous a boat., Brown was at the wheel., I paused in the middle of the room, all fixed to make my bow, but Brown did not look around., I thought he took a furtive glance at me out of the corner of his eye, but as not even this notice was repeated, I judged I had been mistaken., By this time he was picking his way among some dangerous 'breaks' abreast the woodyards; therefore it would not be proper to interrupt him; so I stepped softly to the high bench and took a seat., There was silence for ten minutes; then my new boss turned and inspected me deliberately and painstakingly from head to heel for about--as it seemed to me--a quarter of an hour., After which he removed his countenance and I saw it no more for some seconds; then it came around once more, and this question greeted me--  'Are you Horace Bigsby's cub?', 'Yes, sir.', After this there was a pause and another inspection., Then--  'What's your name?', I told him., He repeated it after me., It was probably the only thing he ever forgot; for although I was with him many months he never addressed himself to me in any other way than 'Here!', and then his command followed., 'Where was you born?', 'In Florida, Missouri.', A pause., Then--  'Dern sight better staid there!', By means of a dozen or so of pretty direct questions, he pumped my family history out of me., The leads were going now, in the first crossing., This interrupted the inquest., When the leads had been laid in, he resumed--  'How long you been on the river?', I told him., After a pause--  'Where'd you get them shoes?', I gave him the information., 'Hold up your foot!', I did so., He stepped back, examined the shoe minutely and contemptuously, scratching his head thoughtfully, tilting his high sugar-loaf hat well forward to facilitate the operation, then ejaculated, 'Well, I'll be dod derned!', and returned to his wheel., What occasion there was to be dod derned about it is a thing which is still as much of a mystery to me now as it was then., It must have been all of fifteen minutes--fifteen minutes of dull, homesick silence-- before that long horse-face swung round upon me again--and then, what a change!, It was as red as fire, and every muscle in it was working., Now came this shriek--  'Here!--You going to set there all day?', I lit in the middle of the floor, shot there by the electric suddenness of the surprise., As soon as I could get my voice I said, apologetically:--'I have had no orders, sir.', 'You've had no ORDERS!, My, what a fine bird we are!, We must have ORDERS!, Our father was a GENTLEMAN--owned slaves--and we've been to SCHOOL., Yes, WE are a gentleman, TOO, and got to have ORDERS!, ORDERS, is it?, ORDERS is what you want!, Dod dern my skin, I'LL learn you to swell yourself up and blow around here about your dod-derned ORDERS!, G'way from the wheel!', (I had approached it without knowing it.), I moved back a step or two, and stood as in a dream, all my senses stupefied by this frantic assault., 'What you standing there for?, Take that ice-pitcher down to the texas- tender-come, move along, and don't you be all day about it!', The moment I got back to the pilot-house, Brown said--  'Here!, What was you doing down there all this time?', 'I couldn't find the texas-tender; I had to go all the way to the pantry.', 'Derned likely story!, Fill up the stove.', I proceeded to do so., He watched me like a cat., Presently he shouted--  'Put down that shovel!, Deadest numskull I ever saw--ain't even got sense enough to load up a stove.', All through the watch this sort of thing went on., Yes, and the subsequent watches were much like it, during a stretch of months., As I have said, I soon got the habit of coming on duty with dread., ...]"|1
38|[I went on telling fortunes., Every night I shut myself in, all alone, and studied the day's thumb-prints with a magnifying-glass., Imagine the devouring eagerness with which I pored over those mazy red spirals, with that document by my side which bore the right-hand thumb-and-finger- marks of that unknown murderer, printed with the dearest blood--to me-- that was ever shed on this earth!, And many and many a time I had to repeat the same old disappointed remark, 'will they NEVER correspond!', But my reward came at last., It was the print of the thumb of the forty- third man of Company C whom I had experimented on--Private Franz Adler., An hour before, I did not know the murderer's name, or voice, or figure, or face, or nationality; but now I knew all these things!, I believed I might feel sure; the Frenchman's repeated demonstrations being so good a warranty., Still, there was a way to MAKE sure., I had an impression of Kruger's left thumb., In the morning I took him aside when he was off duty; and when we were out of sight and hearing of witnesses, I said, impressively--  'A part of your fortune is so grave, that I thought it would be better for you if I did not tell it in public., You and another man, whose fortune I was studying last night,--Private Adler,--have been murdering a woman and a child!, You are being dogged: within five days both of you will be assassinated.', He dropped on his knees, frightened out of his wits; and for five minutes he kept pouring out the same set of words, like a demented person, and in the same half-crying way which was one of my memories of that murderous night in my cabin--  'I didn't do it; upon my soul I didn't do it; and I tried to keep HIM from doing it; I did, as God is my witness., He did it alone.', This was all I wanted., And I tried to get rid of the fool; but no, he clung to me, imploring me to save him from the assassin., He said--  'I have money--ten thousand dollars--hid away, the fruit of loot and thievery; save me--tell me what to do, and you shall have it, every penny., Two-thirds of it is my cousin Adler's; but you can take it all., We hid it when we first came here., But I hid it in a new place yesterday, and have not told him--shall not tell him., I was going to desert, and get away with it all., It is gold, and too heavy to carry when one is running and dodging; but a woman who has been gone over the river two days to prepare my way for me is going to follow me with it; and if I got no chance to describe the hiding-place to her I was going to slip my silver watch into her hand, or send it to her, and she would understand., There's a piece of paper in the back of the case, which tells it all., Here, take the watch--tell me what to do!', He was trying to press his watch upon me, and was exposing the paper and explaining it to me, when Adler appeared on the scene, about a dozen yards away., I said to poor Kruger--  'Put up your watch, I don't want it., You shan't come to any harm., Go, now; I must tell Adler his fortune., Presently I will tell you how to escape the assassin; meantime I shall have to examine your thumbmark again., Say nothing to Adler about this thing--say nothing to anybody.', He went away filled with fright and gratitude, poor devil., I told Adler a long fortune--purposely so long that I could not finish it; promised to come to him on guard, that night, and tell him the really important part of it--the tragical part of it, I said--so must be out of reach of eavesdroppers., They always kept a picket-watch outside the town--mere discipline and ceremony--no occasion for it, no enemy around., Toward midnight I set out, equipped with the countersign, and picked my way toward the lonely region where Adler was to keep his watch., It was so dark that I stumbled right on a dim figure almost before I could get out a protecting word., The sentinel hailed and I answered, both at the same moment., I added, 'It's only me--the fortune-teller.', Then I slipped to the poor devil's side, and without a word I drove my dirk into his heart!, YA WOHL, laughed I, it WAS the tragedy part of his fortune, indeed!, As he fell from his horse, he clutched at me, and my blue goggles remained in his hand; and away plunged the beast dragging him, with his foot in the stirrup., I fled through the woods, and made good my escape, leaving the accusing goggles behind me in that dead man's hand., This was fifteen or sixteen years ago., Since then I have wandered aimlessly about the earth, sometimes at work, sometimes idle; sometimes with money, sometimes with none; but always tired of life, and wishing it was done, for my mission here was finished, with the act of that night; and the only pleasure, solace, satisfaction I had, in all those tedious years, was in the daily reflection, 'I have killed him!', Four years ago, my health began to fail., I had wandered into Munich, in my purposeless way., Being out of money, I sought work, and got it; did my duty faithfully about a year, and was then given the berth of night watchman yonder in that dead-house which you visited lately., The place suited my mood., I liked it., I liked being with the dead--liked being alone with them., I used to wander among those rigid corpses, and peer into their austere faces, by the hour., The later the time, the more impressive it was; I preferred the late time., Sometimes I turned the lights low:  this gave perspective, you see; and the imagination could play; always, the dim receding ranks of the dead inspired one with weird and fascinating fancies., Two years ago--I had been there a year then--I was sitting all alone in the watch-room, one gusty winter's night, chilled, numb, comfortless; drowsing gradually into unconsciousness; the sobbing of the wind and the slamming of distant shutters falling fainter and fainter upon my dulling ear each moment, when sharp and suddenly that dead-bell rang out a blood-curdling alarum over my head!, The shock of it nearly paralyzed me; for it was the first time I had ever heard it., I gathered myself together and flew to the corpse-room., About midway down the outside rank, a shrouded figure was sitting upright, wagging its head slowly from one side to the other--a grisly spectacle!, Its side was toward me., I hurried to it and peered into its face., Heavens, it was Adler!, Can you divine what my first thought was?, Put into words, it was this: 'It seems, then, you escaped me once: there will be a different result this time!', Evidently this creature was suffering unimaginable terrors., Think what it must have been to wake up in the midst of that voiceless hush, and, look out over that grim congregation of the dead!, What gratitude shone in his skinny white face when he saw a living form before him!, And how the fervency of this mute gratitude was augmented when his eyes fell upon the life-giving cordials which I carried in my hands!, Then imagine the horror which came into this pinched face when I put the cordials behind me, and said mockingly--  'Speak up, Franz Adler--call upon these dead., Doubtless they will listen and have pity; but here there is none else that will.', He tried to speak, but that part of the shroud which bound his jaws, held firm and would not let him., He tried to lift imploring hands, but they were crossed upon his breast and tied., I said--  'Shout, Franz Adler; make the sleepers in the distant streets hear you and bring help., Shout--and lose no time, for there is little to lose., What, you cannot?, That is a pity; but it is no matter--it does not always bring help., When you and your cousin murdered a helpless woman and child in a cabin in Arkansas--my wife, it was, and my child!--they shrieked for help, you remember; but it did no good; you remember that it did no good, is it not so?, Your teeth chatter--then why cannot you shout?, Loosen the bandages with your hands--then you can., Ah, I see-- your hands are tied, they cannot aid you., How strangely things repeat themselves, after long years; for MY hands were tied, that night, you remember?, Yes, tied much as yours are now--how odd that is., I could not pull free., It did not occur to you to untie me; it does not occur to me to untie you., Sh--!, there's a late footstep., It is coming this way., Hark, how near it is!, One can count the footfalls--one--two--three., There--it is just outside., Now is the time!, Shout, man, shout!--it is the one sole chance between you and eternity!, Ah, you see you have delayed too long--it is gone by., There--it is dying out., It is gone!, Think of it--reflect upon it--you have heard a human footstep for the last time., How curious it must be, to listen to so common a sound as that, and know that one will never hear the fellow to it again.', Oh, my friend, the agony in that shrouded face was ecstasy to see!, I thought of a new torture, and applied it--assisting myself with a trifle of lying invention--  'That poor Kruger tried to save my wife and child, and I did him a grateful good turn for it when the time came., I persuaded him to rob you; and I and a woman helped him to desert, and got him away in safety.', A look as of surprise and triumph shone out dimly through the anguish in my victim's face., I was disturbed, disquieted., ...]|1
39|[First, you heave your cane into the centrifugals and grind out the juice; then run it through the evaporating pan to extract the fiber; then through the bone-filter to remove the alcohol; then through the clarifying tanks to discharge the molasses; then through the granulating pipe to condense it; then through the vacuum pan to extract the vacuum., It is now ready for market., I have jotted these particulars down from memory., The thing looks simple and easy., Do not deceive yourself., To make sugar is really one of the most difficult things in the world., And to make it right, is next to impossible., If you will examine your own supply every now and then for a term of years, and tabulate the result, you will find that not two men in twenty can make sugar without getting sand into it., We could have gone down to the mouth of the river and visited Captain Eads' great work, the 'jetties,' where the river has been compressed between walls, and thus deepened to twenty-six feet; but it was voted useless to go, since at this stage of the water everything would be covered up and invisible., We could have visited that ancient and singular burg, 'Pilot-town,' which stands on stilts in the water--so they say; where nearly all communication is by skiff and canoe, even to the attending of weddings and funerals; and where the littlest boys and girls are as handy with the oar as unamphibious children are with the velocipede., We could have done a number of other things; but on account of limited time, we went back home., The sail up the breezy and sparkling river was a charming experience, and would have been satisfyingly sentimental and romantic but for the interruptions of the tug's pet parrot, whose tireless comments upon the scenery and the guests were always this- worldly, and often profane., He had also a superabundance of the discordant, ear-splitting, metallic laugh common to his breed--a machine-made laugh, a Frankenstein laugh, with the soul left out of it., He applied it to every sentimental remark, and to every pathetic song., He cackled it out with hideous energy after 'Home again, home again from a foreign shore,' and said he 'wouldn't give a damn for a tug-load of such rot.', Romance and sentiment cannot long survive this sort of discouragement; so the singing and talking presently ceased; which so delighted the parrot that he cursed himself hoarse for joy., Then the male members of the party moved to the forecastle, to smoke and gossip., There were several old steamboatmen along, and I learned from them a great deal of what had been happening to my former river friends during my long absence., I learned that a pilot whom I used to steer for is become a spiritualist, and for more than fifteen years has been receiving a letter every week from a deceased relative, through a New York spiritualist medium named Manchester--postage graduated by distance:  from the local post-office in Paradise to New York, five dollars; from New York to St. Louis, three cents., I remember Mr. Manchester very well., I called on him once, ten years ago, with a couple of friends, one of whom wished to inquire after a deceased uncle., This uncle had lost his life in a peculiarly violent and unusual way, half a dozen years before:  a cyclone blew him some three miles and knocked a tree down with him which was four feet through at the butt and sixty- five feet high., He did not survive this triumph., At the seance just referred to, my friend questioned his late uncle, through Mr. Manchester, and the late uncle wrote down his replies, using Mr. Manchester's hand and pencil for that purpose., The following is a fair example of the questions asked, and also of the sloppy twaddle in the way of answers, furnished by Manchester under the pretense that it came from the specter., If this man is not the paltriest fraud that lives, I owe him an apology--  QUESTION., Where are you?, ANSWER., In the spirit world., Q., Are you happy?, A., Very happy., Perfectly happy., Q., How do you amuse yourself?, A., Conversation with friends, and other spirits., Q., What else?, A., Nothing else., Nothing else is necessary., Q., What do you talk about?, A., About how happy we are; and about friends left behind in the earth, and how to influence them for their good., Q., When your friends in the earth all get to the spirit land, what shall you have to talk about then?--nothing but about how happy you all are?, No reply., It is explained that spirits will not answer frivolous questions., Q., How is it that spirits that are content to spend an eternity in frivolous employments, and accept it as happiness, are so fastidious about frivolous questions upon the subject?, No reply., Q., Would you like to come back?, A., No., Q., Would you say that under oath?, A., Yes., Q., What do you eat there?, A., We do not eat., Q., What do you drink?, A., We do not drink., Q., What do you smoke?, A., We do not smoke., Q., What do you read?, A., We do not read., Q., Do all the good people go to your place?, A., Yes., Q., You know my present way of life., Can you suggest any additions to it, in the way of crime, that will reasonably insure my going to some other place., A., No reply., Q., When did you die?, A. I did not die, I passed away., Q., Very well, then, when did you pass away?, How long have you been in the spirit land?, A., We have no measurements of time here., Q., Though you may be indifferent and uncertain as to dates and times in your present condition and environment, this has nothing to do with your former condition., You had dates then., One of these is what I ask for., You departed on a certain day in a certain year., ...]|1
40|[These three rivers form the Black River., Troy, or a portion of it, is situated on and around three large Indian mounds, circular in shape, which rise above the present water about twelve feet., They are about one hundred and fifty feet in diameter, and are about two hundred yards apart., The houses are all built between these mounds, and hence are all flooded to a depth of eighteen inches on their floors., These elevations, built by the aborigines, hundreds of years ago, are the only points of refuge for miles., When we arrived we found them crowded with stock, all of which was thin and hardly able to stand up., They were mixed together, sheep, hogs, horses, mules, and cattle., One of these mounds has been used for many years as the grave-yard, and to-day we saw attenuated cows lying against the marble tomb-stones, chewing their cud in contentment, after a meal of corn furnished by General York., Here, as below, the remarkable skill of the women and girls in the management of the smaller pirogues was noticed., Children were paddling about in these most ticklish crafts with all the nonchalance of adepts., General York has put into operation a perfect system in regard to furnishing relief., He makes a personal inspection of the place where it is asked, sees what is necessary to be done, and then, having two boats chartered, with flats, sends them promptly to the place, when the cattle are loaded and towed to the pine hills and uplands of Catahoula., He has made Troy his headquarters, and to this point boats come for their supply of feed for cattle., On the opposite side of Little River, which branches to the left out of Black, and between it and the Ouachita, is situated the town of Trinity, which is hourly threatened with destruction., It is much lower than Troy, and the water is eight and nine feet deep in the houses., A strong current sweeps through it, and it is remarkable that all of its houses have not gone before., The residents of both Troy and Trinity have been cared for, yet some of their stock have to be furnished with food., As soon as the 'Susie' reached Troy, she was turned over to General York, and placed at his disposition to carry out the work of relief more rapidly., Nearly all her supplies were landed on one of the mounds to lighten her, and she was headed down stream to relieve those below., At Tom Hooper's place, a few miles from Troy, a large flat, with about fifty head of stock on board, was taken in tow., The animals were fed, and soon regained some strength., To-day we go on Little River, where the suffering is greatest., DOWN BLACK RIVER  Saturday Evening, March 25., We started down Black River quite early, under the direction of General York, to bring out what stock could be reached., Going down river a flat in tow was left in a central locality, and from there men poled her back in the rear of plantations, picking up the animals wherever found., In the loft of a gin-house there were seventeen head found, and after a gangway was built they were led down into the flat without difficulty., Taking a skiff with the General, your reporter was pulled up to a little house of two rooms, in which the water was standing two feet on the floors., In one of the large rooms were huddled the horses and cows of the place, while in the other the Widow Taylor and her son were seated on a scaffold raised on the floor., One or two dug-outs were drifting about in the roam ready to be put in service at any time., When the flat was brought up, the side of the house was cut away as the only means of getting the animals out, and the cattle were driven on board the boat., General York, in this as in every case, inquired if the family desired to leave, informing them that Major Burke, of 'The Times-Democrat,' has sent the 'Susie' up for that purpose., Mrs. Taylor said she thanked Major Burke, but she would try and hold out., The remarkable tenacity of the people here to their homes is beyond all comprehension., Just below, at a point sixteen miles from Troy, information was received that the house of Mr. Tom Ellis was in danger, and his family were all in it., We steamed there immediately, and a sad picture was presented., Looking out of the half of the window left above water, was Mrs. Ellis, who is in feeble health, whilst at the door were her seven children, the oldest not fourteen years., One side of the house was given up to the work animals, some twelve head, besides hogs., In the next room the family lived, the water coming within two inches of the bed-rail., The stove was below water, and the cooking was done on a fire on top of it., The house threatened to give way at any moment: one end of it was sinking, and, in fact, the building looked a mere shell., As the boat rounded to, Mr. Ellis came out in a dug-out, and General York told him that he had come to his relief; that 'The Times-Democrat' boat was at his service, and would remove his family at once to the hills, and on Monday a flat would take out his stock, as, until that time, they would be busy., Notwithstanding the deplorable situation himself and family were in, Mr. Ellis did not want to leave., He said he thought he would wait until Monday, and take the risk of his house falling., The children around the door looked perfectly contented, seeming to care little for the danger they were in., These are but two instances of the many., After weeks of privation and suffering, people still cling to their houses and leave only when there is not room between the water and the ceiling to build a scaffold on which to stand., It seemed to be incomprehensible, yet the love for the old place was stronger than that for safety., After leaving the Ellis place, the next spot touched at was the Oswald place., Here the flat was towed alongside the gin-house where there were fifteen head standing in water; and yet, as they stood on scaffolds, their heads were above the top of the entrance., It was found impossible to get them out without cutting away a portion of the front; and so axes were brought into requisition and a gap made., After much labor the horses and mules were securely placed on the flat., At each place we stop there are always three, four, or more dug-outs arriving, bringing information of stock in other places in need., Notwithstanding the fact that a great many had driven a part of their stock to the hills some time ago, there yet remains a large quantity, which General York, who is working with indomitable energy, will get landed in the pine hills by Tuesday., All along Black River the 'Susie' has been visited by scores of planters, whose tales are the repetition of those already heard of suffering and loss., An old planter, who has lived on the river since 1844, said there never was such a rise, and he was satisfied more than one quarter of the stock has been lost., Luckily the people cared first for their work stock, and when they could find it horses and mules were housed in a place of safety., The rise which still continues, and was two inches last night, compels them to get them out to the hills; hence it is that the work of General York is of such a great value., From daylight to late at night he is going this way and that, cheering by his kindly words and directing with calm judgment what is to be done., One unpleasant story, of a certain merchant in New Orleans, is told all along the river., It appears for some years past the planters have been dealing with this individual, and many of them had balances in his hands., When the overflow came they wrote for coffee, for meal, and, in fact, for such little necessities as were required., No response to these letters came, and others were written, and yet these old customers, with plantations under water, were refused even what was necessary to sustain life., It is needless to say he is not popular now on Back River., The hills spoken of as the place of refuge for the people and stock on Black River are in Catahoula parish, twenty-four miles from Black River., After filling the flat with cattle we took on board the family of T. S. Hooper, seven in number, who could not longer remain in their dwelling, and we are now taking them up Little River to the hills., THE FLOOD STILL RISING  Troy: March 27, 1882, noon., The flood here is rising about three and a half inches every twenty-four hours, and rains have set in which will increase this., General York feels now that our efforts ought to be directed towards saving life, as the increase of the water has jeopardized many houses., We intend to go up the Tensas in a few minutes, and then we will return and go down Black River to take off families., There is a lack of steam transportation here to meet the emergency., The General has three boats chartered, with flats in tow, but the demand for these to tow out stock is greater than they can meet with promptness., All are working night and day, and the 'Susie' hardly stops for more than an hour anywhere., The rise has placed Trinity in a dangerous plight, and momentarily it is expected that some of the houses will float off., Troy is a little higher, yet all are in the water., Reports have come in that a woman and child have been washed away below here, and two cabins floated off., Their occupants are the same who refused to come off day before yesterday., One would not believe the utter passiveness of the people., As yet no news has been received of the steamer 'Delia,' which is supposed to be the one sunk in yesterday's storm on Lake Catahoula., She is due here now, but has not arrived., Even the mail here is most uncertain, and this I send by skiff to Natchez to get it to you., It is impossible to get accurate data as to past crops, etc., as those who know much about the matter have gone, and those who remain are not well versed in the production of this section., General York desires me to say that the amount of rations formerly sent should be duplicated and sent at once., It is impossible to make any estimate, for the people are fleeing to the hills, so rapid is the rise., The residents here are in a state of commotion that can only be appreciated when seen, and complete demoralization has set in,  If rations are drawn for any particular section hereabouts, they would not be certain to be distributed, so everything should be sent to Troy as a center, and the General will have it properly disposed of., He has sent for one hundred tents, and, if all go to the hills who are in motion now, two hundred will be required., APPENDIX B  THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER COMMISSION  THE condition of this rich valley of the Lower Mississippi, immediately after and since the war, constituted one of the disastrous effects of war most to be deplored., Fictitious property in slaves was not only righteously destroyed, but very much of the work which had depended upon the slave labor was also destroyed or greatly impaired, especially the levee system., It might have been expected by those who have not investigated the subject, that such important improvements as the construction and maintenance of the levees would have been assumed at once by the several States., But what can the State do where the people are under subjection to rates of interest ranging from 18 to 30 per cent., and are also under the necessity of pledging their crops in advance even of planting, at these rates, for the privilege of purchasing all of their supplies at 100 per cent., profit?, It has needed but little attention to make it perfectly obvious that the control of the Mississippi River, if undertaken at all, must be undertaken by the national government, and cannot be compassed by States., The river must be treated as a unit; its control cannot be compassed under a divided or separate system of administration., Neither are the States especially interested competent to combine among themselves for the necessary operations., The work must begin far up the river; at least as far as Cairo, if not beyond; and must be conducted upon a consistent general plan throughout the course of the river., It does not need technical or scientific knowledge to comprehend the elements of the case if one will give a little time and attention to the subject, and when a Mississippi River commission has been constituted, as the existing commission is, of thoroughly able men of different walks in life, may it not be suggested that their verdict in the case should be accepted as conclusive, so far as any a priori theory of construction or control can be considered conclusive?, It should be remembered that upon this board are General Gilmore, General Comstock, and General Suter, of the United States Engineers; Professor Henry Mitchell (the most competent authority on the question of hydrography), of the United States Coast Survey; B., B. Harrod, the State Engineer of Louisiana; Jas., B. Eads, whose success with the jetties at New Orleans is a warrant of his competency, and Judge Taylor, of Indiana., It would be presumption on the part of any single man, however skilled, to contest the judgment of such a board as this., The method of improvement proposed by the commission is at once in accord with the results of engineering experience and with observations of nature where meeting our wants., ...]|1
41|"[Well, by this time I was most down to the foot of the island., A little ripply, cool breeze begun to blow, and that was as good as saying the night was about done., I give her a turn with the paddle and brung her nose to shore; then I got my gun and slipped out and into the edge of the woods., I sat down there on a log, and looked out through the leaves., I see the moon go off watch, and the darkness begin to blanket the river., But in a little while I see a pale streak over the treetops, and knowed the day was coming., So I took my gun and slipped off towards where I had run across that camp fire, stopping every minute or two to listen., But I hadn't no luck somehow; I couldn't seem to find the place., But by and by, sure enough, I catched a glimpse of fire away through the trees., I went for it, cautious and slow., By and by I was close enough to have a look, and there laid a man on the ground., It most give me the fantods., He had a blanket around his head, and his head was nearly in the fire., I set there behind a clump of bushes in about six foot of him, and kept my eyes on him steady., It was getting gray daylight now., Pretty soon he gapped and stretched himself and hove off the blanket, and it was Miss Watson's Jim!, I bet I was glad to see him., I says:  ""Hello, Jim!"", and skipped out., He bounced up and stared at me wild., Then he drops down on his knees, and puts his hands together and says:  ""Doan' hurt me--don't!, I hain't ever done no harm to a ghos'., I alwuz liked dead people, en done all I could for 'em., You go en git in de river agin, whah you b'longs, en doan' do nuffn to Ole Jim, 'at 'uz awluz yo' fren'."", Well, I warn't long making him understand I warn't dead., I was ever so glad to see Jim., I warn't lonesome now., I told him I warn't afraid of HIM telling the people where I was., I talked along, but he only set there and looked at me; never said nothing., Then I says:  ""It's good daylight., Le's get breakfast., Make up your camp fire good."", ""What's de use er makin' up de camp fire to cook strawbries en sich truck?, But you got a gun, hain't you?, Den we kin git sumfn better den strawbries."", ""Strawberries and such truck,"" I says., ""Is that what you live on?"", ""I couldn' git nuffn else,"" he says., ""Why, how long you been on the island, Jim?"", ""I come heah de night arter you's killed."", ""What, all that time?"", ""Yes--indeedy."", ""And ain't you had nothing but that kind of rubbage to eat?"", ""No, sah--nuffn else."", ""Well, you must be most starved, ain't you?"", ""I reck'n I could eat a hoss., I think I could., How long you ben on de islan'?"", ""Since the night I got killed."", ""No!, W'y, what has you lived on?, But you got a gun., Oh, yes, you got a gun., Dat's good., Now you kill sumfn en I'll make up de fire."", So we went over to where the canoe was, and while he built a fire in a grassy open place amongst the trees, I fetched meal and bacon and coffee, and coffee-pot and frying-pan, and sugar and tin cups, and the nigger was set back considerable, because he reckoned it was all done with witchcraft., I catched a good big catfish, too, and Jim cleaned him with his knife, and fried him., When breakfast was ready we lolled on the grass and eat it smoking hot., Jim laid it in with all his might, for he was most about starved., Then when we had got pretty well stuffed, we laid off and lazied., By and by Jim says:  ""But looky here, Huck, who wuz it dat 'uz killed in dat shanty ef it warn't you?"", Then I told him the whole thing, and he said it was smart., He said Tom Sawyer couldn't get up no better plan than what I had., Then I says:  ""How do you come to be here, Jim, and how'd you get here?"", He looked pretty uneasy, and didn't say nothing for a minute., Then he says:  ""Maybe I better not tell."", ""Why, Jim?"", ""Well, dey's reasons., But you wouldn' tell on me ef I uz to tell you, would you, Huck?"", ""Blamed if I would, Jim."", ""Well, I b'lieve you, Huck., I--I RUN OFF."", ""Jim!"", ""But mind, you said you wouldn' tell--you know you said you wouldn' tell, Huck."", ""Well, I did., I said I wouldn't, and I'll stick to it., Honest INJUN, I will., People would call me a low-down Abolitionist and despise me for keeping mum--but that don't make no difference., I ain't a-going to tell, and I ain't a-going back there, anyways., So, now, le's know all about it."", ""Well, you see, it 'uz dis way., Ole missus--dat's Miss Watson--she pecks on me all de time, en treats me pooty rough, but she awluz said she wouldn' sell me down to Orleans., But I noticed dey wuz a nigger trader roun' de place considable lately, en I begin to git oneasy., Well, one night I creeps to de do' pooty late, en de do' warn't quite shet, en I hear old missus tell de widder she gwyne to sell me down to Orleans, but she didn' want to, but she could git eight hund'd dollars for me, en it 'uz sich a big stack o' money she couldn' resis'., De widder she try to git her to say she wouldn' do it, but I never waited to hear de res'., I lit out mighty quick, I tell you., ""I tuck out en shin down de hill, en 'spec to steal a skift 'long de sho' som'ers 'bove de town, but dey wuz people a-stirring yit, so I hid in de ole tumble-down cooper-shop on de bank to wait for everybody to go 'way., Well, I wuz dah all night., Dey wuz somebody roun' all de time., 'Long 'bout six in de mawnin' skifts begin to go by, en 'bout eight er nine every skift dat went 'long wuz talkin' 'bout how yo' pap come over to de town en say you's killed., Dese las' skifts wuz full o' ladies en genlmen a-goin' over for to see de place., Sometimes dey'd pull up at de sho' en take a res' b'fo' dey started acrost, so by de talk I got to know all 'bout de killin'., I 'uz powerful sorry you's killed, Huck, but I ain't no mo' now., ""I laid dah under de shavin's all day., I 'uz hungry, but I warn't afeard;

42|"[Come along, old hoss."", Cold corn-pone, cold corn-beef, butter and buttermilk--that is what they had for me down there, and there ain't nothing better that ever I've come across yet., Buck and his ma and all of them smoked cob pipes, except the nigger woman, which was gone, and the two young women., They all smoked and talked, and I eat and talked., The young women had quilts around them, and their hair down their backs., They all asked me questions, and I told them how pap and me and all the family was living on a little farm down at the bottom of Arkansaw, and my sister Mary Ann run off and got married and never was heard of no more, and Bill went to hunt them and he warn't heard of no more, and Tom and Mort died, and then there warn't nobody but just me and pap left, and he was just trimmed down to nothing, on account of his troubles; so when he died I took what there was left, because the farm didn't belong to us, and started up the river, deck passage, and fell overboard; and that was how I come to be here., So they said I could have a home there as long as I wanted it., Then it was most daylight and everybody went to bed, and I went to bed with Buck, and when I waked up in the morning, drat it all, I had forgot what my name was., So I laid there about an hour trying to think, and when Buck waked up I says:  ""Can you spell, Buck?"", ""Yes,"" he says., ""I bet you can't spell my name,"" says I., ""I bet you what you dare I can,"" says he., ""All right,"" says I, ""go ahead."", ""G-e-o-r-g-e J-a-x-o-n--there now,"" he says., ""Well,"" says I, ""you done it, but I didn't think you could., It ain't no slouch of a name to spell--right off without studying."", I set it down, private, because somebody might want ME to spell it next, and so I wanted to be handy with it and rattle it off like I was used to it., It was a mighty nice family, and a mighty nice house, too., I hadn't seen no house out in the country before that was so nice and had so much style., It didn't have an iron latch on the front door, nor a wooden one with a buckskin string, but a brass knob to turn, the same as houses in town., There warn't no bed in the parlor, nor a sign of a bed; but heaps of parlors in towns has beds in them., There was a big fireplace that was bricked on the bottom, and the bricks was kept clean and red by pouring water on them and scrubbing them with another brick; sometimes they wash them over with red water-paint that they call Spanish-brown, same as they do in town., They had big brass dog-irons that could hold up a saw-log., There was a clock on the middle of the mantelpiece, with a picture of a town painted on the bottom half of the glass front, and a round place in the middle of it for the sun, and you could see the pendulum swinging behind it., It was beautiful to hear that clock tick; and sometimes when one of these peddlers had been along and scoured her up and got her in good shape, she would start in and strike a hundred and fifty before she got tuckered out., They wouldn't took any money for her., Well, there was a big outlandish parrot on each side of the clock, made out of something like chalk, and painted up gaudy., By one of the parrots was a cat made of crockery, and a crockery dog by the other; and when you pressed down on them they squeaked, but didn't open their mouths nor look different nor interested., They squeaked through underneath., There was a couple of big wild-turkey-wing fans spread out behind those things., On the table in the middle of the room was a kind of a lovely crockery basket that had apples and oranges and peaches and grapes piled up in it, which was much redder and yellower and prettier than real ones is, but they warn't real because you could see where pieces had got chipped off and showed the white chalk, or whatever it was, underneath., This table had a cover made out of beautiful oilcloth, with a red and blue spread-eagle painted on it, and a painted border all around., It come all the way from Philadelphia, they said., There was some books, too, piled up perfectly exact, on each corner of the table., One was a big family Bible full of pictures., One was Pilgrim's Progress, about a man that left his family, it didn't say why., I read considerable in it now and then., The statements was interesting, but tough., Another was Friendship's Offering, full of beautiful stuff and poetry; but I didn't read the poetry., Another was Henry Clay's Speeches, and another was Dr. Gunn's Family Medicine, which told you all about what to do if a body was sick or dead., There was a hymn book, and a lot of other books., And there was nice split-bottom chairs, and perfectly sound, too--not bagged down in the middle and busted, like an old basket., They had pictures hung on the walls--mainly Washingtons and Lafayettes, and battles, and Highland Marys, and one called ""Signing the Declaration."", There was some that they called crayons, which one of the daughters which was dead made her own self when she was only fifteen years old., They was different from any pictures I ever see before --blacker, mostly, than is common., One was a woman in a slim black dress, belted small under the armpits, with bulges like a cabbage in the middle of the sleeves, and a large black scoop-shovel bonnet with a black veil, and white slim ankles crossed about with black tape, and very wee black slippers, like a chisel, and she was leaning pensive on a tombstone on her right elbow, under a weeping willow, and her other hand hanging down her side holding a white handkerchief and a reticule, and underneath the picture it said ""Shall I Never See Thee More Alas."", Another one was a young lady with her hair all combed up straight to the top of her head, and knotted there in front of a comb like a chair-back, and she was crying into a handkerchief and had a dead bird laying on its back in her other hand with its heels up, and underneath the picture it said ""I Shall Never Hear Thy Sweet Chirrup More Alas."", There was one where a young lady was at a window looking up at the moon, and tears running down her cheeks; and she had an open letter in one hand with black sealing wax showing on one edge of it, and she was mashing a locket with a chain to it against her mouth, and underneath the picture it said ""And Art Thou Gone Yes Thou Art Gone Alas."", These was all nice pictures, I reckon, but I didn't somehow seem to take to them, because if ever I was down a little they always give me the fan-tods., Everybody was sorry she died, because she had laid out a lot more of these pictures to do, and a body could see by what she had done what they had lost., But I reckoned that with her disposition she was having a better time in the graveyard., She was at work on what they said was her greatest picture when she took sick, and every day and every night it was her prayer to be allowed to live till she got it done, but she never got the chance., It was a picture of a young woman in a long white gown, standing on the rail of a bridge all ready to jump off, with her hair all down her back, and looking up to the moon, with the tears running down her face, and she had two arms folded across her breast, and two arms stretched out in front, and two more reaching up towards the moon--and the idea was to see which pair would look best, and then scratch out all the other arms; but, as I was saying, she died before she got her mind made up, and now they kept this picture over the head of the bed in her room, and every time her birthday come they hung flowers on it., Other times it was hid with a little curtain., The young woman in the picture had a kind of a nice sweet face, but there was so many arms it made her look too spidery, seemed to me., This young girl kept a scrap-book when she was alive, and used to paste obituaries and accidents and cases of patient suffering in it out of the Presbyterian Observer, and write poetry after them out of her own head., It was very good poetry., This is what she wrote about a boy by the name of Stephen Dowling Bots that fell down a well and was drownded:  ODE TO STEPHEN DOWLING BOTS, DEC'D  And did young Stephen sicken, And did young Stephen die?, And did the sad hearts thicken, And did the mourners cry?, No; such was not the fate of Young Stephen Dowling Bots; Though sad hearts round him thickened, 'Twas not from sickness' shots., No whooping-cough did rack his frame, Nor measles drear with spots; Not these impaired the sacred name Of Stephen Dowling Bots., Despised love struck not with woe That head of curly knots, Nor stomach troubles laid him low, Young Stephen Dowling Bots., O no., Then list with tearful eye, Whilst I his fate do tell., His soul did from this cold world fly By falling down a well., They got him out and emptied him; Alas it was too late; His spirit was gone for to sport aloft In the realms of the good and great., If Emmeline Grangerford could make poetry like that before she was fourteen, there ain't no telling what she could a done by and by., Buck said she could rattle off poetry like nothing., She didn't ever have to stop to think., He said she would slap down a line, and if she couldn't find anything to rhyme with it would just scratch it out and slap down another one, and go ahead., She warn't particular; she could write about anything you choose to give her to write about just so it was sadful., Every time a man died, or a woman died, or a child died, she would be on hand with her ""tribute"" before he was cold., She called them tributes., The neighbors said it was the doctor first, then Emmeline, then the undertaker--the undertaker never got in ahead of Emmeline but once, and then she hung fire on a rhyme for the dead person's name, which was Whistler., She warn't ever the same after that; she never complained, but she kinder pined away and did not live long., Poor thing, many's the time I made myself go up to the little room that used to be hers and get out her poor old scrap-book and read in it when her pictures had been aggravating me and I had soured on her a little., I liked all that family, dead ones and all, and warn't going to let anything come between us., Poor Emmeline made poetry about all the dead people when she was alive, and it didn't seem right that there warn't nobody to make some about her now she was gone; so I tried to sweat out a verse or two myself, but I couldn't seem to make it go somehow., They kept Emmeline's room trim and nice, and all the things fixed in it just the way she liked to have them when she was alive, and nobody ever slept there., The old lady took care of the room herself, though there was plenty of niggers, and she sewed there a good deal and read her Bible there mostly., Well, as I was saying about the parlor, there was beautiful curtains on the windows:  white, with pictures painted on them of castles with vines all down the walls, and cattle coming down to drink., There was a little old piano, too, that had tin pans in it, I reckon, and nothing was ever so lovely as to hear the young ladies sing ""The Last Link is Broken"" and play ""The Battle of Prague"" on it., The walls of all the rooms was plastered, and most had carpets on the floors, and the whole house was whitewashed on the outside., It was a double house, and the big open place betwixt them was roofed and floored, and sometimes the table was set there in the middle of the day, and it was a cool, comfortable place., Nothing couldn't be better., And warn't the cooking good, and just bushels of it too!, COL.  GRANGERFORD was a gentleman, you see., He was a gentleman all over; and so was his family., He was well born, as the saying is, and that's worth as much in a man as it is in a horse, so the Widow Douglas said, and nobody ever denied that she was of the first aristocracy in our town; and pap he always said it, too, though he warn't no more quality than a mudcat himself., Col.  Grangerford was very tall and very slim, and had a darkish-paly complexion, not a sign of red in it anywheres; he was clean shaved every morning all over his thin face, and he had the thinnest kind of lips, and the thinnest kind of nostrils, and a high nose, and heavy eyebrows, and the blackest kind of eyes, sunk so deep back that they seemed like they was looking out of caverns at you, as you may say., His forehead was high, and his hair was black and straight and hung to his shoulders., His hands was long and thin, and every day of his life he put on a clean shirt and a full suit from head to foot made out of linen so white it hurt your eyes to look at it; and on Sundays he wore a blue tail-coat with brass buttons on it., He carried a mahogany cane with a silver head to it., There warn't no frivolishness about him, not a bit, and he warn't ever loud., He was as kind as he could be--you could feel that, you know, and so you had confidence., Sometimes he smiled, and it was good to see; but when he straightened himself up like a liberty-pole, and the lightning begun to flicker out from under his eyebrows, you wanted to climb a tree first, and find out what the matter was afterwards., He didn't ever have to tell anybody to mind their manners --everybody was always good-mannered where he was., Everybody loved to have him around, too; he was sunshine most always--I mean he made it seem like good weather., When he turned into a cloudbank it was awful dark for half a minute, and that was enough; there wouldn't nothing go wrong again for a week., When him and the old lady come down in the morning all the family got up out of their chairs and give them good-day, and didn't set down again till they had set down., ...]"|1
43|"[I reckon he can stand a little thing like that, can't he?"", ""I don't care whether 'twas little or whether 'twas big; he's here in our house and a stranger, and it wasn't good of you to say it., If you was in his place it would make you feel ashamed; and so you oughtn't to say a thing to another person that will make THEM feel ashamed."", ""Why, Maim, he said--""  ""It don't make no difference what he SAID--that ain't the thing., The thing is for you to treat him KIND, and not be saying things to make him remember he ain't in his own country and amongst his own folks."", I says to myself, THIS is a girl that I'm letting that old reptle rob her of her money!, Then Susan SHE waltzed in; and if you'll believe me, she did give Hare-lip hark from the tomb!, Says I to myself, and this is ANOTHER one that I'm letting him rob her of her money!, Then Mary Jane she took another inning, and went in sweet and lovely again--which was her way; but when she got done there warn't hardly anything left o' poor Hare-lip., So she hollered., ""All right, then,"" says the other girls; ""you just ask his pardon."", She done it, too; and she done it beautiful., She done it so beautiful it was good to hear; and I wished I could tell her a thousand lies, so she could do it again., I says to myself, this is ANOTHER one that I'm letting him rob her of her money., And when she got through they all jest laid theirselves out to make me feel at home and know I was amongst friends., I felt so ornery and low down and mean that I says to myself, my mind's made up; I'll hive that money for them or bust., So then I lit out--for bed, I said, meaning some time or another., When I got by myself I went to thinking the thing over., I says to myself, shall I go to that doctor, private, and blow on these frauds?, No--that won't do., He might tell who told him; then the king and the duke would make it warm for me., Shall I go, private, and tell Mary Jane?, No--I dasn't do it., Her face would give them a hint, sure; they've got the money, and they'd slide right out and get away with it., If she was to fetch in help I'd get mixed up in the business before it was done with, I judge., No; there ain't no good way but one., I got to steal that money, somehow; and I got to steal it some way that they won't suspicion that I done it., They've got a good thing here, and they ain't a-going to leave till they've played this family and this town for all they're worth, so I'll find a chance time enough., I'll steal it and hide it; and by and by, when I'm away down the river, I'll write a letter and tell Mary Jane where it's hid., But I better hive it tonight if I can, because the doctor maybe hasn't let up as much as he lets on he has; he might scare them out of here yet., So, thinks I, I'll go and search them rooms., Upstairs the hall was dark, but I found the duke's room, and started to paw around it with my hands; but I recollected it wouldn't be much like the king to let anybody else take care of that money but his own self; so then I went to his room and begun to paw around there., But I see I couldn't do nothing without a candle, and I dasn't light one, of course., So I judged I'd got to do the other thing--lay for them and eavesdrop., About that time I hears their footsteps coming, and was going to skip under the bed; I reached for it, but it wasn't where I thought it would be; but I touched the curtain that hid Mary Jane's frocks, so I jumped in behind that and snuggled in amongst the gowns, and stood there perfectly still., They come in and shut the door; and the first thing the duke done was to get down and look under the bed., Then I was glad I hadn't found the bed when I wanted it., And yet, you know, it's kind of natural to hide under the bed when you are up to anything private., They sets down then, and the king says:  ""Well, what is it?, And cut it middlin' short, because it's better for us to be down there a-whoopin' up the mournin' than up here givin' 'em a chance to talk us over."", ""Well, this is it, Capet., I ain't easy; I ain't comfortable., That doctor lays on my mind., I wanted to know your plans., I've got a notion, and I think it's a sound one."", ""What is it, duke?"", ""That we better glide out of this before three in the morning, and clip it down the river with what we've got., Specially, seeing we got it so easy--GIVEN back to us, flung at our heads, as you may say, when of course we allowed to have to steal it back., I'm for knocking off and lighting out."", That made me feel pretty bad., About an hour or two ago it would a been a little different, but now it made me feel bad and disappointed, The king rips out and says:  ""What!, And not sell out the rest o' the property?, March off like a passel of fools and leave eight or nine thous'n' dollars' worth o' property layin' around jest sufferin' to be scooped in?--and all good, salable stuff, too."", The duke he grumbled; said the bag of gold was enough, and he didn't want to go no deeper--didn't want to rob a lot of orphans of EVERYTHING they had., ""Why, how you talk!"", says the king., ""We sha'n't rob 'em of nothing at all but jest this money., The people that BUYS the property is the suff'rers; because as soon 's it's found out 'at we didn't own it--which won't be long after we've slid--the sale won't be valid, and it 'll all go back to the estate., These yer orphans 'll git their house back agin, and that's enough for THEM; they're young and spry, and k'n easy earn a livin'., THEY ain't a-goin to suffer., Why, jest think--there's thous'n's and thous'n's that ain't nigh so well off., Bless you, THEY ain't got noth'n' to complain of."", Well, the king he talked him blind; so at last he give in, and said all right, but said he believed it was blamed foolishness to stay, and that doctor hanging over them., But the king says:  ""Cuss the doctor!, What do we k'yer for HIM?, Hain't we got all the fools in town on our side?, And ain't that a big enough majority in any town?"", So they got ready to go down stairs again., The duke says:  ""I don't think we put that money in a good place."", That cheered me up., I'd begun to think I warn't going to get a hint of no kind to help me., The king says:  ""Why?"", ""Because Mary Jane 'll be in mourning from this out; and first you know the nigger that does up the rooms will get an order to box these duds up and put 'em away; and do you reckon a nigger can run across money and not borrow some of it?"", ""Your head's level agin, duke,"" says the king; and he comes a-fumbling under the curtain two or three foot from where I was., I stuck tight to the wall and kept mighty still, though quivery; and I wondered what them fellows would say to me if they catched me; and I tried to think what I'd better do if they did catch me., But the king he got the bag before I could think more than about a half a thought, and he never suspicioned I was around., They took and shoved the bag through a rip in the straw tick that was under the feather-bed, and crammed it in a foot or two amongst the straw and said it was all right now, because a nigger only makes up the feather-bed, and don't turn over the straw tick only about twice a year, and so it warn't in no danger of getting stole now., But I knowed better., I had it out of there before they was half-way down stairs., I groped along up to my cubby, and hid it there till I could get a chance to do better., I judged I better hide it outside of the house somewheres, because if they missed it they would give the house a good ransacking:  I knowed that very well., Then I turned in, with my clothes all on; but I couldn't a gone to sleep if I'd a wanted to, I was in such a sweat to get through with the business., By and by I heard the king and the duke come up; so I rolled off my pallet and laid with my chin at the top of my ladder, and waited to see if anything was going to happen., But nothing did., So I held on till all the late sounds had quit and the early ones hadn't begun yet; and then I slipped down the ladder., I CREPT to their doors and listened; they was snoring., So I tiptoed along, and got down stairs all right., There warn't a sound anywheres., I peeped through a crack of the dining-room door, and see the men that was watching the corpse all sound asleep on their chairs., The door was open into the parlor, where the corpse was laying, and there was a candle in both rooms., I passed along, and the parlor door was open; but I see there warn't nobody in there but the remainders of Peter; so I shoved on by; but the front door was locked, and the key wasn't there., Just then I heard somebody coming down the stairs, back behind me., I run in the parlor and took a swift look around, and the only place I see to hide the bag was in the coffin., The lid was shoved along about a foot, showing the dead man's face down in there, with a wet cloth over it, and his shroud on., I tucked the money-bag in under the lid, just down beyond where his hands was crossed, which made me creep, they was so cold, and then I run back across the room and in behind the door., The person coming was Mary Jane., She went to the coffin, very soft, and kneeled down and looked in; then she put up her handkerchief, and I see she begun to cry, though I couldn't hear her, and her back was to me., I slid out, and as I passed the dining-room I thought I'd make sure them watchers hadn't seen me; so I looked through the crack, and everything was all right., They hadn't stirred., I slipped up to bed, feeling ruther blue, on accounts of the thing playing out that way after I had took so much trouble and run so much resk about it., ...]"|1
44|"[Well, as I was saying, we waited that morning till everybody was settled down to business, and nobody in sight around the yard; then Tom he carried the sack into the lean-to whilst I stood off a piece to keep watch., By and by he come out, and we went and set down on the woodpile to talk., He says:  ""Everything's all right now except tools; and that's easy fixed."", ""Tools?"", I says., ""Yes."", ""Tools for what?"", ""Why, to dig with., We ain't a-going to GNAW him out, are we?"", ""Ain't them old crippled picks and things in there good enough to dig a nigger out with?"", I says., He turns on me, looking pitying enough to make a body cry, and says:  ""Huck Finn, did you EVER hear of a prisoner having picks and shovels, and all the modern conveniences in his wardrobe to dig himself out with?, Now I want to ask you--if you got any reasonableness in you at all--what kind of a show would THAT give him to be a hero?, Why, they might as well lend him the key and done with it., Picks and shovels--why, they wouldn't furnish 'em to a king."", ""Well, then,"" I says, ""if we don't want the picks and shovels, what do we want?"", ""A couple of case-knives."", ""To dig the foundations out from under that cabin with?"", ""Yes."", ""Confound it, it's foolish, Tom."", ""It don't make no difference how foolish it is, it's the RIGHT way--and it's the regular way., And there ain't no OTHER way, that ever I heard of, and I've read all the books that gives any information about these things., They always dig out with a case-knife--and not through dirt, mind you; generly it's through solid rock., And it takes them weeks and weeks and weeks, and for ever and ever., Why, look at one of them prisoners in the bottom dungeon of the Castle Deef, in the harbor of Marseilles, that dug himself out that way; how long was HE at it, you reckon?"", ""I don't know."", ""Well, guess."", ""I don't know., A month and a half."", ""THIRTY-SEVEN YEAR--and he come out in China., THAT'S the kind., I wish the bottom of THIS fortress was solid rock."", ""JIM don't know nobody in China."", ""What's THAT got to do with it?, Neither did that other fellow., But you're always a-wandering off on a side issue., Why can't you stick to the main point?"", ""All right--I don't care where he comes out, so he COMES out; and Jim don't, either, I reckon., But there's one thing, anyway--Jim's too old to be dug out with a case-knife., He won't last."", ""Yes he will LAST, too., You don't reckon it's going to take thirty-seven years to dig out through a DIRT foundation, do you?"", ""How long will it take, Tom?"", ""Well, we can't resk being as long as we ought to, because it mayn't take very long for Uncle Silas to hear from down there by New Orleans., He'll hear Jim ain't from there., Then his next move will be to advertise Jim, or something like that., So we can't resk being as long digging him out as we ought to., By rights I reckon we ought to be a couple of years; but we can't., Things being so uncertain, what I recommend is this:  that we really dig right in, as quick as we can; and after that, we can LET ON, to ourselves, that we was at it thirty-seven years., Then we can snatch him out and rush him away the first time there's an alarm., Yes, I reckon that 'll be the best way."", ""Now, there's SENSE in that,"" I says., ""Letting on don't cost nothing; letting on ain't no trouble; and if it's any object, I don't mind letting on we was at it a hundred and fifty year., It wouldn't strain me none, after I got my hand in., So I'll mosey along now, and smouch a couple of case-knives."", ""Smouch three,"" he says; ""we want one to make a saw out of."", ""Tom, if it ain't unregular and irreligious to sejest it,"" I says, ""there's an old rusty saw-blade around yonder sticking under the weather-boarding behind the smoke-house."", He looked kind of weary and discouraged-like, and says:  ""It ain't no use to try to learn you nothing, Huck., Run along and smouch the knives--three of them."", So I done it., AS soon as we reckoned everybody was asleep that night we went down the lightning-rod, and shut ourselves up in the lean-to, and got out our pile of fox-fire, and went to work., We cleared everything out of the way, about four or five foot along the middle of the bottom log., Tom said we was right behind Jim's bed now, and we'd dig in under it, and when we got through there couldn't nobody in the cabin ever know there was any hole there, because Jim's counter-pin hung down most to the ground, and you'd have to raise it up and look under to see the hole., So we dug and dug with the case-knives till most midnight; and then we was dog-tired, and our hands was blistered, and yet you couldn't see we'd done anything hardly., At last I says:  ""This ain't no thirty-seven year job; this is a thirty-eight year job, Tom Sawyer."", He never said nothing., But he sighed, and pretty soon he stopped digging, and then for a good little while I knowed that he was thinking., Then he says:  ""It ain't no use, Huck, it ain't a-going to work., If we was prisoners it would, because then we'd have as many years as we wanted, and no hurry; and we wouldn't get but a few minutes to dig, every day, while they was changing watches, and so our hands wouldn't get blistered, and we could keep it up right along, year in and year out, and do it right, and the way it ought to be done., But WE can't fool along; we got to rush; we ain't got no time to spare., If we was to put in another night this way we'd have to knock off for a week to let our hands get well--couldn't touch a case-knife with them sooner."", ""Well, then, what we going to do, Tom?"", ""I'll tell you., It ain't right, and it ain't moral, and I wouldn't like it to get out; but there ain't only just the one way:  we got to dig him out with the picks, and LET ON it's case-knives."", ""NOW you're TALKING!"", I says; ""your head gets leveler and leveler all the time, Tom Sawyer,"" I says., ""Picks is the thing, moral or no moral; and as for me, I don't care shucks for the morality of it, nohow., When I start in to steal a nigger, or a watermelon, or a Sunday-school book, I ain't no ways particular how it's done so it's done., What I want is my nigger; or what I want is my watermelon; or what I want is my Sunday-school book; and if a pick's the handiest thing, that's the thing I'm a-going to dig that nigger or that watermelon or that Sunday-school book out with; and I don't give a dead rat what the authorities thinks about it nuther."", ""Well,"" he says, ""there's excuse for picks and letting-on in a case like this; if it warn't so, I wouldn't approve of it, nor I wouldn't stand by and see the rules broke--because right is right, and wrong is wrong, and a body ain't got no business doing wrong when he ain't ignorant and knows better., It might answer for YOU to dig Jim out with a pick, WITHOUT any letting on, because you don't know no better; but it wouldn't for me, because I do know better., Gimme a case-knife."", He had his own by him, but I handed him mine., He flung it down, and says:  ""Gimme a CASE-KNIFE."", I didn't know just what to do--but then I thought., I scratched around amongst the old tools, and got a pickaxe and give it to him, and he took it and went to work, and never said a word., He was always just that particular., Full of principle., So then I got a shovel, and then we picked and shoveled, turn about, and made the fur fly., We stuck to it about a half an hour, which was as long as we could stand up; but we had a good deal of a hole to show for it., When I got up stairs I looked out at the window and see Tom doing his level best with the lightning-rod, but he couldn't come it, his hands was so sore., At last he says:  ""It ain't no use, it can't be done., What you reckon I better do?, Can't you think of no way?"", ""Yes,"" I says, ""but I reckon it ain't regular., Come up the stairs, and let on it's a lightning-rod."", So he done it., Next day Tom stole a pewter spoon and a brass candlestick in the house, for to make some pens for Jim out of, and six tallow candles; and I hung around the nigger cabins and laid for a chance, and stole three tin plates., Tom says it wasn't enough; but I said nobody wouldn't ever see the plates that Jim throwed out, because they'd fall in the dog-fennel and jimpson weeds under the window-hole--then we could tote them back and he could use them over again., So Tom was satisfied., ...]"|1
45|"[The king said:  ""Be merciful, fair sir, and essay no further in this perilous matter, lest disaster follow., It was reported to us that your powers could not attain unto their full strength until the morrow; but--""  ""Your Majesty thinks the report may have been a lie?, It _was_ a lie."", That made an immense effect; up went appealing hands everywhere, and the king was assailed with a storm of supplications that I might be bought off at any price, and the calamity stayed., The king was eager to comply., He said:  ""Name any terms, reverend sir, even to the halving of my kingdom; but banish this calamity, spare the sun!"", My fortune was made., I would have taken him up in a minute, but I couldn't stop an eclipse; the thing was out of the question., So I asked time to consider., The king said:  ""How long--ah, how long, good sir?, Be merciful; look, it groweth darker, moment by moment., Prithee how long?"", ""Not long., Half an hour--maybe an hour."", There were a thousand pathetic protests, but I couldn't shorten up any, for I couldn't remember how long a total eclipse lasts., I was in a puzzled condition, anyway, and wanted to think., Something was wrong about that eclipse, and the fact was very unsettling., If this wasn't the one I was after, how was I to tell whether this was the sixth century, or nothing but a dream?, Dear me, if I could only prove it was the latter!, Here was a glad new hope., If the boy was right about the date, and this was surely the 20th, it _wasn't_ the sixth century., I reached for the monk's sleeve, in considerable excitement, and asked him what day of the month it was., Hang him, he said it was the _twenty-first_!, It made me turn cold to hear him., I begged him not to make any mistake about it; but he was sure; he knew it was the 21st., So, that feather-headed boy had botched things again!, The time of the day was right for the eclipse; I had seen that for myself, in the beginning, by the dial that was near by., Yes, I was in King Arthur's court, and I might as well make the most out of it I could., The darkness was steadily growing, the people becoming more and more distressed., I now said:  ""I have reflected, Sir King., For a lesson, I will let this darkness proceed, and spread night in the world; but whether I blot out the sun for good, or restore it, shall rest with you., These are the terms, to wit: You shall remain king over all your dominions, and receive all the glories and honors that belong to the kingship; but you shall appoint me your perpetual minister and executive, and give me for my services one per cent of such actual increase of revenue over and above its present amount as I may succeed in creating for the state., If I can't live on that, I sha'n't ask anybody to give me a lift., Is it satisfactory?"", There was a prodigious roar of applause, and out of the midst of it the king's voice rose, saying:  ""Away with his bonds, and set him free!, and do him homage, high and low, rich and poor, for he is become the king's right hand, is clothed with power and authority, and his seat is upon the highest step of the throne!, Now sweep away this creeping night, and bring the light and cheer again, that all the world may bless thee."", But I said:  ""That a common man should be shamed before the world, is nothing; but it were dishonor to the _king_ if any that saw his minister naked should not also see him delivered from his shame., If I might ask that my clothes be brought again--""  ""They are not meet,"" the king broke in., ""Fetch raiment of another sort; clothe him like a prince!"", My idea worked., I wanted to keep things as they were till the eclipse was total, otherwise they would be trying again to get me to dismiss the darkness, and of course I couldn't do it., Sending for the clothes gained some delay, but not enough., So I had to make another excuse., I said it would be but natural if the king should change his mind and repent to some extent of what he had done under excitement; therefore I would let the darkness grow a while, and if at the end of a reasonable time the king had kept his mind the same, the darkness should be dismissed., Neither the king nor anybody else was satisfied with that arrangement, but I had to stick to my point., It grew darker and darker and blacker and blacker, while I struggled with those awkward sixth-century clothes., It got to be pitch dark, at last, and the multitude groaned with horror to feel the cold uncanny night breezes fan through the place and see the stars come out and twinkle in the sky., At last the eclipse was total, and I was very glad of it, but everybody else was in misery; which was quite natural., I said:  ""The king, by his silence, still stands to the terms."", Then I lifted up my hands--stood just so a moment--then I said, with the most awful solemnity: ""Let the enchantment dissolve and pass harmless away!"", There was no response, for a moment, in that deep darkness and that graveyard hush., But when the silver rim of the sun pushed itself out, a moment or two later, the assemblage broke loose with a vast shout and came pouring down like a deluge to smother me with blessings and gratitude; and Clarence was not the last of the wash, to be sure., Inasmuch as I was now the second personage in the Kingdom, as far as political power and authority were concerned, much was made of me., My raiment was of silks and velvets and cloth of gold, and by consequence was very showy, also uncomfortable., But habit would soon reconcile me to my clothes; I was aware of that., I was given the choicest suite of apartments in the castle, after the king's., They were aglow with loud-colored silken hangings, but the stone floors had nothing but rushes on them for a carpet, and they were misfit rushes at that, being not all of one breed., As for conveniences, properly speaking, there weren't any., I mean _little_ conveniences; it is the little conveniences that make the real comfort of life., The big oaken chairs, graced with rude carvings, were well enough, but that was the stopping place., There was no soap, no matches, no looking-glass--except a metal one, about as powerful as a pail of water., And not a chromo., I had been used to chromos for years, and I saw now that without my suspecting it a passion for art had got worked into the fabric of my being, and was become a part of me., It made me homesick to look around over this proud and gaudy but heartless barrenness and remember that in our house in East Hartford, all unpretending as it was, you couldn't go into a room but you would find an insurance-chromo, or at least a three-color God-Bless-Our-Home over the door; and in the parlor we had nine., But here, even in my grand room of state, there wasn't anything in the nature of a picture except a thing the size of a bedquilt, which was either woven or knitted (it had darned places in it), and nothing in it was the right color or the right shape; and as for proportions, even Raphael himself couldn't have botched them more formidably, after all his practice on those nightmares they call his ""celebrated Hampton Court cartoons."", Raphael was a bird., We had several of his chromos; one was his ""Miraculous Draught of Fishes,"" where he puts in a miracle of his own--puts three men into a canoe which wouldn't have held a dog without upsetting., I always admired to study R.'s art, it was so fresh and unconventional., There wasn't even a bell or a speaking-tube in the castle., I had a great many servants, and those that were on duty lolled in the anteroom; and when I wanted one of them I had to go and call for him., There was no gas, there were no candles; a bronze dish half full of boarding-house butter with a blazing rag floating in it was the thing that produced what was regarded as light., A lot of these hung along the walls and modified the dark, just toned it down enough to make it dismal., If you went out at night, your servants carried torches., There were no books, pens, paper or ink, and no glass in the openings they believed to be windows., It is a little thing--glass is--until it is absent, then it becomes a big thing., But perhaps the worst of all was, that there wasn't any sugar, coffee, tea, or tobacco., I saw that I was just another Robinson Crusoe cast away on an uninhabited island, with no society but some more or less tame animals, and if I wanted to make life bearable I must do as he did--invent, contrive, create, reorganize things; set brain and hand to work, and keep them busy., Well, that was in my line., One thing troubled me along at first--the immense interest which people took in me., Apparently the whole nation wanted a look at me., It soon transpired that the eclipse had scared the British world almost to death; that while it lasted the whole country, from one end to the other, was in a pitiable state of panic, and the churches, hermitages, and monkeries overflowed with praying and weeping poor creatures who thought the end of the world was come., Then had followed the news that the producer of this awful event was a stranger, a mighty magician at Arthur's court; that he could have blown out the sun like a candle, and was just going to do it when his mercy was purchased, and he then dissolved his enchantments, and was now recognized and honored as the man who had by his unaided might saved the globe from destruction and its peoples from extinction., Now if you consider that everybody believed that, and not only believed it, but never even dreamed of doubting it, you will easily understand that there was not a person in all Britain that would not have walked fifty miles to get a sight of me., Of course I was all the talk--all other subjects were dropped; even the king became suddenly a person of minor interest and notoriety., Within twenty-four hours the delegations began to arrive, and from that time onward for a fortnight they kept coming., The village was crowded, and all the countryside., I had to go out a dozen times a day and show myself to these reverent and awe-stricken multitudes., It came to be a great burden, as to time and trouble, but of course it was at the same time compensatingly agreeable to be so celebrated and such a center of homage., It turned Brer Merlin green with envy and spite, which was a great satisfaction to me., But there was one thing I couldn't understand--nobody had asked for an autograph., I spoke to Clarence about it., By George!, I had to explain to him what it was., Then he said nobody in the country could read or write but a few dozen priests., Land!, think of that., There was another thing that troubled me a little., Those multitudes presently began to agitate for another miracle., That was natural., ...]"|1
46|"[Between six and nine we made ten miles, which was plenty for a horse carrying triple--man, woman, and armor; then we stopped for a long nooning under some trees by a limpid brook., Right so came by and by a knight riding; and as he drew near he made dolorous moan, and by the words of it I perceived that he was cursing and swearing; yet nevertheless was I glad of his coming, for that I saw he bore a bulletin-board whereon in letters all of shining gold was writ:      ""USE PETERSON'S PROPHYLACTIC TOOTH-BRUSH--ALL THE GO."", I was glad of his coming, for even by this token I knew him for knight of mine., It was Sir Madok de la Montaine, a burly great fellow whose chief distinction was that he had come within an ace of sending Sir Launcelot down over his horse-tail once., He was never long in a stranger's presence without finding some pretext or other to let out that great fact., But there was another fact of nearly the same size, which he never pushed upon anybody unasked, and yet never withheld when asked: that was, that the reason he didn't quite succeed was, that he was interrupted and sent down over horse-tail himself., This innocent vast lubber did not see any particular difference between the two facts., I liked him, for he was earnest in his work, and very valuable., And he was so fine to look at, with his broad mailed shoulders, and the grand leonine set of his plumed head, and his big shield with its quaint device of a gauntleted hand clutching a prophylactic tooth-brush, with motto: ""Try Noyoudont."", This was a tooth-wash that I was introducing., He was aweary, he said, and indeed he looked it; but he would not alight., He said he was after the stove-polish man; and with this he broke out cursing and swearing anew., The bulletin-boarder referred to was Sir Ossaise of Surluse, a brave knight, and of considerable celebrity on account of his having tried conclusions in a tournament once, with no less a Mogul than Sir Gaheris himself--although not successfully., He was of a light and laughing disposition, and to him nothing in this world was serious., It was for this reason that I had chosen him to work up a stove-polish sentiment., There were no stoves yet, and so there could be nothing serious about stove-polish., All that the agent needed to do was to deftly and by degrees prepare the public for the great change, and have them established in predilections toward neatness against the time when the stove should appear upon the stage., Sir Madok was very bitter, and brake out anew with cursings., He said he had cursed his soul to rags; and yet he would not get down from his horse, neither would he take any rest, or listen to any comfort, until he should have found Sir Ossaise and settled this account., It appeared, by what I could piece together of the unprofane fragments of his statement, that he had chanced upon Sir Ossaise at dawn of the morning, and been told that if he would make a short cut across the fields and swamps and broken hills and glades, he could head off a company of travelers who would be rare customers for prophylactics and tooth-wash.  With characteristic zeal Sir Madok had plunged away at once upon this quest, and after three hours of awful crosslot riding had overhauled his game., And behold, it was the five patriarchs that had been released from the dungeons the evening before!, Poor old creatures, it was all of twenty years since any one of them had known what it was to be equipped with any remaining snag or remnant of a tooth., ""Blank-blank-blank him,"" said Sir Madok, ""an I do not stove-polish him an I may find him, leave it to me; for never no knight that hight Ossaise or aught else may do me this disservice and bide on live, an I may find him, the which I have thereunto sworn a great oath this day."", And with these words and others, he lightly took his spear and gat him thence., In the middle of the afternoon we came upon one of those very patriarchs ourselves, in the edge of a poor village., He was basking in the love of relatives and friends whom he had not seen for fifty years; and about him and caressing him were also descendants of his own body whom he had never seen at all till now; but to him these were all strangers, his memory was gone, his mind was stagnant., It seemed incredible that a man could outlast half a century shut up in a dark hole like a rat, but here were his old wife and some old comrades to testify to it., They could remember him as he was in the freshness and strength of his young manhood, when he kissed his child and delivered it to its mother's hands and went away into that long oblivion., The people at the castle could not tell within half a generation the length of time the man had been shut up there for his unrecorded and forgotten offense; but this old wife knew; and so did her old child, who stood there among her married sons and daughters trying to realize a father who had been to her a name, a thought, a formless image, a tradition, all her life, and now was suddenly concreted into actual flesh and blood and set before her face., It was a curious situation; yet it is not on that account that I have made room for it here, but on account of a thing which seemed to me still more curious., To wit, that this dreadful matter brought from these downtrodden people no outburst of rage against these oppressors., They had been heritors and subjects of cruelty and outrage so long that nothing could have startled them but a kindness., Yes, here was a curious revelation, indeed, of the depth to which this people had been sunk in slavery., Their entire being was reduced to a monotonous dead level of patience, resignation, dumb uncomplaining acceptance of whatever might befall them in this life., Their very imagination was dead., When you can say that of a man, he has struck bottom, I reckon; there is no lower deep for him., I rather wished I had gone some other road., This was not the sort of experience for a statesman to encounter who was planning out a peaceful revolution in his mind., For it could not help bringing up the unget-aroundable fact that, all gentle cant and philosophizing to the contrary notwithstanding, no people in the world ever did achieve their freedom by goody-goody talk and moral suasion: it being immutable law that all revolutions that will succeed must _begin_ in blood, whatever may answer afterward., If history teaches anything, it teaches that., What this folk needed, then, was a Reign of Terror and a guillotine, and I was the wrong man for them., Two days later, toward noon, Sandy began to show signs of excitement and feverish expectancy., She said we were approaching the ogre's castle., I was surprised into an uncomfortable shock., The object of our quest had gradually dropped out of my mind; this sudden resurrection of it made it seem quite a real and startling thing for a moment, and roused up in me a smart interest., Sandy's excitement increased every moment; and so did mine, for that sort of thing is catching., My heart got to thumping., You can't reason with your heart; it has its own laws, and thumps about things which the intellect scorns., Presently, when Sandy slid from the horse, motioned me to stop, and went creeping stealthily, with her head bent nearly to her knees, toward a row of bushes that bordered a declivity, the thumpings grew stronger and quicker., And they kept it up while she was gaining her ambush and getting her glimpse over the declivity; and also while I was creeping to her side on my knees., Her eyes were burning now, as she pointed with her finger, and said in a panting whisper:  ""The castle!, The castle!, Lo, where it looms!"", What a welcome disappointment I experienced!, I said:  ""Castle?, It is nothing but a pigsty; a pigsty with a wattled fence around it."", She looked surprised and distressed., The animation faded out of her face; and during many moments she was lost in thought and silent., Then:  ""It was not enchanted aforetime,"" she said in a musing fashion, as if to herself., ""And how strange is this marvel, and how awful --that to the one perception it is enchanted and dight in a base and shameful aspect; yet to the perception of the other it is not enchanted, hath suffered no change, but stands firm and stately still, girt with its moat and waving its banners in the blue air from its towers., And God shield us, how it pricks the heart to see again these gracious captives, and the sorrow deepened in their sweet faces!, We have tarried along, and are to blame."", I saw my cue., The castle was enchanted to _me_, not to her., It would be wasted time to try to argue her out of her delusion, it couldn't be done; I must just humor it., So I said:  ""This is a common case--the enchanting of a thing to one eye and leaving it in its proper form to another., You have heard of it before, Sandy, though you haven't happened to experience it., But no harm is done., In fact, it is lucky the way it is., If these ladies were hogs to everybody and to themselves, it would be necessary to break the enchantment, and that might be impossible if one failed to find out the particular process of the enchantment., And hazardous, too; for in attempting a disenchantment without the true key, you are liable to err, and turn your hogs into dogs, and the dogs into cats, the cats into rats, and so on, and end by reducing your materials to nothing finally, or to an odorless gas which you can't follow--which, of course, amounts to the same thing., But here, by good luck, no one's eyes but mine are under the enchantment, and so it is of no consequence to dissolve it., These ladies remain ladies to you, and to themselves, and to everybody else; and at the same time they will suffer in no way from my delusion, for when I know that an ostensible hog is a lady, that is enough for me, I know how to treat her."", ""Thanks, oh, sweet my lord, thou talkest like an angel., And I know that thou wilt deliver them, for that thou art minded to great deeds and art as strong a knight of your hands and as brave to will and to do, as any that is on live."", ""I will not leave a princess in the sty, Sandy., Are those three yonder that to my disordered eyes are starveling swine-herds--""  ""The ogres, Are _they_ changed also?, It is most wonderful., Now am I fearful; for how canst thou strike with sure aim when five of their nine cubits of stature are to thee invisible?, Ah, go warily, fair sir; this is a mightier emprise than I wend."", ""You be easy, Sandy., All I need to know is, how _much_ of an ogre is invisible; then I know how to locate his vitals., Don't you be afraid, I will make short work of these bunco-steerers., Stay where you are."", I left Sandy kneeling there, corpse-faced but plucky and hopeful, and rode down to the pigsty, and struck up a trade with the swine-herds., I won their gratitude by buying out all the hogs at the lump sum of sixteen pennies, which was rather above latest quotations., I was just in time; for the Church, the lord of the manor, and the rest of the tax-gatherers would have been along next day and swept off pretty much all the stock, leaving the swine-herds very short of hogs and Sandy out of princesses., But now the tax people could be paid in cash, and there would be a stake left besides., One of the men had ten children; and he said that last year when a priest came and of his ten pigs took the fattest one for tithes, the wife burst out upon him, and offered him a child and said:  ""Thou beast without bowels of mercy, why leave me my child, yet rob me of the wherewithal to feed it?"", How curious., The same thing had happened in the Wales of my day, under this same old Established Church, which was supposed by many to have changed its nature when it changed its disguise., I sent the three men away, and then opened the sty gate and beckoned Sandy to come--which she did; and not leisurely, but with the rush of a prairie fire., And when I saw her fling herself upon those hogs, with tears of joy running down her cheeks, and strain them to her heart, and kiss them, and caress them, and call them reverently by grand princely names, I was ashamed of her, ashamed of the human race., We had to drive those hogs home--ten miles; and no ladies were ever more fickle-minded or contrary., They would stay in no road, no path; they broke out through the brush on all sides, and flowed away in all directions, over rocks, and hills, and the roughest places they could find., And they must not be struck, or roughly accosted; Sandy could not bear to see them treated in ways unbecoming their rank., The troublesomest old sow of the lot had to be called my Lady, and your Highness, like the rest., It is annoying and difficult to scour around after hogs, in armor., There was one small countess, with an iron ring in her snout and hardly any hair on her back, that was the devil for perversity., She gave me a race of an hour, over all sorts of country, and then we were right where we had started from, having made not a rod of real progress., ...]"|1
47|"[""Pretty fair--pretty fair., Chin a little lower, please--there, very good., Eyes too high; pray don't look at the horizon, look at the ground, ten steps in front of you., Ah--that is better, that is very good., Wait, please; you betray too much vigor, too much decision; you want more of a shamble., Look at me, please--this is what I mean....  Now you are getting it; that is the idea--at least, it sort of approaches it...., Yes, that is pretty fair., _But!_ There is a great big something wanting, I don't quite know what it is., Please walk thirty yards, so that I can get a perspective on the thing....

Nay, but me no buts, offer me no objections., I will have the thing., Strap it upon my back."", He was complete now with that knapsack on, and looked as little like a king as any man I had ever seen., But it was an obstinate pair of shoulders; they could not seem to learn the trick of stooping with any sort of deceptive naturalness., The drill went on, I prompting and correcting:  ""Now, make believe you are in debt, and eaten up by relentless creditors; you are out of work--which is horse-shoeing, let us say--and can get none; and your wife is sick, your children are crying because they are hungry--""  And so on, and so on., I drilled him as representing in turn all sorts of people out of luck and suffering dire privations and misfortunes., But lord, it was only just words, words--they meant nothing in the world to him, I might just as well have whistled., Words realize nothing, vivify nothing to you, unless you have suffered in your own person the thing which the words try to describe., There are wise people who talk ever so knowingly and complacently about ""the working classes,"" and satisfy themselves that a day's hard intellectual work is very much harder than a day's hard manual toil, and is righteously entitled to much bigger pay., Why, they really think that, you know, because they know all about the one, but haven't tried the other., But I know all about both; and so far as I am concerned, there isn't money enough in the universe to hire me to swing a pickaxe thirty days, but I will do the hardest kind of intellectual work for just as near nothing as you can cipher it down--and I will be satisfied, too., Intellectual ""work"" is misnamed; it is a pleasure, a dissipation, and is its own highest reward., The poorest paid architect, engineer, general, author, sculptor, painter, lecturer, advocate, legislator, actor, preacher, singer is constructively in heaven when he is at work; and as for the musician with the fiddle-bow in his hand who sits in the midst of a great orchestra with the ebbing and flowing tides of divine sound washing over him--why, certainly, he is at work, if you wish to call it that, but lord, it's a sarcasm just the same., The law of work does seem utterly unfair--but there it is, and nothing can change it: the higher the pay in enjoyment the worker gets out of it, the higher shall be his pay in cash, also., And it's also the very law of those transparent swindles, transmissible nobility and kingship., When we arrived at that hut at mid-afternoon, we saw no signs of life about it., The field near by had been denuded of its crop some time before, and had a skinned look, so exhaustively had it been harvested and gleaned., Fences, sheds, everything had a ruined look, and were eloquent of poverty., No animal was around anywhere, no living thing in sight., The stillness was awful, it was like the stillness of death., The cabin was a one-story one, whose thatch was black with age, and ragged from lack of repair., The door stood a trifle ajar., We approached it stealthily--on tiptoe and at half-breath--for that is the way one's feeling makes him do, at such a time., The king knocked., We waited., No answer., Knocked again., No answer., I pushed the door softly open and looked in., I made out some dim forms, and a woman started up from the ground and stared at me, as one does who is wakened from sleep., Presently she found her voice:  ""Have mercy!"", she pleaded., ""All is taken, nothing is left."", ""I have not come to take anything, poor woman."", ""You are not a priest?"", ""No."", ""Nor come not from the lord of the manor?"", ""No, I am a stranger."", ""Oh, then, for the fear of God, who visits with misery and death such as be harmless, tarry not here, but fly!, This place is under his curse--and his Church's."", ""Let me come in and help you--you are sick and in trouble."", I was better used to the dim light now., ...]"|1
48|"[So he gave up at last, and left the king in possession of his style unimpaired., The fact is, the king was a good deal more than a king, he was a man; and when a man is a man, you can't knock it out of him., We had a rough time for a month, tramping to and fro in the earth, and suffering., And what Englishman was the most interested in the slavery question by that time?, His grace the king!, Yes; from being the most indifferent, he was become the most interested., He was become the bitterest hater of the institution I had ever heard talk., And so I ventured to ask once more a question which I had asked years before and had gotten such a sharp answer that I had not thought it prudent to meddle in the matter further., Would he abolish slavery?, His answer was as sharp as before, but it was music this time; I shouldn't ever wish to hear pleasanter, though the profanity was not good, being awkwardly put together, and with the crash-word almost in the middle instead of at the end, where, of course, it ought to have been., I was ready and willing to get free now; I hadn't wanted to get free any sooner., No, I cannot quite say that., I had wanted to, but I had not been willing to take desperate chances, and had always dissuaded the king from them., But now--ah, it was a new atmosphere!, Liberty would be worth any cost that might be put upon it now., I set about a plan, and was straightway charmed with it., It would require time, yes, and patience, too, a great deal of both., One could invent quicker ways, and fully as sure ones; but none that would be as picturesque as this; none that could be made so dramatic., And so I was not going to give this one up., It might delay us months, but no matter, I would carry it out or break something., Now and then we had an adventure., One night we were overtaken by a snow-storm while still a mile from the village we were making for., Almost instantly we were shut up as in a fog, the driving snow was so thick., You couldn't see a thing, and we were soon lost., The slave-driver lashed us desperately, for he saw ruin before him, but his lashings only made matters worse, for they drove us further from the road and from likelihood of succor., So we had to stop at last and slump down in the snow where we were., The storm continued until toward midnight, then ceased., By this time two of our feebler men and three of our women were dead, and others past moving and threatened with death., Our master was nearly beside himself., He stirred up the living, and made us stand, jump, slap ourselves, to restore our circulation, and he helped as well as he could with his whip., Now came a diversion., We heard shrieks and yells, and soon a woman came running and crying; and seeing our group, she flung herself into our midst and begged for protection., A mob of people came tearing after her, some with torches, and they said she was a witch who had caused several cows to die by a strange disease, and practiced her arts by help of a devil in the form of a black cat., This poor woman had been stoned until she hardly looked human, she was so battered and bloody., The mob wanted to burn her., Well, now, what do you suppose our master did?, When we closed around this poor creature to shelter her, he saw his chance., He said, burn her here, or they shouldn't have her at all., Imagine that!, They were willing., They fastened her to a post; they brought wood and piled it about her; they applied the torch while she shrieked and pleaded and strained her two young daughters to her breast; and our brute, with a heart solely for business, lashed us into position about the stake and warmed us into life and commercial value by the same fire which took away the innocent life of that poor harmless mother., That was the sort of master we had., I took _his_ number., That snow-storm cost him nine of his flock; and he was more brutal to us than ever, after that, for many days together, he was so enraged over his loss., We had adventures all along., One day we ran into a procession., And such a procession!, All the riffraff of the kingdom seemed to be comprehended in it; and all drunk at that., In the van was a cart with a coffin in it, and on the coffin sat a comely young girl of about eighteen suckling a baby, which she squeezed to her breast in a passion of love every little while, and every little while wiped from its face the tears which her eyes rained down upon it; and always the foolish little thing smiled up at her, happy and content, kneading her breast with its dimpled fat hand, which she patted and fondled right over her breaking heart., Men and women, boys and girls, trotted along beside or after the cart, hooting, shouting profane and ribald remarks, singing snatches of foul song, skipping, dancing--a very holiday of hellions, a sickening sight., We had struck a suburb of London, outside the walls, and this was a sample of one sort of London society., Our master secured a good place for us near the gallows., A priest was in attendance, and he helped the girl climb up, and said comforting words to her, and made the under-sheriff provide a stool for her., Then he stood there by her on the gallows, and for a moment looked down upon the mass of upturned faces at his feet, then out over the solid pavement of heads that stretched away on every side occupying the vacancies far and near, and then began to tell the story of the case., And there was pity in his voice --how seldom a sound that was in that ignorant and savage land!, I remember every detail of what he said, except the words he said it in; and so I change it into my own words:  ""Law is intended to mete out justice., Sometimes it fails., This cannot be helped., We can only grieve, and be resigned, and pray for the soul of him who falls unfairly by the arm of the law, and that his fellows may be few., A law sends this poor young thing to death--and it is right., But another law had placed her where she must commit her crime or starve with her child--and before God that law is responsible for both her crime and her ignominious death!, ""A little while ago this young thing, this child of eighteen years, was as happy a wife and mother as any in England; and her lips were blithe with song, which is the native speech of glad and innocent hearts., Her young husband was as happy as she; for he was doing his whole duty, he worked early and late at his handicraft, his bread was honest bread well and fairly earned, he was prospering, he was furnishing shelter and sustenance to his family, he was adding his mite to the wealth of the nation., By consent of a treacherous law, instant destruction fell upon this holy home and swept it away!, That young husband was waylaid and impressed, and sent to sea., The wife knew nothing of it., She sought him everywhere, she moved the hardest hearts with the supplications of her tears, the broken eloquence of her despair., Weeks dragged by, she watching, waiting, hoping, her mind going slowly to wreck under the burden of her misery., Little by little all her small possessions went for food., When she could no longer pay her rent, they turned her out of doors., She begged, while she had strength; when she was starving at last, and her milk failing, she stole a piece of linen cloth of the value of a fourth part of a cent, thinking to sell it and save her child., But she was seen by the owner of the cloth., She was put in jail and brought to trial., The man testified to the facts., A plea was made for her, and her sorrowful story was told in her behalf., She spoke, too, by permission, and said she did steal the cloth, but that her mind was so disordered of late by trouble that when she was overborne with hunger all acts, criminal or other, swam meaningless through her brain and she knew nothing rightly, except that she was so hungry!, For a moment all were touched, and there was disposition to deal mercifully with her, seeing that she was so young and friendless, and her case so piteous, and the law that robbed her of her support to blame as being the first and only cause of her transgression; but the prosecuting officer replied that whereas these things were all true, and most pitiful as well, still there was much small theft in these days, and mistimed mercy here would be a danger to property--oh, my God, is there no property in ruined homes, and orphaned babes, and broken hearts that British law holds precious!--and so he must require sentence., ""When the judge put on his black cap, the owner of the stolen linen rose trembling up, his lip quivering, his face as gray as ashes; and when the awful words came, he cried out, 'Oh, poor child, poor child, I did not know it was death!', and fell as a tree falls., When they lifted him up his reason was gone; before the sun was set, he had taken his own life., A kindly man; a man whose heart was right, at bottom; add his murder to this that is to be now done here; and charge them both where they belong --to the rulers and the bitter laws of Britain., The time is come, my child; let me pray over thee--not _for_ thee, dear abused poor heart and innocent, but for them that be guilty of thy ruin and death, who need it more."", After his prayer they put the noose around the young girl's neck, and they had great trouble to adjust the knot under her ear, because she was devouring the baby all the time, wildly kissing it, and snatching it to her face and her breast, and drenching it with tears, and half moaning, half shrieking all the while, and the baby crowing, and laughing, and kicking its feet with delight over what it took for romp and play., Even the hangman couldn't stand it, but turned away., When all was ready the priest gently pulled and tugged and forced the child out of the mother's arms, and stepped quickly out of her reach; but she clasped her hands, and made a wild spring toward him, with a shriek; but the rope--and the under-sheriff--held her short., Then she went on her knees and stretched out her hands and cried:  ""One more kiss--oh, my God, one more, one more,--it is the dying that begs it!"", She got it; she almost smothered the little thing., And when they got it away again, she cried out:  ""Oh, my child, my darling, it will die!, It has no home, it has no father, no friend, no mother--""  ""It has them all!"", said that good priest., ""All these will I be to it till I die."", You should have seen her face then!, Gratitude?, Lord, what do you want with words to express that?, Words are only painted fire; a look is the fire itself., She gave that look, and carried it away to the treasury of heaven, where all things that are divine belong., London--to a slave--was a sufficiently interesting place., It was merely a great big village; and mainly mud and thatch., The streets were muddy, crooked, unpaved., The populace was an ever flocking and drifting swarm of rags, and splendors, of nodding plumes and shining armor., ...]"|1
49|"[Land, what a sight!, We were enclosed in three walls of dead men!, All the other fences were pretty nearly filled with the living, who were stealthily working their way forward through the wires., The sudden glare paralyzed this host, petrified them, you may say, with astonishment; there was just one instant for me to utilize their immobility in, and I didn't lose the chance., You see, in another instant they would have recovered their faculties, then they'd have burst into a cheer and made a rush, and my wires would have gone down before it; but that lost instant lost them their opportunity forever; while even that slight fragment of time was still unspent, I shot the current through all the fences and struck the whole host dead in their tracks!, _There_ was a groan you could _hear_!, It voiced the death-pang of eleven thousand men., It swelled out on the night with awful pathos., A glance showed that the rest of the enemy--perhaps ten thousand strong--were between us and the encircling ditch, and pressing forward to the assault., Consequently we had them _all!_ and had them past help., Time for the last act of the tragedy., I fired the three appointed revolver shots--which meant:  ""Turn on the water!"", There was a sudden rush and roar, and in a minute the mountain brook was raging through the big ditch and creating a river a hundred feet wide and twenty-five deep., ""Stand to your guns, men!, Open fire!"", The thirteen gatlings began to vomit death into the fated ten thousand., They halted, they stood their ground a moment against that withering deluge of fire, then they broke, faced about and swept toward the ditch like chaff before a gale., A full fourth part of their force never reached the top of the lofty embankment; the three-fourths reached it and plunged over--to death by drowning., Within ten short minutes after we had opened fire, armed resistance was totally annihilated, the campaign was ended, we fifty-four were masters of England., Twenty-five thousand men lay dead around us., But how treacherous is fortune!, In a little while--say an hour --happened a thing, by my own fault, which--but I have no heart to write that., Let the record end here., I, Clarence, must write it for him., He proposed that we two go out and see if any help could be accorded the wounded., I was strenuous against the project., I said that if there were many, we could do but little for them; and it would not be wise for us to trust ourselves among them, anyway., But he could seldom be turned from a purpose once formed; so we shut off the electric current from the fences, took an escort along, climbed over the enclosing ramparts of dead knights, and moved out upon the field., The first wounded mall who appealed for help was sitting with his back against a dead comrade., When The Boss bent over him and spoke to him, the man recognized him and stabbed him., That knight was Sir Meliagraunce, as I found out by tearing off his helmet., He will not ask for help any more., We carried The Boss to the cave and gave his wound, which was not very serious, the best care we could., In this service we had the help of Merlin, though we did not know it., He was disguised as a woman, and appeared to be a simple old peasant goodwife., In this disguise, with brown-stained face and smooth shaven, he had appeared a few days after The Boss was hurt and offered to cook for us, saying her people had gone off to join certain new camps which the enemy were forming, and that she was starving., The Boss had been getting along very well, and had amused himself with finishing up his record., We were glad to have this woman, for we were short handed., We were in a trap, you see--a trap of our own making., If we stayed where we were, our dead would kill us; if we moved out of our defenses, we should no longer be invincible., We had conquered; in turn we were conquered., The Boss recognized this; we all recognized it., If we could go to one of those new camps and patch up some kind of terms with the enemy--yes, but The Boss could not go, and neither could I, for I was among the first that were made sick by the poisonous air bred by those dead thousands., Others were taken down, and still others., To-morrow--  _To-morrow._  It is here., And with it the end., About midnight I awoke, and saw that hag making curious passes in the air about The Boss's head and face, and wondered what it meant., Everybody but the dynamo-watch lay steeped in sleep; there was no sound., The woman ceased from her mysterious foolery, and started tip-toeing toward the door., I called out:  ""Stop!, What have you been doing?"", She halted, and said with an accent of malicious satisfaction:  ""Ye were conquerors; ye are conquered!, These others are perishing --you also., Ye shall all die in this place--every one--except _him_., He sleepeth now--and shall sleep thirteen centuries., I am Merlin!"", Then such a delirium of silly laughter overtook him that he reeled about like a drunken man, and presently fetched up against one of our wires., His mouth is spread open yet; apparently he is still laughing., I suppose the face will retain that petrified laugh until the corpse turns to dust., The Boss has never stirred--sleeps like a stone., If he does not wake to-day we shall understand what kind of a sleep it is, and his body will then be borne to a place in one of the remote recesses of the cave where none will ever find it to desecrate it., As for the rest of us--well, it is agreed that if any one of us ever escapes alive from this place, he will write the fact here, and loyally hide this Manuscript with The Boss, our dear good chief, whose property it is, be he alive or dead., The dawn was come when I laid the Manuscript aside., The rain had almost ceased, the world was gray and sad, the exhausted storm was sighing and sobbing itself to rest., I went to the stranger's room, and listened at his door, which was slightly ajar., I could hear his voice, and so I knocked., There was no answer, but I still heard the voice., I peeped in., The man lay on his back in bed, talking brokenly but with spirit, and punctuating with his arms, which he thrashed about, restlessly, as sick people do in delirium., I slipped in softly and bent over him., His mutterings and ejaculations went on., I spoke--merely a word, to call his attention., His glassy eyes and his ashy face were alight in an instant with pleasure, gratitude, gladness, welcome:  ""Oh, Sandy, you are come at last--how I have longed for you!, Sit by me--do not leave me--never leave me again, Sandy, never again., Where is your hand?--give it me, dear, let me hold it--there --now all is well, all is peace, and I am happy again--_we_ are happy again, isn't it so, Sandy?, You are so dim, so vague, you are but a mist, a cloud, but you are _here_, and that is blessedness sufficient; and I have your hand; don't take it away--it is for only a little while, I shall not require it long....  Was that the child?..., Hello-Central!..., she doesn't answer., Asleep, perhaps?, Bring her when she wakes, and let me touch her hands, her face, her hair, and tell her good-bye....  Sandy!, Yes, you are there., I lost myself a moment, and I thought you were gone....  Have I been sick long?, It must be so; it seems months to me., And such dreams!, such strange and awful dreams, Sandy!, Dreams that were as real as reality--delirium, of course, but _so_ real!, Why, I thought the king was dead, I thought you were in Gaul and couldn't get home, I thought there was a revolution; in the fantastic frenzy of these dreams, I thought that Clarence and I and a handful of my cadets fought and exterminated the whole chivalry of England!, But even that was not the strangest., I seemed to be a creature out of a remote unborn age, centuries hence, and even _that_ was as real as the rest!, Yes, I seemed to have flown back out of that age into this of ours, and then forward to it again, and was set down, a stranger and forlorn in that strange England, with an abyss of thirteen centuries yawning between me and you!, between me and my home and my friends!, between me and all that is dear to me, all that could make life worth the living!, It was awful --awfuler than you can ever imagine, Sandy., Ah, watch by me, Sandy --stay by me every moment--_don't_ let me go out of my mind again; death is nothing, let it come, but not with those dreams, not with the torture of those hideous dreams--I cannot endure _that_ again...., Sandy?..."", He lay muttering incoherently some little time; then for a time he lay silent, and apparently sinking away toward death., Presently his fingers began to pick busily at the coverlet, and by that sign I knew that his end was at hand with the first suggestion of the death-rattle in his throat he started up slightly, and seemed to listen: then he said:  ""A bugle?..., It is the king!, The drawbridge, there!, Man the battlements!--turn out the--""  He was getting up his last ""effect""; but he never finished it., ...]"|1

and if you'll believe me, he just set up the rest of the night--he did, honest., They say he's cracked, but it ain't so, he's English--they're awful particular., You won't mind my saying that., You--you're English?"", ""Yes."", ""I thought so., I could tell it by the way you mispronounce the words that's got a's in them, you know; such as saying loff when you mean laff --but you'll get over that., He's a right down good fellow, and a little sociable with the photographer's boy and the caulker and the blacksmith that work in the navy yard, but not so much with the others., The fact is, though it's private, and the others don't know it, he's a kind of an aristocrat, his father being a doctor, and you know what style that is-- in England, I mean, because in this country a doctor ain't so very much, even if he's that., But over there of course it's different., So this chap had a falling out with his father, and was pretty high strung, and just cut for this country, and the first he knew he had to get to work or starve., Well, he'd been to college, you see, and so he judged he was all right--did you say anything?"", ""No--I only sighed."", ""And there's where he was mistaken., Why, he mighty near starved., And I reckon he would have starved sure enough, if some jour' printer or other hadn't took pity on him and got him a place as apprentice., So he learnt the trade, and then he was all right--but it was a close call., Once he thought he had got to haul in his pride and holler for his father and-- why, you're sighing again., Is anything the matter with you?--does my clatter--""  ""Oh, dear--no., Pray go on--I like it."", ""Yes, you see, he's been over here ten years; he's twenty-eight, now, and he ain't pretty well satisfied in his mind, because he can't get reconciled to being a mechanic and associating with mechanics, he being, as he says to me, a gentleman, which is a pretty plain letting-on that the boys ain't, but of course I know enough not to let that cat out of the bag."", ""Why--would there be any harm in it?"", ""Harm in it?, They'd lick him, wouldn't they?, Wouldn't you?, Of course you would., Don't you ever let a man say you ain't a gentleman in this country., But laws, what am I thinking about?, I reckon a body would think twice before he said a cowboy wasn't a gentleman."", A trim, active, slender and very pretty girl of about eighteen walked into the room now, in the most satisfied and unembarrassed way., She was cheaply but smartly and gracefully dressed, and the mother's quick glance at the stranger's face as he rose, was of the kind which inquires what effect has been produced, and expects to find indications of surprise and admiration., ""This is my daughter Hattie--we call her Puss., It's the new boarder, Puss."", This without rising., The young Englishman made the awkward bow common to his nationality and time of life in circumstances of delicacy and difficulty, and these were of that sort; for, being taken by surprise, his natural, lifelong self sprang to the front, and that self of course would not know just how to act when introduced to a chambermaid, or to the heiress of a mechanics' boarding house., His other self--the self which recognized the equality of all men--would have managed the thing better, if it hadn't been caught off guard and robbed of its chance., The young girl paid no attention to the bow, but put out her hand frankly and gave the stranger a friendly shake and said:  ""How do you do?"", Then she marched to the one washstand in the room, tilted her head this way and that before the wreck of a cheap mirror that hung above it, dampened her fingers with her tongue, perfected the circle of a little lock of hair that was pasted against her forehead, then began to busy herself with the slops., ""Well, I must be going--it's getting towards supper time., Make yourself at home, Mr.  Tracy, you'll hear the bell when it's ready."", The landlady took her tranquil departure, without commanding either of the young people to vacate the room., The young man wondered a little that a mother who seemed so honest and respectable should be so thoughtless, and was reaching for his hat, intending to disembarrass the girl of his presence; but she said:  ""Where are you going?"", ""Well--nowhere in particular, but as I am only in the way here--""  ""Why, who said you were in the way?, Sit down--I'll move you when you are in the way."", She was making the beds, now., He sat down and watched her deft and diligent performance., ""What gave you that notion?, Do you reckon I need a whole room just to make up a bed or two in?"", ""Well no, it wasn't that, exactly., We are away up here in an empty house, and your mother being gone--""  The girl interrupted him with an amused laugh, and said:  ""Nobody to protect me?, Bless you, I don't need it., I'm not afraid., I might be if I was alone, because I do hate ghosts, and I don't deny it., Not that I believe in them, for I don't., I'm only just afraid of them."", ""How can you be afraid of them if you don't believe in them?"", ""Oh, I don't know the how of it--that's too many for me;

I feel it as deeply as anybody could., But we've got to submit--on moral grounds., I need money, but God knows I am not poor enough or shabby enough to be an accessory to the punishing of a man's ancestor for crimes committed by that ancestor's posterity."", ""But Colonel!"", implored Hawkins; ""stop and think; don't be rash; you know it's the only chance we've got to get the money; and besides, the Bible itself says posterity to the fourth generation shall be punished for the sins and crimes committed by ancestors four generations back that hadn't anything to do with them; and so it's only fair to turn the rule around and make it work both ways."", The Colonel was struck with the strong logic of this position., He strode up and down, and thought it painfully over., Finally he said:  ""There's reason in it; yes, there's reason in it., And so, although it seems a piteous thing to sweat this poor ancient devil for a burglary he hadn't the least hand in, still if duty commands I suppose we must give him up to the authorities."", ""I would,"" said Hawkins, cheered and relieved, ""I'd give him up if he was a thousand ancestors compacted into one."", ""Lord bless me, that's just what he is,"" said Sellers, with something like a groan, ""it's exactly what he is; there's a contribution in him from every ancestor he ever had., In him there's atoms of priests, soldiers, crusaders, poets, and sweet and gracious women--all kinds and conditions of folk who trod this earth in old, old centuries, and vanished out of it ages ago, and now by act of ours they are summoned from their holy peace to answer for gutting a one-horse bank away out on the borders of Cherokee Strip, and it's just a howling outrage!"", ""Oh, don't talk like that, Colonel; it takes the heart all out of me, and makes me ashamed of the part I am proposing to--""  ""Wait--I've got it!"", ""A saving hope?, Shout it out, I am perishing."", ""It's perfectly simple; a child would have thought of it., He is all right, not a flaw in him, as far as I have carried the work., If I've been able to bring him as far as the beginning of this century, what's to stop me now?, I'll go on and materialize him down to date."", ""Land, I never thought of that!"", said Hawkins all ablaze with joy again., ""It's the very thing., What a brain you have got!, And will he shed the superfluous arm?"", ""He will."", ""And lose his English accent?"", ""It will wholly disappear., He will speak Cherokee Strip--and other forms of profanity."", ""Colonel, maybe he'll confess!"", ""Confess?, Merely that bank robbery?"", ""Merely?, Yes, but why 'merely'?"", The Colonel said in his most impressive manner: ""Hawkins, he will be wholly under my command., I will make him confess every crime he ever committed., There must be a thousand., Do you get the idea?"", ""Well--not quite."", ""The rewards will come to us."", ""Prodigious conception!, I never saw such ahead for seeing with a lightning glance all the outlying ramifications and possibilities of a central idea."", ""It is nothing;

52|"[Which is a pity, on some accounts., Sunday  Pulled through., Monday  I believe I see what the week is for: it is to give time to rest up from the weariness of Sunday., It seems a good idea....  She has been climbing that tree again., Clodded her out of it., She said nobody was looking., Seems to consider that a sufficient justification for chancing any dangerous thing., Told her that., The word justification moved her admiration--and envy too, I thought., It is a good word., Thursday  She told me she was made out of a rib taken from my body., This is at least doubtful, if not more than that., I have not missed any rib....  She is in much trouble about the buzzard; says grass does not agree with it; is afraid she can't raise it; thinks it was intended to live on decayed flesh., The buzzard must get along the best it can with what is provided., We cannot overturn the whole scheme to accommodate the buzzard., Saturday  She fell in the pond yesterday, when she was looking at herself in it, which she is always doing., She nearly strangled, and said it was most uncomfortable., This made her sorry for the creatures which live in there, which she calls fish, for she continues to fasten names on to things that don't need them and don't come when they are called by them, which is a matter of no consequence to her, as she is such a numskull anyway; so she got a lot of them out and brought them in last night and put them in my bed to keep warm, but I have noticed them now and then all day, and I don't see that they are any happier there than they were before, only quieter., When night comes I shall throw them out-doors., I will not sleep with them again, for I find them clammy and unpleasant to lie among when a person hasn't anything on., Sunday  Pulled through., Tuesday  She has taken up with a snake now., The other animals are glad, for she was always experimenting with them and bothering them; and I am glad, because the snake talks, and this enables me to get a rest., Friday  She says the snake advises her to try the fruit of that tree, and says the result will be a great and fine and noble education., I told her there would be another result, too--it would introduce death into the world., That was a mistake--it had been better to keep the remark to myself; it only gave her an idea--she could save the sick buzzard, and furnish fresh meat to the despondent lions and tigers., I advised her to keep away from the tree., She said she wouldn't., I foresee trouble., Will emigrate., Wednesday  I have had a variegated time., I escaped that night, and rode a horse all night as fast as he could go, hoping to get clear out of the Park and hide in some other country before the trouble should begin; but it was not to be., About an hour after sunup, as I was riding through a flowery plain where thousands of animals were grazing, slumbering, or playing with each other, according to their wont, all of a sudden they broke into a tempest of frightful noises, and in one moment the plain was in a frantic commotion and every beast was destroying its neighbor., I knew what it meant--Eve had eaten that fruit, and death was come into the world...., The tigers ate my horse, paying no attention when I ordered them to desist,  and they would even have eaten me if I had stayed--which I didn't, but went away in much haste...., I found this place, outside the Park, and was fairly comfortable for a few days, but she has found me out., Found me out, and has named the place Tonawanda--says it looks like that., In fact, I was not sorry she came, for there are but meagre pickings here, and she brought some of those apples., I was obliged to eat them, I was so hungry., It was against my principles, but I find that principles have no real force except when one is well fed....  She came curtained in boughs and bunches of leaves, and when I asked her what she meant by such nonsense, and snatched them away and threw them down, she tittered and blushed., I had never seen a person titter and blush before, and to me it seemed unbecoming and idiotic., She said I would soon know how it was myself., This was correct., Hungry as I was, I laid down the apple half eaten--certainly the best one I ever saw, considering the lateness of the season--and arrayed myself in the discarded boughs and branches, and then spoke to her with some severity and ordered her to go and get some more and not make such a spectacle of herself., She did it, and after this we crept down to where the wild-beast battle had been, and collected some skins, and I made her patch together a couple of suits proper for public occasions., They are uncomfortable, it is true, but stylish, and that is the main point about clothes., ..., I find she is a good deal of a companion., I see I should be lonesome and depressed without her, now that I have lost my property., Another thing, she says it is ordered that we work for our living hereafter., She will be useful., I will superintend., Ten Days Later  She accuses me of being the cause of our disaster!, She says, with apparent sincerity and truth, that the Serpent assured her that the forbidden fruit was not apples, it was chestnuts., I said I was innocent, then, for I had not eaten any chestnuts., She said the Serpent informed her that ""chestnut"" was a figurative term meaning an aged and mouldy joke., I turned pale at that, for I have made many jokes to pass the weary time, and some of them could have been of that sort, though I had honestly supposed that they were new when I made them., She asked me if I had made one just at the time of the catastrophe., I was obliged to admit that I had made one to myself, though not aloud., It was this., I was thinking about the Falls, and I said to myself, ""How wonderful it is to see that vast body of water tumble down there!"", Then in an instant a bright thought flashed into my head, and I let it fly, saying, ""It would be a deal more wonderful to see it tumble up there!"", --and I was just about to kill myself with laughing at it when all nature broke loose in war and death, and I had to flee for my life., ""There,"" she said, with triumph, ""that is just it; the Serpent mentioned that very jest, and called it the First Chestnut, and said it was coeval with the creation."", Alas, I am indeed to blame., Would that I were not witty; oh, would that I had never had that radiant thought!, Next Year  We have named it Cain., She caught it while I was up country trapping on the North Shore of the Erie; caught it in the timber a couple of miles from our dug-out--or it might have been four, she isn't certain which., It resembles us in some ways, and may be a relation., That is what she thinks, but this is an error, in my judgment., The difference in size warrants the conclusion that it is a different and new kind of animal--a fish, perhaps, though when I put it in the water to see, it sank, and she plunged in and snatched it out before there was opportunity for the experiment to determine the matter., I still think it is a fish, but she is indifferent about what it is, and will not let me have it to try., I do not understand this., The coming of the creature seems to have changed her whole nature and made her unreasonable about experiments., She thinks more of it than she does of any of the other animals, but is not able to explain why., Her mind is disordered--everything shows it., Sometimes she carries the fish in her arms half the night when it complains and wants to get to the water., At such times the water comes out of the places in her face that she looks out of, and she pats the fish on the back and makes soft sounds with her mouth to soothe it, and betrays sorrow and solicitude in a hundred ways., I have never seen her do like this with any other fish, and it troubles me greatly., She used to carry the young tigers around so, and play with them, before we lost our property; but it was only play; she never took on about them like this when their dinner disagreed with them., Sunday  She doesn't work Sundays, but lies around all tired out, and likes to have the fish wallow over her; and she makes fool noises to amuse it, and pretends to chew its paws, and that makes it laugh., I have not seen a fish before that could laugh., This makes me doubt...., I have come to like Sunday myself., Superintending all the week tires a body so., There ought to be more Sundays., In the old days they were tough, but now they come handy., Wednesday  It isn't a fish., I cannot quite make out what it is., It makes curious, devilish noises when not satisfied, and says ""goo-goo"" when it is., It is not one of us, for it doesn't walk; it is not a bird, for it doesn't fly; it is not a frog, for it doesn't hop; it is not a snake, for it doesn't crawl; I feel sure it is not a fish, though I cannot get a chance to find out whether it can swim or not., It merely lies around, and mostly on its back, with its feet up., I have not seen any other animal do that before., I said I believed it was an enigma, but she only admired the word without understanding it., In my judgment it is either an enigma or some kind of a bug., If it dies, I will take it apart and see what its arrangements are., I never had a thing perplex me so., Three Months Later  The perplexity augments instead of diminishing., I sleep but little., It has ceased from lying around, and goes about on its four legs now., ...]"|1
53|"[No, no, no!--you have quite misunderSTOOD me., If--  Deaf Person., Ah!, GOOD morning; I am sorry you must go., But call again, and let me continue to be of assistance to you in every way I can., You see it is a perfect kodak of the article you have dictated., It is really curious and interesting when you come to compare it with yours; in detail, with my former article to which it is a Reply in your hand., I talk twelve pages about your American instruction projects, and your doubtful scientific system, and your painstaking classification of nonexistent things, and your diligence and zeal and sincerity, and your disloyal attitude towards anecdotes, and your undue reverence for unsafe statistics and far facts that lack a pedigree; and you turn around and come back at me with eight pages of weather., I do not see how a person can act so., It is good of you to repeat, with change of language, in the bulk of your rejoinder, so much of my own article, and adopt my sentiments, and make them over, and put new buttons on; and I like the compliment, and am frank to say so; but agreeing with a person cripples controversy and ought not to be allowed., It is weather; and of almost the worst sort., It pleases me greatly to hear you discourse with such approval and expansiveness upon my text:  ""A foreigner can photograph the exteriors of a nation, but I think that is as far as he can get., I think that no foreigner can report its interior;""--[And you say: ""A man of average intelligence, who has passed six months among a people, cannot express opinions that are worth jotting down, but he can form impressions that are worth repeating., For my part, I think that foreigners' impressions are more interesting than native opinions., After all, such impressions merely mean 'how the country struck the foreigner.'""], --which is a quite clear way of saying that a foreigner's report is only valuable when it restricts itself to impressions., It pleases me to have you follow my lead in that glowing way, but it leaves me nothing to combat., You should give me something to deny and refute; I would do as much for you., It pleases me to have you playfully warn the public against taking one of your books seriously.--[When I published Jonathan and his Continent, I wrote in a preface addressed to Jonathan: ""If ever you should insist in seeing in this little volume a serious study of your country and of your countrymen, I warn you that your world-wide fame for humor will be exploded.""], --Because I used to do that cunning thing myself in earlier days., I did it in a prefatory note to a book of mine called Tom Sawyer., NOTICE., Persons attempting to find a motive in           this narrative will be prosecuted;           persons attempting to find a moral in it           will be banished; persons attempting to           find a plot in it will be shot., BY ORDER OF THE AUTHOR                               PER G. G., CHIEF OF ORDNANCE., The kernel is the same in both prefaces, you see--the public must not take us too seriously., If we remove that kernel we remove the life-principle, and the preface is a corpse., Yes, it pleases me to have you use that idea, for it is a high compliment., But is leaves me nothing to combat; and that is damage to me., Am I seeming to say that your Reply is not a reply at all, M. Bourget?, If so, I must modify that; it is too sweeping., For you have furnished a general answer to my inquiry as to what France through you--can teach us., --[""What could France teach America!"", exclaims Mark Twain., France can teach America all the higher pursuits of life, and there is more artistic feeling and refinement in a street of French workingmen than in many avenues inhabited by American millionaires., She can teach her, not perhaps how to work, but how to rest, how to live, how to be happy., She can teach her that the aim of life is not money-making, but that money-making is only a means to obtain an end., She can teach her that wives are not expensive toys, but useful partners, friends, and confidants, who should always keep men under their wholesome influence by their diplomacy, their tact, their common-sense, without bumptiousness., These qualities, added to the highest standard of morality (not angular and morose, but cheerful morality), are conceded to Frenchwomen by whoever knows something of French life outside of the Paris boulevards, and Mark Twain's ill-natured sneer cannot even so much as stain them., I might tell Mark Twain that in France a man who was seen tipsy in his club would immediately see his name canceled from membership., A man who had settled his fortune on his wife to avoid meeting his creditors would be refused admission into any decent society., Many a Frenchman has blown his brains out rather than declare himself a bankrupt., Now would Mark Twain remark to this: 'An American is not such a fool: when a creditor stands in his way he closes his doors, and reopens them the following day., When he has been a bankrupt three times he can retire from business?'], --It is a good answer., It relates to manners, customs, and morals--three things concerning which we can never have exhaustive and determinate statistics, and so the verdicts delivered upon them must always lack conclusiveness and be subject to revision; but you have stated the truth, possibly, as nearly as any one could do it, in the circumstances., But why did you choose a detail of my question which could be answered only with vague hearsay evidence, and go right by one which could have been answered with deadly facts?--facts in everybody's reach, facts which none can dispute., I asked what France could teach us about government., I laid myself pretty wide open, there; and I thought I was handsomely generous, too, when I did it., France can teach us how to levy village and city taxes which distribute the burden with a nearer approach to perfect fairness than is the case in any other land; and she can teach us the wisest and surest system of collecting them that exists., She can teach us how to elect a President in a sane way; and also how to do it without throwing the country into earthquakes and convulsions that cripple and embarrass business, stir up party hatred in the hearts of men, and make peaceful people wish the term extended to thirty years., France can teach us--but enough of that part of the question., And what else can France teach us?, She can teach us all the fine arts--and does., She throws open her hospitable art academies, and says to us, ""Come""--and we come, troops and troops of our young and gifted; and she sets over us the ablest masters in the world and bearing the greatest names; and she, teaches us all that we are capable of learning, and persuades us and encourages us with prizes and honors, much as if we were somehow children of her own; and when this noble education is finished and we are ready to carry it home and spread its gracious ministries abroad over our nation, and we come with homage and gratitude and ask France for the bill--there is nothing to pay., And in return for this imperial generosity, what does America do?, She charges a duty on French works of art!, I wish I had your end of this dispute; I should have something worth talking about., If you would only furnish me something to argue, something to refute--but you persistently won't., You leave good chances unutilized and spend your strength in proving and establishing unimportant things., For instance, you have proven and established these eight facts here following--a good score as to number, but not worth while:  Mark Twain is--  1., ""Insulting."", 2., (Sarcastically speaking) ""This refined humor, 1st."", 3., Prefers the manure-pile to the violets., 4., Has uttered ""an ill-natured sneer."", 5., Is ""nasty."", 6., Needs a ""lesson in politeness and good manners."", 7., Has published a ""nasty article."", 8., Has made remarks ""unworthy of a gentleman."", --[""It is more funny than his"" (Mark Twain's) ""anecdote, and would have been less insulting.""], A quoted remark of mine ""is a gross insult to a nation friendly to America."", ""He has read La Terre, this refined humorist."", ""When Mark Twain visits a garden ., ., ., he goes in the far-away corner where the soil is prepared."", ""Mark Twain's ill-natured sneer cannot so much as stain them"" (the Frenchwomen)., ""When he"" (Mark Twain) ""takes his revenge he is unkind, unfair, bitter, nasty."", ""But not even your nasty article on my country, Mark,"" etc., ""Mark might certainly have derived from it"" (M. Bourget's book) ""a lesson in politeness and good manners."", A quoted remark of mine is ""unworthy of a gentleman."", --  These are all true, but really they are not valuable; no one cares much for such finds., In our American magazines we recognize this and suppress them., We avoid naming them., American writers never allow themselves to name them., It would look as if they were in a temper, and we hold that exhibitions of temper in public are not good form except in the very young and inexperienced., And even if we had the disposition to name them, in order to fill up a gap when we were short of ideas and arguments, our magazines would not allow us to do it, because they think that such words sully their pages., This present magazine is particularly strenuous about it., Its note to me announcing the forwarding of your proof-sheets to France closed thus--for your protection:  ""It is needless to ask you to avoid anything that he might consider as personal."", It was well enough, as a measure of precaution, but really it was not needed., You can trust me implicitly, M. Bourget; I shall never call you any names in print which I should be ashamed to call you with your unoffending and dearest ones present., Indeed, we are reserved, and particular in America to a degree which you would consider exaggerated., For instance, we should not write notes like that one of yours to a lady for a small fault--or a large one.--[When M. Paul Bourget indulges in a little chaffing at the expense of the Americans, ""who can always get away with a few years' trying to find out who their grandfathers were,""] he merely makes an allusion to an American foible; but, forsooth, what a kind man, what a humorist Mark Twain is when he retorts by calling France a nation of bastards!, How the Americans of culture and refinement will admire him for thus speaking in their name!, ...]"|1
54|"[But that warn't the end yet., That ornery hound kept coming and coming till he had begged back all the camels and had the whole hundred., Then he was satisfied, and ever so grateful, and said he wouldn't ever forgit the dervish as long as he lived, and nobody hadn't been so good to him before, and liberal., So they shook hands good-bye, and separated and started off again., But do you know, it warn't ten minutes till the camel-driver was unsatisfied again--he was the lowdownest reptyle in seven counties--and he come a-running again., And this time the thing he wanted was to get the dervish to rub some of the salve on his other eye., ""Why?"", said the dervish., ""Oh, you know,"" says the driver., ""Know what?"", ""Well, you can't fool me,"" says the driver., ""You're trying to keep back something from me, you know it mighty well., You know, I reckon, that if I had the salve on the other eye I could see a lot more things that's valuable., Come--please put it on."", The dervish says:  ""I wasn't keeping anything back from you., I don't mind telling you what would happen if I put it on., You'd never see again., You'd be stone-blind the rest of your days."", But do you know that beat wouldn't believe him., No, he begged and begged, and whined and cried, till at last the dervish opened his box and told him to put it on, if he wanted to., So the man done it, and sure enough he was as blind as a bat in a minute., Then the dervish laughed at him and mocked at him and made fun of him; and says:  ""Good-bye--a man that's blind hain't got no use for jewelry."", And he cleared out with the hundred camels, and left that man to wander around poor and miserable and friendless the rest of his days in the Desert., Jim said he'd bet it was a lesson to him., ""Yes,"" Tom says, ""and like a considerable many lessons a body gets., They ain't no account, because the thing don't ever happen the same way again--and can't., The time Hen Scovil fell down the chimbly and crippled his back for life, everybody said it would be a lesson to him., What kind of a lesson?, How was he going to use it?, He couldn't climb chimblies no more, and he hadn't no more backs to break."", ""All de same, Mars Tom, dey IS sich a thing as learnin' by expe'ence., De Good Book say de burnt chile shun de fire."", ""Well, I ain't denying that a thing's a lesson if it's a thing that can happen twice just the same way., There's lots of such things, and THEY educate a person, that's what Uncle Abner always said; but there's forty MILLION lots of the other kind--the kind that don't happen the same way twice--and they ain't no real use, they ain't no more instructive than the small-pox., When you've got it, it ain't no good to find out you ought to been vaccinated, and it ain't no good to git vaccinated afterward, because the small-pox don't come but once., But, on the other hand, Uncle Abner said that the person that had took a bull by the tail once had learnt sixty or seventy times as much as a person that hadn't, and said a person that started in to carry a cat home by the tail was gitting knowledge that was always going to be useful to him, and warn't ever going to grow dim or doubtful., But I can tell you, Jim, Uncle Abner was down on them people that's all the time trying to dig a lesson out of everything that happens, no matter whether--""  But Jim was asleep., Tom looked kind of ashamed, because you know a person always feels bad when he is talking uncommon fine and thinks the other person is admiring, and that other person goes to sleep that way., Of course he oughtn't to go to sleep, because it's shabby; but the finer a person talks the certainer it is to make you sleep, and so when you come to look at it it ain't nobody's fault in particular; both of them's to blame., Jim begun to snore--soft and blubbery at first, then a long rasp, then a stronger one, then a half a dozen horrible ones like the last water sucking down the plug-hole of a bath-tub, then the same with more power to it, and some big coughs and snorts flung in, the way a cow does that is choking to death; and when the person has got to that point he is at his level best, and can wake up a man that is in the next block with a dipperful of loddanum in him, but can't wake himself up although all that awful noise of his'n ain't but three inches from his own ears., And that is the curiosest thing in the world, seems to me., But you rake a match to light the candle, and that little bit of a noise will fetch him., I wish I knowed what was the reason of that, but there don't seem to be no way to find out., Now there was Jim alarming the whole Desert, and yanking the animals out, for miles and miles around, to see what in the nation was going on up there; there warn't nobody nor nothing that was as close to the noise as HE was, and yet he was the only cretur that wasn't disturbed by it., We yelled at him and whooped at him, it never done no good; but the first time there come a little wee noise that wasn't of a usual kind it woke him up., No, sir, I've thought it all over, and so has Tom, and there ain't no way to find out why a snorer can't hear himself snore., Jim said he hadn't been asleep; he just shut his eyes so he could listen better., Tom said nobody warn't accusing him., That made him look like he wished he hadn't said anything., And he wanted to git away from the subject, I reckon, because he begun to abuse the camel-driver, just the way a person does when he has got catched in something and wants to take it out of somebody else., He let into the camel-driver the hardest he knowed how, and I had to agree with him; and he praised up the dervish the highest he could, and I had to agree with him there, too., But Tom says:  ""I ain't so sure., You call that dervish so dreadful liberal and good and unselfish, but I don't quite see it., He didn't hunt up another poor dervish, did he?, No, he didn't., If he was so unselfish, why didn't he go in there himself and take a pocketful of jewels and go along and be satisfied?, No, sir, the person he was hunting for was a man with a hundred camels., He wanted to get away with all the treasure he could."", ""Why, Mars Tom, he was willin' to divide, fair and square; he only struck for fifty camels."", ""Because he knowed how he was going to get all of them by and by."", ""Mars Tom, he TOLE de man de truck would make him bline."", ""Yes, because he knowed the man's character., It was just the kind of a man he was hunting for--a man that never believes in anybody's word or anybody's honorableness, because he ain't got none of his own., I reckon there's lots of people like that dervish., They swindle, right and left, but they always make the other person SEEM to swindle himself., They keep inside of the letter of the law all the time, and there ain't no way to git hold of them., THEY don't put the salve on--oh, no, that would be sin; but they know how to fool YOU into putting it on, then it's you that blinds yourself., I reckon the dervish and the camel-driver was just a pair--a fine, smart, brainy rascal, and a dull, coarse, ignorant one, but both of them rascals, just the same."", ""Mars Tom, does you reckon dey's any o' dat kind o' salve in de worl' now?"", ""Yes, Uncle Abner says there is., He says they've got it in New York, and they put it on country people's eyes and show them all the railroads in the world, and they go in and git them, and then when they rub the salve on the other eye the other man bids them goodbye and goes off with their railroads., Here's the treasure-hill now., Lower away!"", We landed, but it warn't as interesting as I thought it was going to be, because we couldn't find the place where they went in to git the treasure., Still, it was plenty interesting enough, just to see the mere hill itself where such a wonderful thing happened., Jim said he wou'dn't 'a' missed it for three dollars, and I felt the same way., And to me and Jim, as wonderful a thing as any was the way Tom could come into a strange big country like this and go straight and find a little hump like that and tell it in a minute from a million other humps that was almost just like it, and nothing to help him but only his own learning and his own natural smartness., We talked and talked it over together, but couldn't make out how he done it., He had the best head on him I ever see; and all he lacked was age, to make a name for himself equal to Captain Kidd or George Washington., I bet you it would 'a' crowded either of THEM to find that hill, with all their gifts, but it warn't nothing to Tom Sawyer; he went across Sahara and put his finger on it as easy as you could pick a nigger out of a bunch of angels., We found a pond of salt water close by and scraped up a raft of salt around the edges, and loaded up the lion's skin and the tiger's so as they would keep till Jim could tan them., WE went a-fooling along for a day or two, and then just as the full moon was touching the ground on the other side of the desert, we see a string of little black figgers moving across its big silver face., You could see them as plain as if they was painted on the moon with ink., It was another caravan., We cooled down our speed and tagged along after it, just to have company, though it warn't going our way., It was a rattler, that caravan, and a most bully sight to look at next morning when the sun come a-streaming across the desert and flung the long shadders of the camels on the gold sand like a thousand grand-daddy-long-legses marching in procession., We never went very near it, because we knowed better now than to act like that and scare people's camels and break up their caravans., It was the gayest outfit you ever see, for rich clothes and nobby style., Some of the chiefs rode on dromedaries, the first we ever see, and very tall, and they go plunging along like they was on stilts, and they rock the man that is on them pretty violent and churn up his dinner considerable, I bet you, but they make noble good time, and a camel ain't nowheres with them for speed., The caravan camped, during the middle part of the day, and then started again about the middle of the afternoon., Before long the sun begun to look very curious., First it kind of turned to brass, and then to copper, and after that it begun to look like a blood-red ball, and the air got hot and close, and pretty soon all the sky in the west darkened up and looked thick and foggy, but fiery and dreadful--like it looks through a piece of red glass, you know., We looked down and see a big confusion going on in the caravan, and a rushing every which way like they was scared; and then they all flopped down flat in the sand and laid there perfectly still., Pretty soon we see something coming that stood up like an amazing wide wall, and reached from the Desert up into the sky and hid the sun, and it was coming like the nation, too., Then a little faint breeze struck us, and then it come harder, and grains of sand begun to sift against our faces and sting like fire, and Tom sung out:  ""It's a sand-storm--turn your backs to it!"", We done it; and in another minute it was blowing a gale, and the sand beat against us by the shovelful, and the air was so thick with it we couldn't see a thing., In five minutes the boat was level full, and we was setting on the lockers buried up to the chin in sand, and only our heads out and could hardly breathe., Then the storm thinned, and we see that monstrous wall go a-sailing off across the desert, awful to look at, I tell you., We dug ourselves out and looked down, and where the caravan was before there wasn't anything but just the sand ocean now, and all still and quiet., All them people and camels was smothered and dead and buried--buried under ten foot of sand, we reckoned, and Tom allowed it might be years before the wind uncovered them, and all that time their friends wouldn't ever know what become of that caravan., ...]"|1
55|"[Come right out and tell me you've found out somehow what a shape I'm in on account of dissipation and foolishness."", ""Disposition en foolishness!, NO sir, dat ain't it., Dat jist ain't nothin' at all, 'longside o' what _I_ knows."", Tom stared at her, and said:  ""Why, Roxy, what do you mean?"", She rose, and gloomed above him like a Fate., ""I means dis--en it's de Lord's truth., You ain't no more kin to ole Marse Driscoll den I is!, _dat's_  what I means!"", and her eyes flamed with triumph., ""What?"", ""Yassir, en _dat_ ain't all!, You's a _nigger!_--_bawn_ a nigger and a _slave!_--en you's a nigger en a slave dis minute;

en don't you git up ag'in till I tell you!"", Tom fretted and chafed awhile in a whirlwind of disorganizing sensations and emotions, and finally said, with something like settled conviction:  ""The whole thing is moonshine; now then, go ahead and do your worst; I'm done with you."", Roxy made no answer., She took the lantern and started for the door., Tom was in a cold panic in a moment., ""Come back, come back!"", he wailed., ""I didn't mean it, Roxy; I take it all back, and I'll never say it again!, Please come back, Roxy!"", The woman stood a moment, then she said gravely:  ""Dat's one thing you's got to stop, Valet de Chambers., You can't call me _Roxy_, same as if you was my equal., Chillen don't speak to dey mammies like dat., You'll call me ma or mammy, dat's what you'll call me--leastways when de ain't nobody aroun'., _Say_ it!"", It cost Tom a struggle, but he got it out., ""Dat's all right, don't you ever forgit it ag'in, if you knows what's good for you., Now den, you had said you wouldn't ever call it lies en moonshine ag'in., I'll tell you dis, for a warnin': if you ever does say it ag'in, it's de LAS' time you'll ever say it to me; I'll tramp as straight to de judge as I kin walk, en tell him who you is, en _prove_ it., Does you b'lieve me when I says dat?"", ""Oh,"" groaned Tom, ""I more than believe it; I _know_ it."", Roxy knew her conquest was complete., She could have proved nothing to anybody, and her threat of writings was a lie; but she knew the person she was dealing with, and had made both statements without any doubt as to the effect they would produce., She went and sat down on her candle box, and the pride and pomp of her victorious attitude made it a throne., She said:  ""Now den, Chambers, we's gwine to talk business, en dey ain't gwine to be no mo' foolishness., In de fust place, you gits fifty dollahs a month; you's gwine to han' over half of it to yo' ma., Plank it out!"", But Tom had only six dollars in the world., He gave her that, and promised to start fair on next month's pension., ""Chambers, how much is you in debt?"", Tom shuddered, and said:  ""Nearly three hundred dollars."", ""How is you gwine to pay it?"", Tom groaned out:  ""Oh, I don't know; don't ask me such awful questions."", But she stuck to her point until she wearied a confession out of him: he had been prowling about in disguise, stealing small valuables from private houses; in fact, he made a good deal of a raid on his fellow villagers a fortnight before, when he was supposed to be in St. Louis; but he doubted if he had sent away enough stuff to realize the required amount, and was afraid to make a further venture in the present excited state of the town., His mother approved of his conduct, and offered to help, but this frightened him., He tremblingly ventured to say that if she would retire from the town he should feel better and safer, and could hold his head higher--and was going on to make an argument, but she interrupted and surprised him pleasantly by saying she was ready; it didn't make any difference to her where she stayed, so that she got her share of the pension regularly., She said she would not go far, and would call at the haunted house once a month for her money., Then she said:  ""I don't hate you so much now, but I've hated you a many a year--and anybody would., Didn't I change you off, en give you a good fambly en a good name, en made you a white gen'l'man en rich, wid store clothes on--en what did I git for it?, You despised me all de time, en was al'ays sayin' mean hard things to me befo' folks, en wouldn't ever let me forgit I's a nigger--en--en--""  She fell to sobbing, and broke down., Tom said:  ""But you know I didn't know you were my mother; and besides--""  ""Well, nemmine 'bout dat, now; let it go., I's gwine to fo'git it."", Then she added fiercely, ""En don't ever make me remember it ag'in, or you'll be sorry, _I_ tell you."", When they were parting, Tom said, in the most persuasive way he could command:  ""Ma, would you mind telling me who was my father?"", He had supposed he was asking an embarrassing question., He was mistaken., Roxy drew herself up with a proud toss of her head, and said:  ""Does I mine tellin' you?, No, dat I don't!, You ain't got no 'casion to be shame' o' yo' father, _I_ kin tell you., He wuz de highest quality in dis whole town--ole Virginny stock., Fust famblies, he wuz., Jes as good stock as de Driscolls en de Howards, de bes' day dey ever seed."", She put on a little prouder air, if possible, and added impressively:  ""Does you 'member Cunnel Cecil Burleigh Essex, dat died de same year yo' young Marse Tom Driscoll's pappy died, en all de Masons en Odd Fellers en Churches turned out en give him de bigges' funeral dis town ever seed?, Dat's de man."", Under the inspiration of her soaring complacency the departed graces of her earlier days returned to her, and her bearing took to itself a dignity and state that might have passed for queenly if her surroundings had been a little more in keeping with it., ""Dey ain't another nigger in dis town dat's as highbawn as you is., Now den, go 'long!, En jes you hold yo' head up as high as you want to--you has de right, en dat I kin swah."", The Nymph Revealed  All say, ""How hard it is that we have to die""--a strange complaint to come from the mouths of people who have had to live., --Pudd'nhead Wilson's Calendar  When angry, count four; when very angry, swear., --Pudd'nhead Wilson's Calendar  Every now and then, after Tom went to bed, he had sudden wakings out of his sleep, and his first thought was, ""Oh, joy, it was all a dream!"", Then he laid himself heavily down again, with a groan and the muttered words, ""A nigger!, I am a nigger!, Oh, I wish I was dead!"", He woke at dawn with one more repetition of this horror, and then he resolved to meddle no more with that treacherous sleep., He began to think., Sufficiently bitter thinkings they were., They wandered along something after this fashion:  ""Why were niggers _and_ whites made?, What crime did the uncreated first nigger commit that the curse of birth was decreed for him?, And why is this awful difference made between white and black?, ., ., ., How hard the nigger's fate seems, this morning!--yet until last night such a thought never entered my head."", He sighed and groaned an hour or more away., Then ""Chambers"" came humbly in to say that breakfast was nearly ready., ""Tom"" blushed scarlet to see this aristocratic white youth cringe to him, a nigger, and call him ""Young Marster."", ...]"|1

but at last he said to himself, wearily:  ""There is but the one way out., I must follow her plan., But with a variation--I will not ask for the money and ruin myself; I will ROB the old skinflint."", The Prophesy Realized  Few things are harder to put up with than the annoyance of a good example., It were not best that we should all think alike; it is difference of opinion that makes horse races., Dawson's Landing was comfortably finishing its season of dull repose and waiting patiently for the duel., Count Luigi was waiting, too; but not patiently, rumor said., Sunday came, and Luigi insisted on having his challenge conveyed., Wilson carried it., Judge Driscoll declined to fight with an assassin--""that is,"" he added significantly, ""in the field of honor."", Elsewhere, of course, he would be ready., Wilson tried to convince him that if he had been present himself when Angelo told him about the homicide committed by Luigi, he would not have considered the act discreditable to Luigi; but the obstinate old man was not to be moved., Wilson went back to his principal and reported the failure of his mission., Luigi was incensed, and asked how it could be that the old gentleman, who was by no means dull-witted, held his trifling nephew's evidence in inferences to be of more value than Wilson's., But Wilson laughed, and said:  ""That is quite simple; that is easily explicable., I am not his doll--his baby--his infatuation:  his nature is., The judge and his late wife never had any children., The judge and his wife were past middle age when this treasure fell into their lap., One must make allowances for a parental instinct that has been starving for twenty-five or thirty years., It is famished, it is crazed with hunger by that time, and will be entirely satisfied with anything that comes handy; its taste is atrophied, it can't tell mud cat from shad., A devil born to a young couple is measurably recognizable by them as a devil before long, but a devil adopted by an old couple is an angel to them, and remains so, through thick and thin., Tom is this old man's angel; he is infatuated with him., Tom can persuade him into things which other people can't--not all things; I don't mean that, but a good many--particularly one class of things:  the things that create or abolish personal partialities or prejudices in the old man's mind., The old man liked both of you., Tom conceived a hatred for you., That was enough; it turned the old man around at once., The oldest and strongest friendship must go to the ground when one of these late-adopted darlings throws a brick at it."", ""It's a curious philosophy,"" said Luigi., ""It ain't philosophy at all--it's a fact., And there is something pathetic and beautiful about it, too., I think there is nothing more pathetic than to see one of these poor old childless couples taking a menagerie of yelping little worthless dogs to their hearts; and then adding some cursing and squawking parrots and a jackass-voiced macaw; and next a couple of hundred screeching songbirds, and presently some fetid guinea pigs and rabbits, and a howling colony of cats., It is all a groping and ignorant effort to construct out of base metal and brass filings, so to speak, something to take the place of that golden treasure denied them by Nature, a child., But this is a digression., The unwritten law of this region requires you to kill Judge Driscoll on sight, and he and the community will expect that attention at your hands--though of course your own death by his bullet will answer every purpose., Look out for him!, Are you healed--that is, fixed?"", ""Yes, he shall have his opportunity., If he attacks me, I will respond."", As Wilson was leaving, he said:  ""The judge is still a little used up by his campaign work, and will not get out for a day or so; but when he does get out, you want to be on the alert."", About eleven at night the twins went out for exercise, and started on a long stroll in the veiled moonlight., Tom Driscoll had landed at Hackett's Store, two miles below Dawson's, just about half an hour earlier, the only passenger for that lonely spot, and had walked up the shore road and entered Judge Driscoll's house without having encountered anyone either on the road or under the roof., He pulled down his window blinds and lighted his candle., He laid off his coat and hat and began his preparations., He unlocked his trunk and got his suit of girl's clothes out from under the male attire in it, and laid it by., Then he blacked his face with burnt cork and put the cork in his pocket., His plan was to slip down to his uncle's private sitting room below, pass into the bedroom, steal the safe key from the old gentleman's clothes, and then go back and rob the safe., He took up his candle to start., His courage and confidence were high, up to this point, but both began to waver a little now., Suppose he should make a noise, by some accident, and get caught--say, in the act of opening the safe?, Perhaps it would be well to go armed., He took the Indian knife from its hiding place, and felt a pleasant return of his wandering courage., He slipped stealthily down the narrow stair, his hair rising and his pulses halting at the slightest creak., When he was halfway down, he was disturbed to perceive that the landing below was touched by a faint glow of light., What could that mean?, Was his uncle still up?, No, that was not likely; he must have left his night taper there when he went to bed., Tom crept on down, pausing at every step to listen., He found the door standing open, and glanced it., What he saw pleased him beyond measure., His uncle was asleep on the sofa; on a small table at the head of the sofa a lamp was burning low, and by it stood the old man's small cashbox, closed., Near the box was a pile of bank notes and a piece of paper covered with figured in pencil., The safe door was not open., Evidently the sleeper had wearied himself with work upon his finances, and was taking a rest., Tom set his candle on the stairs, and began to make his way toward the pile of notes, stooping low as he went., When he was passing his uncle, the old man stirred in his sleep, and Tom stopped instantly--stopped, and softly drew the knife from its sheath, with his heart thumping, and his eyes fastened upon his benefactor's face., After a moment or two he ventured forward again--one step--reached for his prize and seized it, dropping the knife sheath., Then he felt the old man's strong grip upon him, and a wild cry of ""Help!, help!"", rang in his ear., Without hesitation he drove the knife home--and was free., Some of the notes escaped from his left hand and fell in the blood on the floor., He dropped the knife and snatched them up and started to fly; transferred them to his left hand, and seized the knife again, in his fright and confusion, but remembered himself and flung it from him, as being a dangerous witness to carry away with him., He jumped for the stair-foot, and closed the door behind him; and as he snatched his candle and fled upward, the stillness of the night was broken by the sound of urgent footsteps approaching the house., In another moment he was in his room, and the twins were standing aghast over the body of the murdered man!, Tom put on his coat, buttoned his hat under it, threw on his suit of girl's clothes, dropped the veil, blew out his light, locked the room door by which he had just entered, taking the key, passed through his other door into the black hall, locked that door and kept the key, then worked his way along in the dark and descended the black stairs., He was not expecting to meet anybody, for all interest was centered in the other part of the house now; his calculation proved correct., By the time he was passing through the backyard, Mrs. Pratt, her servants, and a dozen half-dressed neighbors had joined the twins and the dead, and accessions were still arriving at the front door., As Tom, quaking as with a palsy, passed out at the gate, three women came flying from the house on the opposite side of the lane., They rushed by him and in at the gate, asking him what the trouble was there, but not waiting for an answer., Tom said to himself, ""Those old maids waited to dress--they did the same thing the night Stevens's house burned down next door."", In a few minutes he was in the haunted house., He lighted a candle and took off his girl-clothes., There was blood on him all down his left side, and his right hand was red with the stains of the blood-soaked notes which he has crushed in it; but otherwise he was free from this sort of evidence., He cleansed his hand on the straw, and cleaned most of the smut from his face., Then he burned the male and female attire to ashes, scattered the ashes, and put on a disguise proper for a tramp., He blew out his light, went below, and was soon loafing down the river road with the intent to borrow and use one of Roxy's devices., He found a canoe and paddled down downstream, setting the canoe adrift as dawn approached, and making his way by land to the next village, where he kept out of sight till a transient steamer came along, and then took deck passage for St. Louis., He was ill at ease Dawson's Landing was behind him; then he said to himself, ""All the detectives on earth couldn't trace me now; there's not a vestige of a clue left in the world; that homicide will take its place with the permanent mysteries, and people won't get done trying to guess out the secret of it for fifty years."", ...]"|1
57|"[It seems to me that if we can save these poor persecuted strangers, it is our bounden duty to stand up here and talk for them till--""  ""There, there, there, do sit down!"", It cost some trouble and a good deal of coaxing, but they were got into their seats at last., The trial was soon ended now., The twins themselves became witnesses in their own defense., They established the fact, upon oath, that the leg-power passed from one to the other every Saturday night at twelve o'clock sharp., But or cross-examination their counsel would not allow them to tell whose week of power the current week was., The judge insisted upon their answering, and proposed to compel them, but even the prosecution took fright and came to the rescue then, and helped stay the sturdy jurist's revolutionary hand., So the case had to go to the jury with that important point hanging in the air., They were out an hour and brought in this verdict:  ""We the jury do find:  1, that an assault was committed, as charged; 2, that it was committed by one of the persons accused, he having been seen to do it by several credible witnesses; 3, but that his identity is so merged in his brother's that we have not been able to tell which was him., We cannot convict both, for only one is guilty., We cannot acquit both, for only one is innocent., Our verdict is that justice has been defeated by the dispensation of God, and ask to be discharged from further duty."", This was read aloud in court and brought out a burst of hearty applause., The old ladies made a spring at the twins, to shake and congratulate, but were gently disengaged by Mr. Wilson and softly crowded back into their places., The judge rose in his little tribune, laid aside his silver-bowed spectacles, roached his gray hair up with his fingers, and said, with dignity and solemnity, and even with a certain pathos:  ""In all my experience on the bench, I have not seen justice bow her head in shame in this court until this day., You little realize what far-reaching harm has just been wrought here under the fickle forms of law., Imitation is the bane of courts--I thank God that this one is free from the contamination of that vice--and in no long time you will see the fatal work of this hour seized upon by profligate so-called guardians of justice in all the wide circumstance of this planet and perpetuated in their pernicious decisions., I wash my hands of this iniquity., I would have compelled these culprits to expose their guilt, but support failed me where I had most right to expect aid and encouragement., And I was confronted by a law made in the interest of crime, which protects the criminal from testifying against himself., Yet I had precedents of my own whereby I had set aside that law on two different occasions and thus succeeded in convicting criminals to whose crimes there were no witnesses but themselves., What have you accomplished this day?, Do you realize it?, You have set adrift, unadmonished, in this community, two men endowed with an awful and mysterious gift, a hidden and grisly power for evil --a power by which each in his turn may commit crime after crime of the most heinous character, and no man be able to tell which is the guilty or which the innocent party in any case of them all., Look to your homes look to your property look to your lives for you have need!, ""Prisoners at the bar, stand up., Through suppression of evidence, a jury of your--our--countrymen have been obliged to deliver a verdict concerning your case which stinks to heaven with the rankness of its injustice., By its terms you, the guilty one, go free with the innocent., Depart in peace, and come no more!, The costs devolve upon the outraged plaintiff--another iniquity., The court stands dissolved."", Almost everybody crowded forward to overwhelm the twins and their counsel with congratulations; but presently the two old aunties dug the duplicates out and bore them away in triumph through the hurrahing crowd, while lots of new friends carried Pudd'nhead Wilson off tavernward to feast him and ""wet down"" his great and victorious entry into the legal arena., To Wilson, so long familiar with neglect and depreciation, this strange new incense of popularity and admiration was as a fragrance blown from the fields of paradise., A happy man was Wilson., THE AMAZING DUEL       A deputation came in the evening and conferred upon Wilson the      welcome honor of a nomination for mayor; for the village has just      been converted into a city by charter., Tom skulks out of      challenging the twins., Judge Driscoll thereupon challenges Angelo      (accused by Tom of doing the kicking); he declines, but Luigi      accepts in his place against Angelo's timid protest., It was late Saturday night nearing eleven., The judge and his second found the rest of the war party at the further end of the vacant ground, near the haunted house., Pudd'nhead Wilson advanced to meet them, and said anxiously:  ""I must say a word in behalf of my principal's proxy, Count Luigi, to whom you have kindly granted the privilege of fighting my principal's battle for him., It is growing late, and Count Luigi is in great trouble lest midnight shall strike before the finish."", ""It is another testimony,"" said Howard, approvingly., ""That young man is fine all through., He wishes to save his brother the sorrow of fighting on the Sabbath, and he is right; it is the right and manly feeling and does him credit., We will make all possible haste."", Wilson said: ""There is also another reason--a consideration, in fact, which deeply concerns Count Luigi himself., These twins have command of their mutual legs turn about., Count Luigi is in command now; but at midnight, possession will pass to my principal, Count Angelo, and--well, you can foresee what will happen., He will march straight off the field, and carry Luigi with him."", ""Why!, sure enough!"", cried the judge, ""we have heard something about that extraordinary law of their being, already--nothing very definite, it is true, as regards dates and durations of power, but I see it is definite enough as regards to-night., Of course we must give Luigi every chance., Omit all the ceremonial possible, gentlemen, and place us in position."", The seconds at once tossed up a coin; Howard won the choice., He placed the judge sixty feet from the haunted house and facing it; Wilson placed the twins within fifteen feet of the house and facing the judge --necessarily., The pistol-case was opened and the long slim tubes taken out; when the moonlight glinted from them a shiver went through Angelo., The doctor was a fool, but a thoroughly well-meaning one, with a kind heart and a sincere disposition to oblige, but along with it an absence of tact which often hurt its effectiveness., He brought his box of lint and bandages, and asked Angelo to feel and see how soft and comfortable they were., Angelo's head fell over against Luigi's in a faint, and precious time was lost in bringing him to; which provoked Luigi into expressing his mind to the doctor with a good deal of vigor and frankness., After Angelo came to he was still so weak that Luigi was obliged to drink a stiff horn of brandy to brace him up., The seconds now stepped at once to their posts, halfway between the combatants, one of them on each side of the line of fire., Wilson was to count, very deliberately, ""One-two-three-fire!--stop!"", and the duelists could bang away at any time they chose during that recitation, but not after the last word., Angelo grew very nervous when he saw Wilson's hand rising slowly into the air as a sign to make ready, and he leaned his head against Luigi's and said:  ""Oh, please take me away from here, I can't stay, I know I can't!"", ""What in the world are you doing?, Straighten up!, What's the matter with you?--you're in no danger--nobody's going to shoot at you., Straighten up, I tell you!"", Angelo obeyed, just in time to hear:  ""One--!"", ""Bang!"", Just one report, and a little tuft of white hair floated slowly to the judge's feet in the moonlight., The judge did not swerve; he still stood erect and motionless, like a statue, with his pistol-arm hanging straight down at his side., He was reserving his fire., ""Two--!"", ""Three--""!, ""Fire--!"", Up came the pistol-arm instantly-Angelo dodged with the report., He said ""Ouch!"", and fainted again., The doctor examined and bandaged the wound., It was of no consequence, he said--bullet through fleshy part of arm--no bones broken the gentleman was still able to fight let the duel proceed., Next time Angelo jumped just as Luigi fired, which disordered his aim and caused him to cut a chip off of Howard's ear., The judge took his time again, and when he fired Angelo jumped and got a knuckle skinned., The doctor inspected and dressed the wounds., Angelo now spoke out and said he was content with the satisfaction he had got, and if the judge--but Luigi shut him roughly up, and asked him not to make an ass of himself; adding:  ""And I want you to stop dodging., You take a great deal too prominent a part in this thing for a person who has got nothing to do with it., You should remember that you are here only by courtesy, and are without official recognition; officially you are not here at all; officially you do not even exist., To all intents and purposes you are absent from this place, and you ought for your own modesty's sake to reflect that it cannot become a person who is not present here to be taking this sort of public and indecent prominence in a matter in which he is not in the slightest degree concerned., Now, don't dodge again; the bullets are not for you, they are for me; if I want them dodged I will attend to it myself., I never saw a person act so."", Angelo saw the reasonableness of what his brother had said, and he did try to reform, but it was of no use; both pistols went off at the same instant, and he jumped once more; he got a sharp scrape along his cheek from the judge's bullet, and so deflected Luigi's aim that his ball went wide and chipped flake of skin from Pudd'nhead Wilson's chin., The doctor attended to the wounded., By the terms, the duel was over., But Luigi was entirely out of patience, and begged for one exchange of shots, insisting that he had had no fair chance, on account of his brother's indelicate behavior., Howard was opposed to granting so unusual a privilege, but the judge took Luigi's part, and added that indeed he himself might fairly be considered entitled to another trial, because although the proxy on the other side was in no way to blame for his (the judge's) humiliatingly resultless work, the gentleman with whom he was fighting this duel was to blame for it, since if he had played no advantages and had held his head still, his proxy would have been disposed of early., He added:  ""Count Luigi's request for another exchange is another proof that he is a brave and chivalrous gentleman, and I beg that the courtesy he asks may be accorded him."", ""I thank you most sincerely for this generosity, Judge Driscoll,"" said Luigi, with a polite bow, and moving to his place., Then he added to Angelo, ""Now hold your grip, hold your grip, I tell you, and I'll land him sure!"", The men stood erect, their pistol-arms at their sides, the two seconds stood at their official posts, the doctor stood five paces in Wilson's rear with his instruments and bandages in his hands., ...]"|1
58|"[He had dreamed of her doing such a thing, some time before, and now he remembered that dream with apprehension and anger, and said that rather than see her unsex herself and go away with the armies, he would require her brothers to drown her; and that if they should refuse, he would do it with his own hands., But none of these things shook her purpose in the least., Her parents kept a strict watch upon her to keep her from leaving the village, but she said her time was not yet; that when the time to go was come she should know it, and then the keepers would watch in vain., The summer wasted along; and when it was seen that her purpose continued steadfast, the parents were glad of a chance which finally offered itself for bringing her projects to an end through marriage., The Paladin had the effrontery to pretend that she had engaged herself to him several years before, and now he claimed a ratification of the engagement., She said his statement was not true, and refused to marry him., She was cited to appear before the ecclesiastical court at Toul to answer for her perversity; when she declined to have counsel, and elected to conduct her case herself, her parents and all her ill-wishers rejoiced, and looked upon her as already defeated., And that was natural enough; for who would expect that an ignorant peasant-girl of sixteen would be otherwise than frightened and tongue-tied when standing for the first time in presence of the practised doctors of the law, and surrounded by the cold solemnities of a court?, Yet all these people were mistaken., They flocked to Toul to see and enjoy this fright and embarrassment and defeat, and they had their trouble for their pains., She was modest, tranquil, and quite at her ease., She called no witnesses, saying she would content herself with examining the witnesses for the prosecution., When they had testified, she rose and reviewed their testimony in a few words, pronounced it vague, confused, and of no force, then she placed the Paladin again on the stand and began to search him., His previous testimony went rag by rag to ruin under her ingenious hands, until at last he stood bare, so to speak, he that had come so richly clothed in fraud and falsehood., His counsel began an argument, but the court declined to hear it, and threw out the case, adding a few words of grave compliment for Joan, and referring to her as ""this marvelous child."", After this victory, with this high praise from so imposing a source added, the fickle village turned again, and gave Joan countenance, compliment, and peace., Her mother took her back to her heart, and even her father relented and said he was proud of her., But the time hung heavy on her hands, nevertheless, for the siege of Orleans was begun, the clouds lowered darker and darker over France, and still her Voices said wait, and gave her no direct commands., The winter set in, and wore tediously along; but at last there was a change., IN COURT AND CAMP  Joan Says Good-By  THE 5th of January, 1429, Joan came to me with her uncle Laxart, and said:  ""The time is come., My Voices are not vague now, but clear, and they have told me what to do., In two months I shall be with the Dauphin."", Her spirits were high, and her bearing martial., I caught the infection and felt a great impulse stirring in me that was like what one feels when he hears the roll of the drums and the tramp of marching men., ""I believe it,"" I said., ""I also believe it,"" said Laxart., ""If she had told me before, that she was commanded of God to rescue France, I should not have believed; I should have let her seek the governor by her own ways and held myself clear of meddling in the matter, not doubting she was mad., But I have seen her stand before those nobles and might men unafraid, and say her say; and she had not been able to do that but by the help of God., That I know., Therefore with all humbleness I am at her command, to do with me as she will."", ""My uncle is very good to me,"" Joan said., ""I sent and asked him to come and persuade my mother to let him take me home with him to tend his wife, who is not well., It is arranged, and we go at dawn to-morrow., From his house I shall go soon to Vaucouleurs, and wait and strive until my prayer is granted., Who were the two cavaliers who sat to your left at the governor's table that day?"", ""One was the Sieur Jean de Novelonpont de Metz, the other the Sieur Bertrand de Poulengy."", ""Good metal--good metal, both., I marked them for men of mine., ., ., ., What is it I see in your face?, Doubt?"", I was teaching myself to speak the truth to her, not trimming it or polishing it; so I said:  ""They considered you out of your head, and said so., It is true they pitied you for being in such misfortune, but still they held you to be mad."", This did not seem to trouble her in any way or wound her., She only said:  ""The wise change their minds when they perceive that they have been in error., These will., They will march with me., I shall see them presently., ., ., ., You seem to doubt again?, Do you doubt?"", ""N-no., Not now., I was remembering that it was a year ago, and that they did not belong here, but only chanced to stop a day on their journey."", ""They will come again., But as to matters now in hand; I came to leave with you some instructions., You will follow me in a few days., Order your affairs, for you will be absent long."", ""Will Jean and Pierre go with me?"", ""No; they would refuse now, but presently they will come, and with them they will bring my parents' blessing, and likewise their consent that I take up my mission., I shall be stronger, then--stronger for that; for lack of it I am weak now."", She paused a little while, and the tears gathered in her eyes; then she went on: ""I would say good-by to Little Mengette., Bring her outside the village at dawn; she must go with me a little of the way--""  ""And Haumette?"", She broke down and began to cry, saying:  ""No, oh, no--she is too dear to me, I could not bear it, knowing I should never look upon her face again."", Next morning I brought Mengette, and we four walked along the road in the cold dawn till the village was far behind; then the two girls said their good-bys, clinging about each other's neck, and pouring out their grief in loving words and tears, a pitiful sight to see., And Joan took one long look back upon the distant village, and the Fairy Tree, and the oak forest, and the flowery plain, and the river, as if she was trying to print these scenes on her memory so that they would abide there always and not fade, for she knew she would not see them any more in this life; then she turned, and went from us, sobbing bitterly., It was her birthday and mine., She was seventeen years old., The Governor Speeds Joan  After a few days, Laxart took Joan to Vaucouleurs, and found lodging and guardianship for her with Catherine Royer, a wheelwright's wife, an honest and good woman., Joan went to mass regularly, she helped do the housework, earning her keep in that way, and if any wished to talk with her about her mission--and many did--she talked freely, making no concealments regarding the matter now., I was soon housed near by, and witnessed the effects which followed., At once the tidings spread that a young girl was come who was appointed of God to save France., The common people flocked in crowds to look at her and speak with her, and her fair young loveliness won the half of their belief, and her deep earnestness and transparent sincerity won the other half., The well-to-do remained away and scoffed, but that is their way., Next, a prophecy of Merlin's, more than eight hundred years old, was called to mind, which said that in a far future time France would be lost by a woman and restored by a woman., France was now, for the first time, lost--and by a woman, Isabel of Bavaria, her base Queen; doubtless this fair and pure young girl was commissioned of Heaven to complete the prophecy., This gave the growing interest a new and powerful impulse; the excitement rose higher and higher, and hope and faith along with it; and so from Vaucouleurs wave after wave of this inspiring enthusiasm flowed out over the land, far and wide, invading all the villages and refreshing and revivifying the perishing children of France; and from these villages came people who wanted to see for themselves, hear for themselves; and they did see and hear, and believe., They filled the town; they more than filled it; inns and lodgings were packed, and yet half of the inflow had to go without shelter., And still they came, winter as it was, for when a man's soul is starving, what does he care for meat and roof so he can but get that nobler hunger fed?, Day after day, and still day after day the great tide rose., Domremy was dazed, amazed, stupefied, and said to itself, ""Was this world-wonder in our familiar midst all these years and we too dull to see it?"", Jean and Pierre went out from the village, stared at and envied like the great and fortunate of the earth, and their progress to Vaucouleurs was like a triumph, all the country-side flocking to see and salute the brothers of one with whom angels had spoken face to face, and into whose hands by command of God they had delivered the destinies of France., The brothers brought the parents' blessing and godspeed to Joan, and their promise to bring it to her in person later; and so, with this culminating happiness in her heart and the high hope it inspired, she went and confronted the governor again., But he was no more tractable than he had been before., He refused to send her to the King., She was disappointed, but in no degree discouraged., She said:  ""I must still come to you until I get the men-at-arms; for so it is commanded, and I may not disobey., I must go to the Dauphin, though I go on my knees."", I and the two brothers were with Joan daily, to see the people that came and hear what they said; and one day, sure enough, the Sieur Jean de Metz came., He talked with her in a petting and playful way, as one talks with children, and said:  ""What are you doing here, my little maid?, Will they drive the King out of France, and shall we all turn English?"", She answered him in her tranquil, serious way:  ""I am come to bid Robert de Baudricourt take or send me to the King, but he does not heed my words."", ""Ah, you have an admirable persistence, truly; a whole year has not turned you from your wish., I saw you when you came before."", Joan said, as tranquilly as before:  ""It is not a wish, it is a purpose., He will grant it., ...]"|1
59|"[All arrangements having been completed for the return of the main body of the army, she took the Bastard and La Hire and a thousand men and went down to Orleans, where all the town was in a fever of impatience to have sight of her face., It was eight in the evening when she and the troops rode in at the Burgundy gate, with the Paladin preceding her with her standard., She was riding a white horse, and she carried in her hand the sacred sword of Fierbois., You should have seen Orleans then., What a picture it was!, Such black seas of people, such a starry firmament of torches, such roaring whirlwinds of welcome, such booming of bells and thundering of cannon!, It was as if the world was come to an end., Everywhere in the glare of the torches one saw rank upon rank of upturned white faces, the mouths wide open, shouting, and the unchecked tears running down; Joan forged her slow way through the solid masses, her mailed form projecting above the pavement of heads like a silver statue., The people about her struggled along, gazing up at her through their tears with the rapt look of men and women who believe they are seeing one who is divine; and always her feet were being kissed by grateful folk, and such as failed of that privilege touched her horse and then kissed their fingers., Nothing that Joan did escaped notice; everything she did was commented upon and applauded., You could hear the remarks going all the time., ""There--she's smiling--see!"", ""Now she's taking her little plumed cap off to somebody--ah, it's fine and graceful!"", ""She's patting that woman on the head with her gauntlet."", ""Oh, she was born on a horse--see her turn in her saddle, and kiss the hilt of her sword to the ladies in the window that threw the flowers down."", ""Now there's a poor woman lifting up a child--she's kissed it--oh, she's divine!"", ""What a dainty little figure it is, and what a lovely face--and such color and animation!"", Joan's slender long banner streaming backward had an accident--the fringe caught fire from a torch., She leaned forward and crushed the flame in her hand., ""She's not afraid of fire nor anything!"", they shouted, and delivered a storm of admiring applause that made everything quake., She rode to the cathedral and gave thanks to God, and the people crammed the place and added their devotions to hers; then she took up her march again and picked her slow way through the crowds and the wilderness of torches to the house of Jacques Boucher, treasurer of the Duke of Orleans, where she was to be the guest of his wife as long as she stayed in the city, and have his young daughter for comrade and room-mate., The delirium of the people went on the rest of the night, and with it the clamor of the joy-bells and the welcoming cannon., Joan of Arc had stepped upon her stage at last, and was ready to begin., What the English Answered  SHE WAS ready, but must sit down and wait until there was an army to work with., Next morning, Saturday, April 30, 1429, she set about inquiring after the messenger who carried her proclamation to the English from Blois--the one which she had dictated at Poitiers., Here is a copy of it., It is a remarkable document, for several reasons: for its matter-of-fact directness, for its high spirit and forcible diction, and for its naive confidence in her ability to achieve the prodigious task which she had laid upon herself, or which had been laid upon her--which you please., All through it you seem to see the pomps of war and hear the rumbling of the drums., In it Joan's warrior soul is revealed, and for the moment the soft little shepherdess has disappeared from your view., This untaught country-damsel, unused to dictating anything at all to anybody, much less documents of state to kings and generals, poured out this procession of vigorous sentences as fluently as if this sort of work had been her trade from childhood:  JESUS MARIA King of England and you Duke of Bedford who call yourself Regent of France; William de la Pole, Earl of Suffolk; and you Thomas Lord Scales, who style yourselves lieutenants of the said Bedford--do right to the King of Heaven., Render to the Maid who is sent by God the keys of all the good towns you have taken and violated in France., She is sent hither by God, to restore the blood royal., She is very ready to make peace if you will do her right by giving up France and paying for what you have held., And you archers, companions of war, noble and otherwise, who are before the good city of Orleans, begone into your own land in God's name, or expect news from the Maid who will shortly go to see you to your very great hurt., King of England, if you do not so, I am chief of war, and whenever I shall find your people in France, I will drive them out, willing or not willing; and if they do not obey I will slay them all, but if they obey, I will have them to mercy., I am come hither by God, the King of Heaven, body for body, to put you our of France, in spite of those who would work treason and mischief against the kingdom., Think not you shall ever hold the kingdom from the King of Heaven, the Son of the Blessed Mary; King Charles shall hold it, for God wills it so, and has revealed it to him by the Maid., If you believe not the news sent by God through the Maid, wherever we shall met you we will strike boldly and make such a noise as has not been in France these thousand years., Be sure that God can send more strength to the Maid than you can bring to any assault against her and her good men-at-arms; and then we shall see who has the better right, the King of Heaven, or you., Duke of Bedford, the Maid prays you not to bring about your own destruction., If you do her right, you may yet go in her company where the French shall do the finest deed that has been done in Christendom, and if you do not, you shall be reminded shortly of your great wrongs., In that closing sentence she invites them to go on crusade with her to rescue the Holy Sepulcher., No answer had been returned to this proclamation, and the messenger himself had not come back., So now she sent her two heralds with a new letter warning the English to raise the siege and requiring them to restore that missing messenger., The heralds came back without him., All they brought was notice from the English to Joan that they would presently catch her and burn her if she did not clear out now while she had a chance, and ""go back to her proper trade of minding cows."", She held her peace, only saying it was a pity that the English would persist in inviting present disaster and eventual destruction when she was ""doing all she could to get them out of the country with their lives still in their bodies."", Presently she thought of an arrangement that might be acceptable, and said to the heralds, ""Go back and say to Lord Talbot this, from me: 'Come out of your bastilles with your host, and I will come with mine; if I beat you, go in peace out of France; if you beat me, burn me, according to your desire.'"", I did not hear this, but Dunois did, and spoke of it., The challenge was refused., Sunday morning her Voices or some instinct gave her a warning, and she sent Dunois to Blois to take command of the army and hurry it to Orleans., It was a wise move, for he found Regnault de Chartres and some more of the King's pet rascals there trying their best to disperse the army, and crippling all the efforts of Joan's generals to head it for Orleans., They were a fine lot, those miscreants., They turned their attention to Dunois now, but he had balked Joan once, with unpleasant results to himself, and was not minded to meddle in that way again., He soon had the army moving., My Exquisite Poem Goes to Smash  WE OF the personal staff were in fairyland now, during the few days that we waited for the return of the army., We went into society., To our two knights this was not a novelty, but to us young villagers it was a new and wonderful life., Any position of any sort near the person of the Maid of Vaucouleurs conferred high distinction upon the holder and caused his society to be courted; and so the D'Arc brothers, and Noel, and the Paladin, humble peasants at home, were gentlemen here, personages of weight and influence., It was fine to see how soon their country diffidences and awkwardnesses melted away under this pleasant sun of deference and disappeared, and how lightly and easily they took to their new atmosphere., The Paladin was as happy as it was possible for any one in this earth to be., His tongue went all the time, and daily he got new delight out of hearing himself talk., He began to enlarge his ancestry and spread it out all around, and ennoble it right and left, and it was not long until it consisted almost entirely of dukes., He worked up his old battles and tricked them out with fresh splendors; also with new terrors, for he added artillery now., We had seen cannon for the first time at Blois--a few pieces--here there was plenty of it, and now and then we had the impressive spectacle of a huge English bastille hidden from sight in a mountain of smoke from its own guns, with lances of red flame darting through it; and this grand picture, along with the quaking thunders pounding away in the heart of it, inflamed the Paladin's imagination and enabled him to dress out those ambuscade-skirmishes of ours with a sublimity which made it impossible for any to recognize them at all except people who had not been there., You may suspect that there was a special inspiration for these great efforts of the Paladin's, and there was., It was the daughter of the house, Catherine Boucher, who was eighteen, and gentle and lovely in her ways, and very beautiful., I think she might have been as beautiful as Joan herself, if she had had Joan's eyes., But that could never be., There was never but that one pair, there will never be another., Joan's eyes were deep and rich and wonderful beyond anything merely earthly., They spoke all the languages--they had no need of words., They produced all effects--and just by a glance, just a single glance; a glance that could convict a liar of his lie and make him confess it; that could bring down a proud man's pride and make him humble; that could put courage into a coward and strike dead the courage of the bravest; that could appease resentments and real hatreds; that could make the doubter believe and the hopeless hope again; that could purify the impure mind; that could persuade--ah, there it is--persuasion!, that is the word; what or who is it that it couldn't persuade?, The maniac of Domremy--the fairy-banishing priest--the reverend tribunal of Toul--the doubting and superstitious Laxart--the obstinate veteran of Vaucouleurs--the characterless heir of France--the sages and scholars of the Parliament and University of Poitiers--the darling of Satan, La Hire--the masterless Bastard of Orleans, accustomed to acknowledge no way as right and rational but his own--these were the trophies of that great gift that made her the wonder and mystery that she was., We mingled companionably with the great folk who flocked to the big house to make Joan's acquaintance, and they made much of us and we lived in the clouds, so to speak., But what we preferred even to this happiness was the quieter occasions, when the formal guests were gone and the family and a few dozen of its familiar friends were gathered together for a social good time., It was then that we did our best, we five youngsters, with such fascinations as we had, and the chief object of them was Catherine., None of us had ever been in love been in love before, and now we had the misfortune to all fall in love with the same person at the same time--which was the first moment we saw her., She was a merry heart, and full of life, and I still remember tenderly those few evenings that I was permitted to have my share of her dear society and of comradeship with that little company of charming people., The Paladin made us all jealous the first night, for when he got fairly started on those battles of his he had everything to himself, and there was no use in anybody else's trying to get any attention., Those people had been living in the midst of real war for seven months; and to hear this windy giant lay out his imaginary campaigns and fairly swim in blood and spatter it all around, entertained them to the verge of the grave., Catherine was like to die, for pure enjoyment., She didn't laugh loud--we, of course, wished she would--but kept in the shelter of a fan, and shook until there was danger that she would unhitch her ribs from her spine., Then when the Paladin had got done with a battle and we began to feel thankful and hope for a change, she would speak up in a way that was so sweet and persuasive that it rankled in me, and ask him about some detail or other in the early part of his battle which she said had greatly interested her, and would he be so good as to describe that part again and with a little more particularity?--which of course precipitated the whole battle on us, again, with a hundred lies added that had been overlooked before., I do not know how to make you realize the pain I suffered., I had never been jealous before, and it seemed intolerable that this creature should have this good fortune which he was so ill entitled to, and I have to sit and see myself neglected when I was so longing for the least little attention out of the thousand that this beloved girl was lavishing on him., I was near her, and tried two or three times to get started on some of the things that I had done in those battles--and I felt ashamed of myself, too, for stooping to such a business--but she cared for nothing but his battles, and could not be got to listen; and presently when one of my attempts caused her to lose some precious rag or other of his mendacities and she asked him to repeat, thus bringing on a new engagement, of course, and increasing the havoc and carnage tenfold, I felt so humiliated by this pitiful miscarriage of mine that I gave up and tried no more., The others were as outraged by the Paladin's selfish conduct as I was--and by his grand luck, too, of course--perhaps, indeed, that was the main hurt., We talked our trouble over together, which was natural, for rivals become brothers when a common affliction assails them and a common enemy bears off the victory., Each of us could do things that would please and get notice if it were not for this person, who occupied all the time and gave others no chance., I had made a poem, taking a whole night to it--a poem in which I most happily and delicately celebrated that sweet girl's charms, without mentioning her name, but any one could see who was meant; for the bare title--""The Rose of Orleans""--would reveal that, as it seemed to me., It pictured this pure and dainty white rose as growing up out of the rude soil of war and looking abroad out of its tender eyes upon the horrid machinery of death, and then--note this conceit--it blushes for the sinful nature of man, and turns red in a single night., Becomes a red rose, you see--a rose that was white before., The idea was my own, and quite new., Then it sent its sweet perfume out over the embattled city, and when the beleaguering forces smelt it they laid down their arms and wept., This was also my own idea, and new., That closed that part of the poem; then I put her into the similitude of the firmament--not the whole of it, but only part., That is to say, she was the moon, and all the constellations were following her about, their hearts in flames for love of her, but she would not halt, she would not listen, for 'twas thought she loved another., ...]"|1
60|"[And you led an assault again., Joan, it is tempting Providence., I want you to make me a promise., I want you to promise me that you will let others lead the assaults, if there must be assaults, and that you will take better care of yourself in those dreadful battles., Will you?"", But Joan fought away from the promise and did not give it., Catherine sat troubled and discontented awhile, then she said:  ""Joan, are you going to be a soldier always?, These wars are so long--so long., They last forever and ever and ever."", There was a glad flash in Joan's eye as she cried:  ""This campaign will do all the really hard work that is in front of it in the next four days., The rest of it will be gentler--oh, far less bloody., Yes, in four days France will gather another trophy like the redemption of Orleans and make her second long step toward freedom!"", Catherine started (and do did I); then she gazed long at Joan like one in a trance, murmuring ""four days--four days,"" as if to herself and unconsciously., Finally she asked, in a low voice that had something of awe in it:  ""Joan, tell me--how is it that you know that?, For you do know it, I think."", ""Yes,"" said Joan, dreamily, ""I know--I know., I shall strike--and strike again., And before the fourth day is finished I shall strike yet again."", She became silent., We sat wondering and still., This was for a whole minute, she looking at the floor and her lips moving but uttering nothing., Then came these words, but hardly audible: ""And in a thousand years the English power in France will not rise up from that blow."", It made my flesh creep., It was uncanny., She was in a trance again--I could see it--just as she was that day in the pastures of Domremy when she prophesied about us boys in the war and afterward did not know that she had done it., She was not conscious now; but Catherine did not know that, and so she said, in a happy voice:  ""Oh, I believe it, I believe it, and I am so glad!, Then you will come back and bide with us all your life long, and we will love you so, and honor you!"", A scarcely perceptible spasm flitted across Joan's face, and the dreamy voice muttered:  ""Before two years are sped I shall die a cruel death!"", I sprang forward with a warning hand up., That is why Catherine did not scream., She was going to do that--I saw it plainly., Then I whispered her to slip out of the place, and say nothing of what had happened., I said Joan was asleep--asleep and dreaming., Catherine whispered back, and said:  ""Oh, I am so grateful that it is only a dream!, It sounded like prophecy."", And she was gone., Like prophecy!, I knew it was prophecy; and I sat down crying, as knowing we should lose her., Soon she started, shivering slightly, and came to herself, and looked around and saw me crying there, and jumped out of her chair and ran to me all in a whirl of sympathy and compassion, and put her hand on my head, and said:  ""My poor boy!, What is it?, Look up and tell me."", I had to tell her a lie; I grieved to do it, but there was no other way., I picked up an old letter from my table, written by Heaven knows who, about some matter Heaven knows what, and told her I had just gotten it from Pere Fronte, and that in it it said the children's Fairy Tree had been chopped down by some miscreant or other, and-- I got no further., She snatched the letter from my hand and searched it up and down and all over, turning it this way and that, and sobbing great sobs, and the tears flowing down her cheeks, and ejaculating all the time, ""Oh, cruel, cruel!, how could any be so heartless?, Ah, poor Arbre Fee de Bourlemont gone--and we children loved it so!, Show me the place where it says it!"", And I, still lying, showed her the pretended fatal words on the pretended fatal page, and she gazed at them through her tears, and said she could see herself that they were hateful, ugly words--they ""had the very look of it."", Then we heard a strong voice down the corridor announcing:  ""His majesty's messenger--with despatches for her Excellency the Commander-in-Chief of the Armies of France!"", Fierce Talbot Reconsiders  I KNEW she had seen the wisdom of the Tree., But when?, I could not know., Doubtless before she had lately told the King to use her, for that she had but one year left to work in., It had not occurred to me at the time, but the conviction came upon me now that at that time she had already seen the Tree., It had brought her a welcome message; that was plain, otherwise she could not have been so joyous and light-hearted as she had been these latter days., The death-warning had nothing dismal about it for her; no, it was remission of exile, it was leave to come home., Yes, she had seen the Tree., No one had taken the prophecy to heart which she made to the King; and for a good reason, no doubt; no one wanted to take it to heart; all wanted to banish it away and forget it., And all had succeeded, and would go on to the end placid and comfortable., All but me alone., I must carry my awful secret without any to help me., A heavy load, a bitter burden; and would cost me a daily heartbreak., She was to die; and so soon., I had never dreamed of that., How could I, and she so strong and fresh and young, and every day earning a new right to a peaceful and honored old age?, For at that time I though old age valuable., I do not know why, but I thought so., All young people think it, I believe, they being ignorant and full of superstitions., She had seen the Tree., All that miserable night those ancient verses went floating back and forth through my brain:       And when, in exile wand'ring, we      Shall fainting yearn for glimpse of thee,      Oh, rise upon our sight!, But at dawn the bugles and the drums burst through the dreamy hush of the morning, and it was turn out all!, mount and ride., For there was red work to be done., We marched to Meung without halting., There we carried the bridge by assault, and left a force to hold it, the rest of the army marching away next morning toward Beaugency, where the lion Talbot, the terror of the French, was in command., When we arrived at that place, the English retired into the castle and we sat down in the abandoned town., Talbot was not at the moment present in person, for he had gone away to watch for and welcome Fastolfe and his reinforcement of five thousand men., Joan placed her batteries and bombarded the castle till night., Then some news came: Richemont, Constable of France, this long time in disgrace with the King, largely because of the evil machinations of La Tremouille and his party, was approaching with a large body of men to offer his services to Joan--and very much she needed them, now that Fastolfe was so close by., Richemont had wanted to join us before, when we first marched on Orleans; but the foolish King, slave of those paltry advisers of his, warned him to keep his distance and refused all reconciliation with him., I go into these details because they are important., Important because they lead up to the exhibition of a new gift in Joan's extraordinary mental make-up--statesmanship., It is a sufficiently strange thing to find that great quality in an ignorant country-girl of seventeen and a half, but she had it., Joan was for receiving Richemont cordially, and so was La Hire and the two young Lavals and other chiefs, but the Lieutenant-General, d'Alencon, strenuously and stubbornly opposed it., He said he had absolute orders from the King to deny and defy Richemont, and that if they were overridden he would leave the army., This would have been a heavy disaster, indeed., But Joan set herself the task of persuading him that the salvation of France took precedence of all minor things--even the commands of a sceptered ass; and she accomplished it., She persuaded him to disobey the King in the interest of the nation, and to be reconciled to Count Richemont and welcome him., That was statesmanship; and of the highest and soundest sort., Whatever thing men call great, look for it in Joan of Arc, and there you will find it., In the early morning, June 17th, the scouts reported the approach of Talbot and Fastolfe with Fastolfe's succoring force., Then the drums beat to arms; and we set forth to meet the English, leaving Richemont and his troops behind to watch the castle of Beaugency and keep its garrison at home., By and by we came in sight of the enemy., Fastolfe had tried to convince Talbot that it would be wisest to retreat and not risk a battle with Joan at this time, but distribute the new levies among the English strongholds of the Loire, thus securing them against capture; then be patient and wait--wait for more levies from Paris; let Joan exhaust her army with fruitless daily skirmishing; then at the right time fall upon her in resistless mass and annihilate her., He was a wise old experienced general, was Fastolfe., But that fierce Talbot would hear of no delay., He was in a rage over the punishment which the Maid had inflicted upon him at Orleans and since, and he swore by God and Saint George that he would have it out with her if he had to fight her all alone., So Fastolfe yielded, though he said they were now risking the loss of everything which the English had gained by so many years' work and so many hard knocks., The enemy had taken up a strong position, and were waiting, in order of battle, with their archers to the front and a stockade before them., Night was coming on., ...]"|1
61|"[It was a most joyful meeting, that you will easily know; and also as sad as it was joyful., We could not speak Joan's name., One's voice would have broken down., We knew who was meant when she was mentioned; we could say ""she"" and ""her,"" but we could not speak the name., We talked of the personal staff., Old D'Aulon, wounded and a prisoner, was still with Joan and serving her, by permission of the Duke of Burgundy., Joan was being treated with respect due to her rank and to her character as a prisoner of war taken in honorable conflict., And this was continued--as we learned later--until she fell into the hands of that bastard of Satan, Pierre Cauchon, Bishop of Beauvais., Noel was full of noble and affectionate praises and appreciations of our old boastful big Standard-Bearer, now gone silent forever, his real and imaginary battles all fought, his work done, his life honorably closed and completed., ""And think of his luck!"", burst out Noel, with his eyes full of tears., ""Always the pet child of luck!, ""See how it followed him and stayed by him, from his first step all through, in the field or out of it; always a splendid figure in the public eye, courted and envied everywhere; always having a chance to do fine things and always doing them; in the beginning called the Paladin in joke, and called it afterward in earnest because he magnificently made the title good; and at last--supremest luck of all--died in the field!, died with his harness on; died faithful to his charge the Standard in his hand; died--oh, think of it--with the approving eye of Joan of Arc upon him!, ""He drained the cup of glory to the last drop, and went jubilant to his peace, blessedly spared all part in the disaster which was to follow., What luck, what luck!, And we?, What was our sin that we are still here, we who have also earned our place with the happy dead?"", And presently he said:  ""They tore the sacred Standard from his dead hand and carried it away, their most precious prize after its captured owner., But they haven't it now., A month ago we put our lives upon the risk--our two good knights, my fellow-prisoners, and I--and stole it, and got it smuggled by trusty hands to Orleans, and there it is now, safe for all time in the Treasury."", I was glad and grateful to learn that., I have seen it often since, when I have gone to Orleans on the 8th of May to be the petted old guest of the city and hold the first place of honor at the banquets and in the processions--I mean since Joan's brothers passed from this life., It will still be there, sacredly guarded by French love, a thousand years from now--yes, as long as any shred of it hangs together., [1] Two or three weeks after this talk came the tremendous news like a thunder-clap, and we were aghast--Joan of Arc sold to the English!, Not for a moment had we ever dreamed of such a thing., We were young, you see, and did not know the human race, as I have said before., We had been so proud of our country, so sure of her nobleness, her magnanimity, her gratitude., We had expected little of the King, but of France we had expected everything., Everybody knew that in various towns patriot priests had been marching in procession urging the people to sacrifice money, property, everything, and buy the freedom of their heaven-sent deliverer., That the money would be raised we had not thought of doubting., But it was all over now, all over., It was a bitter time for us., The heavens seemed hung with black; all cheer went out from our hearts., Was this comrade here at my bedside really Noel Rainguesson, that light-hearted creature whose whole life was but one long joke, and who used up more breath in laughter than in keeping his body alive?, No, no; that Noel I was to see no more., This one's heart was broken., He moved grieving about, and absently, like one in a dream; the stream of his laughter was dried at its source., Well, that was best., It was my own mood., We were company for each other., He nursed me patiently through the dull long weeks, and at last, in January, I was strong enough to go about again., Then he said:  ""Shall we go now?"", ""Yes."", There was no need to explain., Our hearts were in Rouen; we would carry our bodies there., All that we cared for in this life was shut up in that fortress., We could not help her, but it would be some solace to us to be near her, to breathe the air that she breathed, and look daily upon the stone walls that hid her., What if we should be made prisoners there?, Well, we could but do our best, and let luck and fate decide what should happen., And so we started., We could not realize the change which had come upon the country., We seemed able to choose our own route and go whenever we pleased, unchallenged and unmolested., When Joan of Arc was in the field there was a sort of panic of fear everywhere; but now that she was out of the way, fear had vanished., Nobody was troubled about you or afraid of you, nobody was curious about you or your business, everybody was indifferent., We presently saw that we could take to the Seine, and not weary ourselves out with land travel., So we did it, and were carried in a boat to within a league of Rouen., Then we got ashore; not on the hilly side, but on the other, where it is as level as a floor., Nobody could enter or leave the city without explaining himself., It was because they feared attempts at a rescue of Joan., We had no trouble., We stopped in the plain with a family of peasants and stayed a week, helping them with their work for board and lodging, and making friends of them., We got clothes like theirs, and wore them., When we had worked our way through their reserves and gotten their confidence, we found that they secretly harbored French hearts in their bodies., Then we came out frankly and told them everything, and found them ready to do anything they could to help us., Our plan was soon made, and was quite simple., It was to help them drive a flock of sheep to the market of the city., One morning early we made the venture in a melancholy drizzle of rain, and passed through the frowning gates unmolested., Our friends had friends living over a humble wine shop in a quaint tall building situated in one of the narrow lanes that run down from the cathedral to the river, and with these they bestowed us; and the next day they smuggled our own proper clothing and other belongings to us., The family that lodged us--the Pieroons--were French in sympathy, and we needed to have no secrets from them., [1] It remained there three hundred and sixty years, and then was destroyed in a public bonfire, together with two swords, a plumed cap, several suits of state apparel, and other relics of the Maid, by a mob in the time of the Revolution., Nothing which the hand of Joan of Arc is known to have touched now remains in existence except a few preciously guarded military and state papers which she signed, her pen being guided by a clerk or her secretary, Louis de Conte., A boulder exists from which she is known to have mounted her horse when she was once setting out upon a campaign., Up to a quarter of a century ago there was a single hair from her head still in existence., It was drawn through the wax of a seal attached to the parchment of a state document., It was surreptitiously snipped out, seal and all, by some vandal relic-hunter, and carried off., Doubtless it still exists, but only the thief knows where., -- TRANSLATOR., Weaving the Net About Her  IT WAS necessary for me to have some way to gain bread for Noel and myself; and when the Pierrons found that I knew how to write, the applied to their confessor in my behalf, and he got a place for me with a good priest named Manchon, who was to be the chief recorder in the Great Trial of Joan of Arc now approaching., It was a strange position for me--clerk to the recorder--and dangerous if my sympathies and the late employment should be found out., But there was not much danger., Manchon was at bottom friendly to Joan and would not betray me; and my name would not, for I had discarded my surname and retained only my given one, like a person of low degree., I attended Manchon constantly straight along, out of January and into February, and was often in the citadel with him--in the very fortress where Joan was imprisoned, though not in the dungeon where she was confined, and so did not see her, of course., Manchon told me everything that had been happening before my coming., Ever since the purchase of Joan, Cauchon had been busy packing his jury for the destruction of the Maid--weeks and weeks he had spent in this bad industry., The University of Paris had sent him a number of learned and able and trusty ecclesiastics of the stripe he wanted; and he had scraped together a clergyman of like stripe and great fame here and there and yonder, until he was able to construct a formidable court numbering half a hundred distinguished names., French names they were, but their interests and sympathies were English., A great officer of the Inquisition was also sent from Paris for the accused must be tried by the forms of the Inquisition; but this was a brave and righteous man, and he said squarely that this court had no power to try the case, wherefore he refused to act; and the same honest talk was uttered by two or three others., The Inquisitor was right., The case as here resurrected against Joan had already been tried long ago at Poitiers, and decided in her favor., Yes, and by a higher tribunal than this one, for at the head of it was an Archbishop--he of Rheims--Cauchon's own metropolitan., So here, you see, a lower court was impudently preparing to try and redecide a cause which had already been decided by its superior, a court of higher authority., Imagine it!, No, the case could not properly be tried again., Cauchon could not properly preside in this new court, for more than one reason:  Rouen was not in his diocese; Joan had not been arrested in her domicile, which was still Domremy; and finally this proposed judge was the prisoner's outspoken enemy, and therefore he was incompetent to try her., Yet all these large difficulties were gotten rid of., The territorial Chapter of Rouen finally granted territorial letters to Cauchon--though only after a struggle and under compulsion., Force was also applied to the Inquisitor, and he was obliged to submit., So then, the little English King, by his representative, formally delivered Joan into the hands of the court, but with this reservation: if the court failed to condemn her, he was to have her back again!, Ah, dear, what chance was there for that forsaken and friendless child?, ...]"|1
62|"[The Tenth Article was resentful against her for ""pretending"" that St. Catherine and St.  Marguerite spoke French and not English, and were French in their politics., The Twelve were to be submitted first to the learned doctors of theology of the University of Paris for approval., They were copied out and ready by the night of April 4th., Then Manchon did another bold thing: he wrote in the margin that many of the Twelve put statements in Joan's mouth which were the exact opposite of what she had said., That fact would not be considered important by the University of Paris, and would not influence its decision or stir its humanity, in case it had any--which it hadn't when acting in a political capacity, as at present--but it was a brave thing for that good Manchon to do, all the same., The Twelve were sent to Paris next day, April 5th., That afternoon there was a great tumult in Rouen, and excited crowds were flocking through all the chief streets, chattering and seeking for news; for a report had gone abroad that Joan of Arc was sick until death., In truth, these long seances had worn her out, and she was ill indeed., The heads of the English party were in a state of consternation; for if Joan should die uncondemned by the Church and go to the grave unsmirched, the pity and the love of the people would turn her wrongs and sufferings and death into a holy martyrdom, and she would be even a mightier power in France dead than she had been when alive., The Earl of Warwick and the English Cardinal (Winchester) hurried to the castle and sent messengers flying for physicians., Warwick was a hard man, a rude, coarse man, a man without compassion., There lay the sick girl stretched in her chains in her iron cage--not an object to move man to ungentle speech, one would think; yet Warwick spoke right out in her hearing and said to the physicians:  ""Mind you take good care of her., The King of England has no mind to have her die a natural death., She is dear to him, for he bought her dear, and he does not want her to die, save at the stake., Now then, mind you cure her."", The doctors asked Joan what had made her ill. She said the Bishop of Beauvais had sent her a fish and she thought it was that., Then Jean d'Estivet burst out on her, and called her names and abused her., He understood Joan to be charging the Bishop with poisoning her, you see; and that was not pleasing to him, for he was one of Cauchon's most loving and conscienceless slaves, and it outraged him to have Joan injure his master in the eyes of these great English chiefs, these being men who could ruin Cauchon and would promptly do it if they got the conviction that he was capable of saving Joan from the stake by poisoning her and thus cheating the English out of all the real value gainable by her purchase from the Duke of Burgundy., Joan had a high fever, and the doctors proposed to bleed her., Warwick said:  ""Be careful about that; she is smart and is capable of killing herself."", He meant that to escape the stake she might undo the bandage and let herself bleed to death., But the doctors bled her anyway, and then she was better., Not for long, though., Jean d'Estivet could not hold still, he was so worried and angry about the suspicion of poisoning which Joan had hinted at; so he came back in the evening and stormed at her till he brought the fever all back again., When Warwick heard of this he was in a fine temper, you may be sure, for here was his prey threatening to escape again, and all through the over-zeal of this meddling fool., Warwick gave D'Estivet a quite admirable cursing--admirable as to strength, I mean, for it was said by persons of culture that the art of it was not good--and after that the meddler kept still., Joan remained ill more than two weeks; then she grew better., She was still very weak, but she could bear a little persecution now without much danger to her life., It seemed to Cauchon a good time to furnish it., So he called together some of his doctors of theology and went to her dungeon., Manchon and I went along to keep the record--that is, to set down what might be useful to Cauchon, and leave out the rest., The sight of Joan gave me a shock., Why, she was but a shadow!, It was difficult for me to realize that this frail little creature with the sad face and drooping form was the same Joan of Arc that I had so often seen, all fire and enthusiasm, charging through a hail of death and the lightning and thunder of the guns at the head of her battalions., It wrung my heart to see her looking like this., But Cauchon was not touched., He made another of those conscienceless speeches of his, all dripping with hypocrisy and guile., He told Joan that among her answers had been some which had seemed to endanger religion; and as she was ignorant and without knowledge of the Scriptures, he had brought some good and wise men to instruct her, if she desired it., Said he, ""We are churchmen, and disposed by our good will as well as by our vocation to procure for you the salvation of your soul and your body, in every way in our power, just as we would do the like for our nearest kin or for ourselves., In this we but follow the example of Holy Church, who never closes the refuge of her bosom against any that are willing to return."", Joan thanked him for these sayings and said:  ""I seem to be in danger of death from this malady; if it be the pleasure of God that I die here, I beg that I may be heard in confession and also receive my Saviour; and that I may be buried in consecrated ground."", Cauchon thought he saw his opportunity at last; this weakened body had the fear of an unblessed death before it and the pains of hell to follow., This stubborn spirit would surrender now., So he spoke out and said:  ""Then if you want the Sacraments, you must do as all good Catholics do, and submit to the Church."", He was eager for her answer; but when it came there was no surrender in it, she still stood to her guns., She turned her head away and said wearily:  ""I have nothing more to say."", Cauchon's temper was stirred, and he raised his voice threateningly and said that the more she was in danger of death the more she ought to amend her life; and again he refused the things she begged for unless she would submit to the Church., Joan said:  ""If I die in this prison I beg you to have me buried in holy ground; if you will not, I cast myself upon my Saviour."", There was some more conversation of the like sort, then Cauchon demanded again, and imperiously, that she submit herself and all her deeds to the Church., His threatening and storming went for nothing., That body was weak, but the spirit in it was the spirit of Joan of Arc; and out of that came the steadfast answer which these people were already so familiar with and detested so sincerely:  ""Let come what may., I will neither do nor say any otherwise than I have said already in your tribunals."", Then the good theologians took turn about and worried her with reasonings and arguments and Scriptures; and always they held the lure of the Sacraments before her famishing soul, and tried to bribe her with them to surrender her mission to the Church's judgment--that is to their judgment--as if they were the Church!, But it availed nothing., I could have told them that beforehand, if they had asked me., But they never asked me anything; I was too humble a creature for their notice., Then the interview closed with a threat; a threat of fearful import; a threat calculated to make a Catholic Christian feel as if the ground were sinking from under him:  ""The Church calls upon you to submit; disobey, and she will abandon you as if you were a pagan!"", Think of being abandoned by the Church!--that August Power in whose hands is lodged the fate of the human race; whose scepter stretches beyond the furthest constellation that twinkles in the sky; whose authority is over millions that live and over the billions that wait trembling in purgatory for ransom or doom; whose smile opens the gates of heaven to you, whose frown delivers you to the fires of everlasting hell; a Power whose dominion overshadows and belittles the pomps and shows of a village., To be abandoned by one's King--yes, that is death, and death is much; but to be abandoned by Rome, to be abandoned by the Church!, Ah, death is nothing to that, for that is consignment to endless life--and such a life!, I could see the red waves tossing in that shoreless lake of fire, I could see the black myriads of the damned rise out of them and struggle and sink and rise again; and I knew that Joan was seeing what I saw, while she paused musing; and I believed that she must yield now, and in truth I hoped she would, for these men were able to make the threat good and deliver her over to eternal suffering, and I knew that it was in their natures to do it., But I was foolish to think that thought and hope that hope., Joan of Arc was not made as others are made., Fidelity to principle, fidelity to truth, fidelity to her word, all these were in her bone and in her flesh--they were parts of her., She could not change, she could not cast them out., She was the very genius of Fidelity; she was Steadfastness incarnated., Where she had taken her stand and planted her foot, there she would abide; hell itself could not move her from that place., Her Voices had not given her permission to make the sort of submission that was required, therefore she would stand fast., She would wait, in perfect obedience, let come what might., My heart was like lead in my body when I went out from that dungeon; but she--she was serene, she was not troubled., She had done what she believed to be her duty, and that was sufficient; the consequences were not her affair., The last thing she said that time was full of this serenity, full of contented repose:  ""I am a good Christian born and baptized, and a good Christian I will die."", 15 Undaunted by Threat of Burning  TWO WEEKS went by; the second of May was come, the chill was departed out of the air, the wild flowers were springing in the glades and glens, the birds were piping in the woods, all nature was brilliant with sunshine, all spirits were renewed and refreshed, all hearts glad, the world was alive with hope and cheer, the plain beyond the Seine stretched away soft and rich and green, the river was limpid and lovely, the leafy islands were dainty to see, and flung still daintier reflections of themselves upon the shining water; and from the tall bluffs above the bridge Rouen was become again a delight to the eye, the most exquisite and satisfying picture of a town that nestles under the arch of heaven anywhere., When I say that all hearts were glad and hopeful, I mean it in a general sense., There were exceptions--we who were the friends of Joan of Arc, also Joan of Arc herself, that poor girl shut up there in that frowning stretch of mighty walls and towers: brooding in darkness, so close to the flooding downpour of sunshine yet so impossibly far away from it; so longing for any little glimpse of it, yet so implacably denied it by those wolves in the black gowns who were plotting her death and the blackening of her good name., Cauchon was ready to go on with his miserable work., He had a new scheme to try now., He would see what persuasion could do--argument, eloquence, poured out upon the incorrigible captive from the mouth of a trained expert., That was his plan., But the reading of the Twelve Articles to her was not a part of it., No, even Cauchon was ashamed to lay that monstrosity before her; even he had a remnant of shame in him, away down deep, a million fathoms deep, and that remnant asserted itself now and prevailed., On this fair second of May, then, the black company gathered itself together in the spacious chamber at the end of the great hall of the castle--the Bishop of Beauvais on his throne, and sixty-two minor judges massed before him, with the guards and recorders at their stations and the orator at his desk., Then we heard the far clank of chains, and presently Joan entered with her keepers and took her seat upon her isolated bench., She was looking well now, and most fair and beautiful after her fortnight's rest from wordy persecution., She glanced about and noted the orator., Doubtless she divined the situation., The orator had written his speech all out, and had it in his hand, though he held it back of him out of sight., It was so thick that it resembled a book., He began flowing, but in the midst of a flowery period his memory failed him and he had to snatch a furtive glance at his manuscript--which much injured the effect., Again this happened, and then a third time., The poor man's face was red with embarrassment, the whole great house was pitying him, which made the matter worse; then Joan dropped in a remark which completed the trouble., She said:  ""Read your book--and then I will answer you!"", Why, it was almost cruel the way those moldy veterans laughed; and as for the orator, he looked so flustered and helpless that almost anybody would have pitied him, and I had difficulty to keep from doing it myself., Yes, Joan was feeling very well after her rest, and the native mischief that was in her lay near the surface., It did not show when she made the remark, but I knew it was close in there back of the words., When the orator had gotten back his composure he did a wise thing; for he followed Joan's advice: he made no more attempts at sham impromptu oratory, but read his speech straight from his ""book."", In the speech he compressed the Twelve Articles into six, and made these his text., Every now and then he stopped and asked questions, and Joan replied., The nature of the Church Militant was explained, and once more Joan was asked to submit herself to it., She gave her usual answer., ...]"|1

it's all right, or He'd 'a' fixed it some other way., Go on--I see plenty plain enough, now, that them thieves didn't get way with the di'monds., Why didn't they, do you reckon?"", ""Because they got chased away by them other two men before they could pull the boots off of the corpse."", ""That's so!, I see it now., But looky here, Tom, why ain't we to go and tell about it?"", ""Oh, shucks, Huck Finn, can't you see?, Look at it., What's a-going to happen?, There's going to be an inquest in the morning., Them two men will tell how they heard the yells and rushed there just in time to not save the stranger., Then the jury'll twaddle and twaddle and twaddle, and finally they'll fetch in a verdict that he got shot or stuck or busted over the head with something, and come to his death by the inspiration of God., And after they've buried him they'll auction off his things for to pay the expenses, and then's OUR chance."", ""How, Tom?"", ""Buy the boots for two dollars!"", Well, it 'most took my breath., ""My land!, Why, Tom, WE'LL get the di'monds!"", ""You bet., Some day there'll be a big reward offered for them--a thousand dollars, sure., That's our money!, Now we'll trot in and see the folks., And mind you we don't know anything about any murder, or any di'monds, or any thieves--don't you forget that."", I had to sigh a little over the way he had got it fixed., I'd 'a' SOLD them di'monds--yes, sir--for twelve thousand dollars; but I didn't say anything., It wouldn't done any good., I says:  ""But what are we going to tell your aunt Sally has made us so long getting down here from the village, Tom?"", ""Oh, I'll leave that to you,"" he says., ""I reckon you can explain it somehow."", He was always just that strict and delicate., He never would tell a lie himself., We struck across the big yard, noticing this, that, and t'other thing that was so familiar, and we so glad to see it again, and when we got to the roofed big passageway betwixt the double log house and the kitchen part, there was everything hanging on the wall just as it used to was, even to Uncle Silas's old faded green baize working-gown with the hood to it, and raggedy white patch between the shoulders that always looked like somebody had hit him with a snowball; and then we lifted the latch and walked in., Aunt Sally she was just a-ripping and a-tearing around, and the children was huddled in one corner, and the old man he was huddled in the other and praying for help in time of need., She jumped for us with joy and tears running down her face and give us a whacking box on the ear, and then hugged us and kissed us and boxed us again, and just couldn't seem to get enough of it, she was so glad to see us; and she says:  ""Where HAVE you been a-loafing to, you good-for-nothing trash!, I've been that worried about you I didn't know what to do., Your traps has been here ever so long, and I've had supper cooked fresh about four times so as to have it hot and good when you come, till at last my patience is just plumb wore out, and I declare I--I--why I could skin you alive!, You must be starving, poor things!--set down, set down, everybody; don't lose no more time."", It was good to be there again behind all that noble corn-pone and spareribs, and everything that you could ever want in this world., Old Uncle Silas he peeled off one of his bulliest old-time blessings, with as many layers to it as an onion, and whilst the angels was hauling in the slack of it I was trying to study up what to say about what kept us so long., When our plates was all loadened and we'd got a-going, she asked me, and I says:  ""Well, you see,--er--Mizzes--""  ""Huck Finn!, Since when am I Mizzes to you?, Have I ever been stingy of cuffs or kisses for you since the day you stood in this room and I took you for Tom Sawyer and blessed God for sending you to me, though you told me four thousand lies and I believed every one of them like a simpleton?, Call me Aunt Sally--like you always done."", So I done it., And I says:  ""Well, me and Tom allowed we would come along afoot and take a smell of the woods, and we run across Lem Beebe and Jim Lane, and they asked us to go with them blackberrying to-night, and said they could borrow Jubiter Dunlap's dog, because he had told them just that minute--""  ""Where did they see him?"", says the old man; and when I looked up to see how HE come to take an intrust in a little thing like that, his eyes was just burning into me, he was that eager., It surprised me so it kind of throwed me off, but I pulled myself together again and says:  ""It was when he was spading up some ground along with you, towards sundown or along there."", He only said, ""Um,"" in a kind of a disappointed way, and didn't take no more intrust., So I went on., I says:  ""Well, then, as I was a-saying--""  ""That'll do, you needn't go no furder."", It was Aunt Sally., She was boring right into me with her eyes, and very indignant., ""Huck Finn,"" she says, ""how'd them men come to talk about going a-black-berrying in September--in THIS region?"", I see I had slipped up, and I couldn't say a word., She waited, still a-gazing at me, then she says:  ""And how'd they come to strike that idiot idea of going a-blackberrying in the night?"", ""Well, m'm, they--er--they told us they had a lantern, and--""  ""Oh, SHET up--do!, Looky here; what was they going to do with a dog?--hunt blackberries with it?"", ""I think, m'm, they--""  ""Now, Tom Sawyer, what kind of a lie are you fixing YOUR mouth to contribit to this mess of rubbage?, Speak out--and I warn you before you begin, that I don't believe a word of it., You and Huck's been up to something you no business to--I know it perfectly well; I know you, BOTH of you., Now you explain that dog, and them blackberries, and the lantern, and the rest of that rot--and mind you talk as straight as a string--do you hear?"", Tom he looked considerable hurt, and says, very dignified:  ""It is a pity if Huck is to be talked to that way, just for making a little bit of a mistake that anybody could make."", ""What mistake has he made?"", ...]"|1
64|"[Mr. Thomas and I were the contestants., He won the lead and went to the bat--so to speak., And there he stood, with the crotch of his cue resting against his disk while the ship rose slowly up, sank slowly down, rose again, sank again., She never seemed to rise to suit him exactly., She started up once more; and when she was nearly ready for the turn, he let drive and landed his disk just within the left-hand end of the 10., (Applause)., The umpire proclaimed ""a good 10,"" and the game-keeper set it down., I played: my disk grazed the edge of Mr. Thomas's disk, and went out of the diagram., (No applause.), Mr. Thomas played again--and landed his second disk alongside of the first, and almost touching its right-hand side., ""Good 10."", (Great applause.), I played, and missed both of them., (No applause.), Mr. Thomas delivered his third shot and landed his disk just at the right of the other two., ""Good 10."", (Immense applause.), There they lay, side by side, the three in a row., It did not seem possible that anybody could miss them., Still I did it., (Immense silence.), Mr. Thomas played his last disk., It seems incredible, but he actually landed that disk alongside of the others, and just to the right of them-a straight solid row of 4 disks., (Tumultuous and long-continued applause.), Then I played my last disk., Again it did not seem possible that anybody could miss that row--a row which would have been 14 inches long if the disks had been clamped together; whereas, with the spaces separating them they made a longer row than that., But I did it., It may be that I was getting nervous., I think it unlikely that that innings has ever had its parallel in the history of horse-billiards., To place the four disks side by side in the 10 was an extraordinary feat; indeed, it was a kind of miracle., To miss them was another miracle., It will take a century to produce another man who can place the four disks in the 10; and longer than that to find a man who can't knock them out., I was ashamed of my performance at the time, but now that I reflect upon it I see that it was rather fine and difficult., Mr. Thomas kept his luck, and won the game, and later the championship., In a minor tournament I won the prize, which was a Waterbury watch., I put it in my trunk., In Pretoria, South Africa, nine months afterward, my proper watch broke down and I took the Waterbury out, wound it, set it by the great clock on the Parliament House (8.05), then went back to my room and went to bed, tired from a long railway journey., The parliamentary clock had a peculiarity which I was not aware of at the time --a peculiarity which exists in no other clock, and would not exist in that one if it had been made by a sane person; on the half-hour it strikes the succeeding hour, then strikes the hour again, at the proper time., I lay reading and smoking awhile; then, when I could hold my eyes open no longer and was about to put out the light, the great clock began to boom, and I counted ten., I reached for the Waterbury to see how it was getting along., It was marking 9.30., It seemed rather poor speed for a three-dollar watch, but I supposed that the climate was affecting it., I shoved it half an hour ahead; and took to my book and waited to see what would happen., At 10 the great clock struck ten again., I looked--the Waterbury was marking half-past 10., This was too much speed for the money, and it troubled me., I pushed the hands back a half hour, and waited once more; I had to, for I was vexed and restless now, and my sleepiness was gone., By and by the great clock struck 11., The Waterbury was marking 10.30., I pushed it ahead half an hour, with some show of temper., By and by the great clock struck 11 again., The Waterbury showed up 11.30, now, and I beat her brains out against the bedstead., I was sorry next day, when I found out., To return to the ship., The average human being is a perverse creature; and when he isn't that, he is a practical joker., The result to the other person concerned is about the same: that is, he is made to suffer., The washing down of the decks begins at a very early hour in all ships; in but few ships are any measures taken to protect the passengers, either by waking or warning them, or by sending a steward to close their ports., And so the deckwashers have their opportunity, and they use it., They send a bucket of water slashing along the side of the ship and into the ports, drenching the passenger's clothes, and often the passenger himself., This good old custom prevailed in this ship, and under unusually favorable circumstances, for in the blazing tropical regions a removable zinc thing like a sugarshovel projects from the port to catch the wind and bring it in; this thing catches the wash-water and brings it in, too--and in flooding abundance., Mrs. L, an invalid, had to sleep on the locker--sofa under her port, and every time she over-slept and thus failed to take care of herself, the deck-washers drowned her out., And the painters, what a good time they had!, This ship would be going into dock for a month in Sydney for repairs; but no matter, painting was going on all the time somewhere or other., The ladies' dresses were constantly getting ruined, nevertheless protests and supplications went for nothing., Sometimes a lady, taking an afternoon nap on deck near a ventilator or some other thing that didn't need painting, would wake up by and by and find that the humorous painter had been noiselessly daubing that thing and had splattered her white gown all over with little greasy yellow spots., The blame for this untimely painting did not lie with the ship's officers, but with custom., As far back as Noah's time it became law that ships must be constantly painted and fussed at when at sea; custom grew out of the law, and at sea custom knows no death; this custom will continue until the sea goes dry., Sept., 8.--Sunday., We are moving so nearly south that we cross only about two meridians of longitude a day., This morning we were in longitude 178 west from Greenwich, and 57 degrees west from San Francisco., To-morrow we shall be close to the center of the globe--the 180th degree of west longitude and 180th degree of east longitude., And then we must drop out a day-lose a day out of our lives, a day never to be found again., We shall all die one day earlier than from the beginning of time we were foreordained to die., We shall be a day behindhand all through eternity., We shall always be saying to the other angels, ""Fine day today,"" and they will be always retorting, ""But it isn't to-day, it's tomorrow."", We shall be in a state of confusion all the time and shall never know what true happiness is., Next Day., Sure enough, it has happened., Yesterday it was September 8, Sunday; to-day, per the bulletin-board at the head of the companionway, it is September 10, Tuesday., There is something uncanny about it., And uncomfortable., In fact, nearly unthinkable, and wholly unrealizable, when one comes to consider it., While we were crossing the 180th meridian it was Sunday in the stern of the ship where my family were, and Tuesday in the bow where I was., They were there eating the half of a fresh apple on the 8th, and I was at the same time eating the other half of it on the 10th--and I could notice how stale it was, already., The family were the same age that they were when I had left them five minutes before, but I was a day older now than I was then., The day they were living in stretched behind them half way round the globe, across the Pacific Ocean and America and Europe; the day I was living in stretched in front of me around the other half to meet it., They were stupendous days for bulk and stretch; apparently much larger days than we had ever been in before., All previous days had been but shrunk-up little things by comparison., The difference in temperature between the two days was very marked, their day being hotter than mine because it was closer to the equator., Along about the moment that we were crossing the Great Meridian a child was born in the steerage, and now there is no way to tell which day it was born on., The nurse thinks it was Sunday, the surgeon thinks it was Tuesday., The child will never know its own birthday., It will always be choosing first one and then the other, and will never be able to make up its mind permanently., This will breed vacillation and uncertainty in its opinions about religion, and politics, and business, and sweethearts, and everything, and will undermine its principles, and rot them away, and make the poor thing characterless, and its success in life impossible., Every one in the ship says so., And this is not all--in fact, not the worst., For there is an enormously rich brewer in the ship who said as much as ten days ago, that if the child was born on his birthday he would give it ten thousand dollars to start its little life with., His birthday was Monday, the 9th of September., If the ships all moved in the one direction--westward, I mean--the world would suffer a prodigious loss--in the matter of valuable time, through the dumping overboard on the Great Meridian of such multitudes of days by ships crews and passengers., ...]"|1
65|"[That is to say, the product of the individual Indian, annually (for export some whither), is worth $1.15; that of the individual Australasian (for export some whither), $75!, Or, to put it in another way, the Indian family of man and wife and three children sends away an annual result worth $8.75, while the Australasian family sends away $375 worth., There are trustworthy statistics furnished by Sir Richard Temple and others, which show that the individual Indian's whole annual product, both for export and home use, is worth in gold only $7.50; or, $37.50 for the family-aggregate., Ciphered out on a like ratio of multiplication, the Australasian family's aggregate production would be nearly $1,600., Truly, nothing is so astonishing as figures, if they once get started., We left Melbourne by rail for Adelaide, the capital of the vast Province of South Australia--a seventeen-hour excursion., On the train we found several Sydney friends; among them a Judge who was going out on circuit, and was going to hold court at Broken Hill, where the celebrated silver mine is., It seemed a curious road to take to get to that region., Broken Hill is close to the western border of New South Wales, and Sydney is on the eastern border., A fairly straight line, 700 miles long, drawn westward from Sydney, would strike Broken Hill, just as a somewhat shorter one drawn west from Boston would strike Buffalo., The way the Judge was traveling would carry him over 2,000 miles by rail, he said; southwest from Sydney down to Melbourne, then northward up to Adelaide, then a cant back northeastward and over the border into New South Wales once more--to Broken Hill., It was like going from Boston southwest to Richmond, Virginia, then northwest up to Erie, Pennsylvania, then a cant back northeast and over the border--to Buffalo, New York., But the explanation was simple., Years ago the fabulously rich silver discovery at Broken Hill burst suddenly upon an unexpectant world., Its stocks started at shillings, and went by leaps and bounds to the most fanciful figures., It was one of those cases where the cook puts a month's wages into shares, and comes next mouth and buys your house at your own price, and moves into it herself; where the coachman takes a few shares, and next month sets up a bank; and where the common sailor invests the price of a spree, and next month buys out the steamship company and goes into business on his own hook., In a word, it was one of those excitements which bring multitudes of people to a common center with a rush, and whose needs must be supplied, and at once., Adelaide was close by, Sydney was far away., Adelaide threw a short railway across the border before Sydney had time to arrange for a long one; it was not worth while for Sydney to arrange at all., The whole vast trade-profit of Broken Hill fell into Adelaide's hands, irrevocably., New South Wales furnishes for Broken Hill and sends her Judges 2,000 miles--mainly through alien countries--to administer it, but Adelaide takes the dividends and makes no moan., We started at 4.20 in the afternoon, and moved across level until night., In the morning we had a stretch of ""scrub"" country--the kind of thing which is so useful to the Australian novelist., In the scrub the hostile aboriginal lurks, and flits mysteriously about, slipping out from time to time to surprise and slaughter the settler; then slipping back again, and leaving no track that the white man can follow., In the scrub the novelist's heroine gets lost, search fails of result; she wanders here and there, and finally sinks down exhausted and unconscious, and the searchers pass within a yard or two of her, not suspecting that she is near, and by and by some rambler finds her bones and the pathetic diary which she had scribbled with her failing hand and left behind., Nobody can find a lost heroine in the scrub but the aboriginal ""tracker,"" and he will not lend himself to the scheme if it will interfere with the novelist's plot., The scrub stretches miles and miles in all directions, and looks like a level roof of bush-tops without a break or a crack in it --as seamless as a blanket, to all appearance., One might as well walk under water and hope to guess out a route and stick to it, I should think., Yet it is claimed that the aboriginal ""tracker"" was able to hunt out people lost in the scrub., Also in the ""bush""; also in the desert; and even follow them over patches of bare rocks and over alluvial ground which had to all appearance been washed clear of footprints., From reading Australian books and talking with the people, I became convinced that the aboriginal tracker's performances evince a craft, a penetration, a luminous sagacity, and a minuteness and accuracy of observation in the matter of detective-work not found in nearly so remarkable a degree in any other people, white or colored., In an official account of the blacks of Australia published by the government of Victoria, one reads that the aboriginal not only notices the faint marks left on the bark of a tree by the claws of a climbing opossum, but knows in some way or other whether the marks were made to-day or yesterday., And there is the case, on records where A., a settler, makes a bet with B., that B. may lose a cow as effectually as he can, and A. will produce an aboriginal who will find her., B. selects a cow and lets the tracker see the cow's footprint, then be put under guard., B. then drives the cow a few miles over a course which drifts in all directions, and frequently doubles back upon itself; and he selects difficult ground all the time, and once or twice even drives the cow through herds of other cows, and mingles her tracks in the wide confusion of theirs., He finally brings his cow home; the aboriginal is set at liberty, and at once moves around in a great circle, examining all cow-tracks until he finds the one he is after; then sets off and follows it throughout its erratic course, and ultimately tracks it to the stable where B. has hidden the cow., Now wherein does one cow-track differ from another?, There must be a difference, or the tracker could not have performed the feat; a difference minute, shadowy, and not detectible by you or me, or by the late Sherlock Holmes, and yet discernible by a member of a race charged by some people with occupying the bottom place in the gradations of human intelligence., It is easier to stay out than get out., The train was now exploring a beautiful hill country, and went twisting in and out through lovely little green valleys., There were several varieties of gum trees; among them many giants., Some of them were bodied and barked like the sycamore; some were of fantastic aspect, and reminded one of the quaint apple trees in Japanese pictures., And there was one peculiarly beautiful tree whose name and breed I did not know., The foliage seemed to consist of big bunches of pine-spines, the lower half of each bunch a rich brown or old-gold color, the upper half a most vivid and strenuous and shouting green., The effect was altogether bewitching., The tree was apparently rare., I should say that the first and last samples of it seen by us were not more than half an hour apart., There was another tree of striking aspect, a kind of pine, we were told., Its foliage was as fine as hair, apparently, and its mass sphered itself above the naked straight stem like an explosion of misty smoke., It was not a sociable sort; it did not gather in groups or couples, but each individual stood far away from its nearest neighbor., It scattered itself in this spacious and exclusive fashion about the slopes of swelling grassy great knolls, and stood in the full flood of the wonderful sunshine; and as far as you could see the tree itself you could also see the ink-black blot of its shadow on the shining green carpet at its feet., On some part of this railway journey we saw gorse and broom--importations from England--and a gentleman who came into our compartment on a visit tried to tell me which--was which; but as he didn't know, he had difficulty., He said he was ashamed of his ignorance, but that he had never been confronted with the question before during the fifty years and more that he had spent in Australia, and so he had never happened to get interested in the matter., But there was no need to be ashamed., The most of us have his defect., We take a natural interest in novelties, but it is against nature to take an interest in familiar things., The gorse and the broom were a fine accent in the landscape., Here and there they burst out in sudden conflagrations of vivid yellow against a background of sober or sombre color, with a so startling effect as to make a body catch his breath with the happy surprise of it., And then there was the wattle, a native bush or tree, an inspiring cloud of sumptuous yellow bloom., It is a favorite with the Australians, and has a fine fragrance, a quality usually wanting in Australian blossoms., The gentleman who enriched me with the poverty of his formation about the gorse and the broom told me that he came out from England a youth of twenty and entered the Province of South Australia with thirty-six shillings in his pocket--an adventurer without trade, profession, or friends, but with a clearly-defined purpose in his head: he would stay until he was worth L200, then go back home., He would allow himself five years for the accumulation of this fortune., ""That was more than fifty years ago,"" said he., ""And here I am, yet."", As he went out at the door he met a friend, and turned and introduced him to me, and the friend and I had a talk and a smoke., I spoke of the previous conversation and said there something very pathetic about this half century of exile, and that I wished the L200 scheme had succeeded., ""With him?, Oh, it did., It's not so sad a case., He is modest, and he left out some of the particulars., The lad reached South Australia just in time to help discover the Burra-Burra copper mines., They turned out L700,000 in the first three years., Up to now they have yielded L120,000,000., He has had his share., Before that boy had been in the country two years he could have gone home and bought a village; he could go now and buy a city, I think., No, there is nothing very pathetic about his case., He and his copper arrived at just a handy time to save South Australia., It had got mashed pretty flat under the collapse of a land boom a while before."", There it is again; picturesque history --Australia's specialty., In 1829 South Australia hadn't a white man in it., In 1836 the British Parliament erected it--still a solitude--into a Province, and gave it a governor and other governmental machinery., Speculators took hold, now, and inaugurated a vast land scheme, and invited immigration, encouraging it with lurid promises of sudden wealth., It was well worked in London; and bishops, statesmen, and all ports of people made a rush for the land company's shares., Immigrants soon began to pour into the region of Adelaide and select town lots and farms in the sand and the mangrove swamps by the sea., The crowds continued to come, prices of land rose high, then higher and still higher, everybody was prosperous and happy, the boom swelled into gigantic proportions., A village of sheet iron huts and clapboard sheds sprang up in the sand, and in these wigwams fashion made display; richly-dressed ladies played on costly pianos, London swells in evening dress and patent-leather boots were abundant, and this fine society drank champagne, and in other ways conducted itself in this capital of humble sheds as it had been accustomed to do in the aristocratic quarters of the metropolis of the world., The provincial government put up expensive buildings for its own use, and a palace with gardens for the use of its governor., The governor had a guard, and maintained a court., Roads, wharves, and hospitals were built., All this on credit, on paper, on wind, on inflated and fictitious values--on the boom's moonshine, in fact., This went on handsomely during four or five years., Then of a sudden came a smash., Bills for a huge amount drawn the governor upon the Treasury were dishonored, the land company's credit went up in smoke, a panic followed, values fell with a rush, the frightened immigrants seized their grips and fled to other lands, leaving behind them a good imitation of a solitude, where lately had been a buzzing and populous hive of men., Adelaide was indeed almost empty; its population had fallen to 3,000., During two years or more the death-trance continued., Prospect of revival there was none; hope of it ceased., Then, as suddenly as the paralysis had come, came the resurrection from it., Those astonishingly rich copper mines were discovered, and the corpse got up and danced., The wool production began to grow; grain-raising followed--followed so vigorously, too, that four or five years after the copper discovery, this little colony, which had had to import its breadstuffs formerly, and pay hard prices for them--once $50 a barrel for flour--had become an exporter of grain., The prosperities continued., ...]"|1
66|"[And to Ed's eager inquiry as to what made them act as they had been acting, they answered evasively, and pretended that they had put it up as a joke, to see what he would do., It was the best explanation they could invent at such short notice., And each said to himself, ""He never delivered that letter, and the joke is on us, if he only knew it or we were dull enough to come out and tell."", Then, of course, they wanted to know all about the trip; and he said--  ""Come right up on the boiler deck and order the drinks it's my treat., I'm going to tell you all about it., And to-night it's my treat again --and we'll have oysters and a time!"", When the drinks were brought and cigars lighted, Ed said:  ""Well, when, I delivered the letter to Mr. Vanderbilt----""  ""Great Scott!"", ""Gracious, how you scared me., What's the matter?"", ""Oh--er--nothing., Nothing--it was a tack in the chair-seat,"" said one., ""But you all said it., However, no matter., When I delivered the letter----""  ""Did you deliver it?"", And they looked at each other as people might who thought that maybe they were dreaming., Then they settled to listening; and as the story deepened and its marvels grew, the amazement of it made them dumb, and the interest of it took their breath., They hardly uttered a whisper during two hours, but sat like petrifactions and drank in the immortal romance., At last the tale was ended, and Ed said--  ""And it's all owing to you, boys, and you'll never find me ungrateful --bless your hearts, the best friends a fellow ever had!, You'll all have places; I want every one of you., I know you--I know you 'by the back,' as the gamblers say., You're jokers, and all that, but you're sterling, with the hallmark on., And Charley Fairchild, you shall be my first assistant and right hand, because of your first-class ability, and because you got me the letter, and for your father's sake who wrote it for me, and to please Mr. Vanderbilt, who said it would!, And here's to that great man--drink hearty!"", Yes, when the Moment comes, the Man appears--even if he is a thousand miles away, and has to be discovered by a practical joke., When people do not respect us we are sharply offended; yet deep down in his private heart no man much respects himself., Necessarily, the human interest is the first interest in the log-book of any country., The annals of Tasmania, in whose shadow we were sailing, are lurid with that feature., Tasmania was a convict-dump, in old times; this has been indicated in the account of the Conciliator, where reference is made to vain attempts of desperate convicts to win to permanent freedom, after escaping from Macquarrie Harbor and the ""Gates of Hell."", In the early days Tasmania had a great population of convicts, of both sexes and all ages, and a bitter hard life they had., In one spot there was a settlement of juvenile convicts--children--who had been sent thither from their home and their friends on the other side of the globe to expiate their ""crimes."", In due course our ship entered the estuary called the Derwent, at whose head stands Hobart, the capital of Tasmania., The Derwent's shores furnish scenery of an interesting sort., The historian Laurie, whose book, ""The Story of Australasia,"" is just out, invoices its features with considerable truth and intemperance: ""The marvelous picturesqueness of every point of view, combined with the clear balmy atmosphere and the transparency of the ocean depths, must have delighted and deeply impressed"" the early explorers., ""If the rock-bound coasts, sullen, defiant, and lowering, seemed uninviting, these were occasionally broken into charmingly alluring coves floored with golden sand, clad with evergreen shrubbery, and adorned with every variety of indigenous wattle, she-oak, wild flower, and fern, from the delicately graceful 'maiden-hair' to the palm-like 'old man'; while the majestic gum-tree, clean and smooth as the mast of 'some tall admiral' pierces the clear air to the height of 230 feet or more."", It looked so to me., ""Coasting along Tasman's Peninsula, what a shock of pleasant wonder must have struck the early mariner on suddenly sighting Cape Pillar, with its cluster of black-ribbed basaltic columns rising to a height of 900 feet, the hydra head wreathed in a turban of fleecy cloud, the base lashed by jealous waves spouting angry fountains of foam."", That is well enough, but I did not suppose those snags were 900 feet high., Still they were a very fine show., They stood boldly out by themselves, and made a fascinatingly odd spectacle., But there was nothing about their appearance to suggest the heads of a hydra., They looked like a row of lofty slabs with their upper ends tapered to the shape of a carving-knife point; in fact, the early voyager, ignorant of their great height, might have mistaken them for a rusty old rank of piles that had sagged this way and that out of the perpendicular., The Peninsula is lofty, rocky, and densely clothed with scrub, or brush, or both., It is joined to the main by a low neck., At this junction was formerly a convict station called Port Arthur--a place hard to escape from., Behind it was the wilderness of scrub, in which a fugitive would soon starve; in front was the narrow neck, with a cordon of chained dogs across it, and a line of lanterns, and a fence of living guards, armed., We saw the place as we swept by--that is, we had a glimpse of what we were told was the entrance to Port Arthur., The glimpse was worth something, as a remembrancer, but that was all., The voyage thence up the Derwent Frith displays a grand succession of fairy visions, in its entire length elsewhere unequaled., In gliding over the deep blue sea studded with lovely islets luxuriant to the water's edge, one is at a loss which scene to choose for contemplation and to admire most., When the Huon and Bruni have been passed, there seems no possible chance of a rival; but suddenly Mount Wellington, massive and noble like his brother Etna, literally heaves in sight, sternly guarded on either hand by Mounts Nelson and Rumney; presently we arrive at Sullivan's Cove--Hobart!, It is an attractive town., It sits on low hills that slope to the harbor --a harbor that looks like a river, and is as smooth as one., Its still surface is pictured with dainty reflections of boats and grassy banks and luxuriant foliage., Back of the town rise highlands that are clothed in woodland loveliness, and over the way is that noble mountain, Wellington, a stately bulk, a most majestic pile., How beautiful is the whole region, for form, and grouping, and opulence, and freshness of foliage, and variety of color, and grace and shapeliness of the hills, the capes, the, promontories; and then, the splendor of the sunlight, the dim rich distances, the charm of the water-glimpses!, And it was in this paradise that the yellow-liveried convicts were landed, and the Corps-bandits quartered, and the wanton slaughter of the kangaroo-chasing black innocents consummated on that autumn day in May, in the brutish old time., It was all out of keeping with the place, a sort of bringing of heaven and hell together., The remembrance of this paradise reminds me that it was at Hobart that we struck the head of the procession of Junior Englands., We were to encounter other sections of it in New Zealand, presently, and others later in Natal., Wherever the exiled Englishman can find in his new home resemblances to his old one, he is touched to the marrow of his being; the love that is in his heart inspires his imagination, and these allied forces transfigure those resemblances into authentic duplicates of the revered originals., It is beautiful, the feeling which works this enchantment, and it compels one's homage; compels it, and also compels one's assent--compels it always--even when, as happens sometimes, one does not see the resemblances as clearly as does the exile who is pointing them out., The resemblances do exist, it is quite true; and often they cunningly approximate the originals--but after all, in the matter of certain physical patent rights there is only one England., Now that I have sampled the globe, I am not in doubt., There is a beauty of Switzerland, and it is repeated in the glaciers and snowy ranges of many parts of the earth; there is a beauty of the fiord, and it is repeated in New Zealand and Alaska; there is a beauty of Hawaii, and it is repeated in ten thousand islands of the Southern seas; there is a beauty of the prairie and the plain, and it is repeated here and there in the earth; each of these is worshipful, each is perfect in its way, yet holds no monopoly of its beauty; but that beauty which is England is alone--it has no duplicate., It is made up of very simple details--just grass, and trees, and shrubs, and roads, and hedges, and gardens, and houses, and vines, and churches, and castles, and here and there a ruin--and over it all a mellow dream-haze of history., But its beauty is incomparable, and all its own., Hobart has a peculiarity--it is the neatest town that the sun shines on; and I incline to believe that it is also the cleanest., However that may be, its supremacy in neatness is not to be questioned., There cannot be another town in the world that has no shabby exteriors; no rickety gates and fences, no neglected houses crumbling to ruin, no crazy and unsightly sheds, no weed-grown front-yards of the poor, no back-yards littered with tin cans and old boots and empty bottles, no rubbish in the gutters, no clutter on the sidewalks, no outer-borders fraying out into dirty lanes and tin-patched huts., No, in Hobart all the aspects are tidy, and all a comfort to the eye; the modestest cottage looks combed and brushed, and has its vines, its flowers, its neat fence, its neat gate, its comely cat asleep on the window ledge., We had a glimpse of the museum, by courtesy of the American gentleman who is curator of it., It has samples of half-a-dozen different kinds of marsupials--[A marsupial is a plantigrade vertebrate whose specialty is its pocket., In some countries it is extinct, in the others it is rare., The first American marsupials were Stephen Girard, Mr. Aston and the opossum; the principal marsupials of the Southern Hemisphere are Mr. Rhodes, and the kangaroo., I, myself, am the latest marsupial., Also, I might boast that I have the largest pocket of them all., But there is nothing in that.], --one, the ""Tasmanian devil;"" that is, I think he was one of them., And there was a fish with lungs., When the water dries up it can live in the mud., Most curious of all was a parrot that kills sheep., On one great sheep-run this bird killed a thousand sheep in a whole year., He doesn't want the whole sheep, but only the kidney-fat., This restricted taste makes him an expensive bird to support., To get the fat he drives his beak in and rips it out; the wound is mortal., This parrot furnishes a notable example of evolution brought about by changed conditions., When the sheep culture was introduced, it presently brought famine to the parrot by exterminating a kind of grub which had always thitherto been the parrot's diet., The miseries of hunger made the bird willing to eat raw flesh, since it could get no other food, and it began to pick remnants of meat from sheep skins hung out on the fences to dry., It soon came to prefer sheep meat to any other food, and by and by it came to prefer the kidney-fat to any other detail of the sheep., The parrot's bill was not well shaped for digging out the fat, but Nature fixed that matter; she altered the bill's shape, and now the parrot can dig out kidney-fat better than the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, or anybody else, for that matter--even an Admiral., And there was another curiosity--quite a stunning one, I thought: Arrow-heads and knives just like those which Primeval Man made out of flint, and thought he had done such a wonderful thing--yes, and has been humored and coddled in that superstition by this age of admiring scientists until there is probably no living with him in the other world by now., Yet here is his finest and nicest work exactly duplicated in our day; and by people who have never heard of him or his works: by aborigines who lived in the islands of these seas, within our time., And they not only duplicated those works of art but did it in the brittlest and most treacherous of substances--glass: made them out of old brandy bottles flung out of the British camps; millions of tons of them., It is time for Primeval Man to make a little less noise, now., He has had his day., He is not what he used to be., We had a drive through a bloomy and odorous fairy-land, to the Refuge for the Indigent--a spacious and comfortable home, with hospitals, etc., for both sexes., There was a crowd in there, of the oldest people I have ever seen., It was like being suddenly set down in a new world--a weird world where Youth has never been, a world sacred to Age, and bowed forms, and wrinkles., Out of the 359 persons present, 223, were ex-convicts, and could have told stirring tales, no doubt, if they had been minded to talk; 42 of the 359 were past 80, and several were close upon 90; the average age at death there is 76 years., ...]"|1
67|"[Hence corpses must not be burned, neither must they be buried., None may touch the dead or enter the Towers where they repose except certain men who are officially appointed for that purpose., They receive high pay, but theirs is a dismal life, for they must live apart from their species, because their commerce with the dead defiles them, and any who should associate with them would share their defilement., When they come out of the Tower the clothes they are wearing are exchanged for others, in a building within the grounds, and the ones which they have taken off are left behind, for they are contaminated, and must never be used again or suffered to go outside the grounds., These bearers come to every funeral in new garments., So far as is known, no human being, other than an official corpse-bearer--save one--has ever entered a Tower of Silence after its consecration., Just a hundred years ago a European rushed in behind the bearers and fed his brutal curiosity with a glimpse of the forbidden mysteries of the place., This shabby savage's name is not given; his quality is also concealed., These two details, taken in connection with the fact that for his extraordinary offense the only punishment he got from the East India Company's Government was a solemn official ""reprimand""--suggest the suspicion that he was a European of consequence., The same public document which contained the reprimand gave warning that future offenders of his sort, if in the Company's service, would be dismissed; and if merchants, suffer revocation of license and exile to England., The Towers are not tall, but are low in proportion to their circumference, like a gasometer., If you should fill a gasometer half way up with solid granite masonry, then drive a wide and deep well down through the center of this mass of masonry, you would have the idea of a Tower of Silence., On the masonry surrounding the well the bodies lie, in shallow trenches which radiate like wheel-spokes from the well., The trenches slant toward the well and carry into it the rainfall., Underground drains, with charcoal filters in them, carry off this water from the bottom of the well., When a skeleton has lain in the Tower exposed to the rain and the flaming sun a month it is perfectly dry and clean., Then the same bearers that brought it there come gloved and take it up with tongs and throw it into the well., There it turns to dust., It is never seen again, never touched again, in the world., Other peoples separate their dead, and preserve and continue social distinctions in the grave--the skeletons of kings and statesmen and generals in temples and pantheons proper to skeletons of their degree, and the skeletons of the commonplace and the poor in places suited to their meaner estate; but the Parsees hold that all men rank alike in death--all are humble, all poor, all destitute., In sign of their poverty they are sent to their grave naked, in sign of their equality the bones of the rich, the poor, the illustrious and the obscure are flung into the common well together., At a Parsee funeral there are no vehicles; all concerned must walk, both rich and poor, howsoever great the distance to be traversed may be., In the wells of the Five Towers of Silence is mingled the dust of all the Parsee men and women and children who have died in Bombay and its vicinity during the two centuries which have elapsed since the Mohammedan conquerors drove the Parsees out of Persia, and into that region of India., The earliest of the five towers was built by the Modi family something more than 200 years ago, and it is now reserved to the heirs of that house; none but the dead of that blood are carried thither., The origin of at least one of the details of a Parsee funeral is not now known--the presence of the dog., Before a corpse is borne from the house of mourning it must be uncovered and exposed to the gaze of a dog; a dog must also be led in the rear of the funeral., Mr. Nusserwanjee Byranijee, Secretary to the Parsee Punchayet, said that these formalities had once had a meaning and a reason for their institution, but that they were survivals whose origin none could now account for., Custom and tradition continue them in force, antiquity hallows them., It is thought that in ancient times in Persia the dog was a sacred animal and could guide souls to heaven; also that his eye had the power of purifying objects which had been contaminated by the touch of the dead; and that hence his presence with the funeral cortege provides an ever-applicable remedy in case of need., The Parsees claim that their method of disposing of the dead is an effective protection of the living; that it disseminates no corruption, no impurities of any sort, no disease-germs; that no wrap, no garment which has touched the dead is allowed to touch the living afterward; that from the Towers of Silence nothing proceeds which can carry harm to the outside world., These are just claims, I think., As a sanitary measure, their system seems to be about the equivalent of cremation, and as sure., We are drifting slowly--but hopefully--toward cremation in these days., It could not be expected that this progress should be swift, but if it be steady and continuous, even if slow, that will suffice., When cremation becomes the rule we shall cease to shudder at it; we should shudder at burial if we allowed ourselves to think what goes on in the grave., The dog was an impressive figure to me, representing as he did a mystery whose key is lost., He was humble, and apparently depressed; and he let his head droop pensively, and looked as if he might be trying to call back to his mind what it was that he had used to symbolize ages ago when he began his function., There was another impressive thing close at hand, but I was not privileged to see it., That was the sacred fire--a fire which is supposed to have been burning without interruption for more than two centuries; and so, living by the same heat that was imparted to it so long ago., The Parsees are a remarkable community., There are only about 60,000 in Bombay, and only about half as many as that in the rest of India; but they make up in importance what they lack in numbers., They are highly educated, energetic, enterprising, progressive, rich, and the Jew himself is not more lavish or catholic in his charities and benevolences., The Parsees build and endow hospitals, for both men and animals; and they and their womenkind keep an open purse for all great and good objects., They are a political force, and a valued support to the government., They have a pure and lofty religion, and they preserve it in its integrity and order their lives by it., We took a final sweep of the wonderful view of plain and city and ocean, and so ended our visit to the garden and the Towers of Silence; and the last thing I noticed was another symbol--a voluntary symbol this one; it was a vulture standing on the sawed-off top of a tall and slender and branchless palm in an open space in the ground; he was perfectly motionless, and looked like a piece of sculpture on a pillar., And he had a mortuary look, too, which was in keeping with the place., There is an old-time toast which is golden for its beauty., ""When you ascend the hill of prosperity may you not meet a friend."", The next picture that drifts across the field of my memory is one which is connected with religious things., We were taken by friends to see a Jain temple., It was small, and had many flags or streamers flying from poles standing above its roof; and its little battlements supported a great many small idols or images., Upstairs, inside, a solitary Jain was praying or reciting aloud in the middle of the room., Our presence did not interrupt him, nor even incommode him or modify his fervor., Ten or twelve feet in front of him was the idol, a small figure in a sitting posture., It had the pinkish look of a wax doll, but lacked the doll's roundness of limb and approximation to correctness of form and justness of proportion., Mr. Gandhi explained every thing to us., He was delegate to the Chicago Fair Congress of Religions., It was lucidly done, in masterly English, but in time it faded from me, and now I have nothing left of that episode but an impression: a dim idea of a religious belief clothed in subtle intellectual forms, lofty and clean, barren of fleshly grossnesses; and with this another dim impression which connects that intellectual system somehow with that crude image, that inadequate idol --how, I do not know., Properly they do not seem to belong together., Apparently the idol symbolized a person who had become a saint or a god through accessions of steadily augmenting holiness acquired through a series of reincarnations and promotions extending over many ages; and was now at last a saint and qualified to vicariously receive worship and transmit it to heaven's chancellery., Was that it?, And thence we went to Mr. Premchand Roychand's bungalow, in Lovelane, Byculla, where an Indian prince was to receive a deputation of the Jain community who desired to congratulate him upon a high honor lately conferred upon him by his sovereign, Victoria, Empress of India., She had made him a knight of the order of the Star of India., It would seem that even the grandest Indian prince is glad to add the modest title ""Sir"" to his ancient native grandeurs, and is willing to do valuable service to win it., He will remit taxes liberally, and will spend money freely upon the betterment of the condition of his subjects, if there is a knighthood to be gotten by it., And he will also do good work and a deal of it to get a gun added to the salute allowed him by the British Government., Every year the Empress distributes knighthoods and adds guns for public services done by native princes., The salute of a small prince is three or four guns; princes of greater consequence have salutes that run higher and higher, gun by gun,--oh, clear away up to eleven; possibly more, but I did not hear of any above eleven-gun princes., I was told that when a four-gun prince gets a gun added, he is pretty troublesome for a while, till the novelty wears off, for he likes the music, and keeps hunting up pretexts to get himself saluted., It may be that supremely grand folk, like the Nyzam of Hyderabad and the Gaikwar of Baroda, have more than eleven guns, but I don't know., When we arrived at the bungalow, the large hall on the ground floor was already about full, and carriages were still flowing into the grounds., The company present made a fine show, an exhibition of human fireworks, so to speak, in the matters of costume and comminglings of brilliant color., The variety of form noticeable in the display of turbans was remarkable., We were told that the explanation of this was, that this Jain delegation was drawn from many parts of India, and that each man wore the turban that was in vogue in his own region., This diversity of turbans made a beautiful effect., I could have wished to start a rival exhibition there, of Christian hats and clothes., I would have cleared one side of the room of its Indian splendors and repacked the space with Christians drawn from America, England, and the Colonies, dressed in the hats and habits of now, and of twenty and forty and fifty years ago., It would have been a hideous exhibition, a thoroughly devilish spectacle., Then there would have been the added disadvantage of the white complexion., It is not an unbearably unpleasant complexion when it keeps to itself, but when it comes into competition with masses of brown and black the fact is betrayed that it is endurable only because we are used to it., Nearly all black and brown skins are beautiful, but a beautiful white skin is rare., How rare, one may learn by walking down a street in Paris, New York, or London on a week-day particularly an unfashionable street--and keeping count of the satisfactory complexions encountered in the course of a mile., Where dark complexions are massed, they make the whites look bleached-out, unwholesome, and sometimes frankly ghastly., I could notice this as a boy, down South in the slavery days before the war., The splendid black satin skin of the South African Zulus of Durban seemed to me to come very close to perfection., I can see those Zulus yet--'ricksha athletes waiting in front of the hotel for custom; handsome and intensely black creatures, moderately clothed in loose summer stuffs whose snowy whiteness made the black all the blacker by contrast., Keeping that group in my mind, I can compare those complexions with the white ones which are streaming past this London window now:       A lady., Complexion, new parchment., Another lady., Complexion, old      parchment., Another., Pink and white, very fine., Man., Grayish skin, with purple areas., Man., Unwholesome fish-belly skin., Girl., Sallow face, sprinkled with freckles., Old woman., ...]"|1
68|"[At first I was strongly interested in the tree, for I was told that it was the renowned peepul--the tree in whose shadow you cannot tell a lie., This one failed to stand the test, and I went away from it disappointed., There was a softly creaking well close by, and a couple of oxen drew water from it by the hour, superintended by two natives dressed in the usual ""turban and pocket-handkerchief."", The tree and the well were the only scenery, and so the compound was a soothing and lonesome and satisfying place; and very restful after so many activities., There was nobody in our bungalow but ourselves; the other guests were in the next one, where the table d'hote was furnished., A body could not be more pleasantly situated., Each room had the customary bath attached--a room ten or twelve feet square, with a roomy stone-paved pit in it and abundance of water., One could not easily improve upon this arrangement, except by furnishing it with cold water and excluding the hot, in deference to the fervency of the climate; but that is forbidden., It would damage the bather's health., The stranger is warned against taking cold baths in India, but even the most intelligent strangers are fools, and they do not obey, and so they presently get laid up., I was the most intelligent fool that passed through, that year., But I am still more intelligent now., Now that it is too late., I wonder if the 'dorian', if that is the name of it, is another superstition, like the peepul tree., There was a great abundance and variety of tropical fruits, but the dorian was never in evidence., It was never the season for the dorian., It was always going to arrive from Burma sometime or other, but it never did., By all accounts it was a most strange fruit, and incomparably delicious to the taste, but not to the smell., Its rind was said to exude a stench of so atrocious a nature that when a dorian was in the room even the presence of a polecat was a refreshment., We found many who had eaten the dorian, and they all spoke of it with a sort of rapture., They said that if you could hold your nose until the fruit was in your mouth a sacred joy would suffuse you from head to foot that would make you oblivious to the smell of the rind, but that if your grip slipped and you caught the smell of the rind before the fruit was in your mouth, you would faint., There is a fortune in that rind., Some day somebody will import it into Europe and sell it for cheese., Benares was not a disappointment., It justified its reputation as a curiosity., It is on high ground, and overhangs a grand curve of the Ganges., It is a vast mass of building, compactly crusting a hill, and is cloven in all directions by an intricate confusion of cracks which stand for streets., Tall, slim minarets and beflagged temple-spires rise out of it and give it picturesqueness, viewed from the river., The city is as busy as an ant-hill, and the hurly-burly of human life swarming along the web of narrow streets reminds one of the ants., The sacred cow swarms along, too, and goes whither she pleases, and takes toll of the grain-shops, and is very much in the way, and is a good deal of a nuisance, since she must not be molested., Benares is older than history, older than tradition, older even than legend, and looks twice as old as all of them put together., From a Hindoo statement quoted in Rev., Mr. Parker's compact and lucid Guide to Benares, I find that the site of the town was the beginning-place of the Creation., It was merely an upright ""lingam,"" at first, no larger than a stove-pipe, and stood in the midst of a shoreless ocean., This was the work of the God Vishnu., Later he spread the lingam out till its surface was ten miles across., Still it was not large enough for the business; therefore he presently built the globe around it., Benares is thus the center of the earth., This is considered an advantage., It has had a tumultuous history, both materially and spiritually., It started Brahminically, many ages ago; then by and by Buddha came in recent times 2,500 years ago, and after that it was Buddhist during many centuries--twelve, perhaps--but the Brahmins got the upper hand again, then, and have held it ever since., It is unspeakably sacred in Hindoo eyes, and is as unsanitary as it is sacred, and smells like the rind of the dorian., It is the headquarters of the Brahmin faith, and one-eighth of the population are priests of that church., But it is not an overstock, for they have all India as a prey., All India flocks thither on pilgrimage, and pours its savings into the pockets of the priests in a generous stream, which never fails., A priest with a good stand on the shore of the Ganges is much better off than the sweeper of the best crossing in London., A good stand is worth a world of money., The holy proprietor of it sits under his grand spectacular umbrella and blesses people all his life, and collects his commission, and grows fat and rich; and the stand passes from father to son, down and down and down through the ages, and remains a permanent and lucrative estate in the family., As Mr. Parker suggests, it can become a subject of dispute, at one time or another, and then the matter will be settled, not by prayer and fasting and consultations with Vishnu, but by the intervention of a much more puissant power--an English court., In Bombay I was told by an American missionary that in India there are 640 Protestant missionaries at work., At first it seemed an immense force, but of course that was a thoughtless idea., One missionary to 500,000 natives--no, that is not a force; it is the reverse of it; 640 marching against an intrenched camp of 300,000,000--the odds are too great., A force of 640 in Benares alone would have its hands over-full with 8,000 Brahmin priests for adversary., Missionaries need to be well equipped with hope and confidence, and this equipment they seem to have always had in all parts of the world., Mr. Parker has it., It enables him to get a favorable outlook out of statistics which might add up differently with other mathematicians., For instance:  ""During the past few years competent observers declare that the number of pilgrims to Benares has increased."", And then he adds up this fact and gets this conclusion:  ""But the revival, if so it may be called, has in it the marks of death., It is a spasmodic struggle before dissolution."", In this world we have seen the Roman Catholic power dying, upon these same terms, for many centuries., Many a time we have gotten all ready for the funeral and found it postponed again, on account of the weather or something., Taught by experience, we ought not to put on our things for this Brahminical one till we see the procession move., Apparently one of the most uncertain things in the world is the funeral of a religion., I should have been glad to acquire some sort of idea of Hindoo theology, but the difficulties were too great, the matter was too intricate., Even the mere A, B, C of it is baffling., There is a trinity--Brahma, Shiva, and Vishnu--independent powers, apparently, though one cannot feel quite sure of that, because in one of the temples there is an image where an attempt has been made to concentrate the three in one person., The three have other names and plenty of them, and this makes confusion in one's mind., The three have wives and the wives have several names, and this increases the confusion., There are children, the children have many names, and thus the confusion goes on and on., It is not worth while to try to get any grip upon the cloud of minor gods, there are too many of them., It is even a justifiable economy to leave Brahma, the chiefest god of all, out of your studies, for he seems to cut no great figure in India., The vast bulk of the national worship is lavished upon Shiva and Vishnu and their families., Shiva's symbol--the ""lingam"" with which Vishnu began the Creation--is worshiped by everybody, apparently., It is the commonest object in Benares., It is on view everywhere, it is garlanded with flowers, offerings are made to it, it suffers no neglect., Commonly it is an upright stone, shaped like a thimble-sometimes like an elongated thimble., This priapus-worship, then, is older than history., Mr. Parker says that the lingams in Benares ""outnumber the inhabitants."", In Benares there are many Mohammedan mosques., There are Hindoo temples without number--these quaintly shaped and elaborately sculptured little stone jugs crowd all the lanes., The Ganges itself and every individual drop of water in it are temples., Religion, then, is the business of Benares, just as gold-production is the business of Johannesburg., Other industries count for nothing as compared with the vast and all-absorbing rush and drive and boom of the town's specialty., Benares is the sacredest of sacred cities., The moment you step across the sharply-defined line which separates it from the rest of the globe, you stand upon ineffably and unspeakably holy ground., Mr. Parker says: ""It is impossible to convey any adequate idea of the intense feelings of veneration and affection with which the pious Hindoo regards 'Holy Kashi' (Benares)."", And then he gives you this vivid and moving picture:       ""Let a Hindoo regiment be marched through the district, and as soon      as they cross the line and enter the limits of the holy place they      rend the air with cries of 'Kashi ji ki jai--jai--jai!, (Holy      Kashi!, Hail to thee!, Hail!, Hail!, Hail)'., The weary pilgrim      scarcely able to stand, with age and weakness, blinded by the dust      and heat, and almost dead with fatigue, crawls out of the oven-like      railway carriage and as soon as his feet touch the ground he lifts      up his withered hands and utters the same pious exclamation., Let a      European in some distant city in casual talk in the bazar mention      the fact that he has lived at Benares, and at once voices will be      raised to call down blessings on his head, for a dweller in Benares      is of all men most blessed."", It makes our own religious enthusiasm seem pale and cold., Inasmuch as the life of religion is in the heart, not the head, Mr. Parker's touching picture seems to promise a sort of indefinite postponement of that funeral., Let me make the superstitions of a nation and I care not who makes its laws or its songs either., Yes, the city of Benares is in effect just a big church, a religious hive, whose every cell is a temple, a shrine or a mosque, and whose every conceivable earthly and heavenly good is procurable under one roof, so to speak--a sort of Army and Navy Stores, theologically stocked., I will make out a little itinerary for the pilgrim; then you will see how handy the system is, how convenient, how comprehensive., If you go to Benares with a serious desire to spiritually benefit yourself, you will find it valuable., ...]"|1
69|"[It occurs to me now that I have never seen the ice-storm put upon canvas, and have not heard that any painter has tried to do it., I wonder why that is., Is it that paint cannot counterfeit the intense blaze of a sun-flooded jewel?, There should be, and must be, a reason, and a good one, why the most enchanting sight that Nature has created has been neglected by the brush., Often, the surest way to convey misinformation is to tell the strict truth., The describers of the Taj have used the word gem in its strictest sense--its scientific sense., In that sense it is a mild word, and promises but little to the eye-nothing bright, nothing brilliant, nothing sparkling, nothing splendid in the way of color., It accurately describes the sober and unobtrusive gem-work of the Taj; that is, to the very highly-educated one person in a thousand; but it most falsely describes it to the 999., But the 999 are the people who ought to be especially taken care of, and to them it does not mean quiet-colored designs wrought in carnelians, or agates, or such things; they know the word in its wide and ordinary sense only, and so to them it means diamonds and rubies and opals and their kindred, and the moment their eyes fall upon it in print they see a vision of glorious colors clothed in fire., These describers are writing for the ""general,"" and so, in order to make sure of being understood, they ought to use words in their ordinary sense, or else explain., The word fountain means one thing in Syria, where there is but a handful of people; it means quite another thing in North America, where there are 75,000,000., If I were describing some Syrian scenery, and should exclaim, ""Within the narrow space of a quarter of a mile square I saw, in the glory of the flooding moonlight, two hundred noble fountains--imagine the spectacle!"", the North American would have a vision of clustering columns of water soaring aloft, bending over in graceful arches, bursting in beaded spray and raining white fire in the moonlight-and he would be deceived., But the Syrian would not be deceived; he would merely see two hundred fresh-water springs--two hundred drowsing puddles, as level and unpretentious and unexcited as so many door-mats, and even with the help of the moonlight he would not lose his grip in the presence of the exhibition., My word ""fountain"" would be correct; it would speak the strict truth; and it would convey the strict truth to the handful of Syrians, and the strictest misinformation to the North American millions., With their gems--and gems--and more gems--and gems again--and still other gems--the describers of the Taj are within their legal but not their moral rights; they are dealing in the strictest scientific truth; and in doing it they succeed to admiration in telling ""what ain't so."", SATAN (impatiently) to NEW-COMER., The trouble with you Chicago people is, that you think you are the best people down here; whereas you are merely the most numerous., We wandered contentedly around here and there in India; to Lahore, among other places, where the Lieutenant-Governor lent me an elephant., This hospitality stands out in my experiences in a stately isolation., It was a fine elephant, affable, gentlemanly, educated, and I was not afraid of it., I even rode it with confidence through the crowded lanes of the native city, where it scared all the horses out of their senses, and where children were always just escaping its feet., It took the middle of the road in a fine independent way, and left it to the world to get out of the way or take the consequences., I am used to being afraid of collisions when I ride or drive, but when one is on top of an elephant that feeling is absent., I could have ridden in comfort through a regiment of runaway teams., I could easily learn to prefer an elephant to any other vehicle, partly because of that immunity from collisions, and partly because of the fine view one has from up there, and partly because of the dignity one feels in that high place, and partly because one can look in at the windows and see what is going on privately among the family., The Lahore horses were used to elephants, but they were rapturously afraid of them just the same., It seemed curious., Perhaps the better they know the elephant the more they respect him in that peculiar way., In our own case--we are not afraid of dynamite till we get acquainted with it., We drifted as far as Rawal Pindi, away up on the Afghan frontier--I think it was the Afghan frontier, but it may have been Hertzegovina--it was around there somewhere--and down again to Delhi, to see the ancient architectural wonders there and in Old Delhi and not describe them, and also to see the scene of the illustrious assault, in the Mutiny days, when the British carried Delhi by storm, one of the marvels of history for impudent daring and immortal valor., We had a refreshing rest, there in Delhi, in a great old mansion which possessed historical interest., It was built by a rich Englishman who had become orientalized--so much so that he had a zenana., But he was a broadminded man, and remained so., To please his harem he built a mosque; to please himself he built an English church., That kind of a man will arrive, somewhere., In the Mutiny days the mansion was the British general's headquarters., It stands in a great garden--oriental fashion --and about it are many noble trees., The trees harbor monkeys; and they are monkeys of a watchful and enterprising sort, and not much troubled with fear., They invade the house whenever they get a chance, and carry off everything they don't want., One morning the master of the house was in his bath, and the window was open., Near it stood a pot of yellow paint and a brush., Some monkeys appeared in the window; to scare them away, the gentleman threw his sponge at them., They did not scare at all; they jumped into the room and threw yellow paint all over him from the brush, and drove him out; then they painted the walls and the floor and the tank and the windows and the furniture yellow, and were in the dressing-room painting that when help arrived and routed them., Two of these creatures came into my room in the early morning, through a window whose shutters I had left open, and when I woke one of them was before the glass brushing his hair, and the other one had my note-book, and was reading a page of humorous notes and crying., I did not mind the one with the hair-brush, but the conduct of the other one hurt me; it hurts me yet., I threw something at him, and that was wrong, for my host had told me that the monkeys were best left alone., They threw everything at me that they could lift, and then went into the bathroom to get some more things, and I shut the door on them., At Jeypore, in Rajputana, we made a considerable stay., We were not in the native city, but several miles from it, in the small European official suburb., There were but few Europeans--only fourteen but they were all kind and hospitable, and it amounted to being at home., In Jeypore we found again what we had found all about India--that while the Indian servant is in his way a very real treasure, he will sometimes bear watching, and the Englishman watches him., If he sends him on an errand, he wants more than the man's word for it that he did the errand., When fruit and vegetables were sent to us, a ""chit"" came with them--a receipt for us to sign; otherwise the things might not arrive., If a gentleman sent up his carriage, the chit stated ""from"" such-and-such an hour ""to"" such-and-such an hour--which made it unhandy for the coachman and his two or three subordinates to put us off with a part of the allotted time and devote the rest of it to a lark of their own., We were pleasantly situated in a small two-storied inn, in an empty large compound which was surrounded by a mud wall as high as a man's head., The inn was kept by nine Hindoo brothers, its owners., They lived, with their families, in a one-storied building within the compound, but off to one side, and there was always a long pile of their little comely brown children loosely stacked in its veranda, and a detachment of the parents wedged among them, smoking the hookah or the howdah, or whatever they call it., By the veranda stood a palm, and a monkey lived in it, and led a lonesome life, and always looked sad and weary, and the crows bothered him a good deal., The inn cow poked about the compound and emphasized the secluded and country air of the place, and there was a dog of no particular breed, who was always present in the compound, and always asleep, always stretched out baking in the sun and adding to the deep tranquility and reposefulness of the place, when the crows were away on business., White-draperied servants were coming and going all the time, but they seemed only spirits, for their feet were bare and made no sound., Down the lane a piece lived an elephant in the shade of a noble tree, and rocked and rocked, and reached about with his trunk, begging of his brown mistress or fumbling the children playing at his feet., And there were camels about, but they go on velvet feet, and were proper to the silence and serenity of the surroundings., The Satan mentioned at the head of this chapter was not our Satan, but the other one., Our Satan was lost to us., In these later days he had passed out of our life--lamented by me, and sincerely., I was missing him; I am missing him yet, after all these months., He was an astonishing creature to fly around and do things., He didn't always do them quite right, but he did them, and did them suddenly., There was no time wasted., You would say:  ""Pack the trunks and bags, Satan."", ""Wair good"" (very good)., Then there would be a brief sound of thrashing and slashing and humming and buzzing, and a spectacle as of a whirlwind spinning gowns and jackets and coats and boots and things through the air, and then with bow and touch--  ""Awready, master."", It was wonderful., It made one dizzy., He crumpled dresses a good deal, and he had no particular plan about the work--at first--except to put each article into the trunk it didn't belong in., But he soon reformed, in this matter., Not entirely; for, to the last, he would cram into the satchel sacred to literature any odds and ends of rubbish that he couldn't find a handy place for elsewhere., When threatened with death for this, it did not trouble him; he only looked pleasant, saluted with soldierly grace, said ""Wair good,"" and did it again next day., He was always busy; kept the rooms tidied up, the boots polished, the clothes brushed, the wash-basin full of clean water, my dress clothes laid out and ready for the lecture-hall an hour ahead of time; and he dressed me from head to heel in spite of my determination to do it myself, according to my lifelong custom., He was a born boss, and loved to command, and to jaw and dispute with inferiors and harry them and bullyrag them., He was fine at the railway station--yes, he was at his finest there., He would shoulder and plunge and paw his violent way through the packed multitude of natives with nineteen coolies at his tail, each bearing a trifle of luggage--one a trunk, another a parasol, another a shawl, another a fan, and so on; one article to each, and the longer the procession, the better he was suited --and he was sure to make for some engaged sleeper and begin to hurl the owner's things out of it, swearing that it was ours and that there had been a mistake., Arrived at our own sleeper, he would undo the bedding-bundles and make the beds and put everything to rights and shipshape in two minutes; then put his head out at, a window and have a restful good time abusing his gang of coolies and disputing their bill until we arrived and made him pay them and stop his noise., Speaking of noise, he certainly was the noisiest little devil in India --and that is saying much, very much, indeed., I loved him for his noise, but the family detested him for it., They could not abide it; they could not get reconciled to it., It humiliated them., As a rule, when we got within six hundred yards of one of those big railway stations, a mighty racket of screaming and shrieking and shouting and storming would break upon us, and I would be happy to myself, and the family would say, with shame:  ""There--that's Satan., Why do you keep him?"", And, sure enough, there in the whirling midst of fifteen hundred wondering people we would find that little scrap of a creature gesticulating like a spider with the colic, his black eyes snapping, his fez-tassel dancing, his jaws pouring out floods of billingsgate upon his gang of beseeching and astonished coolies., I loved him; I couldn't help it; but the family--why, they could hardly speak of him with patience., To this day I regret his loss, and wish I had him back; but they--it is different with them., He was a native, and came from Surat., Twenty degrees of latitude lay between his birthplace and Manuel's, and fifteen hundred between their ways and characters and dispositions., I only liked Manuel, but I loved Satan., This latter's real name was intensely Indian., I could not quite get the hang of it, but it sounded like Bunder Rao Ram Chunder Clam Chowder., It was too long for handy use, anyway; so I reduced it., When he had been with us two or three weeks, he began to make mistakes which I had difficulty in patching up for him., ...]"|1
70|"[The stranger bought it for a trifle and carried it away; and being without honor, made another stranger believe it was a diamond, and so got $125 out of him for it, and was as pleased with himself as if he had done a righteous thing., In Paris the wronged stranger sold it to a pawnshop for $10,000, who sold it to a countess for $90,000, who sold it to a brewer for $800;000, who traded it to a king for a dukedom and a pedigree, and the king ""put it up the spout."", --[handwritten note: ""From the Greek meaning 'pawned it.'"", M.T.], --I know these particulars to be correct., The news flew around, and the South African diamond-boom began., The original traveler--the dishonest one--now remembered that he had once seen a Boer teamster chocking his wagon-wheel on a steep grade with a diamond as large as a football, and he laid aside his occupations and started out to hunt for it, but not with the intention of cheating anybody out of $125 with it, for he had reformed., We now come to matters more didactic., Diamonds are not imbedded in rock ledges fifty miles long, like the Johannesburg gold, but are distributed through the rubbish of a filled-up well, so to speak., The well is rich, its walls are sharply defined; outside of the walls are no diamonds., The well is a crater, and a large one., Before it had been meddled with, its surface was even with the level plain, and there was no sign to suggest that it was there., The pasturage covering the surface of the Kimberley crater was sufficient for the support of a cow, and the pasturage underneath was sufficient for the support of a kingdom; but the cow did not know it, and lost her chance., The Kimberley crater is roomy enough to admit the Roman Coliseum; the bottom of the crater has not been reached, and no one can tell how far down in the bowels of the earth it goes., Originally, it was a perpendicular hole packed solidly full of blue rock or cement, and scattered through that blue mass, like raisins in a pudding, were the diamonds., As deep down in the earth as the blue stuff extends, so deep will the diamonds be found., There are three or four other celebrated craters near by a circle three miles in diameter would enclose them all., They are owned by the De Beers Company, a consolidation of diamond properties arranged by Mr. Rhodes twelve or fourteen years ago., The De Beers owns other craters; they are under the grass, but the De Beers knows where they are, and will open them some day, if the market should require it., Originally, the diamond deposits were the property of the Orange Free State; but a judicious ""rectification"" of the boundary line shifted them over into the British territory of Cape Colony., A high official of the Free State told me that the sum of $4,00,000 was handed to his commonwealth as a compromise, or indemnity, or something of the sort, and that he thought his commonwealth did wisely to take the money and keep out of a dispute, since the power was all on the one side and the weakness all on the other., The De Beers Company dig out $400,000 worth of diamonds per week, now., The Cape got the territory, but no profit; for Mr. Rhodes and the Rothschilds and the other De Beers people own the mines, and they pay no taxes., In our day the mines are worked upon scientific principles, under the guidance of the ablest mining-engineering talent procurable in America., There are elaborate works for reducing the blue rock and passing it through one process after another until every diamond it contains has been hunted down and secured., I watched the ""concentrators"" at work big tanks containing mud and water and invisible diamonds--and was told that each could stir and churn and properly treat 300 car-loads of mud per day 1,600 pounds to the car-load--and reduce it to 3 car-loads of slush., I saw the 3 carloads of slush taken to the ""pulsators"" and there reduced to quarter of a load of nice clean dark-colored sand., Then I followed it to the sorting tables and saw the men deftly and swiftly spread it out and brush it about and seize the diamonds as they showed up., I assisted, and once I found a diamond half as large as an almond., It is an exciting kind of fishing, and you feel a fine thrill of pleasure every time you detect the glow of one of those limpid pebbles through the veil of dark sand., I would like to spend my Saturday holidays in that charming sport every now and then., Of course there are disappointments., Sometimes you find a diamond which is not a diamond; it is only a quartz crystal or some such worthless thing., The expert can generally distinguish it from the precious stone which it is counterfeiting; but if he is in doubt he lays it on a flatiron and hits it with a sledgehammer., If it is a diamond it holds its own; if it is anything else, it is reduced to powder., I liked that experiment very much, and did not tire of repetitions of it., It was full of enjoyable apprehensions, unmarred by any personal sense of risk., The De Beers concern treats 8;000 carloads --about 6,000 tons--of blue rock per day, and the result is three pounds of diamonds., Value, uncut, $50,000 to $70,000., After cutting, they will weigh considerably less than a pound, but will be worth four or five times as much as they were before., All the plain around that region is spread over, a foot deep, with blue rock, placed there by the Company, and looks like a plowed field., Exposure for a length of time make the rock easier to work than it is when it comes out of the mine., If mining should cease now, the supply of rock spread over those fields would furnish the usual 8,000 car-loads per day to the separating works during three years., The fields are fenced and watched; and at night they are under the constant inspection of lofty electric searchlight., They contain fifty or sixty million dollars' worth' of diamonds, and there is an abundance of enterprising thieves around., In the dirt of the Kimberley streets there is much hidden wealth., Some time ago the people were granted the privilege of a free wash-up., There was a general rush, the work was done with thoroughness, and a good harvest of diamonds was gathered., The deep mining is done by natives., There are many hundreds of them., They live in quarters built around the inside of a great compound., They are a jolly and good-natured lot, and accommodating., They performed a war-dance for us, which was the wildest exhibition I have ever seen., They are not allowed outside of the compound during their term of service three months, I think it, is, as a rule., They go down the shaft, stand their watch, come up again, are searched, and go to bed or to their amusements in the compound; and this routine they repeat, day in and day out., It is thought that they do not now steal many diamonds successfully., They used to swallow them, and find other ways of concealing them, but the white man found ways of beating their various games., One man cut his leg and shoved a diamond into the wound, but even that project did not succeed., When they find a fine large diamond they are more likely to report it than to steal it, for in the former case they get a reward, and in the latter they are quite apt to merely get into trouble., Some years ago, in a mine not owned by the De Beers, a black found what has been claimed to be the largest diamond known to the world's history; and, as a reward he was released from service and given a blanket, a horse, and five hundred dollars., It made him a Vanderbilt., He could buy four wives, and have money left., Four wives are an ample support for a native., With four wives he is wholly independent, and need never do a stroke of work again., That great diamond weighs 97l carats., Some say it is as big as a piece of alum, others say it is as large as a bite of rock candy, but the best authorities agree that it is almost exactly the size of a chunk of ice., But those details are not important; and in my opinion not trustworthy., It has a flaw in it, otherwise it would be of incredible value., As it is, it is held to be worth $2,000,000., After cutting it ought to be worth from $5,000,000 to $8,000,000, therefore persons desiring to save money should buy it now., It is owned by a syndicate, and apparently there is no satisfactory market for it., It is earning nothing; it is eating its head off., Up to this time it has made nobody rich but the native who found it., He found it in a mine which was being worked by contract., That is to say, a company had bought the privilege of taking from the mine 5,000,000 carloads of blue-rock, for a sum down and a royalty., Their speculation had not paid; but on the very day that their privilege ran out that native found the $2,000,000-diamond and handed it over to them., Even the diamond culture is not without its romantic episodes., The Koh-i-Noor is a large diamond, and valuable; but it cannot compete in these matters with three which--according to legend--are among the crown trinkets of Portugal and Russia., One of these is held to be worth $20,000,000; another, $25,000,000, and the third something over $28,000,000., Those are truly wonderful diamonds, whether they exist or not; and yet they are of but little importance by comparison with the one wherewith the Boer wagoner chocked his wheel on that steep grade as heretofore referred to., In Kimberley I had some conversation with the man who saw the Boer do that--an incident which had occurred twenty-seven or twenty-eight years before I had my talk with him., He assured me that that diamond's value could have been over a billion dollars, but not under it., I believed him, because he had devoted twenty-seven years to hunting for it, and was, in a position to know., A fitting and interesting finish to an examination of the tedious and laborious and costly processes whereby the diamonds are gotten out of the deeps of the earth and freed from the base stuffs which imprison them is the visit to the De Beers offices in the town of Kimberley, where the result of each day's mining is brought every day, and, weighed, assorted, valued, and deposited in safes against shipping-day., An unknown and unaccredited person cannot, get into that place; and it seemed apparent from the generous supply of warning and protective and prohibitory signs that were posted all about, that not even the known and accredited can steal diamonds there without inconvenience., We saw the day's output--shining little nests of diamonds, distributed a foot apart, along a counter, each nest reposing upon a sheet of white paper., That day's catch was about $70,000 worth., In the course of a year half a ton of diamonds pass under the scales there and sleep on that counter; the resulting money is $18,000,000 or $20,000,000., Profit, about $12,000,000., Young girls were doing the sorting--a nice, clean, dainty, and probably distressing employment., Every day ducal incomes sift and sparkle through the fingers of those young girls; yet they go to bed at night as poor as they were when they got up in the morning., The same thing next day, and all the days., They are beautiful things, those diamonds, in their native state., They are of various shapes; they have flat surfaces, rounded borders, and never a sharp edge., They are of all colors and shades of color, from dewdrop white to actual black; and their smooth and rounded surfaces and contours, variety of color, and transparent limpidity make them look like piles of assorted candies., A very light straw color is their commonest tint., It seemed to me that these uncut gems must be more beautiful than any cut ones could be; but when a collection of cut ones was brought out, I saw my mistake., Nothing is so beautiful as a rose diamond with the light playing through it, except that uncostly thing which is just like it--wavy sea-water with the sunlight playing through it and striking a white-sand bottom., Before the middle of July we reached Cape Town, and the end of our African journeyings., And well satisfied; for, towering above us was Table Mountain--a reminder that we had now seen each and all of the great features of South Africa except Mr. Cecil Rhodes., ...]"|1
71|"[I was clean --artificially--like the rest; and like the rest I fell when temptation came., I signed a lie, and claimed the miserable sack., Mr. Burgess remembered that I had done him a service, and in gratitude (and ignorance) he suppressed my claim and saved me., You know the thing that was charged against Burgess years ago., My testimony, and mine alone, could have cleared him, and I was a coward and left him to suffer disgrace--""  ""No--no--Mr.  Richards, you--""  ""My servant betrayed my secret to him--""  ""No one has betrayed anything to me--""  --""And then he did a natural and justifiable thing; he repented of the saving kindness which he had done me, and he EXPOSED me--as I deserved--""  ""Never!--I make oath--""  ""Out of my heart I forgive him."", Burgess's impassioned protestations fell upon deaf ears; the dying man passed away without knowing that once more he had done poor Burgess a wrong., The old wife died that night., The last of the sacred Nineteen had fallen a prey to the fiendish sack; the town was stripped of the last rag of its ancient glory., Its mourning was not showy, but it was deep., By act of the Legislature--upon prayer and petition--Hadleyburg was allowed to change its name to (never mind what--I will not give it away), and leave one word out of the motto that for many generations had graced the town's official seal., It is an honest town once more, and the man will have to rise early that catches it napping again., MY FIRST LIE, AND HOW I GOT OUT OF IT  As I understand it, what you desire is information about 'my first lie, and how I got out of it.', I was born in 1835; I am well along, and my memory is not as good as it was., If you had asked about my first truth it would have been easier for me and kinder of you, for I remember that fairly well., I remember it as if it were last week., The family think it was week before, but that is flattery and probably has a selfish project back of it., When a person has become seasoned by experience and has reached the age of sixty-four, which is the age of discretion, he likes a family compliment as well as ever, but he does not lose his head over it as in the old innocent days., I do not remember my first lie, it is too far back; but I remember my second one very well., I was nine days old at the time, and had noticed that if a pin was sticking in me and I advertised it in the usual fashion, I was lovingly petted and coddled and pitied in a most agreeable way and got a ration between meals besides., It was human nature to want to get these riches, and I fell., I lied about the pin--advertising one when there wasn't any., You would have done it; George Washington did it, anybody would have done it., During the first half of my life I never knew a child that was able to rise about that temptation and keep from telling that lie., Up to 1867 all the civilised children that were ever born into the world were liars --including George., Then the safety-pin came in and blocked the game., But is that reform worth anything?, No; for it is reform by force and has no virtue in it; it merely stops that form of lying, it doesn't impair the disposition to lie, by a shade., It is the cradle application of conversion by fire and sword, or of the temperance principle through prohibition., To return to that early lie., They found no pin and they realised that another liar had been added to the world's supply., For by grace of a rare inspiration a quite commonplace but seldom noticed fact was borne in upon their understandings--that almost all lies are acts, and speech has no part in them., Then, if they examined a little further they recognised that all people are liars from the cradle onwards, without exception, and that they begin to lie as soon as they wake in the morning, and keep it up without rest or refreshment until they go to sleep at night., If they arrived at that truth it probably grieved them--did, if they had been heedlessly and ignorantly educated by their books and teachers; for why should a person grieve over a thing which by the eternal law of his make he cannot help?, He didn't invent the law; it is merely his business to obey it and keep still; join the universal conspiracy and keep so still that he shall deceive his fellow-conspirators into imagining that he doesn't know that the law exists., It is what we all do--we that know., I am speaking of the lie of silent assertion; we can tell it without saying a word, and we all do it--we that know., In the magnitude of its territorial spread it is one of the most majestic lies that the civilisations make it their sacred and anxious care to guard and watch and propagate., For instance., It would not be possible for a humane and intelligent person to invent a rational excuse for slavery; yet you will remember that in the early days of the emancipation agitation in the North the agitators got but small help or countenance from any one., Argue and plead and pray as they might, they could not break the universal stillness that reigned, from pulpit and press all the way down to the bottom of society--the clammy stillness created and maintained by the lie of silent assertion--the silent assertion that there wasn't anything going on in which humane and intelligent people were interested., From the beginning of the Dreyfus case to the end of it all France, except a couple of dozen moral paladins, lay under the smother of the silent-assertion lie that no wrong was being done to a persecuted and unoffending man., The like smother was over England lately, a good half of the population silently letting on that they were not aware that Mr. Chamberlain was trying to manufacture a war in South Africa and was willing to pay fancy prices for the materials., Now there we have instances of three prominent ostensible civilisations working the silent-assertion lie., Could one find other instances in the three countries?, I think so., Not so very many perhaps, but say a billion--just so as to keep within bounds., Are those countries working that kind of lie, day in and day out, in thousands and thousands of varieties, without ever resting?, Yes, we know that to be true., The universal conspiracy of the silent-assertion lie is hard at work always and everywhere, and always in the interest of a stupidity or a sham, never in the interest of a thing fine or respectable., Is it the most timid and shabby of all lies?, It seems to have the look of it., For ages and ages it has mutely laboured in the interest of despotisms and aristocracies and chattel slaveries, and military slaveries, and religious slaveries, and has kept them alive; keeps them alive yet, here and there and yonder, all about the globe; and will go on keeping them alive until the silent-assertion lie retires from business--the silent assertion that nothing is going on which fair and intelligent men are aware of and are engaged by their duty to try to stop., What I am arriving at is this: When whole races and peoples conspire to propagate gigantic mute lies in the interest of tyrannies and shams, why should we care anything about the trifling lies told by individuals?, Why should we try to make it appear that abstention from lying is a virtue?, Why should we want to beguile ourselves in that way?, Why should we without shame help the nation lie, and then be ashamed to do a little lying on our own account?, Why shouldn't we be honest and honourable, and lie every time we get a chance?, That is to say, why shouldn't we be consistent, and either lie all the time or not at all?, Why should we help the nation lie the whole day long and then object to telling one little individual private lie in our own interest to go to bed on?, Just for the refreshment of it, I mean, and to take the rancid taste out of our mouth., Here in England they have the oddest ways., They won't tell a spoken lie --nothing can persuade them., Except in a large moral interest, like politics or religion, I mean., To tell a spoken lie to get even the poorest little personal advantage out of it is a thing which is impossible to them., They make me ashamed of myself sometimes, they are so bigoted., They will not even tell a lie for the fun of it; they will not tell it when it hasn't even a suggestion of damage or advantage in it for any one., This has a restraining influence upon me in spite of reason, and I am always getting out of practice., Of course, they tell all sorts of little unspoken lies, just like anybody; but they don't notice it until their attention is called to it., They have got me so that sometimes I never tell a verbal lie now except in a modified form; and even in the modified form they don't approve of it., Still, that is as far as I can go in the interest of the growing friendly relations between the two countries; I must keep some of my self-respect--and my health., I can live on a pretty low diet, but I can't get along on no sustenance at all., Of course, there are times when these people have to come out with a spoken lie, for that is a thing which happens to everybody once in a while, and would happen to the angels if they came down here much., Particularly to the angels, in fact, for the lies I speak of are self-sacrificing ones told for a generous object, not a mean one; but even when these people tell a lie of that sort it seems to scare them and unsettle their minds., It is a wonderful thing to see, and shows that they are all insane., In fact, it is a country which is full of the most interesting superstitions., I have an English friend of twenty-five years' standing, and yesterday when we were coming down-town on top of the 'bus I happened to tell him a lie--a modified one, of course; a half-breed, a mulatto; I can't seem to tell any other kind now, the market is so flat., I was explaining to him how I got out of an embarrassment in Austria last year., I do not know what might have become of me if I hadn't happened to remember to tell the police that I belonged to the same family as the Prince of Wales., That made everything pleasant and they let me go; and apologised, too, and were ever so kind and obliging and polite, and couldn't do too much for me, and explained how the mistake came to be made, and promised to hang the officer that did it, and hoped I would let bygones be bygones and not say anything about it; and I said they could depend on me., My friend said, austerely:  'You call it a modified lie?, Where is the modification?', I explained that it lay in the form of my statement to the police., 'I didn't say I belonged to the Royal Family; I only said I belonged to the same family as the Prince--meaning the human family, of course; and if those people had had any penetration they would have known it., I can't go around furnishing brains to the police; it is not to be expected.', 'How did you feel after that performance?', 'Well, of course I was distressed to find that the police had misunderstood me, but as long as I had not told any lie I knew there was no occasion to sit up nights and worry about it.', My friend struggled with the case several minutes, turning it over and examining it in his mind, then he said that so far as he could see the modification was itself a lie, it being a misleading reservation of an explanatory fact, and so I had told two lies instead of only one., 'I wouldn't have done it,' said he; 'I have never told a lie, and I should be very sorry to do such a thing.', Just then he lifted his hat and smiled a basketful of surprised and delighted smiles down at a gentleman who was passing in a hansom., 'Who was that, G---?', 'I don't know.', 'Then why did you do that?', 'Because I saw he thought he knew me and was expecting it of me., If I hadn't done it he would have been hurt., I didn't want to embarrass him before the whole street.', 'Well, your heart was right, G---, and your act was right., What you did was kindly and courteous and beautiful; I would have done it myself; but it was a lie.', 'A lie?, I didn't say a word., How do you make it out?', ...]"|1

but he waited patiently for the hilarity to calm down, and then went on again with his project:  '""Yes, one of us must die, to save the others--and himself., We will cast lots., The one chosen shall be illustrious, all of us shall be rich., Hold still, now--hold still; don't interrupt--I tell you I know what I am talking about., Here is the idea., During the next three months the one who is to die shall paint with all his might, enlarge his stock all he can--not pictures, no!, skeleton sketches, studies, parts of studies, fragments of studies, a dozen dabs of the brush on each--meaningless, of course, but his, with his cipher on them; turn out fifty a day, each to contain some peculiarity or mannerism easily detectable as his--they're the things that sell, you know, and are collected at fabulous prices for the world's museums, after the great man is gone; we'll have a ton of them ready--a ton!, And all that time the rest of us will be busy supporting the moribund, and working Paris and the dealers--preparations for the coming event, you know; and when everything is hot and just right, we'll spring the death on them and have the notorious funeral., You get the idea?"", '""N-o; at least, not qu--""  '""Not quite?, Don't you see?, The man doesn't really die; he changes his name and vanishes; we bury a dummy, and cry over it, with all the world to help., And I--""  'But he wasn't allowed to finish., Everybody broke out into a rousing hurrah of applause; and all jumped up and capered about the room and fell on each other's necks in transports of gratitude and joy., For hours we talked over the great plan, without ever feeling hungry; and at last, when all the details had been arranged satisfactorily, we cast lots and Millet was elected--elected to die, as we called it., Then we scraped together those things which one never parts with until he is betting them against future wealth--keepsake trinkets and suchlike--and these we pawned for enough to furnish us a frugal farewell supper and breakfast, and leave us a few francs over for travel, and a stake of turnips and such for Millet to live on for a few days., 'Next morning, early, the three of us cleared out, straightway after breakfast--on foot, of course., Each of us carried a dozen of Millet's small pictures, purposing to market them., Carl struck for Paris, where he would start the work of building up Millet's name against the coming great day., Claude and I were to separate, and scatter abroad over France., 'Now, it will surprise you to know what an easy and comfortable thing we had., I walked two days before I began business., Then I began to sketch a villa in the outskirts of a big town--because I saw the proprietor standing on an upper veranda., He came down to look on--I thought he would., I worked swiftly, intending to keep him interested., Occasionally he fired off a little ejaculation of approbation, and by-and-by he spoke up with enthusiasm, and said I was a master!, 'I put down my brush, reached into my satchel, fetched out a Millet, and pointed to the cipher in the corner., I said, proudly:  '""I suppose you recognise that?, Well, he taught me!, I should think I ought to know my trade!"", 'The man looked guiltily embarrassed, and was silent., I said sorrowfully:  '""You don't mean to intimate that you don't know the cipher of Francois Millet!"", 'Of course he didn't know that cipher; but he was the gratefullest man you ever saw, just the same, for being let out of an uncomfortable place on such easy terms., He said:  '""No!, Why, it is Millet's, sure enough!, I don't know what I could have been thinking of., Of course I recognise it now."", 'Next, he wanted to buy it; but I said that although I wasn't rich I wasn't that poor., However, at last, I let him have it for eight hundred francs.', 'Eight hundred!', 'Yes., Millet would have sold it for a pork chop., Yes, I got eight hundred francs for that little thing., I wish I could get it back for eighty thousand., But that time's gone by., I made a very nice picture of that man's house and I wanted to offer it to him for ten francs, but that wouldn't answer, seeing I was the pupil of such a master, so I sold it to him for a hundred., I sent the eight hundred francs straight to Millet from that town and struck out again next day., 'But I didn't walk--no., I rode., I have ridden ever since., I sold one picture every day, and never tried to sell two., I always said to my customer:  '""I am a fool to sell a picture of Francois Millet's at all, for that man is not going to live three months, and when he dies his pictures can't be had for love or money."", 'I took care to spread that little fact as far as I could, and prepare the world for the event., ...]"|1
73|[His company was not desired, and he was made to feel it., That he nevertheless conquered his wounded pride and sacrificed both that and his blood for his flag raises the average and quality of his patriotism above the Christian's., His record for capacity, for fidelity, and for gallant soldiership in the field is as good as any one's., This is true of the Jewish private soldiers and of the Jewish generals alike., Major-General O. O. Howard speaks of one of his Jewish staff officers as being 'of the bravest and best;' of another--killed at Chancellorsville --as being 'a true friend and a brave officer;' he highly praises two of his Jewish brigadier-generals; finally, he uses these strong words: 'Intrinsically there are no more patriotic men to be found in the country than those who claim to be of Hebrew descent, and who served with me in parallel commands or more directly under my instructions.', Fourteen Jewish Confederate and Union families contributed, between them, fifty-one soldiers to the war., Among these, a father and three sons; and another, a father and four sons., In the above article I was neither able to endorse nor repel the common approach that the Jew is willing to feed upon a country but not to fight for it, because I did not know whether it was true or false., I supposed it to be true, but it is not allowable to endorse wandering maxims upon supposition--except when one is trying to make out a case., That slur upon the Jew cannot hold up its head in presence of the figures of the War Department., It has done its work, and done it long and faithfully, and with high approval: it ought to be pensioned off now, and retired from active service., See 'Stirring Times in Austria,' in this volume., Here is another piece of picturesque history; and it reminds us that shabbiness and dishonesty are not the monopoly of any race or creed, but are merely human:  'Congress has passed a bill to pay $379.56 to Moses Pendergrass, of Libertyville, Missouri., The story of the reason of this liberality is pathetically interesting, and shows the sort of pickle that an honest man may get into who undertakes to do an honest job of work for Uncle Sam., In 1886 Moses Pendergrass put in a bid for the contract to carry the mail on the route from Knob Lick to Libertyville and Coffman, thirty miles a day, from July 1, 1887, for one years., He got the postmaster at Knob Lick to write the letter for him, and while Moses intended that his bid should be $400, his scribe carelessly made it $4., Moses got the contract, and did not find out about the mistake until the end of the first quarter, when he got his first pay., When he found at what rate he was working he was sorely cast down, and opened communication with the Post Office Department., The department informed his that he must either carry out his contract or throw it up, and that if he threw it up his bondsman would have the pay the Government $1,459.85 damages., So Moses carried out his contract, walked thirty miles every week-day for a year, and carried the mail, and received for his labour $4, or, to be accurate, $6.84; for, the route being extended after his bid was accepted, his pay was proportionately increased., Now, after ten years, a bill was finally passed to pay to Moses the difference between what he earned in that unlucky year and what he received.', The 'Sun,' which tells the above story, says that bills were introduced in three or four Congresses for Moses' relief, and that committees repeatedly investigated his claim., It took six Congresses, containing in their persons the compressed virtues of 70,000,000 of people, and cautiously and carefully giving expression to those virtues in the fear of God and the next election, eleven years to find out some way to cheat a fellow Christian out of about $13 on his honestly executed contract, and out of nearly $300 due him on its enlarged terms., And they succeeded., During the same time they paid out $1,000,000,000 in pensions--a third of it unearned and undeserved., This indicates a splendid all-round competency in theft, for it starts with farthings, and works its industries all the way up to ship-loads., It may be possible that the Jews can beat this, but the man that bets on it is taking chances., The article was written in the summer of 1898., In Austria the renaming was merely done because the Jews in some newly-acquired regions had no surnames, but were mostly named Abraham and Moses, and therefore the tax-gatherer could tell t'other from which, and was likely to lose his reason over the matter., The renaming was put into the hands of the War Department, and a charming mess the graceless young lieutenants made of it., To them a Jew was of no sort of consequence, and they labelled the race in a way to make the angels weep., As an example, take these two: Abraham Bellyache and Schmul Godbedamned--Culled from 'Namens Studien,' by Karl Emil Fransos., FROM THE 'LONDON TIMES' OF 1904  Correspondence of the 'London Times' Chicago, April 1, 1904  I resume by cable-telephone where I left off yesterday., For many hours now, this vast city--along with the rest of the globe, of course--has talked of nothing but the extraordinary episode mentioned in my last report., In accordance with your instructions, I will now trace the romance from its beginnings down to the culmination of yesterday--or today; call it which you like., By an odd chance, I was a personal actor in a part of this drama myself., The opening scene plays in Vienna., Date, one o'clock in the morning, March 31, 1898., I had spent the evening at a social entertainment., About midnight I went away, in company with the military attaches of the British, Italian, and American embassies, to finish with a late smoke., This function had been appointed to take place in the house of Lieutenant Hillyer, the third attache mentioned in the above list., When we arrived there we found several visitors in the room; young Szczepanik;[1] Mr. K., his financial backer; Mr. W., the latter's secretary; and Lieutenant Clayton, of the United States Army., War was at that time threatening between Spain and our country, and Lieutenant Clayton had been sent to Europe on military business., I was well acquainted with young Szczepanik and his two friends, and I knew Mr. Clayton slightly., I had met him at West Point years before, when he was a cadet., It was when General Merritt was superintendent., He had the reputation of being an able officer, and also of being quick-tempered and plain-spoken., This smoking-party had been gathered together partly for business., This business was to consider the availability of the telelectroscope for military service., It sounds oddly enough now, but it is nevertheless true that at that time the invention was not taken seriously by any one except its inventor., Even his financial support regarded it merely as a curious and interesting toy., Indeed, he was so convinced of this that he had actually postponed its use by the general world to the end of the dying century by granting a two years' exclusive lease of it to a syndicate, whose intent was to exploit it at the Paris World's Fair., When we entered the smoking-room we found Lieutenant Clayton and Szczepanik engaged in a warm talk over the telelectroscope in the German tongue., Clayton was saying:  'Well, you know my opinion of it, anyway!', and he brought his fist down with emphasis upon the table., 'And I do not value it,' retorted the young inventor, with provoking calmness of tone and manner., Clayton turned to Mr. K., and said:  'I cannot see why you are wasting money on this toy., In my opinion, the day will never come when it will do a farthing's worth of real service for any human being.', 'That may be; yes, that may be; still, I have put the money in it, and am content., I think, myself, that it is only a toy; but Szczepanik claims more for it, and I know him well enough to believe that he can see father than I can--either with his telelectroscope or without it.', The soft answer did not cool Clayton down; it seemed only to irritate him the more; and he repeated and emphasised his conviction that the invention would never do any man a farthing's worth of real service., He even made it a 'brass' farthing, this time., Then he laid an English farthing on the table, and added:  'Take that, Mr. K., and put it away; and if ever the telelectroscope does any man an actual service--mind, a real service--please mail it to me as a reminder, and I will take back what I have been saying., Will you?', 'I will,' and Mr. K. put the coin in his pocket., Mr. Clayton now turned toward Szczepanik, and began with a taunt--a taunt which did not reach a finish; Szczepanik interrupted it with a hardy retort, and followed this with a blow., There was a brisk fight for a moment or two; then the attaches separated the men., The scene now changes to Chicago., Time, the autumn of 1901., As soon as the Paris contract released the telelectroscope, it was delivered to public use, and was soon connected with the telephonic systems of the whole world., The improved 'limitless-distance' telephone was presently introduced, and the daily doings of the globe made visible to everybody, and audibly discussible, too, by witnesses separated by any number of leagues., By-and-by Szczepanik arrived in Chicago., Clayton (now captain) was serving in that military department at the time., The two men resumed the Viennese quarrel of 1898., On three different occasions they quarrelled, and were separated by witnesses., Then came an interval of two months, during which time Szczepanik was not seen by any of his friends, and it was at first supposed that he had gone off on a sight seeing tour and would soon be heard from., But no; no word came from him., Then it was supposed that he had returned to Europe., Still, time drifted on, and he was not heard from., Nobody was troubled, for he was like most inventors and other kinds of poets, and went and came in a capricious way, and often without notice., Now comes the tragedy., On December 29, in a dark and unused compartment of the cellar under Captain Clayton's house, a corpse was discovered by one of Clayton's maid-servants., Friends of deceased identified it as Szczepanik's., The man had died by violence., Clayton was arrested, indicted, and brought to trial, charged with this murder., The evidence against him was perfect in every detail, and absolutely unassailable., Clayton admitted this himself., He said that a reasonable man could not examine this testimony with a dispassionate mind and not be convinced by it; yet the man would be in error, nevertheless., Clayton swore that he did not commit the murder, and that he had had nothing to do with it., As your readers will remember, he was condemned to death., He had numerous and powerful friends, and they worked hard to save him, for none of them doubted the truth of his assertion., I did what little I could to help, for I had long since become a close friend of his, and thought I knew that it was not in his character to inveigle an enemy into a corner and assassinate him., During 1902 and 1903 he was several times reprieved by the governor; he was reprieved once more in the beginning of the present year, and the execution day postponed to March 31., The governor's situation has been embarrassing, from the day of the condemnation, because of the fact that Clayton's wife is the governor's niece., The marriage took place in 1899, when Clayton was thirty-four and the girl twenty-three, and has been a happy one., There is one child, a little girl three years old., Pity for the poor mother and child kept the mouths of grumblers closed at first; but this could not last for ever --for in America politics has a hand in everything--and by-and-by the governor's political opponents began to call attention to his delay in allowing the law to take its course., These hints have grown more and more frequent of late, and more and more pronounced., As a natural result, his own part grew nervous., Its leaders began to visit Springfield and hold long private conferences with him., ...]|1

'Once more I call Representative Wolf to order!, Do not forget that you are a Representative, sir!', Wolf (slam-banging with his desk-board)., 'I will force this matter!, Are you going to grant me the floor, or not?', And still the sergeant-at-arms did not appear., It was because there wasn't any., It is a curious thing, but the Chair has no effectual means of compelling order., After some more interruptions:  Wolf (banging with his board)., 'I demand the floor., I will not yield!', P.  'I have no recourse against Representative Wolf., In the presence of behaviour like this it is to be regretted that such is the case.', [A shout from the Right, 'Throw him out!'], It is true he had no effective recourse., He had an official called an 'Ordner,' whose help he could invoke in desperate cases, but apparently the Ordner is only a persuader, not a compeller., Apparently he is a sergeant-at-arms who is not loaded; a good enough gun to look at, but not valuable for business., For another twenty or thirty minutes Wolf went on banging with his board and demanding his rights; then at last the weary President threatened to summon the dread order-maker., But both his manner and his words were reluctant., Evidently it grieved him to have to resort to this dire extremity., He said to Wolf, 'If this goes on, I shall feel obliged to summon the Ordner, and beg him to restore order in the House.', Wolf., 'I'd like to see you do it!, Suppose you fetch in a few policemen too!, [Great tumult.], Are you going to put my motion to adjourn, or not?', Dr. Lecher continues his speech., Wolf accompanies him with his board-clatter., The President despatches the Ordner, Dr. Lang (himself a deputy), on his order-restoring mission., Wolf, with his board uplifted for defence, confronts the Ordner with a remark which Boss Tweed might have translated into 'Now let's see what you are going to do about it!', [Noise and tumult all over the House.], Wolf stands upon his rights, and says he will maintain them until he is killed in his tracks., Then he resumes his banging, the President jangles his bell and begs for order, and the rest of the House augments the racket the best it can., Wolf., 'I require an adjournment, because I find myself personally threatened., [Laughter from the Right.], Not that I fear for myself; I am only anxious about what will happen to the man who touches me.', The Ordner., 'I am not going to fight with you.', Nothing came of the efforts of the angel of peace, and he presently melted out of the scene and disappeared., Wolf went on with his noise and with his demands that he be granted the floor, resting his board at intervals to discharge criticisms and epithets at the Chair., Once he reminded the Chairman of his violated promise to grant him (Wolf) the floor, and said, 'Whence I came, we call promise-breakers rascals!', And he advised the Chairman to take his conscience to bed with him and use it as a pillow., Another time he said that the Chair was making itself ridiculous before all Europe., In fact, some of Wolf's language was almost unparliamentary., By-and-by he struck the idea of beating out a tune with his board., Later he decided to stop asking for the floor, and to confer it upon himself., And so he and Dr. Lecher now spoke at the same time, and mingled their speeches with the other noises, and nobody heard either of them., Wolf rested himself now and then from speech-making by reading, in his clarion voice, from a pamphlet., I will explain that Dr. Lecher was not making a twelve-hour speech for pastime, but for an important purpose., It was the Government's intention to push the Ausgleich through its preliminary stages in this one sitting (for which it was the Order of the Day), and then by vote refer it to a select committee., It was the Majority's scheme--as charged by the Opposition--to drown debate upon the bill by pure noise--drown it out and stop it., The debate being thus ended, the vote upon the reference would follow--with victory for the Government., But into the Government's calculations had not entered the possibility of a single-barrelled speech which should occupy the entire time-limit of the setting, and also get itself delivered in spite of all the noise., Goliath was not expecting David., But David was there; and during twelve hours he tranquilly pulled statistical, historical, and argumentative pebbles out of his scrip and slung them at the giant; and when he was done he was victor, and the day was saved., In the English House an obstructionist has held the floor with Bible-readings and other outside matters; but Dr. Lecher could not have that restful and recuperative privilege--he must confine himself strictly to the subject before the House., More than once, when the President could not hear him because of the general tumult, he sent persons to listen and report as to whether the orator was speaking to the subject or not., ...]|1

YOU HAVE TAKEN MY BELIEF AWAY, AND MY COMFORT., NOW I HAVE NOTHING LEFT, AND I DIE MISERABLE; FOR THE THINGS WHICH YOU HAVE TOLD ME DO NOT TAKE THE PLACE OF THAT WHICH I HAVE LOST."", And the mother, also, reproached the Infidel, and said:  ""MY CHILD IS FOREVER LOST, AND MY HEART IS BROKEN., HOW COULD YOU DO THIS CRUEL THING?, WE HAVE DONE YOU NO HARM, BUT ONLY KINDNESS; WE MADE OUR HOUSE YOUR HOME, YOU WERE WELCOME TO ALL WE HAD, AND THIS IS OUR REWARD."", The heart of the Infidel was filled with remorse for what he had done, and he said:  ""IT WAS WRONG--I SEE IT NOW; BUT I WAS ONLY TRYING TO DO HIM GOOD., IN MY VIEW HE WAS IN ERROR; IT SEEMED MY DUTY TO TEACH HIM THE TRUTH."", Then the mother said:  ""I HAD TAUGHT HIM, ALL HIS LITTLE LIFE, WHAT I BELIEVED TO BE THE TRUTH, AND IN HIS BELIEVING FAITH BOTH OF US WERE HAPPY., NOW HE IS DEAD,--AND LOST;

he infers that that is the new home, and follows to inquire., Here, now, is the experience of a gull, as related by a naturalist., The scene is a Scotch fishing village where the gulls were kindly treated., This particular gull visited a cottage; was fed; came next day and was fed again; came into the house, next time, and ate with the family; kept on doing this almost daily, thereafter., But, once the gull was away on a journey for a few days, and when it returned the house was vacant., Its friends had removed to a village three miles distant., Several months later it saw the head of the family on the street there, followed him home, entered the house without excuse or apology, and became a daily guest again., Gulls do not rank high mentally, but this one had memory and the reasoning faculty, you see, and applied them Edisonially., Y.M., Yet it was not an Edison and couldn't be developed into one., O.M., Perhaps not., Could you?, Y.M., That is neither here nor there., Go on., O.M., If Edison were in trouble and a stranger helped him out of it and next day he got into the same difficulty again, he would infer the wise thing to do in case he knew the stranger's address., Here is a case of a bird and a stranger as related by a naturalist., An Englishman saw a bird flying around about his dog's head, down in the grounds, and uttering cries of distress., He went there to see about it., The dog had a young bird in his mouth--unhurt., The gentleman rescued it and put it on a bush and brought the dog away., Early the next morning the mother bird came for the gentleman, who was sitting on his veranda, and by its maneuvers persuaded him to follow it to a distant part of the grounds--flying a little way in front of him and waiting for him to catch up, and so on; and keeping to the winding path, too, instead of flying the near way across lots., The distance covered was four hundred yards., The same dog was the culprit; he had the young bird again, and once more he had to give it up., Now the mother bird had reasoned it all out: since the stranger had helped her once, she inferred that he would do it again; she knew where to find him, and she went upon her errand with confidence., Her mental processes were what Edison's would have been., She put this and that together--and that is all that thought IS--and out of them built her logical arrangement of inferences., Edison couldn't have done it any better himself., Y.M., Do you believe that many of the dumb animals can think?, O.M., Yes--the elephant, the monkey, the horse, the dog, the parrot, the macaw, the mocking-bird, and many others., The elephant whose mate fell into a pit, and who dumped dirt and rubbish into the pit till bottom was raised high enough to enable the captive to step out, was equipped with the reasoning quality., I conceive that all animals that can learn things through teaching and drilling have to know how to observe, and put this and that together and draw an inference--the process of thinking., Could you teach an idiot of manuals of arms, and to advance, retreat, and go through complex field maneuvers at the word of command?, Y.M., Not if he were a thorough idiot., O.M., Well, canary-birds can learn all that; dogs and elephants learn all sorts of wonderful things., They must surely be able to notice, and to put things together, and say to themselves, ""I get the idea, now: when I do so and so, as per order, I am praised and fed;

and is distinctly offensive., It elevates the dumb beasts to--to--  O.M., Let us drop that lying phrase, and call them the Unrevealed Creatures; so far as we can know, there is no such thing as a dumb beast., Y.M., On what grounds do you make that assertion?, O.M., On quite simple ones., ""Dumb"" beast suggests an animal that has no thought-machinery, no understanding, no speech, no way of communicating what is in its mind., We know that a hen HAS speech., We cannot understand everything she says, but we easily learn two or three of her phrases., We know when she is saying, ""I have laid an egg""; we know when she is saying to the chicks, ""Run here, dears, I've found a worm""; we know what she is saying when she voices a warning: ""Quick!, hurry!, gather yourselves under mamma, there's a hawk coming!"", We understand the cat when she stretches herself out, purring with affection and contentment and lifts up a soft voice and says, ""Come, kitties, supper's ready""; we understand her when she goes mourning about and says, ""Where can they be?, They are lost., Won't you help me hunt for them?"", and we understand the disreputable Tom when he challenges at midnight from his shed, ""You come over here, you product of immoral commerce, and I'll make your fur fly!"", We understand a few of a dog's phrases and we learn to understand a few of the remarks and gestures of any bird or other animal that we domesticate and observe., The clearness and exactness of the few of the hen's speeches which we understand is argument that she can communicate to her kind a hundred things which we cannot comprehend--in a word, that she can converse., And this argument is also applicable in the case of others of the great army of the Unrevealed., It is just like man's vanity and impertinence to call an animal dumb because it is dumb to his dull perceptions., Now as to the ant--  Y.M., Yes, go back to the ant, the creature that--as you seem to think--sweeps away the last vestige of an intellectual frontier between man and the Unrevealed., O.M., That is what she surely does., In all his history the aboriginal Australian never thought out a house for himself and built it., The ant is an amazing architect., She is a wee little creature, but she builds a strong and enduring house eight feet high--a house which is as large in proportion to her size as is the largest capitol or cathedral in the world compared to man's size., ...]"|1

his ears are not alike; still, editor suggests the sound of Edward, and he will do., I could make him better if I had a model, but I made this one from memory., But is no particular matter; they all look alike, anyway., They are conceited and troublesome, and don't pay enough., Edward was the first really English king that had yet occupied the throne., The editor in the picture probably looks just as Edward looked when it was first borne in upon him that this was so., His whole attitude expressed gratification and pride mixed with stupefaction and astonishment., Edward II., now; twenty BLUE squares., Another editor., That thing behind his ear is his pencil., Whenever he finds a bright thing in your manuscript he strikes it out with that., That does him good, and makes him smile and show his teeth, the way he is doing in the picture., This one has just been striking out a smart thing, and now he is sitting there with his thumbs in his vest-holes, gloating., They are full of envy and malice, editors are., This picture will serve to remind you that Edward II., was the first English king who was DEPOSED., Upon demand, he signed his deposition himself., He had found kingship a most aggravating and disagreeable occupation, and you can see by the look of him that he is glad he resigned., He has put his blue pencil up for good now., He had struck out many a good thing with it in his time., Edward III., next; fifty RED squares., This editor is a critic., He has pulled out his carving-knife and his tomahawk and is starting after a book which he is going to have for breakfast., This one's arms are put on wrong., I did not notice it at first, but I see it now., Somehow he has got his right arm on his left shoulder, and his left arm on his right shoulder, and this shows us the back of his hands in both instances., It makes him left-handed all around, which is a thing which has never happened before, except perhaps in a museum., That is the way with art, when it is not acquired but born to you: you start in to make some simple little thing, not suspecting that your genius is beginning to work and swell and strain in secret, and all of a sudden there is a convulsion and you fetch out something astonishing., This is called inspiration., It is an accident; you never know when it is coming., I might have tried as much as a year to think of such a strange thing as an all-around left-handed man and I could not have done it, for the more you try to think of an unthinkable thing the more it eludes you; but it can't elude inspiration; you have only to bait with inspiration and you will get it every time., Look at Botticelli's ""Spring."", Those snaky women were unthinkable, but inspiration secured them for us, thanks to goodness., It is too late to reorganize this editor-critic now; we will leave him as he is., He will serve to remind us., Richard II., next; twenty-two WHITE squares., We use the lion again because this is another Richard., Like Edward II., he was DEPOSED., He is taking a last sad look at his crown before they take it away., There was not room enough and I have made it too small; but it never fitted him, anyway., Now we turn the corner of the century with a new line of monarchs--the Lancastrian kings., Henry IV., ; fourteen squares of YELLOW paper., This hen has laid the egg of a new dynasty and realizes the magnitude of the event., She is giving notice in the usual way., You notice I am improving in the construction of hens., At first I made them too much like other animals, but this one is orthodox., I mention this to encourage you., You will find that the more you practice the more accurate you will become., I could always draw animals, but before I was educated I could not tell what kind they were when I got them done, but now I can., Keep up your courage; it will be the same with you, although you may not think it., This Henry died the year after Joan of Arc was born., Henry V.; nine BLUE squares., There you see him lost in meditation over the monument which records the amazing figures of the battle of Agincourt., French history says 20,000 Englishmen routed 80,000 Frenchmen there; and English historians say that the French loss, in killed and wounded, was 60,000., Henry VI., ; thirty-nine RED squares., This is poor Henry VI., who reigned long and scored many misfortunes and humiliations., Also two great disasters: he lost France to Joan of Arc and he lost the throne and ended the dynasty which Henry IV., ...]"|1
79|"[[Figure 1]  It is arranged on the basis of Isaac Pitman's PHONOGRAPHY., Isaac Pitman was the originator and father of scientific phonography., It is used throughout the globe., It was a memorable invention., He made it public seventy-three years ago., The firm of Isaac Pitman & Sons, New York, still exists, and they continue the master's work., What should we gain?, First of all, we could spell DEFINITELY--and correctly--any word you please, just by the SOUND of it., We can't do that with our present alphabet., For instance, take a simple, every-day word PHTHISIS., If we tried to spell it by the sound of it, we should make it TYSIS, and be laughed at by every educated person., Secondly, we should gain in REDUCTION OF LABOR in writing., Simplified Spelling makes valuable reductions in the case of several hundred words, but the new spelling must be LEARNED., You can't spell them by the sound; you must get them out of the book., But even if we knew the simplified form for every word in the language, the phonographic alphabet would still beat the Simplified Speller ""hands down"" in the important matter of economy of labor., I will illustrate:  PRESENT FORM: through, laugh, highland., SIMPLIFIED FORM: thru, laff, hyland., PHONOGRAPHIC FORM:   To write the word ""through,"" the pen has to make twenty-one strokes., To write the word ""thru,"" then pen has to make twelve strokes--a good saving., To write that same word with the phonographic alphabet, the pen has to make only THREE strokes., To write the word ""laugh,"" the pen has to make FOURTEEN strokes., To write ""laff,"" the pen has to make the SAME NUMBER of strokes--no labor is saved to the penman., To write the same word with the phonographic alphabet, the pen has to make only THREE strokes., To write the word ""highland,"" the pen has to make twenty-two strokes., To write ""hyland,"" the pen has to make eighteen strokes., To write that word with the phonographic alphabet, the pen has to make only FIVE strokes., To write the words ""phonographic alphabet,"" the pen has to make fifty-three strokes., To write ""fonografic alfabet,"" the pen has to make fifty strokes., To the penman, the saving in labor is insignificant., To write that word (with vowels) with the phonographic alphabet, the pen has to make only SEVENTEEN strokes., Without the vowels, only THIRTEEN strokes., The vowels are hardly necessary, this time., We make five pen-strokes in writing an m.  Thus: a stroke down; a stroke up; a second stroke down; a second stroke up; a final stroke down., Total, five., The phonographic alphabet accomplishes the m with a single stroke--a curve, like a parenthesis that has come home drunk and has fallen face down right at the front door where everybody that goes along will see him and say, Alas!, When our written m is not the end of a word, but is otherwise located, it has to be connected with the next letter, and that requires another pen-stroke, making six in all, before you get rid of that m.  But never mind about the connecting strokes--let them go., Without counting them, the twenty-six letters of our alphabet consumed about eighty pen-strokes for their construction--about three pen-strokes per letter., It is THREE TIMES THE NUMBER required by the phonographic alphabet., It requires but ONE stroke for each letter., My writing-gait is--well, I don't know what it is, but I will time myself and see., Result: it is twenty-four words per minute., I don't mean composing; I mean COPYING., There isn't any definite composing-gait., Very well, my copying-gait is 1,440 words per hour--say 1,500., If I could use the phonographic character with facility I could do the 1,500 in twenty minutes., I could do nine hours' copying in three hours; I could do three years' copying in one year., Also, if I had a typewriting machine with the phonographic alphabet on it--oh, the miracles I could do!, I am not pretending to write that character well., I have never had a lesson, and I am copying the letters from the book., But I can accomplish my desire, at any rate, which is, to make the reader get a good and clear idea of the advantage it would be to us if we could discard our present alphabet and put this better one in its place--using it in books, newspapers, with the typewriter, and with the pen., --MAN DOG HORSE., I think it is graceful and would look comely in print., And consider--once more, I beg--what a labor-saver it is!, Ten pen-strokes with the one system to convey those three words above, and thirty-three by the other!, [Figure 6]  I mean, in SOME ways, not in all., I suppose I might go so far as to say in most ways, and be within the facts, but never mind; let it go at SOME., One of the ways in which it exercises this birthright is--as I think--continuing to use our laughable alphabet these seventy-three years while there was a rational one at hand, to be had for the taking., It has taken five hundred years to simplify some of Chaucer's rotten spelling--if I may be allowed to use to frank a term as that--and it will take five hundred years more to get our exasperating new Simplified Corruptions accepted and running smoothly., And we sha'n't be any better off then than we are now; for in that day we shall still have the privilege the Simplifiers are exercising now: ANYBODY can change the spelling that wants to., BUT YOU CAN'T CHANGE THE PHONOGRAPHIC SPELLING; THERE ISN'T ANY WAY., It will always follow the SOUND., If you want to change the spelling, you have to change the sound first., Mind, I myself am a Simplified Speller; I belong to that unhappy guild that is patiently and hopefully trying to reform our drunken old alphabet by reducing his whiskey., Well, it will improve him., When they get through and have reformed him all they can by their system he will be only HALF drunk., Above that condition their system can never lift him., There is no competent, and lasting, and real reform for him but to take away his whiskey entirely, and fill up his jug with Pitman's wholesome and undiseased alphabet., One great drawback to Simplified Spelling is, that in print a simplified word looks so like the very nation!, and when you bunch a whole squadron of the Simplified together the spectacle is very nearly unendurable., The da ma ov koars kum when the publik ma be expektd to get rekonsyled to the bezair asspekt of the Simplified Kombynashuns, but--if I may be allowed the expression--is it worth the wasted time?, [Figure 7]  To see our letters put together in ways to which we are not accustomed offends the eye, and also takes the EXPRESSION out of the words., La on, Makduf, and damd be he hoo furst krys hold, enuf!, It doesn't thrill you as it used to do., The simplifications have sucked the thrill all out of it., But a written character with which we are NOT ACQUAINTED does not offend us--Greek, Hebrew, Russian, Arabic, and the others--they have an interesting look, and we see beauty in them, too., And this is true of hieroglyphics, as well., There is something pleasant and engaging about the mathematical signs when we do not understand them., The mystery hidden in these things has a fascination for us: we can't come across a printed page of shorthand without being impressed by it and wishing we could read it., Very well, what I am offering for acceptance and adopting is not shorthand, but longhand, written with the SHORTHAND ALPHABET UNREACHED., You can write three times as many words in a minute with it as you can write with our alphabet., And so, in a way, it IS properly a shorthand., It has a pleasant look, too; a beguiling look, an inviting look., I will write something in it, in my rude and untaught way: [Figure 8]  Even when _I_ do it it comes out prettier than it does in Simplified Spelling., Yes, and in the Simplified it costs one hundred and twenty-three pen-strokes to write it, whereas in the phonographic it costs only twenty-nine., Let us hope so, anyway., AS CONCERNS INTERPRETING THE DEITY  This line of hieroglyphics was for fourteen years the despair of all the scholars who labored over the mysteries of the Rosetta stone: [Figure 1]  After five years of study Champollion translated it thus:  Therefore let the worship of Epiphanes be maintained in all the temples, this upon pain of death., That was the twenty-forth translation that had been furnished by scholars., For a time it stood., But only for a time., Then doubts began to assail it and undermine it, and the scholars resumed their labors., Three years of patient work produced eleven new translations; among them, this, by Gr:unfeldt, was received with considerable favor:  The horse of Epiphanes shall be maintained at the public expense; this upon pain of death., But the following rendering, by Gospodin, was received by the learned world with yet greater favor:  The priest shall explain the wisdom of Epiphanes to all these people, and these shall listen with reverence, upon pain of death., Seven years followed, in which twenty-one fresh and widely varying renderings were scored--none of them quite convincing., But now, at last, came Rawlinson, the youngest of all the scholars, with a translation which was immediately and universally recognized as being the correct version, and his name became famous in a day., So famous, indeed, that even the children were familiar with it; and such a noise did the achievement itself make that not even the noise of the monumental political event of that same year--the flight from Elba--was able to smother it to silence., Rawlinson's version reads as follows:  Therefore, walk not away from the wisdom of Epiphanes, but turn and follow it; so shall it conduct thee to the temple's peace, and soften for thee the sorrows of life and the pains of death., Here is another difficult text:   It is demotic--a style of Egyptian writing and a phase of the language which has perished from the knowledge of all men twenty-five hundred years before the Christian era., Our red Indians have left many records, in the form of pictures, upon our crags and boulders., It has taken our most gifted and painstaking students two centuries to get at the meanings hidden in these pictures; yet there are still two little lines of hieroglyphics among the figures grouped upon the Dighton Rocks which they have not succeeds in interpreting to their satisfaction., These:   The suggested solutions are practically innumerable; they would fill a book., ...]"|1
80|"[Save one--far and away the most colossal prodigy of the entire accumulation--Shakespeare!, About him you can find out NOTHING., Nothing of even the slightest importance., Nothing worth the trouble of stowing away in your memory., Nothing that even remotely indicates that he was ever anything more than a distinctly commonplace person--a manager, an actor of inferior grade, a small trader in a small village that did not regard him as a person of any consequence, and had forgotten all about him before he was fairly cold in his grave., We can go to the records and find out the life-history of every renowned RACE-HORSE of modern times--but not Shakespeare's!, There are many reasons why, and they have been furnished in cart-loads (of guess and conjecture) by those troglodytes; but there is one that is worth all the rest of the reasons put together, and is abundantly sufficient all by itself--HE HADN'T ANY HISTORY TO RECORD., There is no way of getting around that deadly fact., And no sane way has yet been discovered of getting around its formidable significance., Its quite plain significance--to any but those thugs (I do not use the term unkindly) is, that Shakespeare had no prominence while he lived, and none until he had been dead two or three generations., The Plays enjoyed high fame from the beginning; and if he wrote them it seems a pity the world did not find it out., He ought to have explained that he was the author, and not merely a NOM DE PLUME for another man to hide behind., If he had been less intemperately solicitous about his bones, and more solicitous about his Works, it would have been better for his good name, and a kindness to us., The bones were not important., They will moulder away, they will turn to dust, but the Works will endure until the last sun goes down., About two months ago I was illuminating this Autobiography with some notions of mine concerning the Bacon-Shakespeare controversy, and I then took occasion to air the opinion that the Stratford Shakespeare was a person of no public consequence or celebrity during his lifetime, but was utterly obscure and unimportant., And not only in great London, but also in the little village where he was born, where he lived a quarter of a century, and where he died and was buried., I argued that if he had been a person of any note at all, aged villagers would have had much to tell about him many and many a year after his death, instead of being unable to furnish inquirers a single fact connected with him., I believed, and I still believe, that if he had been famous, his notoriety would have lasted as long as mine has lasted in my native village out in Missouri., It is a good argument, a prodigiously strong one, and most formidable one for even the most gifted and ingenious and plausible Stratfordolator to get around or explain away., Today a Hannibal COURIER-POST of recent date has reached me, with an article in it which reinforces my contention that a really celebrated person cannot be forgotten in his village in the short space of sixty years., I will make an extract from it:  Hannibal, as a city, may have many sins to answer for, but ingratitude is not one of them, or reverence for the great men she has produced, and as the years go by her greatest son, Mark Twain, or S. L. Clemens as a few of the unlettered call him, grows in the estimation and regard of the residents of the town he made famous and the town that made him famous., His name is associated with every old building that is torn down to make way for the modern structures demanded by a rapidly growing city, and with every hill or cave over or through which he might by any possibility have roamed, while the many points of interest which he wove into his stories, such as Holiday Hill, Jackson's Island, or Mark Twain Cave, are now monuments to his genius., Hannibal is glad of any opportunity to do him honor as he had honored her., So it has happened that the ""old timers"" who went to school with Mark or were with him on some of his usual escapades have been honored with large audiences whenever they were in a reminiscent mood and condescended to tell of their intimacy with the ordinary boy who came to be a very extraordinary humorist and whose every boyish act is now seen to have been indicative of what was to come., Like Aunt Becky and Mrs. Clemens, they can now see that Mark was hardly appreciated when he lived here and that the things he did as a boy and was whipped for doing were not all bad, after all., So they have been in no hesitancy about drawing out the bad things he did as well as the good in their efforts to get a ""Mark Twain"" story, all incidents being viewed in the light of his present fame, until the volume of ""Twainiana"" is already considerable and growing in proportion as the ""old timers"" drop away and the stories are retold second and third hand by their descendants., With some seventy-three years and living in a villa instead of a house, he is a fair target, and let him incorporate, copyright, or patent himself as he will, there are some of his ""works"" that will go swooping up Hannibal chimneys as long as graybeards gather about the fires and begin with, ""I've heard father tell,"" or possibly, ""Once when I."", The Mrs. Clemens referred to is my mother--WAS my mother., And here is another extract from a Hannibal paper, of date twenty days ago:  Miss Becca Blankenship died at the home of William Dickason, 408 Rock Street, at 2.30 o'clock yesterday afternoon, aged 72 years., The deceased was a sister of ""Huckleberry Finn,"" one of the famous characters in Mark Twain's TOM SAWYER., She had been a member of the Dickason family--the housekeeper--for nearly forty-five years, and was a highly respected lady., For the past eight years she had been an invalid, but was as well cared for by Mr. Dickason and his family as if she had been a near relative., She was a member of the Park Methodist Church and a Christian woman., I remember her well., I have a picture of her in my mind which was graven there, clear and sharp and vivid, sixty-three years ago., She was at that time nine years old, and I was about eleven., I remember where she stood, and how she looked; and I can still see her bare feet, her bare head, her brown face, and her short tow-linen frock., She was crying., What it was about I have long ago forgotten., But it was the tears that preserved the picture for me, no doubt., She was a good child, I can say that for her., She knew me nearly seventy years ago., Did she forget me, in the course of time?, I think not., If she had lived in Stratford in Shakespeare's time, would she have forgotten him?, Yes., For he was never famous during his lifetime, he was utterly obscure in Stratford, and there wouldn't be any occasion to remember him after he had been dead a week., ""Injun Joe,"" ""Jimmy Finn,"" and ""General Gaines"" were prominent and very intemperate ne'er-do-weels in Hannibal two generations ago., Plenty of grayheads there remember them to this day, and can tell you about them., Isn't it curious that two ""town drunkards"" and one half-breed loafer should leave behind them, in a remote Missourian village, a fame a hundred times greater and several hundred times more particularized in the matter of definite facts than Shakespeare left behind him in the village where he had lived the half of his lifetime?, It was in 1590--winter., Austria was far away from the world, and asleep; it was still the Middle Ages in Austria, and promised to remain so forever., Some even set it away back centuries upon centuries and said that by the mental and spiritual clock it was still the Age of Belief in Austria., But they meant it as a compliment, not a slur, and it was so taken, and we were all proud of it., I remember it well, although I was only a boy; and I remember, too, the pleasure it gave me., Yes, Austria was far from the world, and asleep, and our village was in the middle of that sleep, being in the middle of Austria., It drowsed in peace in the deep privacy of a hilly and woodsy solitude where news from the world hardly ever came to disturb its dreams, and was infinitely content., At its front flowed the tranquil river, its surface painted with cloud-forms and the reflections of drifting arks and stone-boats; behind it rose the woody steeps to the base of the lofty precipice; from the top of the precipice frowned a vast castle, its long stretch of towers and bastions mailed in vines; beyond the river, a league to the left, was a tumbled expanse of forest-clothed hills cloven by winding gorges where the sun never penetrated; and to the right a precipice overlooked the river, and between it and the hills just spoken of lay a far-reaching plain dotted with little homesteads nested among orchards and shade trees., The whole region for leagues around was the hereditary property of a prince, whose servants kept the castle always in perfect condition for occupancy, but neither he nor his family came there oftener than once in five years., When they came it was as if the lord of the world had arrived, and had brought all the glories of its kingdoms along; and when they went they left a calm behind which was like the deep sleep which follows an orgy., Eseldorf was a paradise for us boys., We were not overmuch pestered with schooling., Mainly we were trained to be good Christians; to revere the Virgin, the Church, and the saints above everything., Beyond these matters we were not required to know much; and, in fact, not allowed to., Knowledge was not good for the common people, and could make them discontented with the lot which God had appointed for them, and God would not endure discontentment with His plans., We had two priests., One of them, Father Adolf, was a very zealous and strenuous priest, much considered., There may have been better priests, in some ways, than Father Adolf, but there was never one in our commune who was held in more solemn and awful respect., This was because he had absolutely no fear of the Devil., He was the only Christian I have ever known of whom that could be truly said., People stood in deep dread of him on that account; for they thought that there must be something supernatural about him, else he could not be so bold and so confident., All men speak in bitter disapproval of the Devil, but they do it reverently, not flippantly; but Father Adolf's way was very different; he called him by every name he could lay his tongue to, and it made everyone shudder that heard him; and often he would even speak of him scornfully and scoffingly; then the people crossed themselves and went quickly out of his presence, fearing that something fearful might happen., Father Adolf had actually met Satan face to face more than once, and defied him., This was known to be so., Father Adolf said it himself., He never made any secret of it, but spoke it right out., And that he was speaking true there was proof in at least one instance, for on that occasion he quarreled with the enemy, and intrepidly threw his bottle at him; and there, upon the wall of his study, was the ruddy splotch where it struck and broke., But it was Father Peter, the other priest, that we all loved best and were sorriest for., Some people charged him with talking around in conversation that God was all goodness and would find a way to save all his poor human children., It was a horrible thing to say, but there was never any absolute proof that Father Peter said it; and it was out of character for him to say it, too, for he was always good and gentle and truthful., He wasn't charged with saying it in the pulpit, where all the congregation could hear and testify, but only outside, in talk; and it is easy for enemies to manufacture that., Father Peter had an enemy and a very powerful one, the astrologer who lived in a tumbled old tower up the valley, and put in his nights studying the stars., Every one knew he could foretell wars and famines, though that was not so hard, for there was always a war, and generally a famine somewhere., But he could also read any man's life through the stars in a big book he had, and find lost property, and every one in the village except Father Peter stood in awe of him., Even Father Adolf, who had defied the Devil, had a wholesome respect for the astrologer when he came through our village wearing his tall, pointed hat and his long, flowing robe with stars on it, carrying his big book, and a staff which was known to have magic power., The bishop himself sometimes listened to the astrologer, it was said, for, besides studying the stars and prophesying, the astrologer made a great show of piety, which would impress the bishop, of course., But Father Peter took no stock in the astrologer., He denounced him openly as a charlatan--a fraud with no valuable knowledge of any kind, or powers beyond those of an ordinary and rather inferior human being, which naturally made the astrologer hate Father Peter and wish to ruin him., It was the astrologer, as we all believed, who originated the story about Father Peter's shocking remark and carried it to the bishop., It was said that Father Peter had made the remark to his niece, Marget, though Marget denied it and implored the bishop to believe her and spare her old uncle from poverty and disgrace., But the bishop wouldn't listen., He suspended Father Peter indefinitely, though he wouldn't go so far as to excommunicate him on the evidence of only one witness; and now Father Peter had been out a couple of years, and our other priest, Father Adolf, had his flock., Those had been hard years for the old priest and Marget., They had been favorites, but of course that changed when they came under the shadow of the bishop's frown., Many of their friends fell away entirely, and the rest became cool and distant., Marget was a lovely girl of eighteen when the trouble came, and she had the best head in the village, and the most in it., She taught the harp, and earned all her clothes and pocket money by her own industry., But her scholars fell off one by one now; she was forgotten when there were dances and parties among the youth of the village; the young fellows stopped coming to the house, all except Wilhelm Meidling--and he could have been spared; she and her uncle were sad and forlorn in their neglect and disgrace, and the sunshine was gone out of their lives., Matters went worse and worse, all through the two years., ...]"|1
81|"[It's drying, in the kitchen; I'll fetch it."", He had been spending his penny savings in fanciful trifles of various kinds, to go as prizes in the games, and they were marshaled with fine and showy effect upon the table., He said:  ""Examine them at your leisure while I get mother to touch up the kite with her iron if it isn't dry enough yet."", Then he tripped out and went clattering down-stairs, whistling., We did not look at the things; we couldn't take any interest in anything but the clock., We sat staring at it in silence, listening to the ticking, and every time the minute-hand jumped we nodded recognition--one minute fewer to cover in the race for life or for death., Finally Seppi drew a deep breath and said:  ""Two minutes to ten., Seven minutes more and he will pass the death-point., Theodor, he is going to be saved!, He's going to--""  ""Hush!, I'm on needles., Watch the clock and keep still."", Five minutes more., We were panting with the strain and the excitement., Another three minutes, and there was a footstep on the stair., ""Saved!"", And we jumped up and faced the door., The old mother entered, bringing the kite., ""Isn't it a beauty?"", she said., ""And, dear me, how he has slaved over it--ever since daylight, I think, and only finished it awhile before you came."", She stood it against the wall, and stepped back to take a view of it., ""He drew the pictures his own self, and I think they are very good., The church isn't so very good, I'll have to admit, but look at the bridge--any one can recognize the bridge in a minute., He asked me to bring it up....  Dear me!, it's seven minutes past ten, and I--""  ""But where is he?"", ""He?, Oh, he'll be here soon; he's gone out a minute."", ""Gone out?"", ""Yes., Just as he came down-stairs little Lisa's mother came in and said the child had wandered off somewhere, and as she was a little uneasy I told Nikolaus to never mind about his father's orders--go and look her up....  Why, how white you two do look!, I do believe you are sick., Sit down; I'll fetch something., That cake has disagreed with you., It is a little heavy, but I thought--""  She disappeared without finishing her sentence, and we hurried at once to the back window and looked toward the river., There was a great crowd at the other end of the bridge, and people were flying toward that point from every direction., ""Oh, it is all over--poor Nikolaus!, Why, oh, why did she let him get out of the house!"", ""Come away,"" said Seppi, half sobbing, ""come quick--we can't bear to meet her; in five minutes she will know."", But we were not to escape., She came upon us at the foot of the stairs, with her cordials in her hands, and made us come in and sit down and take the medicine., Then she watched the effect, and it did not satisfy her; so she made us wait longer, and kept upbraiding herself for giving us the unwholesome cake., Presently the thing happened which we were dreading., There was a sound of tramping and scraping outside, and a crowd came solemnly in, with heads uncovered, and laid the two drowned bodies on the bed., ""Oh, my God!"", that poor mother cried out, and fell on her knees, and put her arms about her dead boy and began to cover the wet face with kisses., ""Oh, it was I that sent him, and I have been his death., If I had obeyed, and kept him in the house, this would not have happened., And I am rightly punished; I was cruel to him last night, and him begging me, his own mother, to be his friend."", And so she went on and on, and all the women cried, and pitied her, and tried to comfort her, but she could not forgive herself and could not be comforted, and kept on saying if she had not sent him out he would be alive and well now, and she was the cause of his death., It shows how foolish people are when they blame themselves for anything they have done., Satan knows, and he said nothing happens that your first act hasn't arranged to happen and made inevitable; and so, of your own motion you can't ever alter the scheme or do a thing that will break a link., Next we heard screams, and Frau Brandt came wildly plowing and plunging through the crowd with her dress in disorder and hair flying loose, and flung herself upon her dead child with moans and kisses and pleadings and endearments; and by and by she rose up almost exhausted with her outpourings of passionate emotion, and clenched her fist and lifted it toward the sky, and her tear-drenched face grew hard and resentful, and she said:  ""For nearly two weeks I have had dreams and presentiments and warnings that death was going to strike what was most precious to me, and day and night and night and day I have groveled in the dirt before Him praying Him to have pity on my innocent child and save it from harm--and here is His answer!"", Why, He had saved it from harm--but she did not know., She wiped the tears from her eyes and cheeks, and stood awhile gazing down at the child and caressing its face and its hair with her hands; then she spoke again in that bitter tone: ""But in His hard heart is no compassion., I will never pray again."", She gathered her dead child to her bosom and strode away, the crowd falling back to let her pass, and smitten dumb by the awful words they had heard., Ah, that poor woman!, It is as Satan said, we do not know good fortune from bad, and are always mistaking the one for the other., Many a time since I have heard people pray to God to spare the life of sick persons, but I have never done it., Both funerals took place at the same time in our little church next day., Everybody was there, including the party guests., Satan was there, too; which was proper, for it was on account of his efforts that the funerals had happened., Nikolaus had departed this life without absolution, and a collection was taken up for masses, to get him out of purgatory., Only two-thirds of the required money was gathered, and the parents were going to try to borrow the rest, but Satan furnished it., He told us privately that there was no purgatory, but he had contributed in order that Nikolaus's parents and their friends might be saved from worry and distress., We thought it very good of him, but he said money did not cost him anything., At the graveyard the body of little Lisa was seized for debt by a carpenter to whom the mother owed fifty groschen for work done the year before., She had never been able to pay this, and was not able now., The carpenter took the corpse home and kept it four days in his cellar, the mother weeping and imploring about his house all the time; then he buried it in his brother's cattle-yard, without religious ceremonies., It drove the mother wild with grief and shame, and she forsook her work and went daily about the town, cursing the carpenter and blaspheming the laws of the emperor and the church, and it was pitiful to see., Seppi asked Satan to interfere, but he said the carpenter and the rest were members of the human race and were acting quite neatly for that species of animal., He would interfere if he found a horse acting in such a way, and we must inform him when we came across that kind of horse doing that kind of human thing, so that he could stop it., We believed this was sarcasm, for of course there wasn't any such horse., But after a few days we found that we could not abide that poor woman's distress, so we begged Satan to examine her several possible careers, and see if he could not change her, to her profit, to a new one., He said the longest of her careers as they now stood gave her forty-two years to live, and her shortest one twenty-nine, and that both were charged with grief and hunger and cold and pain., The only improvement he could make would be to enable her to skip a certain three minutes from now; and he asked us if he should do it., This was such a short time to decide in that we went to pieces with nervous excitement, and before we could pull ourselves together and ask for particulars he said the time would be up in a few more seconds; so then we gasped out, ""Do it!"", ""It is done,"" he said; ""she was going around a corner; I have turned her back; it has changed her career."", ""Then what will happen, Satan?"", ""It is happening now., She is having words with Fischer, the weaver., In his anger Fischer will straightway do what he would not have done but for this accident., He was present when she stood over her child's body and uttered those blasphemies."", ""What will he do?"", ""He is doing it now--betraying her., In three days she will go to the stake."", We could not speak; we were frozen with horror, for if we had not meddled with her career she would have been spared this awful fate., Satan noticed these thoughts, and said:  ""What you are thinking is strictly human-like--that is to say, foolish., The woman is advantaged., Die when she might, she would go to heaven., By this prompt death she gets twenty-nine years more of heaven than she is entitled to, and escapes twenty-nine years of misery here."", A moment before we were bitterly making up our minds that we would ask no more favors of Satan for friends of ours, for he did not seem to know any way to do a person a kindness but by killing him; but the whole aspect of the case was changed now, and we were glad of what we had done and full of happiness in the thought of it., After a little I began to feel troubled about Fischer, and asked, timidly, ""Does this episode change Fischer's life-scheme, Satan?"", ""Change it?, Why, certainly., And radically., If he had not met Frau Brandt awhile ago he would die next year, thirty-four years of age., Now he will live to be ninety, and have a pretty prosperous and comfortable life of it, as human lives go."", We felt a great joy and pride in what we had done for Fischer, and were expecting Satan to sympathize with this feeling; but he showed no sign and this made us uneasy., ...]"|1

everybody wanted to tell him; everybody began., But Billy Stevens, the barkeeper, called the house to order, and said one at a time was best., He distributed the drinks, and appointed Ferguson to lead., Ferguson said:  ""Well, he's a boy., And that is just about all we know about him., You can pump him till you are tired; it ain't any use; you won't get anything., At least about his intentions, or line of business, or where he's from, and such things as that., And as for getting at the nature and get-up of his main big chief mystery, why, he'll just change the subject, that's all., You can guess till you're black in the face--it's your privilege--but suppose you do, where do you arrive at?, Nowhere, as near as I can make out."", ""What is his big chief one?"", ""Sight, maybe., Hearing, maybe., Instinct, maybe., Magic, maybe., Take your choice--grownups, twenty-five; children and servants, half price., Now I'll tell you what he can do., You can start here, and just disappear; you can go and hide wherever you want to, I don't care where it is, nor how far--and he'll go straight and put his finger on you."", ""You don't mean it!"", ""I just do, though., Weather's nothing to him--elemental conditions is nothing to him--he don't even take notice of them."", ""Oh, come!, Dark?, Rain?, Snow?, Hey?"", ""It's all the same to him., He don't give a damn."", ""Oh, say--including fog, per'aps?"", ""Fog!, he's got an eye 't can plunk through it like a bullet."", ""Now, boys, honor bright, what's he giving me?"", ""It's a fact!"", they all shouted., ""Go on, Wells-Fargo."", ""Well, sir, you can leave him here, chatting with the boys, and you can slip out and go to any cabin in this camp and open a book--yes, sir, a dozen of them--and take the page in your memory, and he'll start out and go straight to that cabin and open every one of them books at the right page, and call it off, and never make a mistake."", ""He must be the devil!"", ""More than one has thought it., Now I'll tell you a perfectly wonderful thing that he done., The other night he--""  There was a sudden great murmur of sounds outside, the door flew open, and an excited crowd burst in, with the camp's one white woman in the lead and crying:  ""My child!, my child!, she's lost and gone!, For the love of God help me to find Archy Stillman; we've hunted everywhere!"", Said the barkeeper:  ""Sit down, sit down, Mrs. Hogan, and don't worry., He asked for a bed three hours ago, tuckered out tramping the trails the way he's always doing, and went up-stairs., Ham Sandwich, run up and roust him out; he's in No., 14."", The youth was soon down-stairs and ready., He asked Mrs. Hogan for particulars., ""Bless you, dear, there ain't any; I wish there was., I put her to sleep at seven in the evening, and when I went in there an hour ago to go to bed myself, she was gone., I rushed for your cabin, dear, and you wasn't there, and I've hunted for you ever since, at every cabin down the gulch, and now I've come up again, and I'm that distracted and scared and heart-broke; but, thanks to God, I've found you at last, dear heart, and you'll find my child., Come on!, come quick!"", ""Move right along; I'm with you, madam., Go to your cabin first."", The whole company streamed out to join the hunt., All the southern half of the village was up, a hundred men strong, and waiting outside, a vague dark mass sprinkled with twinkling lanterns., The mass fell into columns by threes and fours to accommodate itself to the narrow road, and strode briskly along southward in the wake of the leaders., In a few minutes the Hogan cabin was reached., ""There's the bunk,"" said Mrs. Hogan; ""there's where she was; it's where I laid her at seven o'clock; but where she is now, God only knows."", ""Hand me a lantern,"" said Archy., He set it on the hard earth floor and knelt by it, pretending to examine the ground closely., ""Here's her track,"" he said, touching the ground here and there and yonder with his finger., ""Do you see?"", Several of the company dropped upon their knees and did their best to see., One or two thought they discerned something like a track; the others shook their heads and confessed that the smooth hard surface had no marks upon it which their eyes were sharp enough to discover., One said, ""Maybe a child's foot could make a mark on it, but I don't see how."", Young Stillman stepped outside, held the light to the ground, turned leftward, and moved three steps, closely examining; then said, ""I've got the direction--come along; take the lantern, somebody."", He strode off swiftly southward, the files following, swaying and bending in and out with the deep curves of the gorge., Thus a mile, and the mouth of the gorge was reached; before them stretched the sagebrush plain, dim, vast, and vague., Stillman called a halt, saying, ""We mustn't start wrong, now; we must take the direction again."", He took a lantern and examined the ground for a matter of twenty yards; then said, ""Come on; it's all right,"" and gave up the lantern., In and out among the sage-bushes he marched, a quarter of a mile, bearing gradually to the right; then took a new direction and made another great semicircle; then changed again and moved due west nearly half a mile--and stopped., ""She gave it up, here, poor little chap., Hold the lantern., You can see where she sat."", But this was in a slick alkali flat which was surfaced like steel, and no person in the party was quite hardy enough to claim an eyesight that could detect the track of a cushion on a veneer like that., The bereaved mother fell upon her knees and kissed the spot, lamenting., ""But where is she, then?"", some one said., ""She didn't stay here., We can see that much, anyway."", Stillman moved about in a circle around the place, with the lantern, pretending to hunt for tracks., ""Well!"", he said presently, in an annoyed tone, ""I don't understand it."", He examined again., ""No use., She was here--that's certain; she never walked away from here--and that's certain., It's a puzzle; I can't make it out."", The mother lost heart then., ""Oh, my God!, ...]"|1

they saw all things dimly, as through a veil; they were steeped in dreams, often they did not hear when they were spoken to; they often did not understand when they heard; they answered confusedly or at random; Sally sold molasses by weight, sugar by the yard, and furnished soap when asked for candles, and Aleck put the cat in the wash and fed milk to the soiled linen., Everybody was stunned and amazed, and went about muttering, ""What CAN be the matter with the Fosters?"", Three days., Then came events!, Things had taken a happy turn, and for forty-eight hours Aleck's imaginary corner had been booming., Up--up--still up!, Cost point was passed., Still up--and up --and up!, Cost point was passed., STill up--and up--and up!, Five points above cost--then ten--fifteen--twenty!, Twenty points cold profit on the vast venture, now, and Aleck's imaginary brokers were shouting frantically by imaginary long-distance, ""Sell!, sell!, for Heaven's sake SELL!"", She broke the splendid news to Sally, and he, too, said, ""Sell!, sell--oh, don't make a blunder, now, you own the earth!, --sell, sell!"", But she set her iron will and lashed it amidships, and said she would hold on for five points more if she died for it., It was a fatal resolve., The very next day came the historic crash, the record crash, the devastating crash, when the bottom fell out of Wall Street, and the whole body of gilt-edged stocks dropped ninety-five points in five hours, and the multimillionaire was seen begging his bread in the Bowery., Aleck sternly held her grip and ""put up"" as long as she could, but at last there came a call which she was powerless to meet, and her imaginary brokers sold her out., Then, and not till then, the man in her was vanished, and the woman in her resumed sway., She put her arms about her husband's neck and wept, saying:  ""I am to blame, do not forgive me, I cannot bear it., We are paupers!, Paupers, and I am so miserable., The weddings will never come off; all that is past; we could not even buy the dentist, now."", A bitter reproach was on Sally's tongue:  ""I BEGGED you to sell, but you--"" He did not say it; he had not the heart to add a hurt to that broken and repentant spirit., A nobler thought came to him and he said:  ""Bear up, my Aleck, all is not lost!, You really never invested a penny of my uncle's bequest, but only its unmaterialized future; what we have lost was only the incremented harvest from that future by your incomparable financial judgment and sagacity., Cheer up, banish these griefs; we still have the thirty thousand untouched; and with the experience which you have acquired, think what you will be able to do with it in a couple years!, The marriages are not off, they are only postponed."", These are blessed words., Aleck saw how true they were, and their influence was electric;

""a rival, sir, you would fancy in your own mind; but let me say for you, fear not!, fear not!, I will be one of the last persons to disgrace my sex by thus encouraging every one who may feel disposed to visit me, who may honor me with their graceful bows and their choicest compliments., It is true that young men too often mistake civil politeness for the finer emotions of the heart, which is tantamount to courtship; but, ah!, how often are they deceived, when they come to test the weight of sunbeams with those on whose strength hangs the future happiness of an untried life."", The people were now rushing to the Academy with impatient anxiety; the band of music was closely followed by the students; then the parents and guardians; nothing interrupted the glow of spirits which ran through every bosom, tinged with the songs of a Virgil and the tide of a Homer., Elfonzo and Ambulinia soon repaired to the scene, and fortunately for them both the house was so crowded that they took their seats together in the music department, which was not in view of the auditory., This fortuitous circumstances added more the bliss of the Major than a thousand such exhibitions would have done., He forgot that he was man; music had lost its charms for him; whenever he attempted to carry his part, the string of the instrument would break, the bow became stubborn, and refused to obey the loud calls of the audience., Here, he said, was the paradise of his home, the long-sought-for opportunity; he felt as though he could send a million supplications to the throne of Heaven for such an exalted privilege., Poor Leos, who was somewhere in the crowd, looking as attentively as if he was searching for a needle in a haystack; here is stood, wondering to himself why Ambulinia was not there., ""Where can she be?, Oh!, if she was only here, how I could relish the scene!, Elfonzo is certainly not in town; but what if he is?, I have got the wealth, if I have not the dignity, and I am sure that the squire and his lady have always been particular friends of mine, and I think with this assurance I shall be able to get upon the blind side of the rest of the family and make the heaven-born Ambulinia the mistress of all I possess."", Then, again, he would drop his head, as if attempting to solve the most difficult problem in Euclid., While he was thus conjecturing in his own mind, a very interesting part of the exhibition was going on, which called the attention of all present., The curtains of the stage waved continually by the repelled forces that were given to them, which caused Leos to behold Ambulinia leaning upon the chair of Elfonzo., Her lofty beauty, seen by the glimmering of the chandelier, filled his heart with rapture, he knew not how to contain himself; to go where they were would expose him to ridicule; to continue where he was, with such an object before him, without being allowed an explanation in that trying hour, would be to the great injury of his mental as well as of his physical powers; and, in the name of high heaven, what must he do?, Finally, he resolved to contain himself as well as he conveniently could, until the scene was over, and then he would plant himself at the door, to arrest Ambulinia from the hands of the insolent Elfonzo, and thus make for himself a more prosperous field of immortality than ever was decreed by Omnipotence, or ever pencil drew or artist imagined., Accordingly he made himself sentinel, immediately after the performance of the evening --retained his position apparently in defiance of all the world; he waited, he gazed at every lady, his whole frame trembled; here he stood, until everything like human shape had disappeared from the institution, and he had done nothing; he had failed to accomplish that which he so eagerly sought for., Poor, unfortunate creature!, he had not the eyes of an Argus, or he might have seen his Juno and Elfonzo, assisted by his friend Sigma, make their escape from the window, and, with the rapidity of a race-horse, hurry through the blast of the storm to the residence of her father, without being recognized., He did not tarry long, but assured Ambulinia the endless chain of their existence was more closely connected than ever, since he had seen the virtuous, innocent, imploring, and the constant Amelia murdered by the jealous-hearted Farcillo, the accursed of the land., The following is the tragical scene, which is only introduced to show the subject-matter that enabled Elfonzo to come to such a determinate resolution that nothing of the kind should ever dispossess him of his true character, should he be so fortunate as to succeed in his present undertaking., Amelia was the wife of Farcillo, and a virtuous woman;

something, if possible, that could evoke sentiment, interest, feeling., ""What is cat, in Italian?"", I asked., ""Gatto."", ""Is it a gentleman cat, or a lady?"", ""Gentleman cat."", ""How are these people as regards that animal?"", ""We-ll, they--they--""  ""You hesitate:  that is enough., How are they about chickens?"", He tilted his eyes toward heaven in mute ecstasy., I understood., ""What is chicken, in Italian?"", I asked., ""Pollo, PODERE."", (Podere is Italian for master., It is a title of courtesy, and conveys reverence and admiration.), ""Pollo is one chicken by itself; when there are enough present to constitute a plural, it is POLLI."", ""Very well, polli will do., Which squad is detailed for duty next?"", ""The Past Definite."", ""Send out and order it to the front--with chickens., And let them understand that we don't want any more of this cold indifference."", He gave the order to an aide, adding, with a haunting tenderness in his tone and a watering mouth in his aspect:  ""Convey to them the conception that these are unprotected chickens."", He turned to me, saluting with his hand to his temple, and explained, ""It will inflame their interest in the poultry, sire."", A few minutes elapsed., Then the squad marched in and formed up, their faces glowing with enthusiasm, and the file-leader shouted:  ""EBBI POLLI, I had chickens!"", ""Good!"", I said., ""Go on, the next."", ""AVEST POLLI, thou hadst chickens!"", ""Fine!, Next!"", ""EBBE POLLI, he had chickens!"", ""Moltimoltissimo!, Go on, the next!"", ""AVEMMO POLLI, we had chickens!"", ""Basta-basta aspettatto avanti--last man--CHARGE!"", ""EBBERO POLLI, they had chickens!"", Then they formed in echelon, by columns of fours, refused the left, and retired in great style on the double-quick., I was enchanted, and said:  ""Now, doctor, that is something LIKE!, Chickens are the ticket, there is no doubt about it., What is the next squad?"", ""The Imperfect."", ""How does it go?"", ""IO AVENA, I had, TU AVEVI, thou hadst, EGLI AVENA, he had, NOI AV--""  ""Wait--we've just HAD the hads., What are you giving me?"", ""But this is another breed."", ""What do we want of another breed?, Isn't one breed enough?, HAD is HAD, and your tricking it out in a fresh way of spelling isn't going to make it any hadder than it was before; now you know that yourself."", ""But there is a distinction--they are not just the same Hads."", ""How do you make it out?"", ""Well, you use that first Had when you are referring to something that happened at a named and sharp and perfectly definite moment; you use the other when the thing happened at a vaguely defined time and in a more prolonged and indefinitely continuous way."", ""Why, doctor, it is pure nonsense; you know it yourself., Look here: If I have had a had, or have wanted to have had a had, or was in a position right then and there to have had a had that hadn't had any chance to go out hadding on account of this foolish discrimination which lets one Had go hadding in any kind of indefinite grammatical weather but restricts the other one to definite and datable meteoric convulsions, and keeps it pining around and watching the barometer all the time, and liable to get sick through confinement and lack of exercise, and all that sort of thing, why--why, the inhumanity of it is enough, let alone the wanton superfluity and uselessness of any such a loafing consumptive hospital-bird of a Had taking up room and cumbering the place for nothing., These finical refinements revolt me; it is not right, it is not honorable; it is constructive nepotism to keep in office a Had that is so delicate it can't come out when the wind's in the nor'west--I won't have this dude on the payroll., Cancel his exequator; and look here--""  ""But you miss the point., It is like this., You see--""  ""Never mind explaining, I don't care anything about it., Six Hads is enough for me; anybody that needs twelve, let him subscribe; I don't want any stock in a Had Trust., Knock out the Prolonged and Indefinitely Continuous; four-fifths of it is water, anyway."", ""But I beg you, podere!, It is often quite indispensable in cases where--""  ""Pipe the next squad to the assault!"", But it was not to be; for at that moment the dull boom of the noon gun floated up out of far-off Florence, followed by the usual softened jangle of church-bells, Florentine and suburban, that bursts out in murmurous response; by labor-union law the COLAZIONE [1] must stop; stop promptly, stop instantly, stop definitely, like the chosen and best of the breed of Hads., A BURLESQUE BIOGRAPHY    Two or three persons having at different times intimated that if I would write an autobiography they would read it when they got leisure, I yield at last to this frenzied public demand and herewith tender my history., Ours is a noble house, and stretches a long way back into antiquity., The earliest ancestor the Twains have any record of was a friend of the family by the name of Higgins., This was in the eleventh century, when our people were living in Aberdeen, county of Cork, England., Why it is that our long line has ever since borne the maternal name (except when one of them now and then took a playful refuge in an alias to avert foolishness), instead of Higgins, is a mystery which none of us has ever felt much desire to stir., It is a kind of vague, pretty romance, and we leave it alone., All the old families do that way., Arthour Twain was a man of considerable note--a solicitor on the highway in William Rufus's time., At about the age of thirty he went to one of those fine old English places of resort called Newgate, to see about something, and never returned again., ...]"|1
86|"[If it is a reptile, and I suppose it is; for it has frowzy hair and blue eyes, and looks like a reptile., It has no hips; it tapers like a carrot; when it stands, it spreads itself apart like a derrick; so I think it is a reptile, though it may be architecture., I was afraid of it at first, and started to run every time it turned around, for I thought it was going to chase me; but by and by I found it was only trying to get away, so after that I was not timid any more, but tracked it along, several hours, about twenty yards behind, which made it nervous and unhappy., At last it was a good deal worried, and climbed a tree., I waited a good while, then gave it up and went home., Today the same thing over., I've got it up the tree again., SUNDAY.--It is up there yet., Resting, apparently., But that is a subterfuge:  Sunday isn't the day of rest; Saturday is appointed for that., It looks to me like a creature that is more interested in resting than it anything else., It would tire me to rest so much., It tires me just to sit around and watch the tree., I do wonder what it is for; I never see it do anything., They returned the moon last night, and I was SO happy!, I think it is very honest of them., It slid down and fell off again, but I was not distressed; there is no need to worry when one has that kind of neighbors; they will fetch it back., I wish I could do something to show my appreciation., I would like to send them some stars, for we have more than we can use., I mean I, not we, for I can see that the reptile cares nothing for such things., It has low tastes, and is not kind., When I went there yesterday evening in the gloaming it had crept down and was trying to catch the little speckled fishes that play in the pool, and I had to clod it to make it go up the tree again and let them alone., I wonder if THAT is what it is for?, Hasn't it any heart?, Hasn't it any compassion for those little creature?, Can it be that it was designed and manufactured for such ungentle work?, It has the look of it., One of the clods took it back of the ear, and it used language., It gave me a thrill, for it was the first time I had ever heard speech, except my own., I did not understand the words, but they seemed expressive., When I found it could talk I felt a new interest in it, for I love to talk; I talk, all day, and in my sleep, too, and I am very interesting, but if I had another to talk to I could be twice as interesting, and would never stop, if desired., If this reptile is a man, it isn't an IT, is it?, That wouldn't be grammatical, would it?, I think it would be HE., I think so., In that case one would parse it thus:  nominative, HE; dative, HIM; possessive, HIS'N., Well, I will consider it a man and call it he until it turns out to be something else., This will be handier than having so many uncertainties., NEXT WEEK SUNDAY.--All the week I tagged around after him and tried to get acquainted., I had to do the talking, because he was shy, but I didn't mind it., He seemed pleased to have me around, and I used the sociable ""we"" a good deal, because it seemed to flatter him to be included., WEDNESDAY.--We are getting along very well indeed, now, and getting better and better acquainted., He does not try to avoid me any more, which is a good sign, and shows that he likes to have me with him., That pleases me, and I study to be useful to him in every way I can, so as to increase his regard., During the last day or two I have taken all the work of naming things off his hands, and this has been a great relief to him, for he has no gift in that line, and is evidently very grateful., He can't think of a rational name to save him, but I do not let him see that I am aware of his defect., Whenever a new creature comes along I name it before he has time to expose himself by an awkward silence., In this way I have saved him many embarrassments., I have no defect like this., The minute I set eyes on an animal I know what it is., I don't have to reflect a moment; the right name comes out instantly, just as if it were an inspiration, as no doubt it is, for I am sure it wasn't in me half a minute before., I seem to know just by the shape of the creature and the way it acts what animal it is., When the dodo came along he thought it was a wildcat--I saw it in his eye., But I saved him., And I was careful not to do it in a way that could hurt his pride., I just spoke up in a quite natural way of pleasing surprise, and not as if I was dreaming of conveying information, and said, ""Well, I do declare, if there isn't the dodo!"", I explained--without seeming to be explaining --how I know it for a dodo, and although I thought maybe he was a little piqued that I knew the creature when he didn't, it was quite evident that he admired me., That was very agreeable, and I thought of it more than once with gratification before I slept., How little a thing can make us happy when we feel that we have earned it!, THURSDAY.--my first sorrow., Yesterday he avoided me and seemed to wish I would not talk to him., I could not believe it, and thought there was some mistake, for I loved to be with him, and loved to hear him talk, and so how could it be that he could feel unkind toward me when I had not done anything?, But at last it seemed true, so I went away and sat lonely in the place where I first saw him the morning that we were made and I did not know what he was and was indifferent about him; but now it was a mournful place, and every little think spoke of him, and my heart was very sore., I did not know why very clearly, for it was a new feeling; I had not experienced it before, and it was all a mystery, and I could not make it out., But when night came I could not bear the lonesomeness, and went to the new shelter which he has built, to ask him what I had done that was wrong and how I could mend it and get back his kindness again; but he put me out in the rain, and it was my first sorrow., SUNDAY.--It is pleasant again, now, and I am happy; but those were heavy days; I do not think of them when I can help it., I tried to get him some of those apples, but I cannot learn to throw straight., I failed, but I think the good intention pleased him., They are forbidden, and he says I shall come to harm; but so I come to harm through pleasing him, why shall I care for that harm?, MONDAY.--This morning I told him my name, hoping it would interest him., But he did not care for it., It is strange., If he should tell me his name, I would care., I think it would be pleasanter in my ears than any other sound., He talks very little., Perhaps it is because he is not bright, and is sensitive about it and wishes to conceal it., It is such a pity that he should feel so, for brightness is nothing; it is in the heart that the values lie., I wish I could make him understand that a loving good heart is riches, and riches enough, and that without it intellect is poverty., Although he talks so little, he has quite a considerable vocabulary., This morning he used a surprisingly good word., He evidently recognized, himself, that it was a good one, for he worked in in twice afterward, casually., It was good casual art, still it showed that he possesses a certain quality of perception., Without a doubt that seed can be made to grow, if cultivated., Where did he get that word?, I do not think I have ever used it., No, he took no interest in my name., I tried to hide my disappointment, but I suppose I did not succeed., I went away and sat on the moss-bank with my feet in the water., It is where I go when I hunger for companionship, some one to look at, some one to talk to., It is not enough--that lovely white body painted there in the pool --but it is something, and something is better than utter loneliness., It talks when I talk; it is sad when I am sad; it comforts me with its sympathy; it says, ""Do not be downhearted, you poor friendless girl; I will be your friend."", It IS a good friend to me, and my only one; it is my sister., That first time that she forsook me!, ah, I shall never forget that --never, never., My heart was lead in my body!, I said, ""She was all I had, and now she is gone!"", In my despair I said, ""Break, my heart; I cannot bear my life any more!"", and hid my face in my hands, and there was no solace for me., And when I took them away, after a little, there she was again, white and shining and beautiful, and I sprang into her arms!, That was perfect happiness; I had known happiness before, but it was not like this, which was ecstasy., ...]"|1
87|"[I was eager to get to business and find relief, but she was distressingly deliberate., She unpinned and unhooked and uncoupled her upholsteries one by one, abolished the wrinkles with a flirt of her hand, and hung the articles up; peeled off her gloves and disposed of them, got a book out of her hand-bag, then drew a chair to the bedside, descended into it without hurry, and I hung out my tongue., She said, with pity but without passion:  ""Return it to its receptacle., We deal with the mind only, not with its dumb servants."", I could not offer my pulse, because the connection was broken; but she detected the apology before I could word it, and indicated by a negative tilt of her head that the pulse was another dumb servant that she had no use for., Then I thought I would tell her my symptoms and how I felt, so that she would understand the case; but that was another inconsequence, she did not need to know those things; moreover, my remark about how I felt was an abuse of language, a misapplication of terms., ""One does not feel,"" she explained; ""there is no such thing as feeling: therefore, to speak of a non-existent thing as existent is a contradiction., Matter has no existence; nothing exists but mind; the mind cannot feel pain, it can only imagine it."", ""But if it hurts, just the same--""  ""It doesn't., A thing which is unreal cannot exercise the functions of reality., Pain is unreal; hence, pain cannot hurt."", In making a sweeping gesture to indicate the act of shooing the illusion of pain out of the mind, she raked her hand on a pin in her dress, said ""Ouch!"", and went tranquilly on with her talk., ""You should never allow yourself to speak of how you feel, nor permit others to ask you how you are feeling; you should never concede that you are ill, nor permit others to talk about disease or pain or death or similar nonexistences in your presence., Such talk only encourages the mind to continue its empty imaginings."", Just at that point the Stuben-madchen trod on the cat's tail, and the cat let fly a frenzy of cat-profanity., I asked, with caution:  ""Is a cat's opinion about pain valuable?"", ""A cat has no opinion; opinions proceed from mind only; the lower animals, being eternally perishable, have not been granted mind; without mind, opinion is impossible."", ""She merely imagined she felt a pain--the cat?"", ""She cannot imagine a pain, for imagining is an effect of mind; without mind, there is no imagination., A cat has no imagination."", ""Then she had a real pain?"", ""I have already told you there is no such thing as real pain."", ""It is strange and interesting., I do wonder what was the matter with the cat., Because, there being no such thing as a real pain, and she not being able to imagine an imaginary one, it would seem that God in His pity has compensated the cat with some kind of a mysterious emotion usable when her tail is trodden on which, for the moment, joins cat and Christian in one common brotherhood of--""  She broke in with an irritated--  ""Peace!, The cat feels nothing, the Christian feels nothing., Your empty and foolish imaginings are profanation and blasphemy, and can do you an injury., It is wiser and better and holier to recognize and confess that there is no such thing as disease or pain or death."", ""I am full of imaginary tortures,"" I said, ""but I do not think I could be any more uncomfortable if they were real ones., What must I do to get rid of them?"", ""There is no occasion to get rid of them since they do not exist., They are illusions propagated by matter, and matter has no existence; there is no such thing as matter."", ""It sounds right and clear, but yet it seems in a degree elusive; it seems to slip through, just when you think you are getting a grip on it."", ""Explain."", ""Well, for instance: if there is no such thing as matter, how can matter propagate things?"", In her compassion she almost smiled., She would have smiled if there were any such thing as a smile., ""It is quite simple,"" she said; ""the fundamental propositions of Christian Science explain it, and they are summarized in the four following self-evident propositions: 1., God is All in all., 2., God is good., Good is Mind 3., God, Spirit, being all, nothing is matter 4., Life, God, omnipotent Good, deny death, evil, sin, disease., ""There--now you see."", It seemed nebulous; it did not seem to say anything about the difficulty in hand--how non-existent matter can propagate illusions I said, with some hesitancy:  ""Does--does it explain?"", ""Doesn't it?, Even if read backward it will do it."", With a budding hope, I asked her to do it backwards., ""Very well., Disease sin evil death deny Good omnipotent God life matter is nothing all being Spirit God Mind is Good good is God all in All is God., There do you understand now?, ""It--it--well, it is plainer than it was before; still--""  ""Well?"", ""Could you try it some more ways?"", ""As many as you like; it always means the same., Interchanged in any way you please it cannot be made to mean anything different from what it means when put in any other way., Because it is perfect., You can jumble it all up, and it makes no difference: it always comes out the way it was before., It was a marvelous mind that produced it., As a mental tour de force it is without a mate, it defies alike the simple, the concrete, and the occult."", ""It seems to be a corker."", I blushed for the word, but it was out before I could stop it., ""A what?"", ""A--wonderful structure--combination, so to speak, of profound thoughts --unthinkable ones--um--""  It is true., Read backward, or forward, or perpendicularly, or at any given angle, these four propositions will always be found to agree in statement and proof."", ""Ah--proof., Now we are coming at it., The statements agree; they agree with--with--anyway, they agree; I noticed that; but what is it they prove I mean, in particular?"", ""Why, nothing could be clearer., They prove:  ""1., GOD--Principle, Life, Truth, Love, Soul, Spirit, Mind., Do you get that?"", ""I--well, I seem to., Go on, please."", ""2., MAN--God's universal idea, individual, perfect, eternal., Is it clear?"", ""It--I think so., Continue."", ""3., IDEA--An image in Mind; the immediate object of understanding., There it is--the whole sublime Arcana of Christian Science in a nutshell., Do you find a weak place in it anywhere?"", ""Well--no; it seems strong."", ""Very well There is more., Those three constitute the Scientific Definition of Immortal Mind., Next, we have the Scientific Definition of Mortal Mind., Thus., FIRST DEGREE: Depravity I.

88|"[Mrs. Eddy framed it--it is her very own--it bears her trade-mark., ""The Bible and Science and Health, with other works by the same author,"" could have come from no literary vacuum but the one which produced the remark (in the Autobiography): ""I remember reading, in my childhood, certain manuscripts containing Scriptural Sonnets, besides other verses and enigmas."", We know what she means, in both instances, but a low-priced Clerk would not necessarily know, and on a salary like his he could quite excusably aver that the Pastor Emeritus had commanded him to come and make proclamation that she was author of the Bible, and that she was thinking of discharging some Scriptural sonnets and other enigmas upon the congregation., It could lose him his place, but it would not be fair, if it happened before the edict about ""Understanding Communications"" was promulgated., The By-law book makes a showy pretence of orderliness and system, but it is only a pretence., I will not go so far as to say it is a harum-scarum jumble, for it is not that, but I think it fair to say it is at least jumbulacious in places., For instance, Articles III., and IV., set forth in much detail the qualifications and duties of Readers, she then skips some thirty pages and takes up the subject again., It looks like slovenliness, but it may be only art., The belated By-law has a sufficiently quiet look, but it has a ton of dynamite in it., It makes all the Christian Science Church Readers on the globe the personal chattels of Mrs. Eddy., Whenever she chooses, she can stretch her long arm around the world's fat belly and flirt a Reader out of his pulpit, though he be tucked away in seeming safety and obscurity in a lost village in the middle of China:  She does not have to prefer charges against him, she does not have to find him lazy, careless, incompetent, untidy, ill-mannered, unholy, dishonest, she does not have to discover a fault of any kind in him, she does not have to tell him nor his congregation why she dismisses and disgraces him and insults his meek flock, she does not have to explain to his family why she takes the bread out of their mouths and turns them out-of-doors homeless and ashamed in a strange land; she does not have to do anything but send a letter and say: ""Pack!--and ask no questions!"", Has the Pope this power?--the other Pope--the one in Rome., Has he anything approaching it?, Can he turn a priest out of his pulpit and strip him of his office and his livelihood just upon a whim, a caprice, and meanwhile furnishing no reasons to the parish?, Not in America., And not elsewhere, we may believe., It is odd and strange, to see intelligent and educated people among us worshipping this self-seeking and remorseless tyrant as a God., This worship is denied--by persons who are themselves worshippers of Mrs. Eddy., I feel quite sure that it is a worship which will continue during ages., That Mrs. Eddy wrote that amazing By-law with her own hand we have much better evidence than her word., We have her English., It is there., It cannot be imitated., She ought never to go to the expense of copyrighting her verbal discharges., When any one tries to claim them she should call me; I can always tell them from any other literary apprentice's at a glance., It was like her to call America a ""nation""; she would call a sand-bar a nation if it should fall into a sentence in which she was speaking of peoples, for she would not know how to untangle it and get it out and classify it by itself., And the closing arrangement of that By-law is in true Eddysonian form, too., In it she reserves authority to make a Reader fill any office connected with a Science church-sexton, grave-digger, advertising-agent, Annex-polisher, leader of the choir, President, Director, Treasurer, Clerk, etc., She did not mean that., She already possessed that authority., She meant to clothe herself with power, despotic and unchallengeable, to appoint all Science Readers to their offices, both at home and abroad., The phrase ""or to appoint"" is another miscarriage of intention; she did not mean ""or,"" she meant ""and."", That By-law puts into Mrs. Eddy's hands absolute command over the most formidable force and influence existent in the Christian Science kingdom outside of herself, and it does this unconditionally and (by auxiliary force of Laws already quoted) irrevocably., Still, she is not quite satisfied., Something might happen, she doesn't know what., Therefore she drives in one more nail, to make sure, and drives it deep:  Let some one with a wild and delirious fancy try and see if he can imagine her furnishing that consent., Very properly, the first qualification for membership in the Mother-Church is belief in the doctrines of Christian Science., But these doctrines must not be gathered from secondary sources., There is but one recognized source., The candidate must be a believer in the doctrines of Christian Science ""according to the platform and teaching contained in the Christian Science text-book, 'Science and Health, with Key to the Scriptures,' by Rev., Mary Baker G., Eddy."", That is definite, and is final., There are to be no commentaries, no labored volumes of exposition and explanation by anybody except Mrs. Eddy., Because such things could sow error, create warring opinions, split the religion into sects, and disastrously cripple its power., Mrs. Eddy will do the whole of the explaining, Herself--has done it, in fact., She has written several books., They are to be had (for cash in advance), they are all sacred; additions to them can never be needed and will never be permitted., They tell the candidate how to instruct himself, how to teach others, how to do all things comprised in the business--and they close the door against all would-be competitors, and monopolize the trade:  Mrs. Eddy's words are to be the sole elucidators of the Bible and Science and Health--forever., Throughout the ages, whenever there is doubt as to the meaning of a passage in either of these books the inquirer will not dream of trying to explain it to himself; he would shudder at the thought of such temerity, such profanity, he would be haled to the Inquisition and thence to the public square and the stake if he should be caught studying into text-meanings on his own hook; he will be prudent and seek the meanings at the only permitted source, Mrs. Eddy's commentaries., Value of this Strait-jacket., One must not underrate the magnificence of this long-headed idea, one must not underestimate its giant possibilities in the matter of trooping the Church solidly together and keeping it so., It squelches independent inquiry, and makes such a thing impossible, profane, criminal, it authoritatively settles every dispute that can arise., It starts with finality--a point which the Roman Church has travelled towards fifteen or sixteen centuries, stage by stage, and has not yet reached., The matter of the Immaculate Conception of the Virgin Mary was not authoritatively settled until the days of Pius IX., --yesterday, so to speak., As already noticed, the Protestants are broken up into a long array of sects, a result of disputes about the meanings of texts, disputes made unavoidable by the absence of an infallible authority to submit doubtful passages to., A week or two ago (I am writing in the middle of January, 1903), the clergy and others hereabouts had a warm dispute in the papers over this question: Did Jesus anywhere claim to be God?, It seemed an easy question, but it turned out to be a hard one., It was ably and elaborately discussed, by learned men of several denominations, but in the end it remained unsettled., A week ago, another discussion broke out., It was over this text:  One verdict was worded as follows:  Ten clergymen of various denominations were interviewed, and nine of them agreed with that verdict., That did not settle the matter, because the tenth said the language of Jesus was so strait and definite that it explained itself: ""Sell all,"" not a percentage., There is a most unusual feature about that dispute: the nine persons who decided alike, quoted not a single authority in support of their position., I do not know when I have seen trained disputants do the like of that before., The nine merely furnished their own opinions, founded upon--nothing at all., In the other dispute (""Did Jesus anywhere claim to be God?""), the same kind of men--trained and learned clergymen--backed up their arguments with chapter and verse., On both sides., Plenty of verses., Were no reinforcing verses to be found in the present case?, It looks that way., The opinion of the nine seems strange to me, for it is unsupported by authority, while there was at least constructive authority for the opposite view., It is hair-splitting differences of opinion over disputed text-meanings that have divided into many sects a once united Church., One may infer from some of the names in the following list that some of the differences are very slight--so slight as to be not distinctly important, perhaps --yet they have moved groups to withdraw from communions to which they belonged and set up a sect of their own., The list--accompanied by various Church statistics for 1902, compiled by Rev., Dr.  H.

Lindh, A..M., has communicated to the Boston Transcript a hopeful article on the solution of the problem of the ""divided church."", Divided is not too violent a term., Subdivided could have been permitted if he had thought of it., He came near thinking of it, for he mentions some of the subdivisions himself: ""the 12 kinds of Presbyterians, the 17 kinds of Methodists, the 13 kinds of Baptists, etc."", He overlooked the 12 kinds of Mennonites and the 22 kinds of Lutherans, but they are in Rev., Mr. Carroll's list., Altogether, 76 splits under 5 flags., The Literary Digest (February 14th) is pleased with Mr. Lindh's optimistic article, and also with the signs of the times, and perceives that ""the idea of Church unity is in the air."", Now, then, is not Mrs. Eddy profoundly wise in forbidding, for all time, all explanations of her religion except such as she shall let on to be her own?, I think so., I think there can be no doubt of it., In a way, they will be her own; for, no matter which member of her clerical staff shall furnish the explanations, not a line of them will she ever allow to be printed until she shall have approved it, accepted it, copyrighted it, cabbaged it., We may depend on that with a four-ace confidence., THE NEW INFALLIBILITY  All in proper time Mrs. Eddy's factory will take hold of that Commandment, and explain it for good and all., It may be that one member of the shift will vote that the word ""all"" means all; it may be that ten members of the shift will vote that ""all"" means only a percentage; but it is Mrs. Eddy, not the eleven, who will do the deciding., And if she says it is percentage, then percentage it is, forevermore--and that is what I am expecting, for she doesn't sell all herself, nor any considerable part of it, and as regards the poor, she doesn't declare any dividend; but if she says ""all"" means all, then all it is, to the end of time, and no follower of hers will ever be allowed to reconstruct that text, or shrink it, or inflate it, or meddle with it in any way at all., Even to-day --right here in the beginning--she is the sole person who, in the matter of Christian Science exegesis, is privileged to exploit the Spiral Twist., The Christian world has two Infallibles now., Of equal power?, For the present only., ...]"|1
89|"[Says I--  ""Sam, I'm as glad to hear it as I thought I'd be sorry., I'm glad I come, now."", Says he--  ""Cap'n, ain't you pretty physically tired?"", Says I--  ""Sam, it ain't any name for it!, I'm dog-tired."", ""Just so--just so., You've earned a good sleep, and you'll get it., You've earned a good appetite, and you'll enjoy your dinner., It's the same here as it is on earth--you've got to earn a thing, square and honest, before you enjoy it., You can't enjoy first and earn afterwards., But there's this difference, here:  you can choose your own occupation, and all the powers of heaven will be put forth to help you make a success of it, if you do your level best., The shoe-maker on earth that had the soul of a poet in him won't have to make shoes here."", ""Now that's all reasonable and right,"" says I., ""Plenty of work, and the kind you hanker after; no more pain, no more suffering--""  ""Oh, hold on; there's plenty of pain here--but it don't kill., There's plenty of suffering here, but it don't last., You see, happiness ain't a THING IN ITSELF--it's only a CONTRAST with something that ain't pleasant., That's all it is., There ain't a thing you can mention that is happiness in its own self--it's only so by contrast with the other thing., And so, as soon as the novelty is over and the force of the contrast dulled, it ain't happiness any longer, and you have to get something fresh., Well, there's plenty of pain and suffering in heaven--consequently there's plenty of contrasts, and just no end of happiness."", Says I, ""It's the sensiblest heaven I've heard of yet, Sam, though it's about as different from the one I was brought up on as a live princess is different from her own wax figger."", Along in the first months I knocked around about the Kingdom, making friends and looking at the country, and finally settled down in a pretty likely region, to have a rest before taking another start., I went on making acquaintances and gathering up information., I had a good deal of talk with an old bald-headed angel by the name of Sandy McWilliams., He was from somewhere in New Jersey., I went about with him, considerable., We used to lay around, warm afternoons, in the shade of a rock, on some meadow-ground that was pretty high and out of the marshy slush of his cranberry-farm, and there we used to talk about all kinds of things, and smoke pipes., One day, says I--  ""About how old might you be, Sandy?"", ""Seventy-two."", ""I judged so., How long you been in heaven?"", ""Twenty-seven years, come Christmas."", ""How old was you when you come up?"", ""Why, seventy-two, of course."", ""You can't mean it!"", ""Why can't I mean it?"", ""Because, if you was seventy-two then, you are naturally ninety-nine now."", ""No, but I ain't., I stay the same age I was when I come."", ""Well,"" says I, ""come to think, there's something just here that I want to ask about., Down below, I always had an idea that in heaven we would all be young, and bright, and spry."", ""Well, you can be young if you want to., You've only got to wish."", ""Well, then, why didn't you wish?"", ""I did., They all do., You'll try it, some day, like enough; but you'll get tired of the change pretty soon."", ""Why?"", ""Well, I'll tell you., Now you've always been a sailor; did you ever try some other business?"", ""Yes, I tried keeping grocery, once, up in the mines; but I couldn't stand it; it was too dull--no stir, no storm, no life about it; it was like being part dead and part alive, both at the same time., I wanted to be one thing or t'other., I shut up shop pretty quick and went to sea."", ""That's it., Grocery people like it, but you couldn't., You see you wasn't used to it., Well, I wasn't used to being young, and I couldn't seem to take any interest in it., I was strong, and handsome, and had curly hair,--yes, and wings, too!--gay wings like a butterfly., I went to picnics and dances and parties with the fellows, and tried to carry on and talk nonsense with the girls, but it wasn't any use; I couldn't take to it--fact is, it was an awful bore., What I wanted was early to bed and early to rise, and something to DO; and when my work was done, I wanted to sit quiet, and smoke and think--not tear around with a parcel of giddy young kids., You can't think what I suffered whilst I was young."", ""How long was you young?"", ""Only two weeks., That was plenty for me., Laws, I was so lonesome!, You see, I was full of the knowledge and experience of seventy-two years; the deepest subject those young folks could strike was only a-b-c to me., And to hear them argue--oh, my!, it would have been funny, if it hadn't been so pitiful., Well, I was so hungry for the ways and the sober talk I was used to, that I tried to ring in with the old people, but they wouldn't have it., They considered me a conceited young upstart, and gave me the cold shoulder., Two weeks was a-plenty for me., I was glad to get back my bald head again, and my pipe, and my old drowsy reflections in the shade of a rock or a tree."", ""Well,"" says I, ""do you mean to say you're going to stand still at seventy-two, forever?"", ""I don't know, and I ain't particular., But I ain't going to drop back to twenty-five any more--I know that, mighty well., I know a sight more than I did twenty-seven years ago, and I enjoy learning, all the time, but I don't seem to get any older., That is, bodily --my mind gets older, and stronger, and better seasoned, and more satisfactory."", Says I, ""If a man comes here at ninety, don't he ever set himself back?"", ""Of course he does., He sets himself back to fourteen; tries it a couple of hours, and feels like a fool; sets himself forward to twenty; it ain't much improvement; tries thirty, fifty, eighty, and finally ninety--finds he is more at home and comfortable at the same old figure he is used to than any other way., Or, if his mind begun to fail him on earth at eighty, that's where he finally sticks up here., He sticks at the place where his mind was last at its best, for there's where his enjoyment is best, and his ways most set and established."", ""Does a chap of twenty-five stay always twenty-five, and look it?"", ""If he is a fool, yes., But if he is bright, and ambitious and industrious, the knowledge he gains and the experiences he has, change his ways and thoughts and likings, and make him find his best pleasure in the company of people above that age; so he allows his body to take on that look of as many added years as he needs to make him comfortable and proper in that sort of society; he lets his body go on taking the look of age, according as he progresses, and by and by he will be bald and wrinkled outside, and wise and deep within."", ""Babies the same?"", ""Babies the same., Laws, what asses we used to be, on earth, about these things!, We said we'd be always young in heaven., We didn't say HOW young--we didn't think of that, perhaps--that is, we didn't all think alike, anyway., When I was a boy of seven, I suppose I thought we'd all be twelve, in heaven; when I was twelve, I suppose I thought we'd all be eighteen or twenty in heaven; when I was forty, I begun to go back; I remember I hoped we'd all be about THIRTY years old in heaven., Neither a man nor a boy ever thinks the age he HAS is exactly the best one--he puts the right age a few years older or a few years younger than he is., Then he makes that ideal age the general age of the heavenly people., And he expects everybody TO STICK at that age--stand stock-still--and expects them to enjoy it!--Now just think of the idea of standing still in heaven!, Think of a heaven made up entirely of hoop-rolling, marble-playing cubs of seven years!--or of awkward, diffident, sentimental immaturities of nineteen!--or of vigorous people of thirty, healthy-minded, brimming with ambition, but chained hand and foot to that one age and its limitations like so many helpless galley-slaves!, Think of the dull sameness of a society made up of people all of one age and one set of looks, habits, tastes and feelings., Think how superior to it earth would be, with its variety of types and faces and ages, and the enlivening attrition of the myriad interests that come into pleasant collision in such a variegated society."", ""Look here,"" says I, ""do you know what you're doing?"", ""Well, what am I doing?"", ""You are making heaven pretty comfortable in one way, but you are playing the mischief with it in another."", ...]"|1
90|"[Your ancestors skinned him alive, and I am an orphan., Not one drop of my blood flows in that Indian's veins today., I stand here, lone and forlorn, without an ancestor., They skinned him!, I do not object to that, if they needed his fur; but alive, gentlemen-alive!, They skinned him alive--and before company!, That is what rankles., Think how he must have felt; for he was a sensitive person and easily embarrassed., If he had been a bird, it would have been all right, and no violence done to his feelings, because he would have been considered ""dressed."", But he was not a bird, gentlemen, he was a man, and probably one of the most undressed men that ever was., I ask you to put yourselves in his place., I ask it as a favor; I ask it as a tardy act of justice; I ask it in the interest of fidelity to the traditions of your ancestors; I ask it that the world may contemplate, with vision unobstructed by disguising swallow-tails and white cravats, the spectacle which the true New England Society ought to present., Cease to come to these annual orgies in this hollow modern mockery--the surplusage of raiment., Come in character; come in the summer grace, come in the unadorned simplicity, come in the free and joyous costume which your sainted ancestors provided for mine., Later ancestors of mine were the Quakers William Robinson, Marmaduke Stevenson, et al., Your tribe chased them put of the country for their religion's sake; promised them death if they came back; for your ancestors had forsaken the homes they loved, and braved the perils of the sea, the implacable climate, and the savage wilderness, to acquire that highest and most precious of boons, freedom for every man on this broad continent to worship according to the dictates of his own conscience--and they were not going to allow a lot of pestiferous Quakers to interfere with it., Your ancestors broke forever the chains of political slavery, and gave the vote to every man in this wide land, excluding none!--none except those who did not belong to the orthodox church., Your ancestors --yes, they were a hard lot; but, nevertheless, they gave us religious liberty to worship as they required us to worship, and political liberty to vote as the church required; and so I the bereft one, I the forlorn one, am here to do my best to help you celebrate them right., The Quaker woman Elizabeth Hooton was an ancestress of mine., Your people were pretty severe with her you will confess that., But, poor thing!, I believe they changed her opinions before she died, and took her into their fold; and so we have every reason to presume that when she died she went to the same place which your ancestors went to., It is a great pity, for she was a good woman., Roger Williams was an ancestor of mine., I don't really remember what your people did with him., But they banished him to Rhode Island, anyway., And then, I believe, recognizing that this was really carrying harshness to an unjustifiable extreme, they took pity on him and burned him., They were a hard lot!, All those Salem witches were ancestors of mine!, Your people made it tropical for them., Yes, they did; by pressure and the gallows they made such a clean deal with them that there hasn't been a witch and hardly a halter in our family from that day to this, and that is one hundred and eighty-nine years., The first slave brought into New England out of Africa by your progenitors was an ancestor of mine--for I am of a mixed breed, an infinitely shaded and exquisite Mongrel., I'm not one of your sham meerschaums that you can color in a week., No, my complexion is the patient art of eight generations., Well, in my own time, I had acquired a lot of my kin--by purchase, and swapping around, and one way and another --and was getting along very well., Then, with the inborn perversity of your lineage, you got up a war, and took them all away from me., And so, again am I bereft, again am I forlorn; no drop of my blood flows in the veins of any living being who is marketable., O my friends, hear me and reform!, I seek your good, not mine., You have heard the speeches., Disband these New England societies--nurseries of a system of steadily augmenting laudation and hosannaing, which; if persisted in uncurbed, may some day in the remote future beguile you into prevaricating and bragging., Oh, stop, stop, while you are still temperate in your appreciation of your ancestors!, Hear me, I beseech you; get up an auction and sell Plymouth Rock!, The Pilgrims were a simple and ignorant race., They never had seen any good rocks before, or at least any that were not watched, and so they were excusable for hopping ashore in frantic delight and clapping an iron fence around this one., But you, gentlemen, are educated; you are enlightened; you know that in the rich land of your nativity, opulent New England, overflowing with rocks, this one isn't worth, at the outside, more than thirty-five cents., Therefore, sell it, before it is injured by exposure, or at least throw it open to the patent-medicine advertisements, and let it earn its taxes:  Yes, hear your true friend-your only true friend--list to his voice., Disband these societies, hotbeds of vice, of moral decay--perpetuators of ancestral superstition., Here on this board I see water, I see milk, I see the wild and deadly lemonade., These are but steps upon the downward path., Next we shall see tea, then chocolate, then coffee--hotel coffee., A few more years--all too few, I fear--mark my words, we shall have cider!, Gentlemen, pause ere it be too late., You are on the broad road which leads to dissipation, physical ruin, moral decay, gory crime and the gallows!, I beseech you, I implore you, in the name of your anxious friends, in the name of your suffering families, in the name of your impending widows and orphans, stop ere it be too late., Disband these New England societies, renounce these soul-blistering saturnalia, cease from varnishing the rusty reputations of your long-vanished ancestors--the super-high-moral old iron-clads of Cape Cod, the pious buccaneers of Plymouth Rock--go home, and try to learn to behave!, However, chaff and nonsense aside, I think I honor and appreciate your Pilgrim stock as much as you do yourselves, perhaps; and I endorse and adopt a sentiment uttered by a grandfather of mine once--a man of sturdy opinions, of sincere make of mind, and not given to flattery., He said: ""People may talk as they like about that Pilgrim stock, but, after all's said and done, it would be pretty hard to improve on those people; and, as for me, I don't mind coming out flatfooted and saying there ain't any way to improve on them--except having them born in, Missouri!"", In introducing Mr. Clemens, Frank R.  Lawrence, the President           of the Lotos Club, recalled the fact that the first club dinner           in the present club-house, some fourteen years ago, was in           honor of Mark Twain., I wish to begin this time at the beginning, lest I forget it altogether; that is to say, I wish to thank you for this welcome that you are giving, and the welcome which you gave me seven years ago, and which I forgot to thank you for at that time., I also wish to thank you for the welcome you gave me fourteen years ago, which I also forgot to thank you for at the time., I hope you will continue this custom to give me a dinner every seven years before I join the hosts in the other world--I do not know which world., Mr. Lawrence and Mr. Porter have paid me many compliments., It is very difficult to take compliments., I do not care whether you deserve the compliments or not, it is just as difficult to take them., The other night I was at the Engineers' Club, and enjoyed the sufferings of Mr. Carnegie., They were complimenting him there; there it was all compliments, and none of them deserved., They say that you cannot live by bread alone, but I can live on compliments., I do not make any pretence that I dislike compliments., The stronger the better, and I can manage to digest them., I think I have lost so much by not making a collection of compliments, to put them away and take them out again once in a while., When in England I said that I would start to collect compliments, and I began there and I have brought some of them along., The first one of these lies--I wrote them down and preserved them --I think they are mighty good and extremely just., It is one of Hamilton Mabie's compliments., He said that La Salle was the first one to make a voyage of the Mississippi, but Mark Twain was the first to chart, light, and navigate it for the whole world., If that had been published at the time that I issued that book [Life on the Mississippi], it would have been money in my pocket., I tell you, it is a talent by itself to pay compliments gracefully and have them ring true., It's an art by itself., Here is another compliment by Albert Bigelow Paine, my biographer., He is writing four octavo volumes about me, and he has been at my elbow two and one-half years., I just suppose that he does not know me, but says he knows me., He says ""Mark Twain is not merely a great writer, a great philosopher, a great man; he is the supreme expression of the human being, with his strength and his weakness."", What a talent for compression!, It takes a genius in compression to compact as many facts as that., W. D. Howells spoke of me as first of Hartford, and ultimately of the solar system, not to say of the universe:  You know how modest Howells is., If it can be proved that my fame reaches to Neptune and Saturn; that will satisfy even me., You know how modest and retiring Howells seems to be, but deep down he is as vain as I am., Mr. Howells had been granted a degree at Oxford, whose gown was red., He had been invited to an exercise at Columbia, and upon inquiry had been told that it was usual to wear the black gown: Later he had found that three other men wore bright gowns, and he had lamented that he had been one of the black mass, and not a red torch., Edison wrote: ""The average American loves his family., If he has any love left over for some other person, he generally selects Mark Twain."", Now here's the compliment of a little Montana girl which came to me indirectly., She was in a room in which there was a large photograph of me., After gazing at it steadily for a time, she said:  ""We've got a John the Baptist like that."", She also said: ""Only ours has more trimmings."", I suppose she meant the halo., Now here is a gold-miner's compliment., It is forty-two years old., It was my introduction to an audience to which I lectured in a log school-house., There were no ladies there., ...]"|1
91|"[It is not any matter when you are called upon to express it; you can get up and do it, and my verdict has already been recorded in my heart and in my head as regards Mr. Jerome and his administration of the criminal affairs of this county., I agree with everything Mr. Choate has said in his letter regarding Mr. Jerome; I agree with everything Mr. Shepard has said; and I agree with everything Mr. Jerome has said in his own commendation., And I thought Mr. Jerome was modest in that., If he had been talking about another officer of this county, he could have painted the joys and sorrows of office and his victories in even stronger language than he did., I voted for Mr. Jerome in those old days, and I should like to vote for him again if he runs for any office., I moved out of New York, and that is the reason, I suppose, I cannot vote for him again., There may be some way, but I have not found it out., But now I am a farmer--a farmer up in Connecticut, and winning laurels., Those people already speak with such high favor, admiration, of my farming, and they say that I am the only man that has ever come to that region who could make two blades of grass grow where only three grew before., Well, I cannot vote for him., You see that., As it stands now, I cannot., I am crippled in that way and to that extent, for I would ever so much like to do it., I am not a Congress, and I cannot distribute pensions, and I don't know any other legitimate way to buy a vote., But if I should think of any legitimate way, I shall make use of it, and then I shall vote for Mr. Jerome., HENRY IRVING   I find my task a very easy one., I have been a dramatist for thirty years., I have had an ambition in all that time to overdo the work of the Spaniard who said he left behind him four hundred dramas when he died., I leave behind me four hundred and fifteen, and am not yet dead., The greatest of all the arts is to write a drama., It is a most difficult thing., It requires the highest talent possible and the rarest gifts., No, there is another talent that ranks with it--for anybody can write a drama--I had four hundred of them--but to get one accepted requires real ability., And I have never had that felicity yet., But human nature is so constructed, we are so persistent, that when we know that we are born to a thing we do not care what the world thinks about it., We go on exploiting that talent year after year, as I have done., I shall go on writing dramas, and some day the impossible may happen, but I am not looking for it., In writing plays the chief thing is novelty., The world grows tired of solid forms in all the arts., I struck a new idea myself years ago., I was not surprised at it., I was always expecting it would happen., A person who has suffered disappointment for many years loses confidence, and I thought I had better make inquiries before I exploited my new idea of doing a drama in the form of a dream, so I wrote to a great authority on knowledge of all kinds, and asked him whether it was new., I could depend upon him., He lived in my dear home in America--that dear home, dearer to me through taxes., He sent me a list of plays in which that old device had been used, and he said that there was also a modern lot., He travelled back to China and to a play dated two thousand six hundred years before the Christian era., He said he would follow it up with a list of the previous plays of the kind, and in his innocence would have carried them back to the Flood., That is the most discouraging thing that has ever happened to me in my dramatic career., I have done a world of good in a silent and private way, and have furnished Sir Henry Irving with plays and plays and plays., What has he achieved through that influence., See where he stands now --on the summit of his art in two worlds and it was I who put him there --that partly put him there., I need not enlarge upon the influence the drama has exerted upon civilization., It has made good morals entertaining., I am to be followed by Mr. Pinero., I conceive that we stand at the head of the profession., He has not written as many plays as I have, but he has lead that God-given talent, which I lack, of working hem off on the manager., I couple his name with this toast, and add the hope that his influence will be supported in exercising his masterly handicraft in that great gift, and that he will long live to continue his fine work., DINNER TO HAMILTON W. MABIE  MR. CHAIRMAN AND GENTLEMEN,--This man knows now how it feels to be the chief guest, and if he has enjoyed it he is the first man I have ever seen in that position that did enjoy it., And I know, by side-remarks which he made to me before his ordeal came upon him, that he was feeling as some of the rest of us have felt under the same circumstances., He was afraid that he would not do himself justice; but he did--to my surprise., It is a most serious thing to be a chief guest on an occasion like this, and it is admirable, it is fine., It is a great compliment to a man that he shall come out of it so gloriously as Mr. Mabie came out of it tonight--to my surprise., He did it well., He appears to be editor of The Outlook, and notwithstanding that, I have every admiration, because when everything is said concerning The Outlook, after all one must admit that it is frank in its delinquencies, that it is outspoken in its departures from fact, that it is vigorous in its mistaken criticisms of men like me., I have lived in this world a long, long time, and I know you must not judge a man by the editorials that he puts in his paper., A man is always better than his printed opinions., A man always reserves to himself on the inside a purity and an honesty and a justice that are a credit to him, whereas the things that he prints are just the reverse., Oh yes, you must not judge a man by what he writes in his paper., Even in an ordinary secular paper a man must observe some care about it; he must be better than the principles which he puts in print., And that is the case with Mr. Mabie., Why, to see what he writes about me and the missionaries you would think he did not have any principles., But that is Mr. Mabie in his public capacity., Mr. Mabie in his private capacity is just as clean a man as I am., In this very room, a month or two ago, some people admired that portrait; some admired this, but the great majority fastened on that, and said, ""There is a portrait that is a beautiful piece of art."", When that portrait is a hundred years old it will suggest what were the manners and customs in our time., Just as they talk about Mr. Mabie to-night, in that enthusiastic way, pointing out the various virtues of the man and the grace of his spirit, and all that, so was that portrait talked about., They were enthusiastic, just as we men have been over the character and the work of Mr. Mabie., And when they were through they said that portrait, fine as it is, that work, beautiful as it is, that piece of humanity on that canvas, gracious and fine as it is, does not rise to those perfections that exist in the man himself., Come up, Mr. Alexander., [The reference was to James W. Alexander, who happened to be sitting --beneath the portrait of himself on the wall.], Now, I should come up and show myself., But he cannot do it, he cannot do it., He was born that way, he was reared in that way., Let his modesty be an example, and I wish some of you had it, too., But that is just what I have been saying --that portrait, fine as it is, is not as fine as the man it represents, and all the things that have been said about Mr. Mabie, and certainly they have been very nobly worded and beautiful, still fall short of the real Mabie., INTRODUCING NYE AND RILEY    I am very glad indeed to introduce these young people to you, and at the same time get acquainted with them myself., I have seen them more than once for a moment, but have not had the privilege of knowing them personally as intimately as I wanted to., I saw them first, a great many years ago, when Mr. Barnum had them, and they were just fresh from Siam., The ligature was their best hold then, the literature became their best hold later, when one of them committed an indiscretion, and they had to cut the old bond to accommodate the sheriff., In that old former time this one was Chang, that one was Eng., The sympathy existing between the two was most extraordinary; it was so fine, so strong, so subtle, that what the one ate the other digested; when one slept, the other snored; if one sold a thing, the other scooped the usufruct., This independent and yet dependent action was observable in all the details of their daily life--I mean this quaint and arbitrary distribution of originating cause and resulting effect between the two --between, I may say, this dynamo and the other always motor, or, in other words, that the one was always the creating force, the other always the utilizing force; no, no, for while it is true that within certain well-defined zones of activity the one was always dynamo and the other always motor, within certain other well-defined zones these positions became exactly reversed., For instance, in moral matters Mr. Chang Riley was always dynamo, Mr. Eng Nye was always motor; for while Mr. Chang Riley had a high--in fact, an abnormally high and fine moral sense, he had no machinery to work it with; whereas, Mr. Eng Nye, who hadn't any moral sense at all, and hasn't yet, was equipped with all the necessary plant for putting a noble deed through, if he could only get the inspiration on reasonable terms outside., In intellectual matters, on the other hand, Mr. Eng Nye was always dynamo, Mr. Chang Riley was always motor; Mr. Eng Nye had a stately intellect, but couldn't make it go; Mr. Chang Riley hadn't, but could., That is to say, that while Mr. Chang Riley couldn't think things himself, he had a marvellous natural grace in setting them down and weaving them together when his pal furnished the raw material., Thus, working together, they made a strong team; laboring together, they could do miracles; but break the circuit, and both were impotent., It has remained so to this day: they must travel together, hoe, and plant, and plough, and reap, and sell their public together, or there's no result., I have made this explanation, this analysis, this vivisection, so to speak, in order that you may enjoy these delightful adventurers understandingly., When Mr. Eng Nye's deep and broad and limpid philosophies flow by in front of you, refreshing all the regions round about with their gracious floods, you will remember that it isn't his water; it's the other man's, and he is only working the pump., And when Mr. Chang Riley enchants your ear, and soothes your spirit, and touches your heart with the sweet and genuine music of his poetry--as sweet and as genuine as any that his friends, the birds and the bees, make about his other friends, the woods and the flowers--you will remember, while placing justice where justice is due, that it isn't his music, but the other man's--he is only turning the crank., I beseech for these visitors a fair field, a singleminded, one-eyed umpire, and a score bulletin barren of goose-eggs if they earn it--and I judge they will and hope they will., Mr. James Whitcomb Chang Riley will now go to the bat., I am very proud to respond to this toast, as it recalls the proudest day of my life., The delightful hospitality shown me at the time of my visit to Oxford I shall cherish until I die., In that long and distinguished career of mine I value that degree above all other honors., When the ship landed even the stevedores gathered on the shore and gave an English cheer., Nothing could surpass in my life the pleasure of those four weeks., No one could pass by me without taking my hand, even the policemen., I've been in all the principal capitals of Christendom in my life, and have always been an object of interest to policemen., ...]"|1
92|"[Therefore, everybody had taken the pledge; there wasn't anybody for miles and miles around that had not taken the pledge., ""So you can see what a solitude it was to this young man, who was fond of his grog., And he was just an outcast, because when they found he would not join Father Mathew's Society they ostracized him, and he went about that town three weeks, day and night, in utter loneliness--the only human being in the whole place who ever took grog, and he had to take it privately., ""If you don't know what it is to be ostracized, to be shunned by your fellow-man, may you never know it., Then he recognized that there was something more valuable in this life than grog, and that is the fellowship of your fellow-man., And at last he gave it up, and at nine o'clock one night he went down to the Father Mathew Temperance Society, and with a broken heart he said: 'Put my name down for membership in this society.', ""And then he went away crying, and at earliest dawn the next morning they came for him and routed him out, and they said that new ship of his was ready to sail on a three years' voyage., In a minute he was on board that ship and gone., ""And he said--well, he was not out of sight of that town till he began to repent, but he had made up his mind that he would not take a drink, and so that whole voyage of three years was a three years' agony to that man because he saw all the time the mistake he had made., ""He felt it all through; he had constant reminders of it, because the crew would pass him with their grog, come out on the deck and take it, and there was the torturous Smell of it., ""He went through the whole, three years of suffering, and at last coming into port it was snowy, it was cold, he was stamping through the snow two feet deep on the deck and longing to get home, and there was his crew torturing him to the last minute with hot grog, but at last he had his reward., He really did get to shore at fast, and jumped and ran and bought a jug and rushed to the society's office, and said to the secretary:  ""'Take my name off your membership books, and do it right away!, I have got a three years' thirst on.', ""And the secretary said: 'It is not necessary., You were blackballed!'"", LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,--The remainder of my duties as presiding chairman here this evening are but two--only two., One of them is easy, and the other difficult., That is to say, I must introduce the orator, and then keep still and give him a chance., The name of Henry Watterson carries with it its own explanation., It is like an electric light on top of Madison Square Garden; you touch the button and the light flashes up out of the darkness., You mention the name of Henry Watterson, and your minds are at once illuminated with the splendid radiance of his fame and achievements., A journalist, a soldier, an orator, a statesman, a rebel., Yes, he was a rebel; and, better still, now he is a reconstructed rebel., It is a curious circumstance, a circumstance brought about without any collusion or prearrangement, that he and I, both of whom were rebels related by blood to each other, should be brought here together this evening bearing a tribute in our hands and bowing our heads in reverence to that noble soul who for three years we tried to destroy., I don't know as the fact has ever been mentioned before, but it is a fact, nevertheless., Colonel Watterson and I were both rebels, and we are blood relations., I was a second lieutenant in a Confederate company for a while--oh, I could have stayed on if I had wanted to., I made myself felt, I left tracks all around the country., I could have stayed on, but it was such weather., I never saw such weather to be out-of-doors in, in all my life., The Colonel commanded a regiment, and did his part, I suppose, to destroy the Union., He did not succeed, yet if he had obeyed me he would have done so., I had a plan, and I fully intended to drive General Grant into the Pacific Ocean--if I could get transportation., I told Colonel Watterson about it., I told him what he had to do., What I wanted him to do was to surround the Eastern army and wait until I came up., But he was insubordinate; he stuck on some quibble of military etiquette about a second lieutenant giving orders to a colonel or something like that., And what was the consequence?, The Union was preserved., This is the first time I believe that that secret has ever been revealed., No one outside of the family circle, I think, knew it before; but there the facts are., Watterson saved the Union; yes, he saved the Union., And yet there he sits, and not a step has been taken or a movement made toward granting him a pension., That is the way things are done., It is a case where some blushing ought to be done., You ought to blush, and I ought to blush, and he--well, he's a little out of practice now., ""This is my last appearance on the paid platform., I shall not           retire from the gratis platform until I am buried, and courtesy           will compel me to keep still and not disturb the others., Now,           since I must, I shall say good-bye., I see many faces in this           audience well known to me., They are all my friends, and I feel           that those I don't know are my friends, too., I wish to           consider that you represent the nation, and  that in saying           good-bye to you I am saying good-bye to the nation., In the           great name of humanity, let me say this final word: I offer an           appeal in behalf of that vast, pathetic multitude of fathers,           mothers, and helpless little children., They were sheltered and           happy two days ago., Now they are wandering, forlorn, hopeless,           and homeless, the victims of a great disaster., So I beg of           you, I beg of you, to open your hearts and open your purses and           remember San Francisco, the smitten city."", I wish to deliver a historical address., I've been studying the history of---er--a--let me see--a [then he stopped in confusion, and walked over to Gen. Fred D.  Grant, who sat at the head of the platform., He leaned over an a whisper, and then returned to the front of the stage and continued]., Oh yes!, I've been studying Robert Fulton., I've been studying a biographical sketch of Robert Fulton, the inventor of--er--a --let's see--ah yes, the inventor of the electric telegraph and the Morse sewing--machine., Also, I understand he invented the air--diria--pshaw!, I have it at last--the dirigible balloon., Yes, the dirigible--but it is a difficult word, and I don't see why anybody should marry a couple of words like that when they don't want to be married at all and are likely to quarrel with each other all the time., I should put that couple of words under the ban of the United States Supreme Court, under its decision of a few days ago, and take 'em out and drown 'em., I used to know Fulton., It used to do me good to see him dashing through tile town on a wild broncho., And Fulton was born in---er--a--Well, it doesn't make much difference where he was born, does it?, I remember a man who came to interview me once, to get a sketch of my life., I consulted with a friend--a practical man--before he came, to know how I should treat him., ""Whenever you give the interviewer a fact,"" he said, ""give him another fact that will contradict it., Then he'll go away with a jumble that he can't use at all., Be gentle, be sweet, smile like an idiot--just be natural."", That's what my friend told me to do, and I did it., ""Where were you born?"", asked the interviewer., ""Well-er-a,"" I began, ""I was born in Alabama, or Alaska, or the Sandwich Islands; I don't know where, but right around there somewhere., And you had better put it down before you forget it."", ""But you weren't born in all those places,"" he said., ""Well, I've offered you three places., Take your choice., They're all at the same price."", ""How old are you?"", he asked., ""I shall be nineteen in June,"" I said., ""Why, there's such a discrepancy between your age and your looks,"" he said., ""Oh, that's nothing,"" I said, ""I was born discrepantly."", Then we got to talking about my brother Samuel, and he told me my explanations were confusing., ""I suppose he is dead,"" I said., ""Some said that he was dead and some said that he wasn't."", ""Did you bury him without knowing whether he was dead or not?"", asked the reporter., ""There was a mystery,"" said I., ""We were twins, and one day when we were two weeks old--that is, he was one week old, and I was one week old--we got mixed up in the bath-tub, and one of us drowned., We never could tell which., One of us had a strawberry birthmark on the back of his hand., There it is on my hand., This is the one that was drowned., There's no doubt about it., ...]"|1
93|"[There, in his hansom cab, the invalid can go--the poor, sad child of misfortune--and insert his nose between the railings, and breathe the pure, health--giving air of the country and of heaven., And if he is a swell invalid, who isn't obliged to depend upon parks for his country air, he can drive inside--if he owns his vehicle., I drive round and round Hyde Park, and the more I see of the edges of it the more grateful I am that the margin is extensive., And I have been to the Zoological Gardens., What a wonderful place that is!, I never have seen such a curious and interesting variety of wild animals in any garden before--except ""Mabilie."", I never believed before there were so many different kinds of animals in the world as you can find there--and I don't believe it yet., I have been to the British Museum., I would advise you to drop in there some time when you have nothing to do for--five minutes--if you have never been there: It seems to me the noblest monument that this nation has yet erected to her greatness., I say to her, our greatness--as a nation., True, she has built other monuments, and stately ones, as well; but these she has uplifted in honor of two or three colossal demigods who have stalked across the world's stage, destroying tyrants and delivering nations, and whose prodigies will still live in the memories of men ages after their monuments shall have crumbled to dust--I refer to the Wellington and Nelson monuments, and--the Albert memorial., [Sarcasm., The Albert memorial is the finest monument in the world, and celebrates the existence of as commonplace a person as good luck ever lifted out of obscurity.], The library at the British Museum I find particularly astounding., I have read there hours together, and hardly made an impression on it., I revere that library., It is the author's friend., I don't care how mean a book is, it always takes one copy., [A copy of every book printed in Great Britain must by law be sent to the British Museum, a law much complained of by publishers.], And then every day that author goes there to gaze at that book, and is encouraged to go on in the good work., And what a touching sight it is of a Saturday afternoon to see the poor, careworn clergymen gathered together in that vast reading--room cabbaging sermons for Sunday., You will pardon my referring to these things., Everything in this monster city interests me, and I cannot keep from talking, even at the risk of being instructive., People here seem always to express distances by parables., To a stranger it is just a little confusing to be so parabolic--so to speak., I collar a citizen, and I think I am going to get some valuable information out of him., I ask him how far it is to Birmingham, and he says it is twenty-one shillings and sixpence., Now we know that doesn't help a man who is trying to learn., I find myself down-town somewhere, and I want to get some sort of idea where I am--being usually lost when alone--and I stop a citizen and say: ""How far is it to Charing Cross?"", ""Shilling fare in a cab,"" and off he goes., I suppose if I were to ask a Londoner how far it, is from the sublime to the ridiculous, he would try to express it in coin., But I am trespassing upon your time with these geological statistics and historical reflections., I will not longer keep you from your orgies., 'Tis a real pleasure for me to be here, and I thank you for it., The name of the Savage Club is associated in my mind with the kindly interest and the friendly offices which you lavished upon an old friend of mine who came among you a stranger, and you opened your English hearts to him and gave him welcome and a home--Artemus Ward., Asking that you will join me, I give you his memory., I feel exceedingly surreptitious in coming down here without an announcement of any kind., I do not want to see any advertisements around, for the reason that I'm not a lecturer any longer., I reformed long ago, and I break over and commit this sin only just one time this year: and that is moderate, I think, for a person of my disposition., It is not my purpose to lecture any more as long as I live., I never intend to stand up on a platform any more--unless by the request of a sheriff or something like that., First of all, no--second of all--I wish to offer my thanks for the honor done me by naming this last rose of summer of the Mississippi Valley for me, this boat which represents a perished interest, which I fortified long ago, but did not save its life., And, in the first place, I wish to thank the Countess de Rochambeau for the honor she has done me in presiding at this christening., I believe that it is peculiarly appropriate that I should be allowed the privilege of joining my voice with the general voice of St. Louis and Missouri in welcoming to the Mississippi Valley and this part of the continent these illustrious visitors from France., When La Salle came down this river a century and a quarter ago there was nothing on its banks but savages., He opened up this great river, and by his simple act was gathered in this great Louisiana territory., I would have done it myself for half the money., Well, if I made that joke, it is the best one I ever made, and it is in the prettiest language, too.--I never can get quite to that height., But I appreciate that joke, and I shall remember it--and I shall use it when occasion requires., I have had a great many birthdays in my time., I remember the first one very well, and I always think of it with indignation; everything was so crude, unaesthetic, primeval., Nothing like this at all., No proper appreciative preparation made; nothing really ready., Now, for a person born with high and delicate instincts--why, even the cradle wasn't whitewashed--nothing ready at all., I hadn't any hair, I hadn't any teeth, I hadn't any clothes, I had to go to my first banquet just like that., Well, everybody came swarming in., It was the merest little bit of a village--hardly that, just a little hamlet, in the backwoods of Missouri, where nothing ever happened, and the people were all interested, and they all came; they looked me over to see if there was anything fresh in my line., Why, nothing ever happened in that village --I--why, I was the only thing that had really happened there for months and months and months; and although I say it myself that shouldn't, I came the nearest to being a real event that had happened in that village in more than, two years., Well, those people came, they came with that curiosity which is so provincial, with that frankness which also is so provincial, and they examined me all around and gave their opinion., Nobody asked them, and I shouldn't have minded if anybody had paid me a compliment, but nobody did., Their opinions were all just green with prejudice, and I feel those opinions to this day., Well, I stood that as long as--well, you know I was born courteous, and I stood it to the limit., I stood it an hour, and then the worm turned., I was the warm; it was my turn to turn, and I turned., I knew very well the strength of my position; I knew that I was the only spotlessly pure and innocent person in that whole town, and I came out and said so: And they could not say a word., It was so true: They blushed; they were embarrassed., Well, that was the first after-dinner speech I ever made: I think it was after dinner., It's a long stretch between that first birthday speech and this one., That was my cradle-song; and this is my swan-song, I suppose., I am used to swan-songs; I have sung them several, times., This is my seventieth birthday, and I wonder if you all rise to the size of that proposition, realizing all the significance of that phrase, seventieth birthday., The seventieth birthday!, It is the time of life when you arrive at a new and awful dignity;

that the way of life which enabled them to live upon the property of their heirs so long, as Mr. Choate says, would have put us out of commission ahead of time., I will offer here, as a sound maxim, this: That we can't reach old age by another man's road., I will now teach, offering my way of life to whomsoever desires to commit suicide by the scheme which has enabled me to beat the doctor and the hangman for seventy years., Some of the details may sound untrue, but they are not., I am not here to deceive; I am here to teach., We have no permanent habits until we are forty., Then they begin to harden, presently they petrify, then business begins., Since forty I have been regular about going to bed and getting up--and that is one of the main things., I have made it a rule to go to bed when there wasn't anybody left to sit up with; and I have made it a rule to get up when I had to., This has resulted in an unswerving regularity of irregularity., It has saved me sound, but it would injure another person., In the matter of diet--which is another main thing--I have been persistently strict in sticking to the things which didn't agree with me until one or the other of us got the best of it., Until lately I got the best of it myself., But last spring I stopped frolicking with mince-pie after midnight; up to then I had always believed it wasn't loaded., For thirty years I have taken coffee and bread at eight in the morning, and no bite nor sup until seven-thirty in the evening., Eleven hours., That is all right for me, and is wholesome, because I have never had a headache in my life, but headachy people would not reach seventy comfortably by that road, and they would be foolish to try it., And I wish to urge upon you this--which I think is wisdom--that if you find you can't make seventy by any but an uncomfortable road, don't you go., When they take off the Pullman and retire you to the rancid smoker, put on your things, count your checks, and get out at the first way station where there's a cemetery., I have made it a rule never to smoke more than one cigar at a time., ...]"|1

Y., Weekly to you--no charge., I am not going to write for it., Like all other, papers that pay one splendidly it circulates among stupid people and the 'canaille.', I have made no arrangement with any New York paper--I will see about that Monday or Tuesday., Love to all  DEAR FOLKS, I suppose we shall be many a league at sea tomorrow night, and goodness knows I shall be unspeakably glad of it., I haven't got anything to write, else I would write it., I have just written myself clear out in letters to the Alta, and I think they are the stupidest letters that were ever written from New York., Corresponding has been a perfect drag ever since I got to the states., If it continues abroad, I don't know what the Tribune and Alta folks will think., I have withdrawn the Sandwich Island book--it would be useless to publish it in these dull publishing times., As for the Frog book, I don't believe that will ever pay anything worth a cent., I published it simply to advertise myself--not with the hope of making anything out of it., Well, I haven't anything to write, except that I am tired of staying in one place--that I am in a fever to get away., Read my Alta letters--they contain everything I could possibly write to you., Tell Zeb and John Leavenworth to write me., They can get plenty of gossip from the pilots., An importing house sent two cases of exquisite champagne aboard the ship for me today--Veuve Clicquot and Lac d'Or., I and my room-mate have set apart every Saturday as a solemn fast day, wherein we will entertain no light matters of frivolous conversation, but only get drunk., (That is a joke.), His mother and sisters are the best and most homelike people I have yet found in a brown stone front., There is no style about them, except in house and furniture., I wish Orion were going on this voyage, for I believe he could not help but be cheerful and jolly., I often wonder if his law business is going satisfactorily to him, but knowing that the dull season is setting in now (it looked like it had already set in before) I have felt as if I could almost answer the question myself--which is to say in plain words, I was afraid to ask., I wish I had gone to Washington in the winter instead of going West., I could have gouged an office out of Bill Stewart for him, and that would atone for the loss of my home visit., ...]"|1

H. Harkins has been here to ask me to put upon paper a 5-act play which he has been mapping out in his mind for 3 or 4 years., He sat down and told me his plot all through, in a clear, bright way, and I was a deal taken with it; but it is a line of characters whose fine shading and artistic development requires an abler hand than mine; so I easily perceived that I must not make the attempt., But I liked the man, and thought there was a good deal of stuff in him; and therefore I wanted his play to be written, and by a capable hand, too., So I suggested you, and said I would write and see if you would be willing to undertake it., If you like the idea, he will call upon you in the course of two or three weeks and describe his plot and his characters., Then if it doesn't strike you favorably, of course you can simply decline; but it seems to me well worth while that you should hear what he has to say., You could also ""average"" him while he talks, and judge whether he could play your priest--though I doubt if any man can do that justice., Shan't I write him and say he may call?, If you wish to communicate directly with him instead, his address is ""Larchmont Manor, Westchester Co., N., Y."", Do you know, the chill of that 19th of April seems to be in my bones yet?, I am inert and drowsy all the time., That was villainous weather for a couple of wandering children to be out in., Ys ever  Please do not use my name in any way., Please do not even divulge the fact that I own a machine., I have entirely stopped using the typewriter, for the reason that I never could write a letter with it to anybody without receiving a request by return mail that I would not only describe the machine, but state what progress I had made in the use of it, etc., etc., I don't like to write letters, and so I don't want people to know I own this curiosity-breeding little joker., MY DEAR HOWELLS,--I told Patrick to get some carpenters and box the machine and send it to you--and found that Bliss had sent for the machine and earned it off., I have been talking to you and writing to you as if you were present when I traded the machine to Bliss for a twelve-dollar saddle worth $25 (cheating him outrageously, of course--but conscience got the upper hand again and I told him before I left the premises that I'd pay for the saddle if he didn't like the machine--on condition that he donate said machine to a charity)  This was a little over five weeks ago--so I had long ago concluded that Bliss didn't want the machine and did want the saddle--wherefore I jumped at the chance of shoving the machine off onto you, saddle or no saddle so I got the blamed thing out of my sight., The saddle hangs on Tara's walls down below in the stable, and the machine is at Bliss's grimly pursuing its appointed mission, slowly and implacably rotting away another man's chances for salvation., I have sent Bliss word not to donate it to a charity (though it is a pity to fool away a chance to do a charity an ill turn,) but to let me know when he has got his dose, because I've got another candidate for damnation., You just wait a couple of weeks and if you don't see the Type-Writer come tilting along toward Cambridge with an unsatisfied appetite in its eye, I lose my guess., Don't you be mad about this blunder, Howells--it only comes of a bad memory, and the stupidity which is inseparable from true genius., Nothing intentionally criminal in it., MY DEAR HOWELLS,--I have finished the story and didn't take the chap beyond boyhood., I believe it would be fatal to do it in any shape but autobiographically--like Gil Blas., I perhaps made a mistake in not writing it in the first person., If I went on, now, and took him into manhood, he would just like like all the one-horse men in literature and the reader would conceive a hearty contempt for him., It is not a boy's book, at all., It will only be read by adults., It is only written for adults., Moreover the book is plenty long enough as it stands., It is about 900 pages of MS, and may be 1000 when I shall have finished ""working up"" vague places; so it would make from 130 to 150 pages of the Atlantic --about what the Foregone Conclusion made, isn't it?, I would dearly like to see it in the Atlantic, but I doubt if it would pay the publishers to buy the privilege, or me to sell it., Bret Harte has sold his novel (same size as mine, I should say) to Scribner's Monthly for $6,500 (publication to begin in September, I think,) and he gets a royalty of 7 1/2 per cent from Bliss in book form afterwards., He gets a royalty of ten per cent on it in England (issued in serial numbers) and the same royalty on it in book form afterwards, and is to receive an advance payment of five hundred pounds the day the first No., of the serial appears., If I could do as well, here, and there, with mine, it might possibly pay me, but I seriously doubt it though it is likely I could do better in England than Bret, who is not widely known there., You see I take a vile, mercenary view of things--but then my household expenses are something almost ghastly., By and by I shall take a boy of twelve and run him on through life (in the first person) but not Tom Sawyer--he would not be a good character for it., I wish you would promise to read the MS of Tom Sawyer some time, and see if you don't really decide that I am right in closing with him as a boy --and point out the most glaring defects for me., It is a tremendous favor to ask, and I expect you to refuse and would be ashamed to expect you to do otherwise., But the thing has been so many months in my mind that it seems a relief to snake it out., I don't know any other person whose judgment I could venture to take fully and entirely., Don't hesitate about saying no, for I know how your time is taxed, and I would have honest need to blush if you said yes., Osgood and I are ""going for"" the puppy G---- on infringement of trademark., To win one or two suits of this kind will set literary folks on a firmer bottom., I wish Osgood would sue for stealing Holmes's poem., Wouldn't it be gorgeous to sue R---- for petty larceny?, I will promise to go into court and swear I think him capable of stealing pea-nuts from a blind pedlar., Yrs ever,  MY DEAR HOWELLS,--Just as soon as you consented I realized all the atrocity of my request, and straightway blushed and weakened., I telegraphed my theatrical agent to come here and carry off the MS and copy it., But I will gladly send it to you if you will do as follows: dramatize it, if you perceive that you can, and take, for your remuneration, half of the first $6000 which I receive for its representation on the stage., You could alter the plot entirely, if you chose., I could help in the work, most cheerfully, after you had arranged the plot., I have my eye upon two young girls who can play ""Tom"" and ""Huck."", I believe a good deal of a drama can be made of it., Come--can't you tackle this in the odd hours of your vacation?, or later, if you prefer?, I do wish you could come down once more before your holiday., I'd give anything!, Yrs ever,  MY DEAR HOWELLS,--My plan is this--you are to get Mr. Lowell and Mr. Longfellow to be the first signers of my copyright petition; you must sign it yourself and get Mr. Whittier to do likewise., Then Holmes will sign--he said he would if he didn't have to stand at the head., Then I'm fixed., I will then put a gentlemanly chap under wages and send him personally to every author of distinction in the country, and corral the rest of the signatures., Then I'll have the whole thing lithographed (about a thousand copies) and move upon the President and Congress in person, but in the subordinate capacity of a party who is merely the agent of better and wiser men--men whom the country cannot venture to laugh at., I will ask the President to recommend the thing in his message (and if he should ask me to sit down and frame the paragraph for him I should blush --but still I would frame it.), Next I would get a prime leader in Congress: I would also see that votes enough to carry the measure were privately secured before the bill was offered., This I would try through my leader and my friends there., And then if Europe chose to go on stealing from us, we would say with noble enthusiasm, ""American lawmakers do steal but not from foreign authors--Not from foreign authors!"", You see, what I want to drive into the Congressional mind is the simple fact that the moral law is ""Thou shalt not steal""--no matter what Europe may do., I swear I can't see any use in robbing European authors for the benefit of American booksellers, anyway., If we can ever get this thing through Congress, we can try making copyright perpetual, some day., There would be no sort of use in it, since only one book in a hundred millions outlives the present copyright term--no sort of use except that the writer of that one book have his rights--which is something., If we only had some God in the country's laws, instead of being in such a sweat to get Him into the Constitution, it would be better all around., The only man who ever signed my petition with alacrity, and said that the fact that a thing was right was all-sufficient, was Rev., Dr. Bushnell., I have lost my old petition, (which was brief) but will draft and enclose another--not in the words it ought to be, but in the substance., I want Mr. Lowell to furnish the words (and the ideas too,) if he will do it., Say--Redpath beseeches me to lecture in Boston in November--telegraphs that Beecher's and Nast's withdrawal has put him in the tightest kind of a place., So I guess I'll do that old ""Roughing It"" lecture over again in November and repeat it 2 or 3 times in New York while I am at it., Can I take a carriage after the lecture and go out and stay with you that night, provided you find at that distant time that it will not inconvenience you?, Is Aldrich home yet?, With love to you all                                         Yrs ever,  MY DEAR HOWELLS,--That is a perfectly superb notice., ...]"|1
96|"[It was dreadfully conspicuous., The General said a word or so--I replied, and then said, ""But I'll step back, General, I don't want to interrupt your speech."", ""But I'm not going to make any--stay where you are--I'll get you to make it for me."", General Sherman came on the platform wearing the uniform of a full General, and you should have heard the cheers., Gen. Logan was going to introduce me, but I didn't want any more conspicuousness., When the head of the procession passed it was grand to see Sheridan, in his military cloak and his plumed chapeau, sitting as erect and rigid as a statue on his immense black horse--by far the most martial figure I ever saw., And the crowd roared again., It was chilly, and Gen. Deems lent me his overcoat until night., He came a few minutes ago--5.45 P.M., and got it, but brought Gen. Willard, who lent me his for the rest of my stay, and will get another for himself when he goes home to dinner., Mine is much too heavy for this warm weather., I have a seat on the stage at Haverley's Theatre, tonight, where the Army of the Tennessee will receive Gen. Grant, and where Gen. Sherman will make a speech., At midnight I am to attend a meeting of the Owl Club., I love you ever so much, my darling, and am hoping to get a word from you yet., Livy darling, it was a great time., There were perhaps thirty people on the stage of the theatre, and I think I never sat elbow-to-elbow with so many historic names before., Grant, Sherman, Sheridan, Schofield, Pope, Logan, Augur, and so on., What an iron man Grant is!, He sat facing the house, with his right leg crossed over his left and his right boot-sole tilted up at an angle, and his left hand and arm reposing on the arm of his chair--you note that position?, Well, when glowing references were made to other grandees on the stage, those grandees always showed a trifle of nervous consciousness--and as these references came frequently, the nervous change of position and attitude were also frequent., But Grant!--he was under a tremendous and ceaseless bombardment of praise and gratulation, but as true as I'm sitting here he never moved a muscle of his body for a single instant, during 30 minutes!, You could have played him on a stranger for an effigy., Perhaps he never would have moved, but at last a speaker made such a particularly ripping and blood-stirring remark about him that the audience rose and roared and yelled and stamped and clapped an entire minute--Grant sitting as serene as ever--when Gen. Sherman stepped to him, laid his hand affectionately on his shoulder, bent respectfully down and whispered in his ear., Gen. Grant got up and bowed, and the storm of applause swelled into a hurricane., He sat down, took about the same position and froze to it till by and by there was another of those deafening and protracted roars, when Sherman made him get up and bow again., He broke up his attitude once more--the extent of something more than a hair's breadth--to indicate me to Sherman when the house was keeping up a determined and persistent call for me, and poor bewildered Sherman, (who did not know me), was peering abroad over the packed audience for me, not knowing I was only three feet from him and most conspicuously located, (Gen. Sherman was Chairman.), One of the most illustrious individuals on that stage was ""Ole Abe,"" the historic war eagle., He stood on his perch--the old savage-eyed rascal --three or four feet behind Gen. Sherman, and as he had been in nearly every battle that was mentioned by the orators his soul was probably stirred pretty often, though he was too proud to let on., Read Logan's bosh, and try to imagine a burly and magnificent Indian, in General's uniform, striking a heroic attitude and getting that stuff off in the style of a declaiming school-boy., Please put the enclosed scraps in the drawer and I will scrap-book them., I only staid at the Owl Club till 3 this morning and drank little or nothing., Went to sleep without whisky., Ich liebe dish., I've just come to my room, Livy darling, I guess this was the memorable night of my life., By George, I never was so stirred since I was born., I heard four speeches which I can never forget., One by Emory Storrs, one by Gen. Vilas (O, wasn't it wonderful!), one by Gen. Logan (mighty stirring), one by somebody whose name escapes me, and one by that splendid old soul, Col. Bob Ingersoll,--oh, it was just the supremest combination of English words that was ever put together since the world began., My soul, how handsome he looked, as he stood on that table, in the midst of those 500 shouting men, and poured the molten silver from his lips!, Lord, what an organ is human speech when it is played by a master!, All these speeches may look dull in print, but how the lightning glared around them when they were uttered, and how the crowd roared in response!, It was a great night, a memorable night., I am so richly repaid for my journey--and how I did wish with all my whole heart that you were there to be lifted into the very seventh heaven of enthusiasm, as I was., The army songs, the military music, the crashing applause --Lord bless me, it was unspeakable., Out of compliment they placed me last in the list--No., 15--I was to ""hold the crowd""--and bless my life I was in awful terror when No., 14. rose, at a o'clock this morning and killed all the enthusiasm by delivering the flattest, insipidest, silliest of all responses to ""Woman"" that ever a weary multitude listened to., Then Gen. Sherman (Chairman) announced my toast, and the crowd gave me a good round of applause as I mounted on top of the dinner table, but it was only on account of my name, nothing more --they were all tired and wretched., They let my first sentence go in., silence, till I paused and added ""we stand on common ground""--then they burst forth like a hurricane and I saw that I had them!, From that time on, I stopped at the end of each sentence, and let the tornado of applause and laughter sweep around me--and when I closed with ""And if the child is but the prophecy of the man, there are mighty few who will doubt that he succeeded,"" I say it who oughtn't to say it, the house came down with a crash., For two hours and a half, now, I've been shaking hands and listening to congratulations., Gen. Sherman said, ""Lord bless you, my boy, I don't know how you do it--it's a secret that's beyond me--but it was great--give me your hand again."", And do you know, Gen. Grant sat through fourteen speeches like a graven image, but I fetched him!, I broke him up, utterly!, He told me he laughed till the tears came and every bone in his body ached., (And do you know, the biggest part of the success of the speech lay in the fact that the audience saw that for once in his life he had been knocked out of his iron serenity.), Bless your soul, 'twas immense., I never was so proud in my life., Lots and lots of people--hundreds I might say--told me my speech was the triumph of the evening--which was a lie., Ladies, Tom, Dick and Harry --even the policemen--captured me in the halls and shook hands, and scores of army officers said ""We shall always be grateful to you for coming."", General Pope came to bunt me up--I was afraid to speak to him on that theatre stage last night, thinking it might be presumptuous to tackle a man so high up in military history., Gen. Schofield, and other historic men, paid their compliments., Sheridan was ill and could not come, but I'm to go with a General of his staff and see him before I go to Col. Grant's., Gen. Augur--well, I've talked with them all, received invitations from them all--from people living everywhere--and as I said before, it's a memorable night., I wouldn't have missed it for anything in the world., But my sakes, you should have heard Ingersoll's speech on that table!, Half an hour ago he ran across me in the crowded halls and put his arms about me and said ""Mark, if I live a hundred years, I'll always be grateful for your speech--Lord what a supreme thing it was."", But I told him it wasn't any use to talk, he had walked off with the honors of that occasion by something of a majority., Bully boy is Ingersoll--traveled with him in the cars the other day, and you can make up your mind we had a good time., Of course I forgot to go and pay for my hotel car and so secure it, but the army officers told me an hour ago to rest easy, they would go at once, at this unholy hour of the night and compel the railways to do their duty by me, and said ""You don't need to request the Army of the Tennessee to do your desires--you can command its services."", Well, I bummed around that banquet hall from 8 in the evening till 2 in the morning, talking with people and listening to speeches, and I never ate a single bite or took a sup of anything but ice water, so if I seem excited now, it is the intoxication of supreme enthusiasm., By George, it was a grand night, a historical night., And now it is a quarter past 6 A.M.--so good bye and God bless you and the Bays,--[Family word for babies]--my darlings  Show it to Joe if you want to--I saw some of his friends here., MY DEAR INGERSOLL,--Thank you most heartily for the books--I am devouring them--they have found a hungry place, and they content it and satisfy it to a miracle., I wish I could hear you speak these splendid chapters before a great audience--to read them by myself and hear the boom of the applause only in the ear of my imagination, leaves a something wanting --and there is also a still greater lack, your manner, and voice, and presence., The Chicago speech arrived an hour too late, but I was all right anyway, for I found that my memory had been able to correct all the errors., I read it to the Saturday Club (of young girls) and told them to remember that it was doubtful if its superior existed in our language., Truly Yours,  MY DEAR HOWELLS,--If anybody talks, there, I shall claim the right to say a word myself, and be heard among the very earliest--else it would be confoundedly awkward for me--and for the rest, too., But you may read what I say, beforehand, and strike out whatever you choose., Of course I thought it wisest not to be there at all; but Warner took the opposite view, and most strenuously., Speaking of Johnny's conclusion to become an outlaw, reminds me of Susie's newest and very earnest longing--to have crooked teeth and glasses--""like Mamma."", I would like to look into a child's head, once, and see what its processes are., Yrs ever,  MY DEAR HOWELLS,--Am waiting for Patrick to come with the carriage., Mrs. Clemens and I are starting (without the children) to stay indefinitely in Elmira., The wear and tear of settling the house broke her down, and she has been growing weaker and weaker for a fortnight., All that time--in fact ever since I saw you--I have been fighting a life-and-death battle with this infernal book and hoping to get done some day., I required 300 pages of MS, and I have written near 600 since I saw you--and tore it all up except 288., This I was about to tear up yesterday and begin again, when Mrs. Perkins came up to the billiard room and said, ""You will never get any woman to do the thing necessary to save her life by mere persuasion; you see you have wasted your words for three weeks; it is time to use force; she must have a change; take her home and leave the children here."", I said, ""If there is one death that is painfuller than another, may I get it if I don't do that thing."", So I took the 288 pages to Bliss and told him that was the very last line I should ever write on this book., (A book which required 2600 pages of MS, and I have written nearer four thousand, first and last.), I am as soary (and flighty) as a rocket, to-day, with the unutterable joy of getting that Old Man of the Sea off my back, where he has been roosting for more than a year and a half., Next time I make a contract before writing the book, may I suffer the righteous penalty and be burnt, like the injudicious believer., I am mighty glad you are done your book (this is from a man who, above all others, feels how much that sentence means) and am also mighty glad you have begun the next (this is also from a man who knows the felicity of that, and means straightway to enjoy it.), The Undiscovered starts off delightfully--I have read it aloud to Mrs. C. and we vastly enjoyed it., Well, time's about up--must drop a line to Aldrich., Yrs ever,  MY DEAR HOWELLS,--.....I take so much pleasure in my story that I am loth to hurry, not wanting to get it done., Did I ever tell you the plot of it?, It begins at 9 a.m., Jan. 27, 1547, seventeen and a half hours before Henry VIII's death, by the swapping of clothes and place, between the prince of Wales and a pauper boy of the same age and countenance (and half as much learning and still more genius and imagination) and after that, the rightful small King has a rough time among tramps and ruffians in the country parts of Kent, whilst the small bogus King has a gilded and worshipped and dreary and restrained and cussed time of it on the throne--and this all goes on for three weeks--till the midst of the coronation grandeurs in Westminster Abbey, Feb. 20, when the ragged true King forces his way in but cannot prove his genuineness--until the bogus King, by a remembered incident of the first day is able to prove it for him--whereupon clothes are changed and the coronation proceeds under the new and rightful conditions., My idea is to afford a realizing sense of the exceeding severity of the laws of that day by inflicting some of their penalties upon the King himself and allowing him a chance to see the rest of them applied to others--all of which is to account for certain mildnesses which distinguished Edward VI's reign from those that preceded and followed it., ...]"|1

so, no minute subtracted from work is borrowed, it is stolen., But this time I do not repent., As a rule, people don't send me books which I can thank them for, and so I say nothing--which looks uncourteous., But I thank you., Ariadne is a beautiful and satisfying story; and true, too--which is the best part of a story; or indeed of any other thing., Even liars have to admit that, if they are intelligent liars; I mean in their private [the word conscientious written but erased] intervals., (I struck that word out because a man's private thought can never be a lie; what he thinks, is to him the truth, always; what he speaks--but these be platitudes.), If you want me to pick some flaws--very well--but I do it unwillingly., I notice one thing--which one may notice also in my books, and in all books whether written by man or God: trifling carelessness of statement or Expression., If I think that you meant that she took the lizard from the water which she had drawn from the well, it is evidence--it is almost proof--that your words were not as clear as they should have been., True, it is only a trifling thing; but so is mist on a mirror., I would have hung the pail on Ariadne's arm., You did not deceive me when you said that she carried it under her arm, for I knew she didn't; still it was not your right to mar my enjoyment of the graceful picture., If the pail had been a portfolio, I wouldn't be making these remarks., The engraver of a fine picture revises, and revises, and revises--and then revises, and revises, and revises; and then repeats., And always the charm of that picture grows, under his hand., It was good enough before--told its story, and was beautiful., True: and a lovely girl is lovely, with freckles; but she isn't at her level best with them., This is not hypercriticism; you have had training enough to know that., So much concerning exactness of statement., In that other not-small matter--selection of the exact single word--you are hard to catch., Still, I should hold that Mrs. Walker considered that there was no occasion for concealment; that ""motive"" implied a deeper mental search than she expended on the matter; that it doesn't reflect the attitude of her mind with precision., Is this hypercriticism?, I shan't dispute it., I only say, that if Mrs. Walker didn't go so far as to have a motive, I had to suggest that when a word is so near the right one that a body can't quite tell whether it is or isn't, it's good politics to strike it out and go for the Thesaurus., That's all., Motive may stand; but you have allowed a snake to scream, and I will not concede that that was the best word., I do not apologize for saying these things, for they are not said in the speck-hunting spirit, but in the spirit of want-to-help-if-I-can., They would be useful to me if said to me once a month, they may be useful to you, said once., I save the other stories for my real vacation--which is nine months long, to my sorrow., I thank you again., Truly Yours  Saturday 29th, by a closely calculated estimate, there were 85 days' work to do on the machine., We can use 4 men, but not constantly., If they could work constantly it would complete the machine in 21 days, of course., They will all be on hand and under wages, and each will get in all the work there is opportunity for, but by how much they can reduce the 85 days toward the 21 days, nobody can tell., To-day I pay Pratt & Whitney $10,000., This squares back indebtedness and everything to date., They began about May or April or March 1886--along there somewhere, and have always kept from a dozen to two dozen master-hands on the machine., That outgo is done; 4 men for a month or two will close up that leak and caulk it., Work on the patents is also kind of drawing toward a conclusion., Love to you both., All well here., And give our love to Ma if she can get the idea., DEAR THEO,--I am here in Twichell's house at work, with the noise of the children and an army of carpenters to help., Of course they don't help, but neither do they hinder., It's like a boiler-factory for racket, and in nailing a wooden ceiling onto the room under me the hammering tickles my feet amazingly sometimes, and jars my table a good deal; but I never am conscious of the racket at all, and I move my feet into position of relief without knowing when I do it., I began here Monday morning, and have done eighty pages since., I was so tired last night that I thought I would lie abed and rest, to-day; but I couldn't resist., I mean to try to knock off tomorrow, but it's doubtful if I do., I want to finish the day the machine finishes, and a week ago the closest calculations for that indicated Oct. 22--but experience teaches me that their calculations will miss fire, as usual., The other day the children were projecting a purchase, Livy and I to furnish the money--a dollar and a half., Jean discouraged the idea., She said: ""We haven't got any money., Children, if you would think, you would remember the machine isn't done."", It's billiards to-night., I wish you were here., With love to you both  P. S.

S.  Don't imagine that I have lost my temper, because I swear., I swear all day, but I do not lose my temper., ...]"|1

ROGERS, I drove the quill too hard, and I broke down--in my head., It has now been three days since I laid up., When I wrote you a week ago I had added 10,000 words or thereabout to Joan., Next day I added 1,500 which was a proper enough day's work though not a full one; but during Tuesday and Wednesday I stacked up an aggregate of 6,000 words--and that was a very large mistake., My head hasn't been worth a cent since., However, there's a compensation; for in those two days I reached and passed--successfully--a point which I was solicitous about before I ever began the book: viz., the battle of Patay., Because that would naturally be the next to the last chapter of a work consisting of either two books or one., In the one case one goes right along from that point (as I shall do now); in the other he would add a wind-up chapter and make the book consist of Joan's childhood and military career alone., I shall resume work to-day; and hereafter I will not go at such an intemperate' rate., My head is pretty cobwebby yet., I am hoping that along about this time I shall hear that the machine is beginning its test in the Herald office., I shall be very glad indeed to know the result of it., I wish I could be there., Sincerely yours  DEAR MR. ROGERS,--I seemed to be entirely expecting your letter, and also prepared and resigned; but Lord, it shows how little we know ourselves and how easily we can deceive ourselves., It hit me like a thunder-clap., It knocked every rag of sense out of my head, and I went flying here and there and yonder, not knowing what I was doing, and only one clearly defined thought standing up visible and substantial out of the crazy storm-drift that my dream of ten years was in desperate peril, and out of the 60,000 or 90,000 projects for its rescue that came floating through my skull, not one would hold still long enough for me to examine it and size it up., Have you ever been like that?, Not so much so, I reckon., There was another clearly defined idea--I must be there and see it die., That is, if it must die; and maybe if I were there we might hatch up some next-to-impossible way to make it take up its bed and take a walk., So, at the end of four hours I started, still whirling and walked over to the rue Scribe--4 P. M.--and asked a question or two and was told I should be running a big risk if I took the 9 P. M.  train for London and Southampton; ""better come right along at 6.52 per Havre special and step aboard the New York all easy and comfortable."", Very!, and I about two miles from home, with no packing done., Then it occurred to me that none of these salvation-notions that were whirl-winding through my head could be examined or made available unless at least a month's time could be secured., So I cabled you, and said to myself that I would take the French steamer tomorrow (which will be Sunday)., By bedtime Mrs. Clemens had reasoned me into a fairly rational and contented state of mind; but of course it didn't last long., So I went on thinking--mixing it with a smoke in the dressing room once an hour--until dawn this morning., Result--a sane resolution; no matter what your answer to my cable might be, I would hold still and not sail until I should get an answer to this present letter which I am now writing, or a cable answer from you saying ""Come"" or ""Remain."", I have slept 6 hours, my pond has clarified, and I find the sediment of my 70,000 projects to be of this character:  Don't say I'm wild., For really I'm sane again this morning., I am going right along with Joan, now, and wait untroubled till I hear from you., If you think I can be of the least use, cable me ""Come."", I can write Joan on board ship and lose no time., Also I could discuss my plan with the publisher for a deluxe Joan, time being an object, for some of the pictures could be made over here cheaply and quickly, but would cost much time and money in America., If the meeting should decide to quit business Jan. 4, I'd like to have Stoker stopped from paying in any more money, if Miss Harrison doesn't mind that disagreeable job., And I'll have to write them, too, of course., With love,  DEAR MR.

M.  plenty comfortably enough writing a long chapter of my book; then went to a masked ball blacked up as Uncle Remus, taking Clara along; and we had a good time., I have lost no day since and suffered no discomfort to speak of, but drove my troubles out of my mind and had good success in keeping them out--through watchfulness., I have done a good week's work and put the book a good way ahead in the Great Trial, which is the difficult part which requires the most thought and carefulness., I cannot see the end of the Trial yet, but I am on the road., I am creeping surely toward it., ""Why not leave them all to me."", My business bothers?, I take you by the hand!, I jump at the chance!, I ought to be ashamed and I am trying my best to be ashamed--and yet I do jump at the chance in spite of it., I don't want to write Irving and I don't want to write Stoker., It doesn't seem as if I could., But I can suggest something for you to write them; and then if you see that I am unwise, you can write them something quite different., Now this is my idea:       1., To return Stoker's $100 to him and keep his stock., 2., And tell Irving that when luck turns with me I will make good to      him what the salvage from the dead Co. fails to pay him of his $500., P.

grateful to see it grow., Some of that gold comes, like yourself, in a sealed package, and I can't see it and may never have the happiness; but I know its value without that, and by what sum it increases my wealth., I have a Club, a private Club, which is all my own., I appoint the Members myself, and they can't help themselves, because I don't allow them to vote on their own appointment and I don't allow them to resign!, They are all friends whom I have never seen (save one), but who have written friendly letters to me., By the laws of my Club there can be only one Member in each country, and there can be no male Member but myself., Some day I may admit males, but I don't know--they are capricious and inharmonious, and their ways provoke me a good deal., It is a matter which the Club shall decide., I have made four appointments in the past three or four months: You as Member for France, a young Highland girl as Member for Scotland, a Mohammedan girl as Member for Bengal, and a dear and bright young niece of mine as Member for the United States--for I do not represent a country myself, but am merely Member at Large for the Human Race., You must not try to resign, for the laws of the Club do not allow that., You must console yourself by remembering that you are in the best of company; that nobody knows of your membership except myself--that no Member knows another's name, but only her country; that no taxes are levied and no meetings held (but how dearly I should like to attend one!)., One of my Members is a Princess of a royal house, another is the daughter of a village book-seller on the continent of Europe., For the only qualification for Membership is intellect and the spirit of good will; other distinctions, hereditary or acquired, do not count., May I send you the Constitution and Laws of the Club?, I shall be so pleased if I may., It is a document which one of my daughters typewrites for me when I need one for a new Member, and she

Jonathan in his insane debauch; rose immediately refreshed and fine at 10 this morning, but with a strange and haunting sense of having been on a three days' tear with a drunken lunatic., It is years since I have known these sensations., All through the book is the glaze of a resplendent intellect gone mad--a marvelous spectacle., No, not all through the book--the drunk does not come on till the last third, where what I take to be Calvinism and its God begins to show up and shine red and hideous in the glow from the fires of hell, their only right and proper adornment., By God I was ashamed to be in such company., Jonathan seems to hold (as against the Arminian position) that the Man (or his Soul or his Will) never creates an impulse itself, but is moved to action by an impulse back of it., That's sound!, Also, that of two or more things offered it, it infallibly chooses the one which for the moment is most pleasing to ITSELF., Perfectly correct!, An immense admission for a man not otherwise sane., Up to that point he could have written chapters III and IV of my suppressed ""Gospel."", But there we seem to separate., He seems to concede the indisputable and unshakable dominion of Motive and Necessity (call them what he may, these are exterior forces and not under the man's authority, guidance or even suggestion)--then he suddenly flies the logic track and (to all seeming) makes the man and not these exterior forces responsible to God for the man's thoughts, words and acts., It is frank insanity., I think that when he concedes the autocratic dominion of Motive and Necessity he grants, a third position of mine--that a man's mind is a mere machine--an automatic machine--which is handled entirely from the outside, the man himself furnishing it absolutely nothing: not an ounce of its fuel, and not so much as a bare suggestion to that exterior engineer as to what the machine shall do, nor how it shall do it nor when., After that concession, it was time for him to get alarmed and shirk--for he was pointing straight for the only rational and possible next-station on that piece of road the irresponsibility of man to God., And so he shirked., Shirked, and arrived at this handsome result:  Man is commanded to do so-and-so., It has been ordained from the beginning of time that some men shan't and others can't., These are to be blamed: let them be damned., I enjoy the Colonel very much, and shall enjoy the rest of him with an obscene delight., Joe, the whole tribe shout love to you and yours!, DEAR JOE,--I am lost in reverence and admiration!, It is now twenty-four hours that I have been trying to cool down and contemplate with quiet blood this extraordinary spectacle of energy, industry, perseverance, pluck, analytical genius, penetration, this irruption of thunders and fiery splendors from a fair and flowery mountain that nobody had supposed was a sleeping volcano, but I seem to be as excited as ever., Yesterday I read as much as half of the book, not understanding a word but enchanted nevertheless--partly by the wonder of it all, the study, the erudition, the incredible labor, the modesty, the dignity, the majestic exclusiveness of the field and its lofty remoteness from things and contacts sordid and mean and earthy, and partly by the grace and beauty and limpidity of the book's unsurpassable English., Science, always great and worshipful, goes often in hodden grey, but you have clothed her in garments meet for her high degree., You think you get ""poor pay"" for your twenty years?, No, oh no., You have lived in a paradise of the intellect whose lightest joys were beyond the reach of the longest purse in Christendom, you have had daily and nightly emancipation from the world's slaveries and gross interests, you have received a bigger wage than any man in the land, you have dreamed a splendid dream and had it come true, and to-day you could not afford to trade fortunes with anybody--not even with another scientist, for he must divide his spoil with his guild, whereas essentially the world you have discovered is your own and must remain so., It is all just magnificent, Joe!, And no one is prouder or gladder than                Yours always                                 DEAR SIR,--I desire to make a complaint, and I bring it to you, the head of the company, because by experience I know better than to carry it to a subordinate., I have been here a month and a half, and by testimony of friends, reinforced by personal experience I now feel qualified to claim as an established fact that the telegraphic service here is the worst in the world except that Boston., These services are actually slower than was the New York and Hartford service in the days when I last complained to you--which was fifteen or eighteen years ago, when telegraphic time and train time between the mentioned points was exactly the same, to-wit, three hours and a half., Six days ago--it was that raw day which provoked so much comment--my daughter was on her way up from New York, and at noon she telegraphed me from New Haven asking that I meet her with a cloak at Portsmouth., Her telegram reached me four hours and a quarter later--just 15 minutes too late for me to catch my train and meet her., I judge that the telegram traveled about 200 miles., It is the best telegraphic work I have seen since I have been here, and I am mentioning it in this place not as a complaint but as a compliment., I think a compliment ought always to precede a complaint, where one is possible, because it softens resentment and insures for the complaint a courteous and gentle reception., Still, there is a detail or two connected with this matter which ought perhaps to be mentioned., And now, having smoothed the way with the compliment, I will venture them., The head corpse in the York Harbor office sent me that telegram altho (1) he knew it would reach me too late to be of any value; (2) also, that he was going to send it to me by his boy; (3) that the boy would not take the trolley and come the 2 miles in 12 minutes, but would walk; (4) that he would be two hours and a quarter on the road; (5) and that he would collect 25 cents for transportation, for a telegram which the he knew to be worthless before he started it., From these data I infer that the Western Union owes me 75 cents; that is to say, the amount paid for combined wire and land transportation --a recoup provided for in the printed paragraph which heads the telegraph-blank., By these humane and Christian stages we now arrive at the complaint proper., We have had a grave case of illness in the family, and a relative was coming some six hundred miles to help in the sick-room during the convalescing period., It was an anxious time, of course, and I wrote and asked to be notified as to the hour of the expected arrival of this relative in Boston or in York Harbor., Being afraid of the telegraph--which I think ought not to be used in times of hurry and emergency--I asked that the desired message be brought to me by some swift method of transportation., By the milkman, if he was coming this way., But there are always people who think they know more than you do, especially young people; so of course the young fellow in charge of this lady used the telegraph., And at Boston, of all places!, Except York Harbor., The result was as usual; let me employ a statelier and exacter term, and say, historical., The dispatch was handed to the h. c. of the Boston office at 9 this morning., It said, ""Shall bring A. S. to you eleven forty-five this morning."", The distance traveled by the dispatch is forty or fifty miles, I suppose, as the train-time is five minutes short of two hours, and the trains are so slow that they can't give a W.

Clemens Memorial Building., I wish to place the money $6,000.00 in the hands of three trustees, --Paine and two others: H. A. Lounsbury and William E. Hazen, all of Redding, these trustees to form a building Committee to decide on the size and plan of the building needed and to arrange for and supervise the work in such a manner that the fund shall amply provide for the building complete, with necessary furnishings, leaving, if possible, a balance remaining, sufficient for such repairs and additional furnishings as may be required for two years from the time of completion., Will you please draw a document covering these requirements and have it ready by the time I reach New York (April 14th)., Very sincerely,                                           ]"|1
