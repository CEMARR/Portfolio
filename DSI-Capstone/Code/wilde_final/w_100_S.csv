0|"[LE JARDIN., The lily?s withered chalice falls
      Around its rod of dusty gold,
      And from the beech trees on the wold
    The last wood-pigeon coos and calls., The gaudy leonine sunflower
      Hangs black and barren on its stalk,
      And down the windy garden walk
    The dead leaves scatter,--hour by hour., Pale privet-petals white as milk
      Are blown into a snowy mass;
      The roses lie upon the grass,
    Like little shreds of crimson silk., LA MER., A white mist drifts across the shrouds,
      A wild moon in this wintry sky
      Gleams like an angry lion?s eye
    Out of a mane of tawny clouds., The muffled steersman at the wheel
      Is but a shadow in the gloom;--
      And in the throbbing engine room
    Leap the long rods of polished steel., The shattered storm has left its trace
      Upon this huge and heaving dome,
      For the thin threads of yellow foam
    Float on the waves like ravelled lace., I fear I cannot picture America as altogether an Elysium--perhaps, from
the ordinary standpoint I know but little about the country., I cannot
give its latitude or longitude; I cannot compute the value of its dry
goods, and I have no very close acquaintance with its politics., These
are matters which may not interest you, and they certainly are not
interesting to me., The first thing that struck me on landing in America was that if the
Americans are not the most well-dressed people in the world, they are
the most comfortably dressed., Men are seen there with the dreadful
chimney-pot hat, but there are very few hatless men; men wear the
shocking swallow-tail coat, but few are to be seen with no coat at all., There is an air of comfort in the appearance of the people which is a
marked contrast to that seen in this country, where, too often, people
are seen in close contact with rags., The next thing particularly noticeable is that everybody seems in a
hurry to catch a train., This is a state of things which is not
favourable to poetry or romance., Had Romeo or Juliet been in a constant
state of anxiety about trains, or had their minds been agitated by the
question of return-tickets, Shakespeare could not have given us those
lovely balcony scenes which are so full of poetry and pathos., America is the noisiest country that ever existed., One is waked up in
the morning, not by the singing of the nightingale, but by the steam
whistle., It is surprising that the sound practical sense of the
Americans does not reduce this intolerable noise., All Art depends upon
exquisite and delicate sensibility, and such continual turmoil must
ultimately be destructive of the musical faculty., There is not so much beauty to be found in American cities as in Oxford,
Cambridge, Salisbury or Winchester, where are lovely relics of a
beautiful age; but still there is a good deal of beauty to be seen in
them now and then, but only where the American has not attempted to
create it., Where the Americans have attempted to produce beauty they
have signally failed., A remarkable characteristic of the Americans is
the manner in which they have applied science to modern life., This is apparent in the most cursory stroll through New York., In England
an inventor is regarded almost as a crazy man, and in too many instances
invention ends in disappointment and poverty., In America an inventor is
honoured, help is forthcoming, and the exercise of ingenuity, the
application of science to the work of man, is there the shortest road to
wealth., There is no country in the world where machinery is so lovely as
in America., I have always wished to believe that the line of strength and the line
of beauty are one., That wish was realised when I contemplated American
machinery., It was not until I had seen the water-works at Chicago that I
realised the wonders of machinery; the rise and fall of the steel rods,
the symmetrical motion of the great wheels is the most beautifully
rhythmic thing I have ever seen., [3] One is impressed in America, but not
favourably impressed, by the inordinate size of everything., The country
seems to try to bully one into a belief in its power by its impressive
bigness., I was disappointed with Niagara--most people must be disappointed with
Niagara., Every American bride is taken there, and the sight of the
stupendous waterfall must be one of the earliest, if not the keenest,
disappointments in American married life., One sees it under bad
conditions, very far away, the point of view not showing the splendour
of the water., To appreciate it really one has to see it from underneath
the fall, and to do that it is necessary to be dressed in a yellow
oil-skin, which is as ugly as a mackintosh--and I hope none of you ever
wears one., It is a consolation to know, however, that such an artist as
Madame Bernhardt has not only worn that yellow, ugly dress, but has been
photographed in it., Perhaps the most beautiful part of America is the West, to reach which,
however, involves a journey by rail of six days, racing along tied to an
ugly tin-kettle of a steam engine., I found but poor consolation for this
journey in the fact that the boys who infest the cars and sell
everything that one can eat--or should not eat--were selling editions of
my poems vilely printed on a kind of grey blotting paper, for the low
price of ten cents., [4] Calling these boys on one side I told them that
though poets like to be popular they desire to be paid, and selling
editions of my poems without giving me a profit is dealing a blow at
literature which must have a disastrous effect on poetical aspirants., The invariable reply that they made was that they themselves made a
profit out of the transaction and that was all they cared about., It is a popular superstition that in America a visitor is invariably
addressed as ?Stranger.?, I was never once addressed as ?Stranger.?, When
I went to Texas I was called ?Captain?, ; when I got to the centre of the
country I was addressed as ?Colonel,?, and, on arriving at the borders of
Mexico, as ?General.?, On the whole, however, ?Sir,?, the old English
method of addressing people is the most common., It is, perhaps, worth while to note that what many people call
Americanisms are really old English expressions which have lingered in
our colonies while they have been lost in our own country., Many people
imagine that the term ?I guess,?, which is so common in America, is
purely an American expression, but it was used by John Locke in his work
on ?The Understanding,?, just as we now use ?I think.?, [5]

It is in the colonies, and not in the mother country, that the old life
of the country really exists., If one wants to realise what English
Puritanism is--not at its worst (when it is very bad), but at its best,
and then it is not very good--I do not think one can find much of it in
England, but much can be found about Boston and Massachusetts., We have
got rid of it., America still preserves it, to be, I hope, a short-lived
curiosity., San Francisco is a really beautiful city., China Town, peopled by Chinese
labourers, is the most artistic town I have ever come across., The
people--strange, melancholy Orientals, whom many people would call
common, and they are certainly very poor--have determined that they will
have nothing about them that is not beautiful., In the Chinese
restaurant, where these navvies meet to have supper in the evening, I
found them drinking tea out of china cups as delicate as the petals of a
rose-leaf, whereas at the gaudy hotels I was supplied with a delf cup an
inch and a half thick., When the Chinese bill was presented it was made
out on rice paper, the account being done in Indian ink as fantastically
as if an artist had been etching little birds on a fan., Salt Lake City contains only two buildings of note, the chief being the
Tabernacle, which is in the shape of a soup-kettle., It is decorated by
the only native artist, and he has treated religious subjects in the
naive spirit of the early Florentine painters, representing people of
our own day in the dress of the period side by side with people of
Biblical history who are clothed in some romantic costume., The building next in importance is called the Amelia Palace, in honour
of one of Brigham Young?s wives., When he died the present president of
the Mormons stood up in the Tabernacle and said that it had been
revealed to him that he was to have the Amelia Palace, and that on this
subject there were to be no more revelations of any kind!, From Salt Lake City one travels over the great plains of Colorado and up
the Rocky Mountains, on the top of which is Leadville, the richest city
in the world., It has also got the reputation of being the roughest, and
every man carries a revolver., I was told that if I went there they
would be sure to shoot me or my travelling manager., I wrote and told
them that nothing that they could do to my travelling manager would
intimidate me., They are miners--men working in metals, so I lectured to
them on the Ethics of Art., I read them passages from the autobiography
of Benvenuto Cellini and they seemed much delighted., I was reproved by
my hearers for not having brought him with me., I explained that he had
been dead for some little time which elicited the enquiry ?Who shot
him??, They afterwards took me to a dancing saloon where I saw the only
rational method of art criticism I have ever come across., Over the piano
was printed a notice:--

The mortality among pianists in that place is marvellous., Then they
asked me to supper, and having accepted, I had to descend a mine in a
rickety bucket in which it was impossible to be graceful., Having got
into the heart of the mountain I had supper, the first course being
whisky, the second whisky and the third whisky., I went to the Theatre to lecture and I was informed that just before I
went there two men had been seized for committing a murder, and in that
theatre they had been brought on to the stage at eight o?clock in the
evening, and then and there tried and executed before a crowded
audience., But I found these miners very charming and not at all rough., Among the more elderly inhabitants of the South I found a melancholy
tendency to date every event of importance by the late war., ?How
beautiful the moon is to-night,?, I once remarked to a gentleman who was
standing next to me., ?Yes,?, was his reply, ?but you should have seen it
before the war.?, So infinitesimal did I find the knowledge of Art, west of the Rocky
Mountains, that an art patron--one who in his day had been a
miner--actually sued the railroad company for damages because the
plaster cast of Venus of Milo, which he had imported from Paris, had
been delivered minus the arms., And, what is more surprising still, he
gained his case and the damages., Pennsylvania, with its rocky gorges and woodland scenery, reminded me of
Switzerland., The prairie reminded me of a piece of blotting-paper., The Spanish and French have left behind them memorials in the beauty of
their names., All the cities that have beautiful names derive them from
the Spanish or the French., The English people give intensely ugly names
to places., One place had such an ugly name that I refused to lecture
there., It was called Grigsville., Supposing I had founded a school of Art
there--fancy ?Early Grigsville.?, Imagine a School of Art teaching
?Grigsville Renaissance.?, As for slang I did not hear much of it, though a young lady who had
changed her clothes after an afternoon dance did say that ?after the
heel kick she shifted her day goods.?, American youths are pale and precocious, or sallow and supercilious, but
American girls are pretty and charming--little oases of pretty
unreasonableness in a vast desert of practical common-sense., Every American girl is entitled to have twelve young men devoted to her., They remain her slaves and she rules them with charming nonchalance., ...]"|2
1|"[That is the one sin for
which there is no forgiveness., French songs I cannot possibly allow., People always seem to think that
they are improper, and either look shocked, which is vulgar, or laugh,
which is worse., It has often been made a subject of reproach against artists and men of
letters that they are lacking in wholeness and completeness of nature., As a rule this must necessarily be so., That very concentration of vision
and inversity of purpose which is the characteristic of the artistic
temperament is in itself a mode of limitation., To those who are
preoccupied with the beauty of form nothing else seems of so much
importance., The work of art is to dominate the spectator., The spectator is not to
dominate the work of art., One should sympathise with the joy, the beauty, the colour of life., The
less said about life's sores the better., You can't make people good by act of Parliament--that is something., Art creates an incomparable and unique effect, and having done so passes
on to other things., Nature, on the other hand, forgetting that imitation
can be made the sincerest form of insult, keeps on repeating the effect
until we all become absolutely wearied of it., It is perfectly monstrous the way people go about nowadays saying things
against one behind one's back that are absolutely and entirely true., A true artist takes no notice whatever of the public., The public are to
him non-existent., One should never trust a woman who tells one her real age., A woman who
would tell one that would tell one anything., Nothing is so aggravating as calmness., There is something positively
brutal about the good temper of most modern men., I wonder we women stand
it as well as we do., The truth is a thing I get rid of as soon as possible., Bad habit, by the
way, makes one very unpopular at the club ... with the older members., They call it being conceited., Perhaps it is., My own business always bores me to death., I prefer other people's., Don't be led astray into the paths of virtue--that is the worst of
women., They always want one to be good., And if we are good, when they
meet us they don't love us at all., They like to find us quite
irretrievably bad and to leave us quite unattractively good., Men are such cowards., They outrage every law in the world and are afraid
of the world's tongue., Wicked women bother one., Good women bore one., That is the only
difference between them., To know the principles of the highest art is to know the principles of
all the arts., I don't believe in the existence of Puritan women., I don't think there
is a woman in the world who would not be a little flattered if one made
love to her., It is that which makes women so irresistibly adorable., When I am in trouble eating is the only thing that consoles me., Indeed,
when I am in really great trouble, as anyone who knows me intimately
will tell you, I refuse everything except food and drink., When one is going to lead an entirely new life one requires regular and
wholesome meals., The soul is born old, but grows young., That is the comedy of life., The
body is born young, and grows old., That is life's tragedy., One can survive everything nowadays except death, and live down anything
except a good reputation., The past is of no importance., The present is of no importance., It is
with the future that we have to deal., For the past is what men should
not have been., The present is what men ought not to be., The future is
what artists are., Men become old, but they never become good., By persistently remaining single a man converts himself into a permanent
public temptation., Men should be more careful; this very celibacy leads
weaker vessels astray., I think that in practical life there is something about success, actual
success, that is a little unscrupulous, something about ambition that is
scrupulous always., Every man of ambition has to fight his century with its own weapons., What this century worships is wealth., The god of this century is wealth., To succeed one must have wealth., At all costs one must have wealth., I love scandals about other people, but scandals about myself don't
interest me., They have not got the charm of novelty., Moderation is a fatal thing., Enough is as bad as a meal., More than
enough is as good as a feast., The English can't stand a man who is always saying he is in the right,
but they are very fond of a man who admits he has been in the wrong., It
is one of the best things in them., Life is simply a 'mauvais quart d'heure' made up of exquisite moments., There is the same world for all of us, and good and evil, sin and
innocence, go through it hand in hand., To shut one's eyes to half of
life that one may live securely is as though one blinded oneself that
one might walk with more safety in a land of pit and precipice., Married men are horribly tedious when they are good husbands and
abominably conceited when they are not., Between men and women there is no friendship possible., There is passion,
enmity, worship, love, but no friendship., Everybody is clever nowadays., You can't go anywhere without meeting
clever people., This has become an absolute public nuisance., I don't think man has much capacity for development., He has got as far
as he can, and that is not far, is it?, I am not quite sure that I quite know what pessimism really means., All I
do know is that life cannot be understood without much charity, cannot
be lived without much charity., It is love, and not German philosophy,
that is the explanation of this world, whatever may be the explanation
of the next., I do not approve of anything that that tampers with natural arrogance., Ignorance is like a delicate exotic fruit: touch it, and the blossom is
gone., The whole theory of modern education is radically unsound., Fortunately,
in England, at any rate, education produces no effect whatsoever., If it
did it would prove a serious danger to the upper classes, and probably
lead to acts of violence in Grosvenor Square., No woman should ever be quite accurate about her age., It looks so
calculating., Emotion for the sake of emotion is the aim of art, and emotion for the
sake of emotion is the aim of life and of that practical organisation of
life that we call society., Men of the noblest possible moral character are extremely susceptible to
the influence of the physical charms of others., Modern, no less than
ancient, history supplies us with many most painful examples of what I
refer to., If it were not so, indeed, history would be quite unreadable., I am not in favour of long engagements., They give people the opportunity
of finding out each other's character before marriage, which I think is
never advisable., It is a terrible thing for a man to find out suddenly that all his life
he has been speaking nothing but the truth., The two weak points in our age are its want of principle and its want of
profile., ...]"|2
2|"[We live in an age that reads too much to be wise and that thinks too
much to be beautiful., One should absorb the colour of life, but one should never remember its
details., Details are always vulgar., It will be a marvellous thing--the true personality of man--when we see
it., It will grow naturally and simply flowerlike, or as a tree grows., It
will not be at discord., It will never argue or dispute., It will not
prove things., It will know everything, and yet it will not busy itself
about knowledge., It will have wisdom., Its value will not be measured by
material things., It will have nothing, and yet it will have everything,
and whatever one takes from it it will still have, so rich it will be., It will not be always meddling with others or asking them to be like
itself., It will love them because they will be different., And yet, while
it will not meddle with others, it will help all, as a beautiful thing
helps us, by being what it is., The personality of man will be very
wonderful., It will be as wonderful as the personality of a child., Cynicism is merely the art of seeing things as they are instead of as
they ought to be., Three addresses always inspire confidence, even in tradesmen., If one doesn't talk about a thing it has never happened., It is simply
expression that gives reality to things., No man is able who is unable to get on, just as no woman is clever who
can't succeed in obtaining that worst and most necessary of evils, a
husband., The one charm of the past is that it is the past., But women never know
when the curtain has fallen., They always want a sixth act, and as soon
as the interest of the play is entirely over they propose to continue
it., If they were allowed their way every comedy would have a tragic
ending and every tragedy would culminate in a farce., They are charmingly
artificial, but they have no sense of art., Each time that one loves is the only time that one has ever loved., Difference of object does not alter singleness of passion., It merely
intensifies it., The real tragedy of the poor is that they can afford nothing but
self-denial., Beautiful sins, like beautiful things, are the privilege of
the rich., Human life is the one thing worth investigating., Compared to it there is
nothing else of any value., It is true that as one watches life in its
curious crucible of pain and pleasure one cannot wear over one's face a
mask of glass nor keep the sulphurous fumes from troubling the brain and
making the imagination turbid with monstrous fancies and misshapen
dreams., There are poisons so subtle that to know their properties one
has to sicken of them., There are maladies so strange that one has to
pass through them if one seeks to understand their nature., And yet what
a great reward one receives!, How wonderful the whole world becomes to
one!, To note the curious, hard logic of passion and the emotional,
coloured life of the intellect--to observe where they meet, and where
they separate, at what point they are in unison and at what point they
are in discord--there is a delight in that!, What matter what the cost
is?, One can never pay too high a price for any sensation., There is only one class in the community that thinks more about money
than the rich, and that is the poor., The poor can think of nothing else., That is the misery of being poor., To live is the rarest thing in the world., Most people exist--that is
all., Personality is a very mysterious thing., A man cannot always be estimated
by what he does., He may keep the law, and yet be worthless., He may break
the law, and yet be fine., He may be bad without ever doing anything bad., He may commit a sin against society, and yet realise through that sin
his true perfection., Medi?val art is charming, but medi?val emotions are out of date., One can
use them in fiction, of course; but then the only things that one can
use in fiction are the only things that one has ceased to use in fact., Man is complete in himself., What is a cynic?, A man who knows the price of everything and the value
of nothing., It's the old, old story., Love--well, not at first sight--but love at the
end of the season, which is so much more satisfactory., No nice girl should ever waltz with such particularly younger sons!, It
looks so fast!, Good resolutions are useless attempts to interfere with scientific laws., Their origin is pure vanity., Their result is absolutely nil., They give
us now and then some of those luxurious, sterile emotions that have a
certain charm for the weak., That is all that can be said for them., They
are simply cheques that men draw on a bank where they have no account., What is the difference between literature and journalism?, Journalism is
unreadable and literature is unread., I hope you have not been leading a double life, pretending to be wicked
and being really good all the time., That would be hypocrisy., My husband is a sort of promissory note; I am tired of meeting him., Conscience makes egotists of us all., Never trust a woman who wears mauve, whatever her age may be, or a woman
over thirty-five who is fond of pink ribbons., It always means that they
have a history., There is a fatality about good resolutions-they are always made too
late., We can have in life but one great experience at best, and the secret of
life is to reproduce that experience as often as possible., Anybody can be good in the country., There are no temptations there., That
is the reason why people who live out of town are so absolutely
uncivilised., Civilisation is not by any means an easy thing to attain
to., There are only two ways by which man can reach it., One is by being
cultured, the other by being corrupt., Country people have no opportunity
of being either, so they stagnate., What nonsense people talk about happy marriages!, A man can be happy with
any woman so long as he does not love her., The things one feels absolutely certain about are never true., That is
the fatality of faith and the lesson of romance., In the common world of fact the wicked are not punished nor the good
rewarded., Success is given to the strong, failure thrust upon the weak., Nothing should be able to harm a man except himself., Nothing should be
able to rob a man at all., What a man really has is what is in him., What
is outside of him should be a matter of no importance., Modern morality consists in accepting the standard of one's age., I
consider that for any man of culture to accept the standard of his age
is a form of the grossest immorality., Perplexity and mistrust fan affection into passion, and so bring about
those beautiful tragedies that alone make life worth living., Women once
felt this, while men did not, and so women once ruled the world., Sin is a thing that writes itself across a man's, face., ...]"|2
3|"[The Academy is too large and too vulgar., Whenever I have gone there,
there have been either so many people that I have not been able to see
the pictures--which was dreadful, or so many pictures that I have not
been able to see the people--which was worse., All art is quite useless., Beauty, real beauty, ends where an intellectual expression begins., Intellect is in itself a mode of exaggeration and destroys the harmony
of any face., The moment one sits down to think one becomes all nose or
all forehead or something horrid., The one charm of marriage is that it makes a life of deception
absolutely necessary for both parties., Secrecy seems to be the one thing that can make modern life mysterious
or marvellous to us., The commonest thing is delightful if one only hides
it., Conceit is one of the greatest of the virtues, yet how few people
recognise it as a thing to aim at and to strive after., In conceit many a
man and woman has found salvation, yet the average person goes on
all-fours grovelling after modesty., It is difficult not to be unjust to what one loves., Humanity will always love Rousseau for having confessed his sins not to
a friend but to the world., Just as those who do not love Plato more than truth cannot pass beyond
the threshold of the Academe, so those who do not love beauty more than
truth never know the inmost shrine of art., There is a fatality about all physical and intellectual distinction: the
sort of fatality that seems to dog, through history, the faltering steps
of kings., It is better not to be different from one's fellows., To be born, or at any rate bred, in a handbag, whether it had handles or
not, seems to me to display a contempt for the ordinary decencies of
family life that reminds one of the worst excesses of the French
Revolution., Vice and virtue are to the artist materials for an art., There must be a new Hedonism that shall recreate life and save it from
that harsh, uncomely Puritanism that is having, in our own day, its
curious revival., It must have its service of the intellect, certainly,
yet it must never accept any theory or system that will involve the
sacrifice of any mode of passionate experience., Its aim, indeed, is to
be experience itself and not the fruits of experience, bitter or sweet
as they may be., Of the ?stheticism that deadens the senses, as of the
vulgar profligacy that dulls them, it is to know nothing., But it is to
teach man to concentrate himself upon the moments of a life that is
itself but a moment., Art never expresses anything but itself., It has an independent life,
just as thought has, and develops purely on its own lines., It is not
necessarily realistic in an age of realism nor spiritual in an age of
faith., So far from being the creation of its time it is usually in
direct opposition to it, and the only history that it preserves for us
is the history of its own progress., People who mean well always do badly., They are like the ladies who wear
clothes that don't fit them in order to show their piety., Good
intentions are invariably ungrammatical., Man can believe the impossible, but man can never believe the
improbable., When art is more varied nature will, no doubt, be more varied also., If a man is sufficiently imaginative to produce evidence in support of a
lie he might just as well speak the truth at once., The ancient historians gave us delightful fiction in the form of fact;
the modern novelist presents us with dull facts under the guise of
fiction., Nature is no great mother who has home us., She is our own creation., It
is in our brain that she quickens to life., Things are because we see
them, and what we see and how we see it depends on the arts that have
influenced us., To look at a thing is very different from seeing a thing., One does not see anything until one sees its beauty., The proper school to learn art in is not life but art., I won't tell you that the world matters nothing, or the world's voice,
or the voice of society., They matter a good deal., They matter far too
much., I wouldn't marry a man with a future before him for anything under the
sun., I am the only person in the world I should like to know thoroughly, but
I don't see any chance of it just at present., Modern memoirs are generally written by people who have entirely lost
their memories and have never done anything worth recording., Education is an admirable thing, but it is well to remember from time to
time that nothing that is worth knowing can be taught., Women are like minors, they live upon their expectations., Twisted minds are as natural to some people as twisted bodies., It is the very passions about whose origin we deceive ourselves that
tyrannise most strongly over us., Our weakest motives are those of whose
nature we are conscious., It often happens that when we think we are
experimenting on others we are really experimenting on ourselves., Whenever a man does a thoroughly stupid thing it is always from the
noblest motives., I thought I had no heart., I find I have, and a heart doesn't suit me., Somehow it doesn't go with modern dress., It makes one look old, and it
spoils one's career at critical moments., I don't play accurately--anyone can play accurately--but I play with
wonderful expression., As far as the piano is concerned sentiment is my
forte., I keep science for life., I delight in men over seventy., They always offer one the devotion of a
lifetime., Everybody who is incapable of learning has taken to teaching--that is
really what our enthusiasm for education has come to., Nature hates mind., From the point of view of form the type of all the arts is the art of
the musician., From the point of view of feeling the actor's craft is the
type., Where we differ from each other is purely in accidentals--in dress,
manner, tone of voice, religious opinions, personal appearance, tricks
of habit, and the like., The more we study art the less we care for Nature., What art really
reveals to us is Nature's lack of design, her curious crudities, her
extraordinary monotony, her absolutely unfinished condition...., It is
fortunate for us, however, that nature is so imperfect, as otherwise we
should have had no art at all., Art is our spirited protest, our gallant
attempt to teach Nature her proper place., As for the infinite variety of
nature, that is a pure myth., It is not to be found in Nature herself., It
resides in the imagination or fancy or cultivated blindness of the man
who looks at her., Facts are not merely finding a footing-place in history but they are
usurping the domain of fancy and have invaded the kingdom of romance., Their chilling touch is over everything., They are vulgarising mankind., Ordinary people wait till life discloses to them its secrets, but to the
few, to the elect, the mysteries of life are revealed before the veil is
drawn away., Sometimes this is the effect of art, and chiefly of the art
of literature which deals immediately with the passions and the
intellect., But now and then a complex personality takes the place and
assumes the office of art, is, indeed, in its way a real work of art,
Life having its elaborate masterpieces just as poetry has, or sculpture,
or painting., Thinking is the most unhealthy thing in the world, and people die of it
just as they die of any other disease., A cigarette is the perfect type of a perfect pleasure., It is exquisite
and it leaves one unsatisfied., The aim of the liar is simply to charm, to delight, to give pleasure., He
is the very basis of civilised society., It is quite a mistake to believe, as many people do, that the mind shows
itself in the face., Vice may sometimes write itself in lines and changes
of contour, but that is all., Our faces are really masks given to us to
conceal our minds with., What on earth should we men do going about with purity and innocence?, A
carefully thought-out buttonhole is much more effective., The only difference between a caprice and a lifelong passion is that the
caprice lasts a little longer., People say sometimes that beauty is only superficial., That may be so,
but at least it is not so superficial as thought is., It is the spectator and not life that art really mirrors., Nowadays people know the price of everything and the value of nothing., Conscience and cowardice are really the same things., Conscience is the
trade name of the firm--that is all., In every sphere of life form is the beginning of things., The rhythmic,
harmonious gestures of dancing convey, Plato tells us, both rhythm and
harmony into the mind., ...]"|2
4|"[But as a rule the stage is overcrowded with enormous properties, which
are not merely far more expensive and cumbersome than scene-paintings,
but far less beautiful, and far less true., Properties kill perspective., A painted door is more like a real door than a real door is itself, for
the proper conditions of light and shade can be given to it; and the
excessive use of built-up structures always makes the stage too glaring,
for as they have to be lit from behind, as well as from the front, the
gas-jets become the absolute light of the scene instead of the means
merely by which we perceive the conditions of light and shadow which the
painter has desired to show us., So, instead of bemoaning the position of the playwright, it were better
for the critics to exert whatever influence they may possess towards
restoring the scene-painter to his proper position as an artist, and not
allowing him to be built over by the property man, or hammered to death
by the carpenter., I have never seen any reason myself why such artists
as Mr. Beverley, Mr. Walter Hann, and Mr. Telbin should not be entitled
to become Academicians., They have certainly as good a claim as have many
of those R.A.?s whose total inability to paint we can see every May for a
shilling., And lastly, let those critics who hold up for our admiration the
simplicity of the Elizabethan stage remember that they are lauding a
condition of things against which Shakespeare himself, in the spirit of a
true artist, always strongly protested., I have been told that the ambition of every Dramatic Club is to act
_Henry IV_., I am not surprised., The spirit of comedy is as fervent in
this play as is the spirit of chivalry; it is an heroic pageant as well
as an heroic poem, and like most of Shakespeare?s historical dramas it
contains an extraordinary number of thoroughly good acting parts, each of
which is absolutely individual in character, and each of which
contributes to the evolution of the plot., To Oxford belongs the honour of having been the first to present on the
stage this noble play, and the production which I saw last week was in
every way worthy of that lovely town, that mother of sweetness and of
light., For, in spite of the roaring of the young lions at the Union, and
the screaming of the rabbits in the home of the vivisector, in spite of
Keble College, and the tramways, and the sporting prints, Oxford still
remains the most beautiful thing in England, and nowhere else are life
and art so exquisitely blended, so perfectly made one., Indeed, in most
other towns art has often to present herself in the form of a reaction
against the sordid ugliness of ignoble lives, but at Oxford she comes to
us as an exquisite flower born of the beauty of life and expressive of
life?s joy., She finds her home by the Isis as once she did by the
Ilissus; the Magdalen walks and the Magdalen cloisters are as dear to her
as were ever the silver olives of Colonus and the golden gateway of the
house of Pallas: she covers with fanlike tracery the vaulted entrance to
Christ Church Hall, and looks out from the windows of Merton; her feet
have stirred the Cumnor cowslips, and she gathers fritillaries in the
river-fields., To her the clamour of the schools and the dullness of the
lecture-room are a weariness and a vexation of spirit; she seeks not to
define virtue, and cares little for the categories; she smiles on the
swift athlete whose plastic grace has pleased her, and rejoices in the
young Barbarians at their games; she watches the rowers from the reedy
bank and gives myrtle to her lovers, and laurels to her poets, and rue to
those who talk wisely in the street; she makes the earth lovely to all
who dream with Keats; she opens high heaven to all who soar with Shelley;
and turning away her head from pedant, proctor and Philistine, she has
welcomed to her shrine a band of youthful actors, knowing that they have
sought with much ardour for the stern secret of Melpomene, and caught
with much gladness the sweet laughter of Thalia., And to me this ardour
and this gladness were the two most fascinating qualities of the Oxford
performance, as indeed they are qualities which are necessary to any fine
dramatic production., For without quick and imaginative observation of
life the most beautiful play becomes dull in presentation, and what is
not conceived in delight by the actor can give no delight at all to
others., I know that there are many who consider that Shakespeare is more for the
study than for the stage., With this view I do not for a moment agree., Shakespeare wrote the plays to be acted, and we have no right to alter
the form which he himself selected for the full expression of his work., Indeed, many of the beauties of that work can be adequately conveyed to
us only through the actor?s art., As I sat in the Town Hall of Oxford the
other night, the majesty of the mighty lines of the play seemed to me to
gain new music from the clear young voices that uttered them, and the
ideal grandeur of the heroism to be made more real to the spectators by
the chivalrous bearing, the noble gesture and the fine passion of its
exponents., Even the dresses had their dramatic value., Their
arch?ological accuracy gave us, immediately on the rise of the curtain, a
perfect picture of the time., As the knights and nobles moved across the
stage in the flowing robes of peace and in the burnished steel of battle,
we needed no dreary chorus to tell us in what age or land the play?s
action was passing, for the fifteenth century in all the dignity and
grace of its apparel was living actually before us, and the delicate
harmonies of colour struck from the first a dominant note of beauty which
added to the intellectual realism of arch?ology the sensuous charm of
art., I have rarely seen a production better stage-managed., Indeed, I hope
that the University will take some official notice of this delightful
work of art., Why should not degrees be granted for good acting?, Are
they not given to those who misunderstand Plato and who mistranslate
Aristotle?, And should the artist be passed over?, No., To Prince Hal,
Hotspur and Falstaff, D.C.L., ?s should be gracefully offered., I feel sure
they would be gracefully accepted., To the rest of the company the
crimson or the sheepskin hood might be assigned _honoris caus?_ to the
eternal confusion of the Philistine, and the rage of the industrious and
the dull., Thus would Oxford confer honour on herself, and the artist be
placed in his proper position., However, whether or not Convocation
recognizes the claims of culture, I hope that the Oxford Dramatic Society
will produce every summer for us some noble play like _Henry IV_., For,
in plays of this kind, plays which deal with bygone times, there is
always this peculiar charm, that they combine in one exquisite
presentation the passions that are living with the picturesqueness that
is dead., And when we have the modern spirit given to us in an antique
form, the very remoteness of that form can be made a method of increased
realism., This was Shakespeare?s own attitude towards the ancient world,
this is the attitude we in this century should adopt towards his plays,
and with a feeling akin to this it seemed to me that these brilliant
young Oxonians were working., If it was so, their aim is the right one., For while we look to the dramatist to give romance to realism, we ask of
the actor to give realism to romance., In spite of its somewhat alarming title this book may be highly
recommended to every one., As for the authorities the author quotes, they
are almost numberless, and range from Socrates down to Artemus Ward., He
tells us of the wicked bachelor who spoke of marriage as ?a very harmless
amusement?, and advised a young friend of his to ?marry early and marry
often?, ; of Dr. Johnson who proposed that marriage should be arranged by
the Lord Chancellor, without the parties concerned having any choice in
the matter; of the Sussex labourer who asked, ?Why should I give a woman
half my victuals for cooking the other half??, and of Lord Verulam who
thought that unmarried men did the best public work., And, indeed,
marriage is the one subject on which all women agree and all men
disagree., Our author, however, is clearly of the same opinion as the
Scotch lassie who, on her father warning her what a solemn thing it was
to get married, answered, ?I ken that, father, but it?s a great deal
solemner to be single.?, He may be regarded as the champion of the
married life., Indeed, he has a most interesting chapter on marriage-made
men, and though he dissents, and we think rightly, from the view recently
put forward by a lady or two on the Women?s Rights platform that Solomon
owed all his wisdom to the number of his wives, still he appeals to
Bismarck, John Stuart Mill, Mahommed, and Lord Beaconsfield, as instances
of men whose success can be traced to the influence of the women they
married., Archbishop Whately once defined woman as ?a creature that does
not reason and pokes the fire from the top,?, but since his day the higher
education of women has considerably altered their position., Women have
always had an emotional sympathy with those they love; Girton and Newnham
have rendered intellectual sympathy also possible., In our day it is best
for a man to be married, and men must give up the tyranny in married life
which was once so dear to them, and which, we are afraid, lingers still,
here and there., ?Do you wish to be my wife, Mabel??, said a little boy., ?Yes,?, incautiously answered Mabel., ?Then pull off my boots.?, On marriage vows our author has, too, very sensible views and very
amusing stories., He tells of a nervous bridegroom who, confusing the
baptismal and marriage ceremonies, replied when asked if he consented to
take the bride for his wife: ?I renounce them all?, ; of a Hampshire rustic
who, when giving the ring, said solemnly to the bride: ?With my body I
thee wash up, and with all my hurdle goods I thee and thou?, ; of another
who when asked whether he would take his partner to be his wedded wife,
replied with shameful indecision: ?Yes, I?m willin?, ; but I?d a sight
rather have her sister?, ; and of a Scotch lady who, on the occasion of her
daughter?s wedding, was asked by an old friend whether she might
congratulate her on the event, and answered: ?Yes, yes, upon the whole it
is very satisfactory; it is true Jeannie hates her gudeman, but then
there?s always a something!?, Indeed, the good stories contained in this
book are quite endless and make it very pleasant reading, while the good
advice is on all points admirable., Most young married people nowadays start in life with a dreadful
collection of ormolu inkstands covered with sham onyxes, or with a
perfect museum of salt-cellars., We strongly recommend this book as one
of the best of wedding presents., It is a complete handbook to an earthly
Paradise, and its author may be regarded as the Murray of matrimony and
the Baedeker of bliss., Books, I fancy, may be conveniently divided into three classes:

1., Books to read, such as Cicero?s _Letters_, Suetonius, Vasari?s _Lives
of the Painters_, the _Autobiography of Benvenuto Cellini_, Sir John
Mandeville, Marco Polo, St. Simon?s _Memoirs_, Mommsen, and (till we get
a better one) Grote?s _History of Greece_., 2., Books to re-read, such as Plato and Keats: in the sphere of poetry,
the masters not the minstrels; in the sphere of philosophy, the seers not
the _savants_., 3., Books not to read at all, such as Thomson?s _Seasons_, Rogers?s
_Italy_, Paley?s _Evidences_, all the Fathers except St. Augustine, all
John Stuart Mill except the essay on _Liberty_, all Voltaire?s plays
without any exception, Butler?s _Analogy_, Grant?s _Aristotle_, Hume?s
_England_, Lewes?s _History of Philosophy_, all argumentative books and
all books that try to prove anything., The third class is by far the most important., To tell people what to
read is, as a rule, either useless or harmful; for, the appreciation of
literature is a question of temperament not of teaching; to Parnassus
there is no primer and nothing that one can learn is ever worth learning., But to tell people what not to read is a very different matter, and I
venture to recommend it as a mission to the University Extension Scheme., Indeed, it is one that is eminently needed in this age of ours, an age
that reads so much, that it has no time to admire, and writes so much,
that it has no time to think., Whoever will select out of the chaos of
our modern curricula ?The Worst Hundred Books,?, and publish a list of
them, will confer on the rising generation a real and lasting benefit., After expressing these views I suppose I should not offer any suggestions
at all with regard to ?The Best Hundred Books,?, but I hope you will allow
me the pleasure of being inconsistent, as I am anxious to put in a claim
for a book that has been strangely omitted by most of the excellent
judges who have contributed to your columns., I mean the _Greek
Anthology_., The beautiful poems contained in this collection seem to me
to hold the same position with regard to Greek dramatic literature as do
the delicate little figurines of Tanagra to the Phidian marbles, and to
be quite as necessary for the complete understanding of the Greek spirit., I am also amazed to find that Edgar Allan Poe has been passed over., Surely this marvellous lord of rhythmic expression deserves a place?, If,
in order to make room for him, it be necessary to elbow out some one
else, I should elbow out Southey, and I think that Baudelaire might be
most advantageously substituted for Keble., No doubt, both in the _Curse of Kehama_ and in the _Christian Year_ there
are poetic qualities of a certain kind, but absolute catholicity of taste
is not without its dangers., It is only an auctioneer who should admire
all schools of art., Of the many collections of letters that have appeared in this century
few, if any, can rival for fascination of style and variety of incident
the letters of George Sand which have recently been translated into
English by M. Ledos de Beaufort., They extend over a space of more than
sixty years, from 1812 to 1876, in fact, and comprise the first letters
of Aurore Dupin, a child of eight years old, as well as the last letters
of George Sand, a woman of seventy-two., The very early letters, those of
the child and of the young married woman, possess, of course, merely a
psychological interest; but from 1831, the date of Madame Dudevant?s
separation from her husband and her first entry into Paris life, the
interest becomes universal, and the literary and political history of
France is mirrored in every page., For George Sand was an indefatigable correspondent; she longs in one of
her letters, it is true, for ?a planet where reading and writing are
absolutely unknown,?, but still she had a real pleasure in letter-writing., Her greatest delight was the communication of ideas, and she is always in
the heart of the battle., She discusses pauperism with Louis Napoleon in
his prison at Ham, and liberty with Armand Barbes in his dungeon at
Vincennes; she writes to Lamennais on philosophy, to Mazzini on
socialism, to Lamartine on democracy, and to Ledru-Rollin on justice., Her letters reveal to us not merely the life of a great novelist but the
soul of a great woman, of a woman who was one with all the noblest
movements of her day and whose sympathy with humanity was boundless
absolutely., ...]"|2
5|"[We may not at first gain from his works that artistic unity of
impression which is Tourgenieff?s chief charm, but once that we have
mastered the details the whole seems to have the grandeur and the
simplicity of an epic., Dostoieffski differs widely from both his rivals., He is not so fine an artist as Tourgenieff, for he deals more with the
facts than with the effects of life; nor has he Tolstoi?s largeness of
vision and epic dignity; but he has qualities that are distinctively and
absolutely his own, such as a fierce intensity of passion and
concentration of impulse, a power of dealing with the deepest mysteries
of psychology and the most hidden springs of life, and a realism that is
pitiless in its fidelity, and terrible because it is true., Some time ago
we had occasion to draw attention to his marvellous novel _Crime and
Punishment_, where in the haunt of impurity and vice a harlot and an
assassin meet together to read the story of Dives and Lazarus, and the
outcast girl leads the sinner to make atonement for his sin; nor is the
book entitled _Injury and Insult_ at all inferior to that great
masterpiece., Mean and ordinary though the surroundings of the story may
seem, the heroine Natasha is like one of the noble victims of Greek
tragedy; she is Antigone with the passion of Ph?dra, and it is impossible
to approach her without a feeling of awe., Greek also is the gloom of
Nemesis that hangs over each character, only it is a Nemesis that does
not stand outside of life, but is part of our own nature and of the same
material as life itself., Ale?sha, the beautiful young lad whom Natasha
follows to her doom, is a second Tito Melema, and has all Tito?s charm
and grace and fascination., Yet he is different., He would never have
denied Baldassare in the Square at Florence, nor lied to Romola about
Tessa., He has a magnificent, momentary sincerity, a boyish
unconsciousness of all that life signifies, an ardent enthusiasm for all
that life cannot give., There is nothing calculating about him., He never
thinks evil, he only does it., From a psychological point of view he is
one of the most interesting characters of modern fiction, as from an
artistic he is one of the most attractive., As we grow to know him he
stirs strange questions for us, and makes us feel that it is not the
wicked only who do wrong, nor the bad alone who work evil., And by what a subtle objective method does Dostoieffski show us his
characters!, He never tickets them with a list nor labels them with a
description., We grow to know them very gradually, as we know people whom
we meet in society, at first by little tricks of manner, personal
appearance, fancies in dress, and the like; and afterwards by their deeds
and words; and even then they constantly elude us, for though
Dostoieffski may lay bare for us the secrets of their nature, yet he
never explains his personages away; they are always surprising us by
something that they say or do, and keep to the end the eternal mystery of
life., Irrespective of its value as a work of art, this novel possesses a deep
autobiographical interest also, as the character of Vania, the poor
student who loves Natasha through all her sin and shame, is
Dostoieffski?s study of himself., Goethe once had to delay the completion
of one of his novels till experience had furnished him with new
situations, but almost before he had arrived at manhood Dostoieffski knew
life in its most real forms; poverty and suffering, pain and misery,
prison, exile, and love, were soon familiar to him, and by the lips of
Vania he has told his own story., This note of personal feeling, this
harsh reality of actual experience, undoubtedly gives the book something
of its strange fervour and terrible passion, yet it has not made it
egotistic; we see things from every point of view, and we feel, not that
fiction has been trammelled by fact, but that fact itself has become
ideal and imaginative., Pitiless, too, though Dostoieffski is in his
method as an artist, as a man he is full of human pity for all, for those
who do evil as well as for those who suffer it, for the selfish no less
than for those whose lives are wrecked for others and whose sacrifice is
in vain., Since _Adam Bede_ and _Le P?re Goriot_ no more powerful novel
has been written than _Insult and Injury_., To convey ideas through the medium of images has always been the aim of
those who are artists as well as thinkers in literature, and it is to a
desire to give a sensuous environment to intellectual concepts that we
owe Mr. Pater?s last volume., For these Imaginary or, as we should prefer
to call them, Imaginative Portraits of his, form a series of philosophic
studies in which the philosophy is tempered by personality, and the
thought shown under varying conditions of mood and manner, the very
permanence of each principle gaining something through the change and
colour of the life through which it finds expression., The most
fascinating of all these pictures is undoubtedly that of Sebastian Van
Storck., The account of Watteau is perhaps a little too fanciful, and the
description of him as one who was ?always a seeker after something in the
world, that is there in no satisfying measure, or not at all,?, seems to
us more applicable to him who saw Mona Lisa sitting among the rocks than
the gay and debonair _peintre des f?tes galantes_., But Sebastian, the
grave young Dutch philosopher, is charmingly drawn., From the first
glimpse we get of him, skating over the water-meadows with his plume of
squirrel?s tail and his fur muff, in all the modest pleasantness of
boyhood, down to his strange death in the desolate house amid the sands
of the Helder, we seem to see him, to know him, almost to hear the low
music of his voice., He is a dreamer, as the common phrase goes, and yet
he is poetical in this sense, that his theorems shape life for him,
directly., Early in youth he is stirred by a fine saying of Spinoza, and
sets himself to realize the ideal of an intellectual disinterestedness,
separating himself more and more from the transient world of sensation,
accident and even affection, till what is finite and relative becomes of
no interest to him, and he feels that as nature is but a thought of his,
so he himself is but a passing thought of God., This conception, of the
power of a mere metaphysical abstraction over the mind of one so
fortunately endowed for the reception of the sensible world, is
exceedingly delightful, and Mr. Pater has never written a more subtle
psychological study, the fact that Sebastian dies in an attempt to save
the life of a little child giving to the whole story a touch of poignant
pathos and sad irony., _Denys l?Auxerrois_ is suggested by a figure found, or said to be found,
on some old tapestries in Auxerre, the figure of a ?flaxen and flowery
creature, sometimes well-nigh naked among the vine-leaves, sometimes
muffled in skins against the cold, sometimes in the dress of a monk, but
always with a strong impress of real character and incident from the
veritable streets?, of the town itself., From this strange design Mr.
Pater has fashioned a curious medi?val myth of the return of Dionysus
among men, a myth steeped in colour and passion and old romance, full of
wonder and full of worship, Denys himself being half animal and half god,
making the world mad with a new ecstasy of living, stirring the artists
simply by his visible presence, drawing the marvel of music from reed and
pipe, and slain at last in a stage-play by those who had loved him., In
its rich affluence of imagery this story is like a picture by Mantegna,
and indeed Mantegna might have suggested the description of the pageant
in which Denys rides upon a gaily-painted chariot, in soft silken raiment
and, for head-dress, a strange elephant scalp with gilded tusks., If _Denys l?Auxerrois_ symbolizes the passion of the senses and
_Sebastian Van Storck_ the philosophic passion, as they certainly seem to
do, though no mere formula or definition can adequately express the
freedom and variety of the life that they portray, the passion for the
imaginative world of art is the basis of the story of _Duke Carl of
Rosenmold_., Duke Carl is not unlike the late King of Bavaria, in his
love of France, his admiration for the _Grand Monarque_ and his fantastic
desire to amaze and to bewilder, but the resemblance is possibly only a
chance one., In fact Mr. Pater?s young hero is the precursor of the
_Aufkl?rung_ of the last century, the German precursor of Herder and
Lessing and Goethe himself, and finds the forms of art ready to his hand
without any national spirit to fill them or make them vital and
responsive., He too dies, trampled to death by the soldiers of the
country he so much admired, on the night of his marriage with a peasant
girl, the very failure of his life lending him a certain melancholy grace
and dramatic interest., On the whole, then, this is a singularly attractive book., Mr. Pater is
an intellectual impressionist., He does not weary us with any definite
doctrine or seek to suit life to any formal creed., He is always looking
for exquisite moments and, when he has found them, he analyses them with
delicate and delightful art and then passes on, often to the opposite
pole of thought or feeling, knowing that every mood has its own quality
and charm and is justified by its mere existence., He has taken the
sensationalism of Greek philosophy and made it a new method of art
criticism., As for his style, it is curiously ascetic., Now and then, we
come across phrases with a strange sensuousness of expression, as when he
tells us how Denys l?Auxerrois, on his return from a long journey, ?ate
flesh for the first time, tearing the hot, red morsels with his delicate
fingers in a kind of wild greed,?, but such passages are rare., Asceticism
is the keynote of Mr. Pater?s prose; at times it is almost too severe in
its self-control and makes us long for a little more freedom., For
indeed, the danger of such prose as his is that it is apt to become
somewhat laborious., Here and there, one is tempted to say of Mr. Pater
that he is ?a seeker after something in language, that is there in no
satisfying measure, or not at all.?, The continual preoccupation with
phrase and epithet has its drawbacks as well as its virtues., And yet,
when all is said, what wonderful prose it is, with its subtle
preferences, its fastidious purity, its rejection of what is common or
ordinary!, Mr. Pater has the true spirit of selection, the true art of
omission., If he be not among the greatest prose writers of our
literature he is, at least, our greatest artist in prose; and though it
may be admitted that the best style is that which seems an unconscious
result rather than a conscious aim, still in these latter days when
violent rhetoric does duty for eloquence and vulgarity usurps the name of
nature, we should be grateful for a style that deliberately aims at
perfection of form, that seeks to produce its effect by artistic means
and sets before itself an ideal of grave and chastened beauty., The Princess Christian?s translation of the _Memoirs of Wilhelmine_,
_Margravine of Baireuth_, is a most fascinating and delightful book., The
Margravine and her brother, Frederick the Great, were, as the Princess
herself points out in an admirably written introduction, ?among the first
of those questioning minds that strove after spiritual freedom?, in the
last century., ?They had studied,?, says the Princess, ?the English
philosophers, Newton, Locke, and Shaftesbury, and were roused to
enthusiasm by the writings of Voltaire and Rousseau., Their whole lives
bore the impress of the influence of French thought on the burning
questions of the day., In the eighteenth century began that great
struggle of philosophy against tyranny and worn-out abuses which
culminated in the French Revolution., The noblest minds were engaged in
the struggle, and, like most reformers, they pushed their conclusions to
extremes, and too often lost sight of the need of a due proportion in
things., The Margravine?s influence on the intellectual development of
her country is untold., She formed at Baireuth a centre of culture and
learning which had before been undreamt of in Germany.?, The historical value of these _Memoirs_ is, of course, well known., Carlyle speaks of them as being ?by far the best authority?, on the early
life of Frederick the Great., But considered merely as the autobiography
of a clever and charming woman, they are no less interesting, and even
those who care nothing for eighteenth-century politics, and look upon
history itself as an unattractive form of fiction, cannot fail to be
fascinated by the Margravine?s wit, vivacity and humour, by her keen
powers of observation, and by her brilliant and assertive egotism., Not
that her life was by any means a happy one., Her father, to quote the
Princess Christian, ?ruled his family with the same harsh despotism with
which he ruled his country, taking pleasure in making his power felt by
all in the most galling manner,?, and the Margravine and her brother ?had
much to suffer, not only from his ungovernable temper, but also from the
real privations to which they were subjected.?, Indeed, the picture the
Margravine gives of the King is quite extraordinary., ?He despised all
learning,?, she writes, ?and wished me to occupy myself with nothing but
needlework and household duties or details., Had he found me writing or
reading, he would probably have whipped me.?, He ?considered music a
capital offence, and maintained that every one should devote himself to
one object: men to the military service, and women to their household
duties., Science and the arts he counted among the ?seven deadly sins.??, Sometimes he took to religion, ?and then,?, says the Margravine, ?we lived
like trappists, to the great grief of my brother and myself., Every
afternoon the King preached a sermon, to which we had to listen as
attentively as if it proceeded from an Apostle., My brother and I were
often seized with such an intense sense of the ridiculous that we burst
out laughing, upon which an apostolic curse was poured out on our heads,
which we had to accept with a show of humility and penitence.?, Economy
and soldiers were his only topics of conversation; his chief social
amusement was to make his guests intoxicated; and as for his temper, the
accounts the Margravine gives of it would be almost incredible if they
were not amply corroborated from other sources., Suetonius has written of
the strange madness that comes on kings, but even in his melodramatic
chronicles there is hardly anything that rivals what the Margravine has
to tell us., Here is one of her pictures of family life at a Royal Court
in the last century, and it is not by any means the worst scene she
describes:

Yet, as the Princess Christian remarks, ?despite the almost cruel
treatment Wilhelmine received from her father, it is noticeable that
throughout her memoirs she speaks of him with the greatest affection., She makes constant reference to his ?good heart??, ; and says that his
faults ?were more those of temper than of nature.?, Nor could all the
misery and wretchedness of her home life dull the brightness of her
intellect., What would have made others morbid, made her satirical., Instead of weeping over her own personal tragedies, she laughs at the
general comedy of life., Here, for instance, is her description of Peter
the Great and his wife, who arrived at Berlin in 1718:

Nor are the Margravine?s descriptions of her reception as a bride in the
principality of Baireuth less amusing., Hof was the first town she came
to, and a deputation of nobles was waiting there to welcome her., This is
her account of them:

As for Baireuth itself, and its petty Court, the picture she gives of it
is exceedingly curious., Her father-in-law, the reigning Margrave, was a
narrow-minded mediocrity, whose conversation ?resembled that of a sermon
read aloud for the purpose of sending the listener to sleep,?, and he had
only two topics, Telemachus, and Amelot de la Houssaye?s _Roman History_., The Ministers, from Baron von Stein, who always said ?yes?, to everything,
to Baron von Voit, who always said ?no,?, were not by any means an
intellectual set of men., ?Their chief amusement,?, says the Margravine,
?was drinking from morning till night,?, ...]"|2
6|"[Sappho was undoubtedly a far more flawless and perfect artist., She
stirred the whole antique world more than Mrs. Browning ever stirred our
modern age., Never had Love such a singer., Even in the few lines that
remain to us the passion seems to scorch and burn., But, as unjust Time,
who has crowned her with the barren laurels of fame, has twined with them
the dull poppies of oblivion, let us turn from the mere memory of a
poetess to one whose song still remains to us as an imperishable glory to
our literature; to her who heard the cry of the children from dark mine
and crowded factory, and made England weep over its little ones; who, in
the feigned sonnets from the Portuguese, sang of the spiritual mystery of
Love, and of the intellectual gifts that Love brings to the soul; who had
faith in all that is worthy, and enthusiasm for all that is great, and
pity for all that suffers; who wrote the _Vision of Poets_ and _Casa
Guidi Windows_ and _Aurora Leigh_., As one, to whom I owe my love of poetry no less than my love of country,
said of her:

She lives indeed, and not alone in the heart of Shakespeare?s England,
but in the heart of Dante?s Italy also., To Greek literature she owed her
scholarly culture, but modern Italy created her human passion for
Liberty., When she crossed the Alps she became filled with a new ardour,
and from that fine, eloquent mouth, that we can still see in her
portraits, broke forth such a noble and majestic outburst of lyrical song
as had not been heard from woman?s lips for more than two thousand years., It is pleasant to think that an English poetess was to a certain extent a
real factor in bringing about that unity of Italy that was Dante?s dream,
and if Florence drove her great singer into exile, she at least welcomed
within her walls the later singer that England had sent to her., If one were asked the chief qualities of Mrs. Browning?s work, one would
say, as Mr. Swinburne said of Byron?s, its sincerity and its strength., Faults it, of course, possesses., ?She would rhyme moon to table,?, used
to be said of her in jest; and certainly no more monstrous rhymes are to
be found in all literature than some of those we come across in Mrs.
Browning?s poems., But her ruggedness was never the result of
carelessness., It was deliberate, as her letters to Mr. Horne show very
clearly., She refused to sandpaper her muse., She disliked facile
smoothness and artificial polish., In her very rejection of art she was
an artist., She intended to produce a certain effect by certain means,
and she succeeded; and her indifference to complete assonance in rhyme
often gives a splendid richness to her verse, and brings into it a
pleasurable element of surprise., In philosophy she was a Platonist, in politics an Opportunist., She
attached herself to no particular party., She loved the people when they
were king-like, and kings when they showed themselves to be men., Of the
real value and motive of poetry she had a most exalted idea., ?Poetry,?, she says, in the preface of one of her volumes, ?has been as serious a
thing to me as life itself; and life has been a very serious thing., There has been no playing at skittles for me in either., I never mistook
pleasure for the final cause of poetry, nor leisure for the hour of the
poet., I have done my work so far, not as mere hand and head work apart
from the personal being, but as the completest expression of that being
to which I could attain.?, It certainly is her completest expression, and through it she realizes
her fullest perfection., ?The poet,?, she says elsewhere, ?is at once
richer and poorer than he used to be; he wears better broadcloth, but
speaks no more oracles.?, These words give us the keynote to her view of
the poet?s mission., He was to utter Divine oracles, to be at once
inspired prophet and holy priest; and as such we may, I think, without
exaggeration, conceive her., She was a Sibyl delivering a message to the
world, sometimes through stammering lips, and once at least with blinded
eyes, yet always with the true fire and fervour of lofty and unshaken
faith, always with the great raptures of a spiritual nature, the high
ardours of an impassioned soul., As we read her best poems we feel that,
though Apollo?s shrine be empty and the bronze tripod overthrown, and the
vale of Delphi desolate, still the Pythia is not dead., In our own age
she has sung for us, and this land gave her new birth., Indeed, Mrs.
Browning is the wisest of the Sibyls, wiser even than that mighty figure
whom Michael Angelo has painted on the roof of the Sistine Chapel at
Rome, poring over the scroll of mystery, and trying to decipher the
secrets of Fate; for she realized that, while knowledge is power,
suffering is part of knowledge., To her influence, almost as much as to the higher education of women, I
would be inclined to attribute the really remarkable awakening of woman?s
song that characterizes the latter half of our century in England., No
country has ever had so many poetesses at once., Indeed, when one
remembers that the Greeks had only nine muses, one is sometimes apt to
fancy that we have too many., And yet the work done by women in the
sphere of poetry is really of a very high standard of excellence., In
England we have always been prone to underrate the value of tradition in
literature., In our eagerness to find a new voice and a fresh mode of
music, we have forgotten how beautiful Echo may be., We look first for
individuality and personality, and these are, indeed, the chief
characteristics of the masterpieces of our literature, either in prose or
verse; but deliberate culture and a study of the best models, if united
to an artistic temperament and a nature susceptible of exquisite
impressions, may produce much that is admirable, much that is worthy of
praise., It would be quite impossible to give a complete catalogue of all
the women who since Mrs. Browning?s day have tried lute and lyre., Mrs.
Pfeiffer, Mrs. Hamilton King, Mrs. Augusta Webster, Graham Tomson, Miss
Mary Robinson, Jean Ingelow, Miss May Kendall, Miss Nesbit, Miss May
Probyn, Mrs. Craik, Mrs. Meynell, Miss Chapman, and many others have done
really good work in poetry, either in the grave Dorian mode of thoughtful
and intellectual verse, or in the light and graceful forms of old French
song, or in the romantic manner of antique ballad, or in that ?moment?s
monument,?, as Rossetti called it, the intense and concentrated sonnet., Occasionally one is tempted to wish that the quick, artistic faculty that
women undoubtedly possess developed itself somewhat more in prose and
somewhat less in verse., Poetry is for our highest moods, when we wish to
be with the gods, and in our poetry nothing but the very best should
satisfy us; but prose is for our daily bread, and the lack of good prose
is one of the chief blots on our culture., French prose, even in the
hands of the most ordinary writers, is always readable, but English prose
is detestable., We have a few, a very few, masters, such as they are., We
have Carlyle, who should not be imitated; and Mr. Pater, who, through the
subtle perfection of his form, is inimitable absolutely; and Mr. Froude,
who is useful; and Matthew Arnold, who is a model; and Mr. George
Meredith, who is a warning; and Mr. Lang, who is the divine amateur; and
Mr. Stevenson, who is the humane artist; and Mr. Ruskin, whose rhythm and
colour and fine rhetoric and marvellous music of words are entirely
unattainable., But the general prose that one reads in magazines and in
newspapers is terribly dull and cumbrous, heavy in movement and uncouth
or exaggerated in expression., Possibly some day our women of letters
will apply themselves more definitely to prose., Their light touch, and exquisite ear, and delicate sense of balance and
proportion would be of no small service to us., I can fancy women
bringing a new manner into our literature., However, we have to deal here with women as poetesses, and it is
interesting to note that, though Mrs. Browning?s influence undoubtedly
contributed very largely to the development of this new song-movement, if
I may so term it, still there seems to have been never a time during the
last three hundred years when the women of this kingdom did not
cultivate, if not the art, at least the habit, of writing poetry., Who the first English poetess was I cannot say., I believe it was the
Abbess Juliana Berners, who lived in the fifteenth century; but I have no
doubt that Mr. Freeman would be able at a moment?s notice to produce some
wonderful Saxon or Norman poetess, whose works cannot be read without a
glossary, and even with its aid are completely unintelligible., For my
own part, I am content with the Abbess Juliana, who wrote
enthusiastically about hawking; and after her I would mention Anne Askew,
who in prison and on the eve of her fiery martyrdom wrote a ballad that
has, at any rate, a pathetic and historical interest., Queen Elizabeth?s
?most sweet and sententious ditty?, on Mary Stuart is highly praised by
Puttenham, a contemporary critic, as an example of ?Exargasia, or the
Gorgeous in Literature,?, which somehow seems a very suitable epithet for
such a great Queen?s poems., The term she applies to the unfortunate
Queen of Scots, ?the daughter of debate,?, has, of course, long since
passed into literature., The Countess of Pembroke, Sir Philip Sidney?s
sister, was much admired as a poetess in her day., In 1613 the ?learned, virtuous, and truly noble ladie,?, Elizabeth Carew,
published a _Tragedie of Marian_, _the Faire Queene of Jewry_, and a few
years later the ?noble ladie Diana Primrose?, wrote _A Chain of Pearl_,
which is a panegyric on the ?peerless graces?, of Gloriana., Mary Morpeth,
the friend and admirer of Drummond of Hawthornden; Lady Mary Wroth, to
whom Ben Jonson dedicated _The Alchemist_; and the Princess Elizabeth,
the sister of Charles I., should also be mentioned., After the Restoration women applied themselves with still greater ardour
to the study of literature and the practice of poetry., Margaret, Duchess
of Newcastle, was a true woman of letters, and some of her verses are
extremely pretty and graceful., Mrs. Aphra Behn was the first
Englishwoman who adopted literature as a regular profession., Mrs.
Katharine Philips, according to Mr. Gosse, invented sentimentality., As
she was praised by Dryden, and mourned by Cowley, let us hope she may be
forgiven., Keats came across her poems at Oxford when he was writing
_Endymion_, and found in one of them ?a most delicate fancy of the
Fletcher kind?, ; but I fear nobody reads the Matchless Orinda now., Of
Lady Winchelsea?s _Nocturnal Reverie_ Wordsworth said that, with the
exception of Pope?s _Windsor Forest_, it was the only poem of the period
intervening between _Paradise Lost_ and Thomson?s _Seasons_ that
contained a single new image of external nature., Lady Rachel Russell,
who may be said to have inaugurated the letter-writing literature of
England; Eliza Haywood, who is immortalized by the badness of her work,
and has a niche in _The Dunciad_; and the Marchioness of Wharton, whose
poems Waller said he admired, are very remarkable types, the finest of
them being, of course, the first named, who was a woman of heroic mould
and of a most noble dignity of nature., Indeed, though the English poetesses up to the time of Mrs. Browning
cannot be said to have produced any work of absolute genius, they are
certainly interesting figures, fascinating subjects for study., Amongst
them we find Lady Mary Wortley Montague, who had all the caprice of
Cleopatra, and whose letters are delightful reading; Mrs. Centlivre, who
wrote one brilliant comedy; Lady Anne Barnard, whose _Auld Robin Gray_
was described by Sir Walter Scott as ?worth all the dialogues Corydon and
Phillis have together spoken from the days of Theocritus downwards,?, and
is certainly a very beautiful and touching poem; Esther Vanhomrigh and
Hester Johnson, the Vanessa and the Stella of Dean Swift?s life; Mrs.
Thrale, the friend of the great lexicographer; the worthy Mrs. Barbauld;
the excellent Miss Hannah More; the industrious Joanna Baillie; the
admirable Mrs. Chapone, whose _Ode to Solitude_ always fills me with the
wildest passion for society, and who will at least be remembered as the
patroness of the establishment at which Becky Sharp was educated; Miss
Anna Seward, who was called ?The Swan of Lichfield?, ; poor L. E. L. whom
Disraeli described in one of his clever letters to his sister as ?the
personification of Brompton?pink satin dress, white satin shoes, red
cheeks, snub nose, and her hair _?, la_ Sappho?, ; Mrs. Ratcliffe, who
introduced the romantic novel, and has consequently much to answer for;
the beautiful Duchess of Devonshire, of whom Gibbon said that she was
?made for something better than a Duchess?, ; the two wonderful sisters,
Lady Dufferin and Mrs. Norton; Mrs. Tighe, whose _Psyche_ Keats read with
pleasure; Constantia Grierson, a marvellous blue-stocking in her time;
Mrs. Hemans; pretty, charming ?Perdita,?, who flirted alternately with
poetry and the Prince Regent, played divinely in the _Winter?s Tale_, was
brutally attacked by Gifford, and has left us a pathetic little poem on a
Snowdrop; and Emily Bront?, whose poems are instinct with tragic power,
and seem often on the verge of being great., Old fashions in literature are not so pleasant as old fashions in dress., I like the costume of the age of powder better than the poetry of the age
of Pope., But if one adopts the historical standpoint?and this is,
indeed, the only standpoint from which we can ever form a fair estimate
of work that is not absolutely of the highest order?we cannot fail to see
that many of the English poetesses who preceded Mrs. Browning were women
of no ordinary talent, and that if the majority of them looked upon
poetry simply as a department of _belles lettres_, so in most cases did
their contemporaries., Since Mrs. Browning?s day our woods have become
full of singing birds, and if I venture to ask them to apply themselves
more to prose and less to song, it is not that I like poetical prose, but
that I love the prose of poets., There are certain problems in arch?ology that seem to possess a real
romantic interest, and foremost among these is the question of the
so-called Venus of Melos., Who is she, this marble mutilated goddess whom
Gautier loved, to whom Heine bent his knee?, What sculptor wrought her,
and for what shrine?, Whose hands walled her up in that rude niche where
the Melian peasant found her?, What symbol of her divinity did she carry?, Was it apple of gold or shield of bronze?, Where is her city and what was
her name among gods and men?, The last writer on this fascinating subject
is Mr. Stillman, who in a most interesting book recently published in
America, claims that the work of art in question is no sea-born and
foam-born Aphrodite, but the very Victory Without Wings that once stood
in the little chapel outside the gates of the Acropolis at Athens., ...]"|2
7|"[When we get to Cicero?s discussions on
the nature of the soul, or Virgil?s fine descriptions, my mind is filled
up., Life is either a dull round of eating, drinking, and sleeping, or a
spark of ethereal fire just kindled., ., ., ., The character of girls must
depend upon their reading as much as upon the company they keep., Besides
the intrinsic pleasure to be derived from solid knowledge, a woman ought
to consider it as her best resource against poverty.?, This is a somewhat
caustic aphorism: ?A romantic woman is a troublesome friend, as she
expects you to be as impudent as herself, and is mortified at what she
calls coldness and insensibility.?, And this is admirable: ?The art of
life is not to estrange oneself from society, and yet not to pay too dear
for it.?, This, too, is good: ?Vanity, like curiosity, is wanted as a
stimulus to exertion; indolence would certainly get the better of us if
it were not for these two powerful principles?, ; and there is a keen touch
of humour in the following: ?Nothing is so gratifying as the idea that
virtue and philanthropy are becoming fashionable.?, Dr. James Martineau,
in a letter to Mrs. Ross, gives us a pleasant picture of the old lady
returning from market ?weighted by her huge basket, with the shank of a
leg of mutton thrust out to betray its contents,?, and talking divinely
about philosophy, poets, politics, and every intellectual topic of the
day., She was a woman of admirable good sense, a type of Roman matron,
and quite as careful as were the Roman matrons to keep up the purity of
her native tongue., Mrs. Taylor, however, was more or less limited to Norwich., Mrs. Austin
was for the world., In London, Paris, and Germany, she ruled and
dominated society, loved by every one who knew her., ?She is ?My best and
brightest?, to Lord Jeffrey; ?Dear, fair and wise?, to Sydney Smith; ?My
great ally?, to Sir James Stephen; ?Sunlight through waste weltering
chaos?, to Thomas Carlyle (while he needed her aid); ?La petite m?re du
genre humain?, to Michael Chevalier; ?Liebes M?tterlein?, to John Stuart
Mill; and ?My own Professorin?, to Charles Buller, to whom she taught
German, as well as to the sons of Mr. James Mill.?, Jeremy Bentham, when
on his deathbed, gave her a ring with his portrait and some of his hair
let in behind., ?There, my dear,?, he said, ?it is the only ring I ever
gave a woman.?, She corresponded with Guizot, Barthelemy de St. Hilaire,
the Grotes, Dr. Whewell, the Master of Trinity, Nassau Senior, the
Duchesse d?Orl?ans, Victor Cousin, and many other distinguished people., Her translation of Ranke?s _History of the Popes_ is admirable; indeed,
all her literary work was thoroughly well done, and her edition of her
husband?s _Province of Jurisprudence_ deserves the very highest praise., Two people more unlike than herself and her husband it would have been
difficult to find., He was habitually grave and despondent; she was
brilliantly handsome, fond of society, in which she shone, and ?with an
almost superabundance of energy and animal spirits,?, Mrs. Ross tells us., She married him because she thought him perfect, but he never produced
the work of which he was worthy, and of which she knew him to be worthy., Her estimate of him in the preface to the _Jurisprudence_ is wonderfully
striking and simple., ?He was never sanguine., He was intolerant of any
imperfection., He was always under the control of severe love of truth., He lived and died a poor man.?, She was terribly disappointed in him, but
she loved him., Some years after his death, she wrote to M. Guizot:

The most interesting letters in the book are certainly those to M.
Guizot, with whom she maintained the closest intellectual friendship; but
there is hardly one of them that does not contain something clever, or
thoughtful, or witty, while those addressed to her, in turn, are very
interesting., Carlyle writes her letters full of lamentations, the wail
of a Titan in pain, superbly exaggerated for literary effect., Henri Beyle (Stendhal), the great, I am often tempted to think the
greatest of French novelists, writes her a charming letter about
_nuances_., ?It seems to me,?, he says, ?that except when they read
Shakespeare, Byron, or Sterne, no Englishman understands ?_nuances_?, ; we
adore them., A fool says to a woman ?I love you?, ; the words mean nothing,
he might as well say ?Olli Batachor?, ; it is the _nuance_ which gives
force to the meaning.?, In 1839 Mrs. Austin writes to Victor Cousin: ?I
have seen young Gladstone, a distinguished Tory who wants to re-establish
education based on the Church in quite a Catholic form?, ; and we find her
corresponding with Mr. Gladstone on the subject of education., ?If you
are strong enough to provide motives and checks,?, she says to him, ?you
may do two blessed acts?reform your clergy and teach your people., As it
is, how few of them conceive what it is to teach a people?!, Mr.
Gladstone replies at great length, and in many letters, from which we may
quote this passage:

Lord Jeffrey has a very curious and suggestive letter on popular
education, in which he denies, or at least doubts, the effect of this
education on morals., He, however, supports it on the ground ?that it
will increase the enjoyment of individuals,?, which is certainly a very
sensible claim., Humboldt writes to her about an old Indian language
which was preserved by a parrot, the tribe who spoke it having been
exterminated, and about ?young Darwin,?, who had just published his first
book., Here are some extracts from her own letters:

In politics Mrs. Austin was a philosophical Tory., Radicalism she
detested, and she and most of her friends seem to have regarded it as
moribund., ?The Radical party is evidently effete,?, she writes to M.
Victor Cousin; the probable ?leader of the Tory party?, is Mr. Gladstone., ?The people must be instructed, must be guided, must be, in short,
governed,?, she writes elsewhere; and in a letter to Dr. Whewell, she says
that the state of things in France fills ?me with the deepest anxiety on
one point,?the point on which the permanency of our institutions and our
salvation as a nation turn., Are our higher classes able to keep the lead
of the rest?, If they are, we are safe; if not, I agree with my poor dear
Charles Buller?_our_ turn must come., Now Cambridge and Oxford must
really look to this.?, The belief in the power of the Universities to
stem the current of democracy is charming., She grew to regard Carlyle as
?one of the dissolvents of the age?as mischievous as his extravagances
will let him be?, ; speaks of Kingsley and Maurice as ?pernicious?, ; and
talks of John Stuart Mill as a ?demagogue.?, She was no _doctrinaire_., ?One ounce of education demanded is worth a pound imposed., It is no use
to give the meat before you give the hunger.?, She was delighted at a
letter of St. Hilaire?s, in which he said, ?We have a system and no
results; you have results and no system.?, Yet she had a deep sympathy
with the wants of the people., She was horrified at something Babbage
told her of the population of some of the manufacturing towns who are
_worked out_ before they attain to thirty years of age., ?But I am
persuaded that the remedy will not, cannot come from the people,?, she
adds., Many of her letters are concerned with the question of the higher
education of women., She discusses Buckle?s lecture on ?The Influence of
Women upon the Progress of Knowledge,?, admits to M. Guizot that women?s
intellectual life is largely coloured by the emotions, but adds: ?One is
not precisely a fool because one?s opinions are greatly influenced by
one?s affections., The opinions of men are often influenced by worse
things.?, Dr. Whewell consults her about lecturing women on Plato, being
slightly afraid lest people should think it ridiculous; Comte writes her
elaborate letters on the relation of women to progress; and Mr. Gladstone
promises that Mrs. Gladstone will carry out at Hawarden the suggestions
contained in one of her pamphlets., She was always very practical, and
never lost her admiration for plain sewing., All through the book we come across interesting and amusing things., She
gets St. Hilaire to order a large, sensible bonnet for her in Paris,
which was at once christened the ?Aristotelian,?, and was supposed to be
the only useful bonnet in England., Grote has to leave Paris after the
_coup d?, ?tat_, he tells her, because he cannot bear to see the
establishment of a Greek tyrant., Alfred de Vigny, Macaulay, John
Stirling, Southey, Alexis de Tocqueville, Hallam, and Jean Jacques Amp?re
all contribute to these pleasant pages., She seems to have inspired the
warmest feelings of friendship in those who knew her., Guizot writes to
her: ?Madame de Sta?l used to say that the best thing in the world was a
serious Frenchman., I turn the compliment, and say that the best thing in
the world is an affectionate Englishman., How much more an Englishwoman!, Given equal qualities, a woman is always more charming than a man.?, Lucie Austin, afterwards Lady Duff Gordon, was born in 1821., Her chief
playfellow was John Stuart Mill, and Jeremy Bentham?s garden was her
playground., ...]"|2

standin?, quite still by the rock there in t?, path under Rydal, and folks
could hear sounds like a wild beast coming from the rocks, and childer
were scared fit to be dead a?most.?, But the corroboration comes in strange guise., Mr. Rawnsley asked one of
the Dalesmen about Wordsworth?s dress and habits., This was the reply:
?Wudsworth wore a Jem Crow, never seed him in a boxer in my life,?a Jem
Crow and an old blue cloak was his rig, and _as for his habits_, _he had
noan_; niver knew him with a pot i?, his hand, or a pipe i?, his mouth., But he was a gre?t skater, for a?, that?noan better in these parts?why, he
could cut his own na?me upo?, the ice, could Mr., Wudsworth.?, Skating
seems to have been Wordsworth?s one form of amusement., He was ?over
feckless i?, his hands?, ?could not drive or ride?, ?not a bit of fish in
him,?, and ?nowt of a mountaineer.?, But he could skate., The rapture of
the time when, as a boy, on Esthwaite?s frozen lake, he had

was continued, Mr. Rawnsley tells us, into manhood?s later day; and Mr.
Rawnsley found many proofs that the skill the poet had gained, when

was of such a kind as to astonish the natives among whom he dwelt., The
recollection of a fall he once had, when his skate caught on a stone,
still lingers in the district., A boy had been sent to sweep the snow
from the White Moss Tarn for him., ?Did Mr. Wudsworth gie ye owt??, he was
asked, when he returned from his labour., ?Na, but I seed him tumlle,
though!?, was the answer., ?He was a ter?ble girt skater, was Wudsworth
now,?, says one of Mr. Rawnsley?s informants; ?he would put one hand i?, his breast (he wore a frill shirt i?, them days), and t?, other hand i?, his
waistband, same as shepherds does to keep their hands warm, and he would
stand up straight and sway and swing away grandly.?, Of his poetry they did not think much, and whatever was good in it they
ascribed to his wife, his sister, and Hartley Coleridge., He wrote
poetry, they said, ?because he couldn?t help it?because it was his
hobby?, ?for sheer love, and not for money., They could not understand his
doing work ?for nowt,?, and held his occupation in somewhat light esteem
because it did not bring in ?a deal o?, brass to the pocket.?, ?Did you
ever read his poetry, or see any books about in the farmhouses??, asked
Mr. Rawnsley., The answer was curious: ?Ay, ay, time or two., But ya?re
weel aware there?s potry and potry., There?s potry wi?, a li?le bit
pleasant in it, and potry sic as a man can laugh at or the childer
understand, and some as takes a deal of mastery to make out what?s said,
and a deal of Wudsworth?s was this sort, ye kna., You could tell fra the
man?s faace his potry would niver have no laugh in it., His potry was
quite different work from li?le Hartley., Hartley ?ud goa running along
beside o?, the brooks and mak his, and goa in the first oppen door and
write what he had got upo?, paper., But Wudsworth?s potry was real hard
stuff, and bided a deal of makking, and he?d keep it in his head for long
enough., Eh, but it?s queer, mon, different ways folks hes of making
potry now., ., ., ., Not but what Mr. Wudsworth didn?t stand very high, and
was a well-spoken man enough.?, The best criticism on Wordsworth that Mr.
Rawnsley heard was this: ?He was an open-air man, and a great critic of
trees.?, There are many useful and well-written essays in Professor Knight?s
volume, but Mr. Rawnsley?s is far the most interesting of all., It gives
us a graphic picture of the poet as he appeared in outward semblance and
manner to those about whom he wrote., Mr. Swinburne once set his age on fire by a volume of very perfect and
very poisonous poetry., Then he became revolutionary and pantheistic, and
cried out against those that sit in high places both in heaven and on
earth., Then he invented Marie Stuart and laid upon us the heavy burden
of _Bothwell_., Then he retired to the nursery and wrote poems about
children of a somewhat over-subtle character., He is now extremely
patriotic, and manages to combine with his patriotism a strong affection
for the Tory party., He has always been a great poet., But he has his
limitations, the chief of which is, curiously enough, the entire lack of
any sense of limit., His song is nearly always too loud for his subject., His magnificent rhetoric, nowhere more magnificent than in the volume
that now lies before us, conceals rather than reveals., It has been said
of him, and with truth, that he is a master of language, but with still
greater truth it may be said that Language is his master., Words seem to
dominate him., Alliteration tyrannizes over him., Mere sound often
becomes his lord., He is so eloquent that whatever he touches becomes
unreal., Let us turn to the poem on the Armada:

Somehow we seem to have heard all this before., Does it come from the
fact that of all the poets who ever lived Mr. Swinburne is the one who is
the most limited in imagery?, It must be admitted that he is so., He has
wearied us with his monotony., ?Fire?, and the ?Sea?, are the two words
ever on his lips., We must confess also that this shrill
singing?marvellous as it is?leaves us out of breath., Here is a passage
from a poem called _A Word with the Wind_:

Verse of this kind may be justly praised for the sustained strength and
vigour of its metrical scheme., Its purely technical excellence is
extraordinary., But is it more than an oratorical _tour de force_?, Does
it really convey much?, Does it charm?, Could we return to it again and
again with renewed pleasure?, We think not., It seems to us empty., Of course, we must not look to these poems for any revelation of human
life., To be at one with the elements seems to be Mr. Swinburne?s aim., He seeks to speak with the breath of wind and wave., The roar of the fire
is ever in his ears., He puts his clarion to the lips of Spring and bids
her blow, and the Earth wakes from her dreams and tells him her secret., He is the first lyric poet who has tried to make an absolute surrender of
his own personality, and he has succeeded., We hear the song, but we
never know the singer., We never even get near to him., Out of the
thunder and splendour of words he himself says nothing., ...]"|2
9|"[Better to accept a country-house as a gift than to be in debt
to one?s landlady!, On the whole, the patron was an excellent
institution, if not for poetry at least for the poets; ., ., ., every poet
longs for a M?cenas., The two things the Greeks valued most in actors were grace of gesture and
music of voice., Indeed, to gain these virtues their actors used to
subject themselves to a regular course of gymnastics and a particular
regime of diet, health being to the Greeks not merely a quality of art,
but a condition of its production., One should not be too severe on English novels: they are the only
relaxation of the intellectually unemployed., Most modern novels are more remarkable for their crime than for their
culture., Not that a tramp?s mode of life is at all unsuited to the development of
the poetic faculty., Far from it!, He, if any one, should possess that
freedom of mood which is so essential to the artist, for he has no taxes
to pay and no relations to worry him., The man who possesses a permanent
address, and whose name is to be found in the Directory, is necessarily
limited and localized., Only the tramp has absolute liberty of living., Was not Homer himself a vagrant, and did not Thespis go about in a
caravan?, In art as in life the law of heredity holds good., _On est toujours fils
de quelqu?un_., He has succeeded in studying a fine poet without stealing from him?a very
difficult thing to do., Morocco is a sort of paradox among countries, for though it lies westward
of Piccadilly, yet it is purely Oriental in character, and though it is
but three hours?, sail from Europe, yet it makes you feel (to use the
forcible expression of an American writer) as if you had been taken up by
the scruff of the neck and set down in the Old Testament., As children themselves are the perfect flowers of life, so a collection
of the best poems written on children should be the most perfect of all
anthologies., No English poet has written of children with more love and grace and
delicacy [than Herrick]., His _Ode on the Birth of Our Saviour_, his poem
_To His Saviour_, _A Child_: _A Present by a Child_, his _Graces for
Children_, and his many lovely epitaphs on children are all of them
exquisite works of art, simple, sweet and sincere., As the cross-benches form a refuge for those who have no minds to make
up, so those who cannot make up their minds always take to Homeric
studies., Many of our leaders have sulked in their tents with Achilles
after some violent political crisis and, enraged at the fickleness of
fortune, more than one has given up to poetry what was obviously meant
for party., There are two ways of misunderstanding a poem., One is to misunderstand
it and the other to praise it for qualities it does not possess., Most modern calendars mar the sweet simplicity of our lives by reminding
us that each day that passes is the anniversary of some perfectly
uninteresting event., It is true that such aphorisms as

can hardly be said to belong to the very highest order of poetry, still,
they are preferable, on the whole, to the date of Hannah More?s birth, or
of the burning down of Exeter Change, or of the opening of the Great
Exhibition; and though it would be dangerous to make calendars the basis
of Culture, we should all be much improved if we began each day with a
fine passage of English poetry., Even the most uninteresting poet cannot survive bad editing., Prefixed to the Calendar is an introductory note ., ., ., displaying that
intimate acquaintance with Sappho?s lost poems which is the privilege
only of those who are not acquainted with Greek literature., Mediocre critics are usually safe in their generalities; it is in their
reasons and examples that they come so lamentably to grief., All premature panegyrics bring their own punishment upon themselves., No one survives being over-estimated., Henry Wadsworth Longfellow was one of the first true men of letters
America produced, and as such deserves a high place in any history of
American civilization., To a land out of breath in its greed for gain he
showed the example of a life devoted entirely to the study of literature;
his lectures, though not by any means brilliant, were still productive of
much good; he had a most charming and gracious personality, and he wrote
some pretty poems., But his poems are not of the kind that call for
intellectual analysis or for elaborate description or, indeed, for any
serious discussion at all., Though the _Psalm of Life_ be shouted from Maine to California, that
would not make it true poetry., Longfellow has no imitators, for of echoes themselves there are no echoes
and it is only style that makes a school., Poe?s marvellous lines _To Helen_, a poem as beautiful as a Greek gem and
as musical as Apollo?s lute., Good novelists are much rarer than good sons, and none of us would part
readily with Micawber and Mrs. Nickleby., Still, the fact remains that a
man who was affectionate and loving to his children, generous and
warm-hearted to his friends, and whose books are the very bacchanalia of
benevolence, pilloried his parents to make the groundlings laugh, and
this fact every biographer of Dickens should face and, if possible,
explain., No age ever borrows the slang of its predecessor., What we do not know about Shakespeare is a most fascinating subject, and
one that would fill a volume, but what we do know about him is so meagre
and inadequate that when it is collected together the result is rather
depressing., They show a want of knowledge that must be the result of years of study., Rossetti?s was a great personality, and personalities such as his do not
easily survive shilling primers., We are sorry to find an English dramatic critic misquoting Shakespeare,
as we had always been of opinion that this was a privilege reserved
specially for our English actors., Biographies of this kind rob life of much of its dignity and its wonder,
add to death itself a new terror, and make one wish that all art were
anonymous., A pillar of fire to the few who knew him, and of cloud to the many who
knew him not, Dante Gabriel Rossetti lived apart from the gossip and
tittle-tattle of a shallow age., He never trafficked with the merchants
for his soul, nor brought his wares into the market-place for the idle to
gape at., Passionate and romantic though he was, yet there was in his
nature something of high austerity., He loved seclusion, and hated
notoriety, and would have shuddered at the idea that within a few years
after his death he was to make his appearance in a series of popular
biographies, sandwiched between the author of _Pickwick_ and the Great
Lexicographer., We sincerely hope that a few more novels like these will be published, as
the public will then find out that a bad book is very dear at a shilling., The only form of fiction in which real characters do not seem out of
place is history., In novels they are detestable., Shilling literature is always making demands on our credulity without
ever appealing to our imagination., Pathology is rapidly becoming the basis of sensational literature, and in
art, as in politics, there is a great future for monsters., It is only mediocrities and old maids who consider it a grievance to be
misunderstood., As truly religious people are resigned to everything, even to mediocre
poetry, there is no reason at all why Madame Guyon?s verses should not be
popular with a large section of the community., A simile committing suicide is always a depressing spectacle., Such novels as _Scamp_ are possibly more easy to write than they are to
read., We have no doubt that when Bailey wrote to Lord Houghton that
common-sense and gentleness were Keats?s two special characteristics the
worthy Archdeacon meant extremely well, but we prefer the real Keats,
with his passionate wilfulness, his fantastic moods and his fine
inconsistence., Part of Keats?s charm as a man is his fascinating
incompleteness., The Apostolic dictum, that women should not be suffered to teach, is no
longer applicable to a society such as ours, with its solidarity of
interests, its recognition of natural rights, and its universal
education, however suitable it may have been to the Greek cities under
Roman rule., Nothing in the United States struck me more than the fact
that the remarkable intellectual progress of that country is very largely
due to the efforts of American women, who edit many of the most powerful
magazines and newspapers, take part in the discussion of every question
of public interest, and exercise an important influence upon the growth
and tendencies of literature and art., Indeed, the women of America are
the one class in the community that enjoys that leisure which is so
necessary for culture., The men are, as a rule, so absorbed in business,
that the task of bringing some element of form into the chaos of daily
life is left almost entirely to the opposite sex, and an eminent
Bostonian once assured me that in the twentieth century the whole culture
of his country would be in petticoats., By that time, however, it is
probable that the dress of the two sexes will be assimilated, as
similarity of costume always follows similarity of pursuits., The aim of social comedy, in Menander no less than in Sheridan, is to
mirror the manners, not to reform the morals, of its day, and the censure
of the Puritan, whether real or affected, is always out of place in
literary criticism, and shows a want of recognition of the essential
distinction between art and life., After all, it is only the Philistine
who thinks of blaming Jack Absolute for his deception, Bob Acres for his
cowardice, and Charles Surface for his extravagance, and there is very
little use in airing one?s moral sense at the expense of one?s artistic
appreciation., The _?neid_ bears almost the same relation to the _Iliad_ that the
_Idylls of the King_ do to the old Celtic romances of Arthur., Like them
it is full of felicitous modernisms, of exquisite literary echoes and of
delicate and delightful pictures; as Lord Tennyson loves England so did
Virgil love Rome; the pageants of history and the purple of empire are
equally dear to both poets; but neither of them has the grand simplicity
or the large humanity of the early singers, and, as a hero, ?neas is no
less a failure than Arthur., There is always a certain amount of danger in any attempt to cultivate
impossible virtues., As far as the serious presentation of life is concerned, what we require
is more imaginative treatment, greater freedom from theatric language and
theatric convention., It may be questioned, also, whether the consistent
reward of virtue and punishment of wickedness be really the healthiest
ideal for an art that claims to mirror nature., True originality is to be found rather in the use made of a model than in
the rejection of all models and masters., _Dans l?art comme dans la
nature on est toujours fils de quelqu?un_, and we should not quarrel with
the reed if it whispers to us the music of the lyre., A little child once
asked me if it was the nightingale who taught the linnets how to sing., In France they have had one great genius, Balzac, who invented the modern
method of looking at life; and one great artist, Flaubert, who is the
impeccable master of style; and to the influence of these two men we may
trace almost all contemporary French fiction., But in England we have had
no schools worth speaking of., The fiery torch lit by the Bront?s has not
been passed on to other hands; Dickens has influenced only journalism;
Thackeray?s delightful superficial philosophy, superb narrative power,
and clever social satire have found no echoes; nor has Trollope left any
direct successors behind him?a fact which is not much to be regretted,
however, as, admirable though Trollope undoubtedly is for rainy
afternoons and tedious railway journeys, from the point of view of
literature he is merely the perpetual curate of Pudlington Parva., George Meredith?s style is chaos illumined by brilliant flashes of
lightning., As a writer he has mastered everything, except language; as a
novelist he can do everything, except tell a story; as an artist he is
everything, except articulate., Too strange to be popular, too individual
to have imitators, the author of _Richard Feverel_ stands absolutely
alone., It is easy to disarm criticism, but he has disarmed the disciple., He gives us his philosophy through the medium of wit, and is never so
pathetic as when he is humorous., To turn truth into a paradox is not
difficult, but George Meredith makes all his paradoxes truths, and no
Theseus can thread his labyrinth, no ?dipus solve his secret., The most perfect and the most poisonous of all modern French poets once
remarked that a man can live for three days without bread, but that no
one can live for three days without poetry., This, however, can hardly be
said to be a popular view, or one that commends itself to that curiously
uncommon quality which is called common-sense., I fancy that most people,
if they do not actually prefer a salmis to a sonnet, certainly like their
culture to repose on a basis of good cookery., A cynical critic once remarked that no great poet is intelligible and no
little poet worth understanding, but that otherwise poetry is an
admirable thing., This, however, seems to us a somewhat harsh view of the
subject., Little poets are an extremely interesting study., The best of
them have often some new beauty to show us, and though the worst of them
may bore yet they rarely brutalize., It is a curious thing that when minor poets write choruses to a play they
should always consider it necessary to adopt the style and language of a
bad translator., We fear that Mr. Bohn has much to answer for., In one sonnet he makes a distinct attempt to be original and the result
is extremely depressing., ...]"|2
10|"[Your cynicism is simply a pose."", ""Being natural is simply a pose, and the most irritating pose I know,""
cried Lord Henry, laughing; and the two young men went out into the
garden together and ensconced themselves on a long bamboo seat that
stood in the shade of a tall laurel bush., The sunlight slipped over
the polished leaves., In the grass, white daisies were tremulous., After a pause, Lord Henry pulled out his watch., ""I am afraid I must be
going, Basil,"" he murmured, ""and before I go, I insist on your
answering a question I put to you some time ago."", ""What is that?"", said the painter, keeping his eyes fixed on the ground., ""You know quite well."", ""I do not, Harry."", ""Well, I will tell you what it is., I want you to explain to me why you
won't exhibit Dorian Gray's picture., I want the real reason."", ""I told you the real reason."", ""No, you did not., You said it was because there was too much of
yourself in it., Now, that is childish."", ""Harry,"" said Basil Hallward, looking him straight in the face, ""every
portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist, not
of the sitter., The sitter is merely the accident, the occasion., It is
not he who is revealed by the painter; it is rather the painter who, on
the coloured canvas, reveals himself., The reason I will not exhibit
this picture is that I am afraid that I have shown in it the secret of
my own soul."", Lord Henry laughed., ""And what is that?"", he asked., ""I will tell you,"" said Hallward; but an expression of perplexity came
over his face., ""I am all expectation, Basil,"" continued his companion, glancing at him., ""Oh, there is really very little to tell, Harry,"" answered the painter;
""and I am afraid you will hardly understand it., Perhaps you will
hardly believe it."", Lord Henry smiled, and leaning down, plucked a pink-petalled daisy from
the grass and examined it., ""I am quite sure I shall understand it,"" he
replied, gazing intently at the little golden, white-feathered disk,
""and as for believing things, I can believe anything, provided that it
is quite incredible."", The wind shook some blossoms from the trees, and the heavy
lilac-blooms, with their clustering stars, moved to and fro in the
languid air., A grasshopper began to chirrup by the wall, and like a
blue thread a long thin dragon-fly floated past on its brown gauze
wings., Lord Henry felt as if he could hear Basil Hallward's heart
beating, and wondered what was coming., ""The story is simply this,"" said the painter after some time., ""Two
months ago I went to a crush at Lady Brandon's., You know we poor
artists have to show ourselves in society from time to time, just to
remind the public that we are not savages., With an evening coat and a
white tie, as you told me once, anybody, even a stock-broker, can gain
a reputation for being civilized., Well, after I had been in the room
about ten minutes, talking to huge overdressed dowagers and tedious
academicians, I suddenly became conscious that some one was looking at
me., I turned half-way round and saw Dorian Gray for the first time., When our eyes met, I felt that I was growing pale., A curious sensation
of terror came over me., I knew that I had come face to face with some
one whose mere personality was so fascinating that, if I allowed it to
do so, it would absorb my whole nature, my whole soul, my very art
itself., I did not want any external influence in my life., You know
yourself, Harry, how independent I am by nature., I have always been my
own master; had at least always been so, till I met Dorian Gray., Then--but I don't know how to explain it to you., Something seemed to
tell me that I was on the verge of a terrible crisis in my life., I had
a strange feeling that fate had in store for me exquisite joys and
exquisite sorrows., I grew afraid and turned to quit the room., It was
not conscience that made me do so:  it was a sort of cowardice., I take
no credit to myself for trying to escape."", ""Conscience and cowardice are really the same things, Basil., Conscience is the trade-name of the firm., That is all."", ""I don't believe that, Harry, and I don't believe you do either., However, whatever was my motive--and it may have been pride, for I used
to be very proud--I certainly struggled to the door., There, of course,
I stumbled against Lady Brandon., 'You are not going to run away so
soon, Mr., Hallward?', she screamed out., You know her curiously shrill
voice?"", ""Yes; she is a peacock in everything but beauty,"" said Lord Henry,
pulling the daisy to bits with his long nervous fingers., ""I could not get rid of her., She brought me up to royalties, and
people with stars and garters, and elderly ladies with gigantic tiaras
and parrot noses., She spoke of me as her dearest friend., I had only
met her once before, but she took it into her head to lionize me., I
believe some picture of mine had made a great success at the time, at
least had been chattered about in the penny newspapers, which is the
nineteenth-century standard of immortality., Suddenly I found myself
face to face with the young man whose personality had so strangely
stirred me., We were quite close, almost touching., Our eyes met again., It was reckless of me, but I asked Lady Brandon to introduce me to him., Perhaps it was not so reckless, after all., It was simply inevitable., We would have spoken to each other without any introduction., I am sure
of that., Dorian told me so afterwards., He, too, felt that we were
destined to know each other."", ""And how did Lady Brandon describe this wonderful young man?"", asked his
companion., ""I know she goes in for giving a rapid _precis_ of all her
guests., I remember her bringing me up to a truculent and red-faced old
gentleman covered all over with orders and ribbons, and hissing into my
ear, in a tragic whisper which must have been perfectly audible to
everybody in the room, the most astounding details., I simply fled., I
like to find out people for myself., But Lady Brandon treats her guests
exactly as an auctioneer treats his goods., She either explains them
entirely away, or tells one everything about them except what one wants
to know."", ""Poor Lady Brandon!, You are hard on her, Harry!"", said Hallward
listlessly., ""My dear fellow, she tried to found a _salon_, and only succeeded in
opening a restaurant., How could I admire her?, But tell me, what did
she say about Mr. Dorian Gray?"", ""Oh, something like, 'Charming boy--poor dear mother and I absolutely
inseparable., Quite forget what he does--afraid he--doesn't do
anything--oh, yes, plays the piano--or is it the violin, dear Mr., Gray?', Neither of us could help laughing, and we became friends at
once."", ""Laughter is not at all a bad beginning for a friendship, and it is far
the best ending for one,"" said the young lord, plucking another daisy., Hallward shook his head., ""You don't understand what friendship is,
Harry,"" he murmured--""or what enmity is, for that matter., You like
every one; that is to say, you are indifferent to every one."", ""How horribly unjust of you!"", ...]"|2
11|"[There is some answer to you, but I cannot find it., Don't
speak., Let me think., Or, rather, let me try not to think."", For nearly ten minutes he stood there, motionless, with parted lips and
eyes strangely bright., He was dimly conscious that entirely fresh
influences were at work within him., Yet they seemed to him to have
come really from himself., The few words that Basil's friend had said
to him--words spoken by chance, no doubt, and with wilful paradox in
them--had touched some secret chord that had never been touched before,
but that he felt was now vibrating and throbbing to curious pulses., Music had stirred him like that., Music had troubled him many times., But music was not articulate., It was not a new world, but rather
another chaos, that it created in us., Words!, Mere words!, How
terrible they were!, How clear, and vivid, and cruel!, One could not
escape from them., And yet what a subtle magic there was in them!, They
seemed to be able to give a plastic form to formless things, and to
have a music of their own as sweet as that of viol or of lute., Mere
words!, Was there anything so real as words?, Yes; there had been things in his boyhood that he had not understood., He understood them now., Life suddenly became fiery-coloured to him., It seemed to him that he had been walking in fire., Why had he not
known it?, With his subtle smile, Lord Henry watched him., He knew the precise
psychological moment when to say nothing., He felt intensely
interested., He was amazed at the sudden impression that his words had
produced, and, remembering a book that he had read when he was sixteen,
a book which had revealed to him much that he had not known before, he
wondered whether Dorian Gray was passing through a similar experience., He had merely shot an arrow into the air., Had it hit the mark?, How
fascinating the lad was!, Hallward painted away with that marvellous bold touch of his, that had
the true refinement and perfect delicacy that in art, at any rate comes
only from strength., He was unconscious of the silence., ""Basil, I am tired of standing,"" cried Dorian Gray suddenly., ""I must
go out and sit in the garden., The air is stifling here."", ""My dear fellow, I am so sorry., When I am painting, I can't think of
anything else., But you never sat better., You were perfectly still., And I have caught the effect I wanted--the half-parted lips and the
bright look in the eyes., I don't know what Harry has been saying to
you, but he has certainly made you have the most wonderful expression., I suppose he has been paying you compliments., You mustn't believe a
word that he says."", ""He has certainly not been paying me compliments., Perhaps that is the
reason that I don't believe anything he has told me."", ""You know you believe it all,"" said Lord Henry, looking at him with his
dreamy languorous eyes., ""I will go out to the garden with you., It is
horribly hot in the studio., Basil, let us have something iced to
drink, something with strawberries in it."", ""Certainly, Harry., Just touch the bell, and when Parker comes I will
tell him what you want., I have got to work up this background, so I
will join you later on., Don't keep Dorian too long., I have never been
in better form for painting than I am to-day., This is going to be my
masterpiece., It is my masterpiece as it stands."", Lord Henry went out to the garden and found Dorian Gray burying his
face in the great cool lilac-blossoms, feverishly drinking in their
perfume as if it had been wine., He came close to him and put his hand
upon his shoulder., ""You are quite right to do that,"" he murmured., ""Nothing can cure the soul but the senses, just as nothing can cure the
senses but the soul."", The lad started and drew back., He was bareheaded, and the leaves had
tossed his rebellious curls and tangled all their gilded threads., There was a look of fear in his eyes, such as people have when they are
suddenly awakened., His finely chiselled nostrils quivered, and some
hidden nerve shook the scarlet of his lips and left them trembling., ""Yes,"" continued Lord Henry, ""that is one of the great secrets of
life--to cure the soul by means of the senses, and the senses by means
of the soul., You are a wonderful creation., You know more than you
think you know, just as you know less than you want to know."", Dorian Gray frowned and turned his head away., He could not help liking
the tall, graceful young man who was standing by him., His romantic,
olive-coloured face and worn expression interested him., There was
something in his low languid voice that was absolutely fascinating., His cool, white, flowerlike hands, even, had a curious charm., They
moved, as he spoke, like music, and seemed to have a language of their
own., But he felt afraid of him, and ashamed of being afraid., Why had
it been left for a stranger to reveal him to himself?, He had known
Basil Hallward for months, but the friendship between them had never
altered him., Suddenly there had come some one across his life who
seemed to have disclosed to him life's mystery., And, yet, what was
there to be afraid of?, He was not a schoolboy or a girl., It was
absurd to be frightened., ""Let us go and sit in the shade,"" said Lord Henry., ""Parker has brought
out the drinks, and if you stay any longer in this glare, you will be
quite spoiled, and Basil will never paint you again., You really must
not allow yourself to become sunburnt., It would be unbecoming."", ""What can it matter?"", cried Dorian Gray, laughing, as he sat down on
the seat at the end of the garden., ""It should matter everything to you, Mr., Gray."", ""Why?"", ""Because you have the most marvellous youth, and youth is the one thing
worth having."", ""I don't feel that, Lord Henry."", ""No, you don't feel it now., Some day, when you are old and wrinkled
and ugly, when thought has seared your forehead with its lines, and
passion branded your lips with its hideous fires, you will feel it, you
will feel it terribly., Now, wherever you go, you charm the world., Will it always be so?, ... You have a wonderfully beautiful face, Mr.
Gray., Don't frown., ...]"|2
12|"[""Yes, Basil?"", ""Remember what I asked you, when we were in the garden this morning."", ""I have forgotten it."", ""I trust you."", ""I wish I could trust myself,"" said Lord Henry, laughing., ""Come, Mr.
Gray, my hansom is outside, and I can drop you at your own place., Good-bye, Basil., It has been a most interesting afternoon."", As the door closed behind them, the painter flung himself down on a
sofa, and a look of pain came into his face., At half-past twelve next day Lord Henry Wotton strolled from Curzon
Street over to the Albany to call on his uncle, Lord Fermor, a genial
if somewhat rough-mannered old bachelor, whom the outside world called
selfish because it derived no particular benefit from him, but who was
considered generous by Society as he fed the people who amused him., His father had been our ambassador at Madrid when Isabella was young
and Prim unthought of, but had retired from the diplomatic service in a
capricious moment of annoyance on not being offered the Embassy at
Paris, a post to which he considered that he was fully entitled by
reason of his birth, his indolence, the good English of his dispatches,
and his inordinate passion for pleasure., The son, who had been his
father's secretary, had resigned along with his chief, somewhat
foolishly as was thought at the time, and on succeeding some months
later to the title, had set himself to the serious study of the great
aristocratic art of doing absolutely nothing., He had two large town
houses, but preferred to live in chambers as it was less trouble, and
took most of his meals at his club., He paid some attention to the
management of his collieries in the Midland counties, excusing himself
for this taint of industry on the ground that the one advantage of
having coal was that it enabled a gentleman to afford the decency of
burning wood on his own hearth., In politics he was a Tory, except when
the Tories were in office, during which period he roundly abused them
for being a pack of Radicals., He was a hero to his valet, who bullied
him, and a terror to most of his relations, whom he bullied in turn., Only England could have produced him, and he always said that the
country was going to the dogs., His principles were out of date, but
there was a good deal to be said for his prejudices., When Lord Henry entered the room, he found his uncle sitting in a rough
shooting-coat, smoking a cheroot and grumbling over _The Times_., ""Well,
Harry,"" said the old gentleman, ""what brings you out so early?, I
thought you dandies never got up till two, and were not visible till
five."", ""Pure family affection, I assure you, Uncle George., I want to get
something out of you."", ""Money, I suppose,"" said Lord Fermor, making a wry face., ""Well, sit
down and tell me all about it., Young people, nowadays, imagine that
money is everything."", ""Yes,"" murmured Lord Henry, settling his button-hole in his coat; ""and
when they grow older they know it., But I don't want money., It is only
people who pay their bills who want that, Uncle George, and I never pay
mine., Credit is the capital of a younger son, and one lives charmingly
upon it., Besides, I always deal with Dartmoor's tradesmen, and
consequently they never bother me., What I want is information:  not
useful information, of course; useless information."", ""Well, I can tell you anything that is in an English Blue Book, Harry,
although those fellows nowadays write a lot of nonsense., When I was in
the Diplomatic, things were much better., But I hear they let them in
now by examination., What can you expect?, Examinations, sir, are pure
humbug from beginning to end., If a man is a gentleman, he knows quite
enough, and if he is not a gentleman, whatever he knows is bad for him."", ""Mr. Dorian Gray does not belong to Blue Books, Uncle George,"" said
Lord Henry languidly., ""Mr. Dorian Gray?, Who is he?"", asked Lord Fermor, knitting his bushy
white eyebrows., ""That is what I have come to learn, Uncle George., Or rather, I know
who he is., He is the last Lord Kelso's grandson., His mother was a
Devereux, Lady Margaret Devereux., I want you to tell me about his
mother., What was she like?, Whom did she marry?, You have known nearly
everybody in your time, so you might have known her., I am very much
interested in Mr. Gray at present., I have only just met him."", ""Kelso's grandson!"", echoed the old gentleman., ""Kelso's grandson!, ...
Of course...., I knew his mother intimately., I believe I was at her
christening., She was an extraordinarily beautiful girl, Margaret
Devereux, and made all the men frantic by running away with a penniless
young fellow--a mere nobody, sir, a subaltern in a foot regiment, or
something of that kind., Certainly., I remember the whole thing as if
it happened yesterday., The poor chap was killed in a duel at Spa a few
months after the marriage., There was an ugly story about it., They
said Kelso got some rascally adventurer, some Belgian brute, to insult
his son-in-law in public--paid him, sir, to do it, paid him--and that
the fellow spitted his man as if he had been a pigeon., The thing was
hushed up, but, egad, Kelso ate his chop alone at the club for some
time afterwards., He brought his daughter back with him, I was told,
and she never spoke to him again., Oh, yes; it was a bad business., The
girl died, too, died within a year., So she left a son, did she?, I had
forgotten that., What sort of boy is he?, If he is like his mother, he
must be a good-looking chap."", ""He is very good-looking,"" assented Lord Henry., ""I hope he will fall into proper hands,"" continued the old man., ""He
should have a pot of money waiting for him if Kelso did the right thing
by him., His mother had money, too., All the Selby property came to
her, through her grandfather., Her grandfather hated Kelso, thought him
a mean dog., He was, too., Came to Madrid once when I was there., Egad,
I was ashamed of him., The Queen used to ask me about the English noble
who was always quarrelling with the cabmen about their fares., They
made quite a story of it., I didn't dare show my face at Court for a
month., I hope he treated his grandson better than he did the jarvies."", ""I don't know,"" answered Lord Henry., ""I fancy that the boy will be
well off., He is not of age yet., He has Selby, I know., He told me so., And ... his mother was very beautiful?"", ""Margaret Devereux was one of the loveliest creatures I ever saw,
Harry., What on earth induced her to behave as she did, I never could
understand., She could have married anybody she chose., Carlington was
mad after her., She was romantic, though., All the women of that family
were., The men were a poor lot, but, egad!, the women were wonderful., Carlington went on his knees to her., ...]"|2
13|"[""How late you
are, Harry!"", he murmured., ""I am afraid it is not Harry, Mr. Gray,"" answered a shrill voice., He glanced quickly round and rose to his feet., ""I beg your pardon., I
thought--""

""You thought it was my husband., It is only his wife., You must let me
introduce myself., I know you quite well by your photographs., I think
my husband has got seventeen of them."", ""Not seventeen, Lady Henry?"", ""Well, eighteen, then., And I saw you with him the other night at the
opera."", She laughed nervously as she spoke, and watched him with her
vague forget-me-not eyes., She was a curious woman, whose dresses
always looked as if they had been designed in a rage and put on in a
tempest., She was usually in love with somebody, and, as her passion
was never returned, she had kept all her illusions., She tried to look
picturesque, but only succeeded in being untidy., Her name was
Victoria, and she had a perfect mania for going to church., ""That was at Lohengrin, Lady Henry, I think?"", ""Yes; it was at dear Lohengrin., I like Wagner's music better than
anybody's., It is so loud that one can talk the whole time without other
people hearing what one says., That is a great advantage, don't you
think so, Mr., Gray?"", The same nervous staccato laugh broke from her thin lips, and her
fingers began to play with a long tortoise-shell paper-knife., Dorian smiled and shook his head:  ""I am afraid I don't think so, Lady
Henry., I never talk during music--at least, during good music., If one
hears bad music, it is one's duty to drown it in conversation."", ""Ah!, that is one of Harry's views, isn't it, Mr. Gray?, I always hear
Harry's views from his friends., It is the only way I get to know of
them., But you must not think I don't like good music., I adore it, but
I am afraid of it., It makes me too romantic., I have simply worshipped
pianists--two at a time, sometimes, Harry tells me., I don't know what
it is about them., Perhaps it is that they are foreigners., They all
are, ain't they?, Even those that are born in England become foreigners
after a time, don't they?, It is so clever of them, and such a
compliment to art., Makes it quite cosmopolitan, doesn't it?, You have
never been to any of my parties, have you, Mr. Gray?, You must come., I
can't afford orchids, but I spare no expense in foreigners., They make
one's rooms look so picturesque., But here is Harry!, Harry, I came in
to look for you, to ask you something--I forget what it was--and I
found Mr. Gray here., We have had such a pleasant chat about music., We
have quite the same ideas., No; I think our ideas are quite different., But he has been most pleasant., I am so glad I've seen him."", ""I am charmed, my love, quite charmed,"" said Lord Henry, elevating his
dark, crescent-shaped eyebrows and looking at them both with an amused
smile., ""So sorry I am late, Dorian., I went to look after a piece of
old brocade in Wardour Street and had to bargain for hours for it., Nowadays people know the price of everything and the value of nothing."", ""I am afraid I must be going,"" exclaimed Lady Henry, breaking an
awkward silence with her silly sudden laugh., ""I have promised to drive
with the duchess., Good-bye, Mr. Gray., Good-bye, Harry., You are
dining out, I suppose?, So am I., Perhaps I shall see you at Lady
Thornbury's."", ""I dare say, my dear,"" said Lord Henry, shutting the door behind her
as, looking like a bird of paradise that had been out all night in the
rain, she flitted out of the room, leaving a faint odour of
frangipanni., Then he lit a cigarette and flung himself down on the
sofa., ""Never marry a woman with straw-coloured hair, Dorian,"" he said after a
few puffs., ""Why, Harry?"", ""Because they are so sentimental."", ""But I like sentimental people."", ""Never marry at all, Dorian., Men marry because they are tired; women,
because they are curious:  both are disappointed."", ""I don't think I am likely to marry, Harry., I am too much in love., That is one of your aphorisms., I am putting it into practice, as I do
everything that you say."", ""Who are you in love with?"", asked Lord Henry after a pause., ""With an actress,"" said Dorian Gray, blushing., Lord Henry shrugged his shoulders., ""That is a rather commonplace
_debut_."", ""You would not say so if you saw her, Harry."", ""Who is she?"", ""Her name is Sibyl Vane."", ""Never heard of her."", ""No one has., People will some day, however., She is a genius."", ""My dear boy, no woman is a genius., Women are a decorative sex., They
never have anything to say, but they say it charmingly., Women
represent the triumph of matter over mind, just as men represent the
triumph of mind over morals."", ""Harry, how can you?"", ""My dear Dorian, it is quite true., I am analysing women at present, so
I ought to know., The subject is not so abstruse as I thought it was., I find that, ultimately, there are only two kinds of women, the plain
and the coloured., The plain women are very useful., If you want to
gain a reputation for respectability, you have merely to take them down
to supper., The other women are very charming., ...]"|2
14|"[The others write the poetry that they
dare not realize."", ""I wonder is that really so, Harry?"", said Dorian Gray, putting some
perfume on his handkerchief out of a large, gold-topped bottle that
stood on the table., ""It must be, if you say it., And now I am off., Imogen is waiting for me., Don't forget about to-morrow., Good-bye."", As he left the room, Lord Henry's heavy eyelids drooped, and he began
to think., Certainly few people had ever interested him so much as
Dorian Gray, and yet the lad's mad adoration of some one else caused
him not the slightest pang of annoyance or jealousy., He was pleased by
it., It made him a more interesting study., He had been always
enthralled by the methods of natural science, but the ordinary
subject-matter of that science had seemed to him trivial and of no
import., And so he had begun by vivisecting himself, as he had ended by
vivisecting others., Human life--that appeared to him the one thing
worth investigating., Compared to it there was nothing else of any
value., It was true that as one watched life in its curious crucible of
pain and pleasure, one could not wear over one's face a mask of glass,
nor keep the sulphurous fumes from troubling the brain and making the
imagination turbid with monstrous fancies and misshapen dreams., There
were poisons so subtle that to know their properties one had to sicken
of them., There were maladies so strange that one had to pass through
them if one sought to understand their nature., And, yet, what a great
reward one received!, How wonderful the whole world became to one!, To
note the curious hard logic of passion, and the emotional coloured life
of the intellect--to observe where they met, and where they separated,
at what point they were in unison, and at what point they were at
discord--there was a delight in that!, What matter what the cost was?, One could never pay too high a price for any sensation., He was conscious--and the thought brought a gleam of pleasure into his
brown agate eyes--that it was through certain words of his, musical
words said with musical utterance, that Dorian Gray's soul had turned
to this white girl and bowed in worship before her., To a large extent
the lad was his own creation., He had made him premature., That was
something., Ordinary people waited till life disclosed to them its
secrets, but to the few, to the elect, the mysteries of life were
revealed before the veil was drawn away., Sometimes this was the effect
of art, and chiefly of the art of literature, which dealt immediately
with the passions and the intellect., But now and then a complex
personality took the place and assumed the office of art, was indeed,
in its way, a real work of art, life having its elaborate masterpieces,
just as poetry has, or sculpture, or painting., Yes, the lad was premature., He was gathering his harvest while it was
yet spring., The pulse and passion of youth were in him, but he was
becoming self-conscious., It was delightful to watch him., With his
beautiful face, and his beautiful soul, he was a thing to wonder at., It was no matter how it all ended, or was destined to end., He was like
one of those gracious figures in a pageant or a play, whose joys seem
to be remote from one, but whose sorrows stir one's sense of beauty,
and whose wounds are like red roses., Soul and body, body and soul--how mysterious they were!, There was
animalism in the soul, and the body had its moments of spirituality., The senses could refine, and the intellect could degrade., Who could
say where the fleshly impulse ceased, or the psychical impulse began?, How shallow were the arbitrary definitions of ordinary psychologists!, And yet how difficult to decide between the claims of the various
schools!, Was the soul a shadow seated in the house of sin?, Or was the
body really in the soul, as Giordano Bruno thought?, The separation of
spirit from matter was a mystery, and the union of spirit with matter
was a mystery also., He began to wonder whether we could ever make psychology so absolute a
science that each little spring of life would be revealed to us., As it
was, we always misunderstood ourselves and rarely understood others., Experience was of no ethical value., It was merely the name men gave to
their mistakes., Moralists had, as a rule, regarded it as a mode of
warning, had claimed for it a certain ethical efficacy in the formation
of character, had praised it as something that taught us what to follow
and showed us what to avoid., But there was no motive power in
experience., It was as little of an active cause as conscience itself., All that it really demonstrated was that our future would be the same
as our past, and that the sin we had done once, and with loathing, we
would do many times, and with joy., It was clear to him that the experimental method was the only method by
which one could arrive at any scientific analysis of the passions; and
certainly Dorian Gray was a subject made to his hand, and seemed to
promise rich and fruitful results., His sudden mad love for Sibyl Vane
was a psychological phenomenon of no small interest., There was no
doubt that curiosity had much to do with it, curiosity and the desire
for new experiences, yet it was not a simple, but rather a very complex
passion., What there was in it of the purely sensuous instinct of
boyhood had been transformed by the workings of the imagination,
changed into something that seemed to the lad himself to be remote from
sense, and was for that very reason all the more dangerous., It was the
passions about whose origin we deceived ourselves that tyrannized most
strongly over us., Our weakest motives were those of whose nature we
were conscious., It often happened that when we thought we were
experimenting on others we were really experimenting on ourselves., While Lord Henry sat dreaming on these things, a knock came to the
door, and his valet entered and reminded him it was time to dress for
dinner., He got up and looked out into the street., The sunset had
smitten into scarlet gold the upper windows of the houses opposite., The panes glowed like plates of heated metal., The sky above was like a
faded rose., He thought of his friend's young fiery-coloured life and
wondered how it was all going to end., When he arrived home, about half-past twelve o'clock, he saw a telegram
lying on the hall table., He opened it and found it was from Dorian
Gray., It was to tell him that he was engaged to be married to Sibyl
Vane., ""Mother, Mother, I am so happy!"", whispered the girl, burying her face
in the lap of the faded, tired-looking woman who, with back turned to
the shrill intrusive light, was sitting in the one arm-chair that their
dingy sitting-room contained., ""I am so happy!"", she repeated, ""and you
must be happy, too!"", Mrs. Vane winced and put her thin, bismuth-whitened hands on her
daughter's head., ""Happy!"", she echoed, ""I am only happy, Sibyl, when I
see you act., You must not think of anything but your acting., Mr.
Isaacs has been very good to us, and we owe him money."", The girl looked up and pouted., ""Money, Mother?"", she cried, ""what does
money matter?, Love is more than money."", ""Mr. Isaacs has advanced us fifty pounds to pay off our debts and to
get a proper outfit for James., You must not forget that, Sibyl., Fifty
pounds is a very large sum., Mr. Isaacs has been most considerate."", ""He is not a gentleman, Mother, and I hate the way he talks to me,""
said the girl, rising to her feet and going over to the window., ""I don't know how we could manage without him,"" answered the elder
woman querulously., Sibyl Vane tossed her head and laughed., ""We don't want him any more,
Mother., Prince Charming rules life for us now."", Then she paused., A
rose shook in her blood and shadowed her cheeks., Quick breath parted
the petals of her lips., They trembled., Some southern wind of passion
swept over her and stirred the dainty folds of her dress., ""I love
him,"" she said simply., ""Foolish child!, ...]"|2
15|"[""Show him to me., Which is he?, Point him out., I must see him!"", he exclaimed; but at
that moment the Duke of Berwick's four-in-hand came between, and when
it had left the space clear, the carriage had swept out of the park., ""He is gone,"" murmured Sibyl sadly., ""I wish you had seen him."", ""I wish I had, for as sure as there is a God in heaven, if he ever does
you any wrong, I shall kill him."", She looked at him in horror., He repeated his words., They cut the air
like a dagger., The people round began to gape., A lady standing close
to her tittered., ""Come away, Jim; come away,"" she whispered., He followed her doggedly
as she passed through the crowd., He felt glad at what he had said., When they reached the Achilles Statue, she turned round., There was
pity in her eyes that became laughter on her lips., She shook her head
at him., ""You are foolish, Jim, utterly foolish; a bad-tempered boy,
that is all., How can you say such horrible things?, You don't know
what you are talking about., You are simply jealous and unkind., Ah!, I
wish you would fall in love., Love makes people good, and what you said
was wicked."", ""I am sixteen,"" he answered, ""and I know what I am about., Mother is no
help to you., She doesn't understand how to look after you., I wish now
that I was not going to Australia at all., I have a great mind to chuck
the whole thing up., I would, if my articles hadn't been signed."", ""Oh, don't be so serious, Jim., You are like one of the heroes of those
silly melodramas Mother used to be so fond of acting in., I am not
going to quarrel with you., I have seen him, and oh!, to see him is
perfect happiness., We won't quarrel., I know you would never harm any
one I love, would you?"", ""Not as long as you love him, I suppose,"" was the sullen answer., ""I shall love him for ever!"", she cried., ""And he?"", ""For ever, too!"", ""He had better."", She shrank from him., Then she laughed and put her hand on his arm., He
was merely a boy., At the Marble Arch they hailed an omnibus, which left them close to
their shabby home in the Euston Road., It was after five o'clock, and
Sibyl had to lie down for a couple of hours before acting., Jim
insisted that she should do so., He said that he would sooner part with
her when their mother was not present., She would be sure to make a
scene, and he detested scenes of every kind., In Sybil's own room they parted., There was jealousy in the lad's
heart, and a fierce murderous hatred of the stranger who, as it seemed
to him, had come between them., Yet, when her arms were flung round his
neck, and her fingers strayed through his hair, he softened and kissed
her with real affection., There were tears in his eyes as he went
downstairs., His mother was waiting for him below., She grumbled at his
unpunctuality, as he entered., He made no answer, but sat down to his
meagre meal., The flies buzzed round the table and crawled over the
stained cloth., Through the rumble of omnibuses, and the clatter of
street-cabs, he could hear the droning voice devouring each minute that
was left to him., After some time, he thrust away his plate and put his head in his
hands., He felt that he had a right to know., It should have been told
to him before, if it was as he suspected., Leaden with fear, his mother
watched him., Words dropped mechanically from her lips., A tattered
lace handkerchief twitched in her fingers., When the clock struck six,
he got up and went to the door., Then he turned back and looked at her., Their eyes met., In hers he saw a wild appeal for mercy., It enraged
him., ""Mother, I have something to ask you,"" he said., Her eyes wandered
vaguely about the room., She made no answer., ""Tell me the truth., I
have a right to know., Were you married to my father?"", She heaved a deep sigh., It was a sigh of relief., The terrible moment,
the moment that night and day, for weeks and months, she had dreaded,
had come at last, and yet she felt no terror., Indeed, in some measure
it was a disappointment to her., The vulgar directness of the question
called for a direct answer., The situation had not been gradually led
up to., It was crude., It reminded her of a bad rehearsal., ""No,"" she answered, wondering at the harsh simplicity of life., ""My father was a scoundrel then!"", cried the lad, clenching his fists., She shook her head., ""I knew he was not free., We loved each other very
much., If he had lived, he would have made provision for us., Don't
speak against him, my son., He was your father, and a gentleman., Indeed, he was highly connected."", An oath broke from his lips., ""I don't care for myself,"" he exclaimed,
""but don't let Sibyl...., It is a gentleman, isn't it, who is in love
with her, or says he is?, ...]"|2
16|"[He escorted them to their box with a sort of
pompous humility, waving his fat jewelled hands and talking at the top
of his voice., Dorian Gray loathed him more than ever., He felt as if
he had come to look for Miranda and had been met by Caliban., Lord
Henry, upon the other hand, rather liked him., At least he declared he
did, and insisted on shaking him by the hand and assuring him that he
was proud to meet a man who had discovered a real genius and gone
bankrupt over a poet., Hallward amused himself with watching the faces
in the pit., The heat was terribly oppressive, and the huge sunlight
flamed like a monstrous dahlia with petals of yellow fire., The youths
in the gallery had taken off their coats and waistcoats and hung them
over the side., They talked to each other across the theatre and shared
their oranges with the tawdry girls who sat beside them., Some women
were laughing in the pit., Their voices were horribly shrill and
discordant., The sound of the popping of corks came from the bar., ""What a place to find one's divinity in!"", said Lord Henry., ""Yes!"", answered Dorian Gray., ""It was here I found her, and she is
divine beyond all living things., When she acts, you will forget
everything., These common rough people, with their coarse faces and
brutal gestures, become quite different when she is on the stage., They
sit silently and watch her., They weep and laugh as she wills them to
do., She makes them as responsive as a violin., She spiritualizes them,
and one feels that they are of the same flesh and blood as one's self."", ""The same flesh and blood as one's self!, Oh, I hope not!"", exclaimed
Lord Henry, who was scanning the occupants of the gallery through his
opera-glass., ""Don't pay any attention to him, Dorian,"" said the painter., ""I
understand what you mean, and I believe in this girl., Any one you love
must be marvellous, and any girl who has the effect you describe must
be fine and noble., To spiritualize one's age--that is something worth
doing., If this girl can give a soul to those who have lived without
one, if she can create the sense of beauty in people whose lives have
been sordid and ugly, if she can strip them of their selfishness and
lend them tears for sorrows that are not their own, she is worthy of
all your adoration, worthy of the adoration of the world., This
marriage is quite right., I did not think so at first, but I admit it
now., The gods made Sibyl Vane for you., Without her you would have
been incomplete."", ""Thanks, Basil,"" answered Dorian Gray, pressing his hand., ""I knew that
you would understand me., Harry is so cynical, he terrifies me., But
here is the orchestra., It is quite dreadful, but it only lasts for
about five minutes., Then the curtain rises, and you will see the girl
to whom I am going to give all my life, to whom I have given everything
that is good in me."", A quarter of an hour afterwards, amidst an extraordinary turmoil of
applause, Sibyl Vane stepped on to the stage., Yes, she was certainly
lovely to look at--one of the loveliest creatures, Lord Henry thought,
that he had ever seen., There was something of the fawn in her shy
grace and startled eyes., A faint blush, like the shadow of a rose in a
mirror of silver, came to her cheeks as she glanced at the crowded
enthusiastic house., She stepped back a few paces and her lips seemed
to tremble., Basil Hallward leaped to his feet and began to applaud., Motionless, and as one in a dream, sat Dorian Gray, gazing at her., Lord Henry peered through his glasses, murmuring, ""Charming!, charming!"", The scene was the hall of Capulet's house, and Romeo in his pilgrim's
dress had entered with Mercutio and his other friends., The band, such
as it was, struck up a few bars of music, and the dance began., Through
the crowd of ungainly, shabbily dressed actors, Sibyl Vane moved like a
creature from a finer world., Her body swayed, while she danced, as a
plant sways in the water., The curves of her throat were the curves of
a white lily., Her hands seemed to be made of cool ivory., Yet she was curiously listless., She showed no sign of joy when her
eyes rested on Romeo., The few words she had to speak--

    Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,
        Which mannerly devotion shows in this;
    For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch,
        And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss--

with the brief dialogue that follows, were spoken in a thoroughly
artificial manner., The voice was exquisite, but from the point of view
of tone it was absolutely false., It was wrong in colour., It took away
all the life from the verse., It made the passion unreal., Dorian Gray grew pale as he watched her., He was puzzled and anxious., Neither of his friends dared to say anything to him., She seemed to
them to be absolutely incompetent., They were horribly disappointed., Yet they felt that the true test of any Juliet is the balcony scene of
the second act., They waited for that., If she failed there, there was
nothing in her., She looked charming as she came out in the moonlight., That could not
be denied., But the staginess of her acting was unbearable, and grew
worse as she went on., Her gestures became absurdly artificial., She
overemphasized everything that she had to say., The beautiful passage--

    Thou knowest the mask of night is on my face,
    Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
    For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night--

was declaimed with the painful precision of a schoolgirl who has been
taught to recite by some second-rate professor of elocution., When she
leaned over the balcony and came to those wonderful lines--

        Although I joy in thee,
    I have no joy of this contract to-night:
    It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden;
    Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be
    Ere one can say, ""It lightens."", Sweet, good-night!, This bud of love by summer's ripening breath
    May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet--

she spoke the words as though they conveyed no meaning to her., It was
not nervousness., Indeed, so far from being nervous, she was absolutely
self-contained., It was simply bad art., She was a complete failure., Even the common uneducated audience of the pit and gallery lost their
interest in the play., They got restless, and began to talk loudly and
to whistle., The Jew manager, who was standing at the back of the
dress-circle, stamped and swore with rage., The only person unmoved was
the girl herself., When the second act was over, there came a storm of hisses, and Lord
Henry got up from his chair and put on his coat., ""She is quite
beautiful, Dorian,"" he said, ""but she can't act., Let us go."", ""I am going to see the play through,"" answered the lad, in a hard
bitter voice., ""I am awfully sorry that I have made you waste an
evening, Harry., I apologize to you both."", ""My dear Dorian, I should think Miss Vane was ill,"" interrupted
Hallward., ""We will come some other night."", ""I wish she were ill,"" he rejoined., ""But she seems to me to be simply
callous and cold., She has entirely altered., Last night she was a
great artist., ...]"|2
17|"[The fascination that she had exercised over him
would return., They would be happy together., His life with her would
be beautiful and pure., He got up from his chair and drew a large screen right in front of the
portrait, shuddering as he glanced at it., ""How horrible!"", he murmured
to himself, and he walked across to the window and opened it., When he
stepped out on to the grass, he drew a deep breath., The fresh morning
air seemed to drive away all his sombre passions., He thought only of
Sibyl., A faint echo of his love came back to him., He repeated her
name over and over again., The birds that were singing in the
dew-drenched garden seemed to be telling the flowers about her., It was long past noon when he awoke., His valet had crept several times
on tiptoe into the room to see if he was stirring, and had wondered
what made his young master sleep so late., Finally his bell sounded,
and Victor came in softly with a cup of tea, and a pile of letters, on
a small tray of old Sevres china, and drew back the olive-satin
curtains, with their shimmering blue lining, that hung in front of the
three tall windows., ""Monsieur has well slept this morning,"" he said, smiling., ""What o'clock is it, Victor?"", asked Dorian Gray drowsily., ""One hour and a quarter, Monsieur."", How late it was!, He sat up, and having sipped some tea, turned over
his letters., One of them was from Lord Henry, and had been brought by
hand that morning., He hesitated for a moment, and then put it aside., The others he opened listlessly., They contained the usual collection
of cards, invitations to dinner, tickets for private views, programmes
of charity concerts, and the like that are showered on fashionable
young men every morning during the season., There was a rather heavy
bill for a chased silver Louis-Quinze toilet-set that he had not yet
had the courage to send on to his guardians, who were extremely
old-fashioned people and did not realize that we live in an age when
unnecessary things are our only necessities; and there were several
very courteously worded communications from Jermyn Street money-lenders
offering to advance any sum of money at a moment's notice and at the
most reasonable rates of interest., After about ten minutes he got up, and throwing on an elaborate
dressing-gown of silk-embroidered cashmere wool, passed into the
onyx-paved bathroom., The cool water refreshed him after his long
sleep., He seemed to have forgotten all that he had gone through., A
dim sense of having taken part in some strange tragedy came to him once
or twice, but there was the unreality of a dream about it., As soon as he was dressed, he went into the library and sat down to a
light French breakfast that had been laid out for him on a small round
table close to the open window., It was an exquisite day., The warm air
seemed laden with spices., A bee flew in and buzzed round the
blue-dragon bowl that, filled with sulphur-yellow roses, stood before
him., He felt perfectly happy., Suddenly his eye fell on the screen that he had placed in front of the
portrait, and he started., ""Too cold for Monsieur?"", asked his valet, putting an omelette on the
table., ""I shut the window?"", Dorian shook his head., ""I am not cold,"" he murmured., Was it all true?, Had the portrait really changed?, Or had it been
simply his own imagination that had made him see a look of evil where
there had been a look of joy?, Surely a painted canvas could not alter?, The thing was absurd., It would serve as a tale to tell Basil some day., It would make him smile., And, yet, how vivid was his recollection of the whole thing!, First in
the dim twilight, and then in the bright dawn, he had seen the touch of
cruelty round the warped lips., He almost dreaded his valet leaving the
room., He knew that when he was alone he would have to examine the
portrait., He was afraid of certainty., When the coffee and cigarettes
had been brought and the man turned to go, he felt a wild desire to
tell him to remain., As the door was closing behind him, he called him
back., The man stood waiting for his orders., Dorian looked at him for
a moment., ""I am not at home to any one, Victor,"" he said with a sigh., The man bowed and retired., Then he rose from the table, lit a cigarette, and flung himself down on
a luxuriously cushioned couch that stood facing the screen., The screen
was an old one, of gilt Spanish leather, stamped and wrought with a
rather florid Louis-Quatorze pattern., He scanned it curiously,
wondering if ever before it had concealed the secret of a man's life., Should he move it aside, after all?, Why not let it stay there?, What
was the use of knowing?, If the thing was true, it was terrible., If it
was not true, why trouble about it?, But what if, by some fate or
deadlier chance, eyes other than his spied behind and saw the horrible
change?, What should he do if Basil Hallward came and asked to look at
his own picture?, Basil would be sure to do that., No; the thing had to
be examined, and at once., Anything would be better than this dreadful
state of doubt., He got up and locked both doors., At least he would be alone when he
looked upon the mask of his shame., Then he drew the screen aside and
saw himself face to face., It was perfectly true., The portrait had
altered., As he often remembered afterwards, and always with no small wonder, he
found himself at first gazing at the portrait with a feeling of almost
scientific interest., That such a change should have taken place was
incredible to him., And yet it was a fact., Was there some subtle
affinity between the chemical atoms that shaped themselves into form
and colour on the canvas and the soul that was within him?, Could it be
that what that soul thought, they realized?--that what it dreamed, they
made true?, Or was there some other, more terrible reason?, He
shuddered, and felt afraid, and, going back to the couch, lay there,
gazing at the picture in sickened horror., One thing, however, he felt that it had done for him., It had made him
conscious how unjust, how cruel, he had been to Sibyl Vane., It was not
too late to make reparation for that., She could still be his wife., His unreal and selfish love would yield to some higher influence, would
be transformed into some nobler passion, and the portrait that Basil
Hallward had painted of him would be a guide to him through life, would
be to him what holiness is to some, and conscience to others, and the
fear of God to us all., There were opiates for remorse, drugs that
could lull the moral sense to sleep., But here was a visible symbol of
the degradation of sin., Here was an ever-present sign of the ruin men
brought upon their souls., Three o'clock struck, and four, and the half-hour rang its double
chime, but Dorian Gray did not stir., He was trying to gather up the
scarlet threads of life and to weave them into a pattern; to find his
way through the sanguine labyrinth of passion through which he was
wandering., He did not know what to do, or what to think., Finally, he
went over to the table and wrote a passionate letter to the girl he had
loved, imploring her forgiveness and accusing himself of madness., He
covered page after page with wild words of sorrow and wilder words of
pain., There is a luxury in self-reproach., When we blame ourselves, we
feel that no one else has a right to blame us., It is the confession,
not the priest, that gives us absolution., ...]"|2
18|"[""We are only at the beginning of our friendship, Dorian,"" answered Lord
Henry, shaking him by the hand., ""Good-bye., I shall see you before
nine-thirty, I hope., Remember, Patti is singing."", As he closed the door behind him, Dorian Gray touched the bell, and in
a few minutes Victor appeared with the lamps and drew the blinds down., He waited impatiently for him to go., The man seemed to take an
interminable time over everything., As soon as he had left, he rushed to the screen and drew it back., No;
there was no further change in the picture., It had received the news
of Sibyl Vane's death before he had known of it himself., It was
conscious of the events of life as they occurred., The vicious cruelty
that marred the fine lines of the mouth had, no doubt, appeared at the
very moment that the girl had drunk the poison, whatever it was., Or
was it indifferent to results?, Did it merely take cognizance of what
passed within the soul?, He wondered, and hoped that some day he would
see the change taking place before his very eyes, shuddering as he
hoped it., Poor Sibyl!, What a romance it had all been!, She had often mimicked
death on the stage., Then Death himself had touched her and taken her
with him., How had she played that dreadful last scene?, Had she cursed
him, as she died?, No; she had died for love of him, and love would
always be a sacrament to him now., She had atoned for everything by the
sacrifice she had made of her life., He would not think any more of
what she had made him go through, on that horrible night at the
theatre., When he thought of her, it would be as a wonderful tragic
figure sent on to the world's stage to show the supreme reality of
love., A wonderful tragic figure?, Tears came to his eyes as he
remembered her childlike look, and winsome fanciful ways, and shy
tremulous grace., He brushed them away hastily and looked again at the
picture., He felt that the time had really come for making his choice., Or had
his choice already been made?, Yes, life had decided that for
him--life, and his own infinite curiosity about life., Eternal youth,
infinite passion, pleasures subtle and secret, wild joys and wilder
sins--he was to have all these things., The portrait was to bear the
burden of his shame: that was all., A feeling of pain crept over him as he thought of the desecration that
was in store for the fair face on the canvas., Once, in boyish mockery
of Narcissus, he had kissed, or feigned to kiss, those painted lips
that now smiled so cruelly at him., Morning after morning he had sat
before the portrait wondering at its beauty, almost enamoured of it, as
it seemed to him at times., Was it to alter now with every mood to
which he yielded?, Was it to become a monstrous and loathsome thing, to
be hidden away in a locked room, to be shut out from the sunlight that
had so often touched to brighter gold the waving wonder of its hair?, The pity of it!, the pity of it!, For a moment, he thought of praying that the horrible sympathy that
existed between him and the picture might cease., It had changed in
answer to a prayer; perhaps in answer to a prayer it might remain
unchanged., And yet, who, that knew anything about life, would
surrender the chance of remaining always young, however fantastic that
chance might be, or with what fateful consequences it might be fraught?, Besides, was it really under his control?, Had it indeed been prayer
that had produced the substitution?, Might there not be some curious
scientific reason for it all?, If thought could exercise its influence
upon a living organism, might not thought exercise an influence upon
dead and inorganic things?, Nay, without thought or conscious desire,
might not things external to ourselves vibrate in unison with our moods
and passions, atom calling to atom in secret love or strange affinity?, But the reason was of no importance., He would never again tempt by a
prayer any terrible power., If the picture was to alter, it was to
alter., That was all., Why inquire too closely into it?, For there would be a real pleasure in watching it., He would be able to
follow his mind into its secret places., This portrait would be to him
the most magical of mirrors., As it had revealed to him his own body,
so it would reveal to him his own soul., And when winter came upon it,
he would still be standing where spring trembles on the verge of
summer., When the blood crept from its face, and left behind a pallid
mask of chalk with leaden eyes, he would keep the glamour of boyhood., Not one blossom of his loveliness would ever fade., Not one pulse of
his life would ever weaken., Like the gods of the Greeks, he would be
strong, and fleet, and joyous., What did it matter what happened to the
coloured image on the canvas?, He would be safe., That was everything., He drew the screen back into its former place in front of the picture,
smiling as he did so, and passed into his bedroom, where his valet was
already waiting for him., An hour later he was at the opera, and Lord
Henry was leaning over his chair., As he was sitting at breakfast next morning, Basil Hallward was shown
into the room., ""I am so glad I have found you, Dorian,"" he said gravely., ""I called
last night, and they told me you were at the opera., Of course, I knew
that was impossible., But I wish you had left word where you had really
gone to., I passed a dreadful evening, half afraid that one tragedy
might be followed by another., I think you might have telegraphed for
me when you heard of it first., I read of it quite by chance in a late
edition of _The Globe_ that I picked up at the club., I came here at once
and was miserable at not finding you., I can't tell you how
heart-broken I am about the whole thing., I know what you must suffer., But where were you?, Did you go down and see the girl's mother?, For a
moment I thought of following you there., They gave the address in the
paper., Somewhere in the Euston Road, isn't it?, But I was afraid of
intruding upon a sorrow that I could not lighten., Poor woman!, What a
state she must be in!, And her only child, too!, What did she say about
it all?"", ""My dear Basil, how do I know?"", murmured Dorian Gray, sipping some
pale-yellow wine from a delicate, gold-beaded bubble of Venetian glass
and looking dreadfully bored., ""I was at the opera., You should have
come on there., I met Lady Gwendolen, Harry's sister, for the first
time., We were in her box., She is perfectly charming; and Patti sang
divinely., Don't talk about horrid subjects., If one doesn't talk about
a thing, it has never happened., It is simply expression, as Harry
says, that gives reality to things., I may mention that she was not the
woman's only child., There is a son, a charming fellow, I believe., ...]"|2
19|"[""It was a very disappointing confession."", ""Why, what did you expect, Dorian?, You didn't see anything else in the
picture, did you?, There was nothing else to see?"", ""No; there was nothing else to see., Why do you ask?, But you mustn't
talk about worship., It is foolish., You and I are friends, Basil, and
we must always remain so."", ""You have got Harry,"" said the painter sadly., ""Oh, Harry!"", cried the lad, with a ripple of laughter., ""Harry spends
his days in saying what is incredible and his evenings in doing what is
improbable., Just the sort of life I would like to lead., But still I
don't think I would go to Harry if I were in trouble., I would sooner
go to you, Basil."", ""You will sit to me again?"", ""Impossible!"", ""You spoil my life as an artist by refusing, Dorian., No man comes
across two ideal things., Few come across one."", ""I can't explain it to you, Basil, but I must never sit to you again., There is something fatal about a portrait., It has a life of its own., I will come and have tea with you., That will be just as pleasant."", ""Pleasanter for you, I am afraid,"" murmured Hallward regretfully., ""And
now good-bye., I am sorry you won't let me look at the picture once
again., But that can't be helped., I quite understand what you feel
about it."", As he left the room, Dorian Gray smiled to himself., Poor Basil!, How
little he knew of the true reason!, And how strange it was that,
instead of having been forced to reveal his own secret, he had
succeeded, almost by chance, in wresting a secret from his friend!, How
much that strange confession explained to him!, The painter's absurd
fits of jealousy, his wild devotion, his extravagant panegyrics, his
curious reticences--he understood them all now, and he felt sorry., There seemed to him to be something tragic in a friendship so coloured
by romance., He sighed and touched the bell., The portrait must be hidden away at
all costs., He could not run such a risk of discovery again., It had
been mad of him to have allowed the thing to remain, even for an hour,
in a room to which any of his friends had access., When his servant entered, he looked at him steadfastly and wondered if
he had thought of peering behind the screen., The man was quite
impassive and waited for his orders., Dorian lit a cigarette and walked
over to the glass and glanced into it., He could see the reflection of
Victor's face perfectly., It was like a placid mask of servility., There was nothing to be afraid of, there., Yet he thought it best to be
on his guard., Speaking very slowly, he told him to tell the house-keeper that he
wanted to see her, and then to go to the frame-maker and ask him to
send two of his men round at once., It seemed to him that as the man
left the room his eyes wandered in the direction of the screen., Or was
that merely his own fancy?, After a few moments, in her black silk dress, with old-fashioned thread
mittens on her wrinkled hands, Mrs., Leaf bustled into the library., He
asked her for the key of the schoolroom., ""The old schoolroom, Mr., Dorian?"", she exclaimed., ""Why, it is full of
dust., I must get it arranged and put straight before you go into it., It is not fit for you to see, sir., It is not, indeed."", ""I don't want it put straight, Leaf., I only want the key."", ""Well, sir, you'll be covered with cobwebs if you go into it., Why, it
hasn't been opened for nearly five years--not since his lordship died."", He winced at the mention of his grandfather., He had hateful memories
of him., ""That does not matter,"" he answered., ""I simply want to see
the place--that is all., Give me the key."", ""And here is the key, sir,"" said the old lady, going over the contents
of her bunch with tremulously uncertain hands., ""Here is the key., I'll
have it off the bunch in a moment., But you don't think of living up
there, sir, and you so comfortable here?"", ""No, no,"" he cried petulantly., ""Thank you, Leaf., That will do."", She lingered for a few moments, and was garrulous over some detail of
the household., He sighed and told her to manage things as she thought
best., She left the room, wreathed in smiles., As the door closed, Dorian put the key in his pocket and looked round
the room., His eye fell on a large, purple satin coverlet heavily
embroidered with gold, a splendid piece of late seventeenth-century
Venetian work that his grandfather had found in a convent near Bologna., Yes, that would serve to wrap the dreadful thing in., It had perhaps
served often as a pall for the dead., Now it was to hide something that
had a corruption of its own, worse than the corruption of death
itself--something that would breed horrors and yet would never die., What the worm was to the corpse, his sins would be to the painted image
on the canvas., They would mar its beauty and eat away its grace., They
would defile it and make it shameful., And yet the thing would still
live on., It would be always alive., He shuddered, and for a moment he regretted that he had not told Basil
the true reason why he had wished to hide the picture away., Basil
would have helped him to resist Lord Henry's influence, and the still
more poisonous influences that came from his own temperament., The love
that he bore him--for it was really love--had nothing in it that was
not noble and intellectual., It was not that mere physical admiration
of beauty that is born of the senses and that dies when the senses
tire., It was such love as Michelangelo had known, and Montaigne, and
Winckelmann, and Shakespeare himself., Yes, Basil could have saved him., But it was too late now., The past could always be annihilated., Regret, denial, or forgetfulness could do that., ...]"|2
20|"[Summer followed summer, and the yellow
jonquils bloomed and died many times, and nights of horror repeated the
story of their shame, but he was unchanged., No winter marred his face
or stained his flowerlike bloom., How different it was with material
things!, Where had they passed to?, Where was the great crocus-coloured
robe, on which the gods fought against the giants, that had been worked
by brown girls for the pleasure of Athena?, Where the huge velarium
that Nero had stretched across the Colosseum at Rome, that Titan sail
of purple on which was represented the starry sky, and Apollo driving a
chariot drawn by white, gilt-reined steeds?, He longed to see the
curious table-napkins wrought for the Priest of the Sun, on which were
displayed all the dainties and viands that could be wanted for a feast;
the mortuary cloth of King Chilperic, with its three hundred golden
bees; the fantastic robes that excited the indignation of the Bishop of
Pontus and were figured with ""lions, panthers, bears, dogs, forests,
rocks, hunters--all, in fact, that a painter can copy from nature""; and
the coat that Charles of Orleans once wore, on the sleeves of which
were embroidered the verses of a song beginning ""_Madame, je suis tout
joyeux_,"" the musical accompaniment of the words being wrought in gold
thread, and each note, of square shape in those days, formed with four
pearls., He read of the room that was prepared at the palace at Rheims
for the use of Queen Joan of Burgundy and was decorated with ""thirteen
hundred and twenty-one parrots, made in broidery, and blazoned with the
king's arms, and five hundred and sixty-one butterflies, whose wings
were similarly ornamented with the arms of the queen, the whole worked
in gold."", Catherine de Medicis had a mourning-bed made for her of
black velvet powdered with crescents and suns., Its curtains were of
damask, with leafy wreaths and garlands, figured upon a gold and silver
ground, and fringed along the edges with broideries of pearls, and it
stood in a room hung with rows of the queen's devices in cut black
velvet upon cloth of silver., Louis XIV had gold embroidered caryatides
fifteen feet high in his apartment., The state bed of Sobieski, King of
Poland, was made of Smyrna gold brocade embroidered in turquoises with
verses from the Koran., Its supports were of silver gilt, beautifully
chased, and profusely set with enamelled and jewelled medallions., It
had been taken from the Turkish camp before Vienna, and the standard of
Mohammed had stood beneath the tremulous gilt of its canopy., And so, for a whole year, he sought to accumulate the most exquisite
specimens that he could find of textile and embroidered work, getting
the dainty Delhi muslins, finely wrought with gold-thread palmates and
stitched over with iridescent beetles' wings; the Dacca gauzes, that
from their transparency are known in the East as ""woven air,"" and
""running water,"" and ""evening dew""; strange figured cloths from Java;
elaborate yellow Chinese hangings; books bound in tawny satins or fair
blue silks and wrought with _fleurs-de-lis_, birds and images; veils of
_lacis_ worked in Hungary point; Sicilian brocades and stiff Spanish
velvets; Georgian work, with its gilt coins, and Japanese _Foukousas_,
with their green-toned golds and their marvellously plumaged birds., He had a special passion, also, for ecclesiastical vestments, as indeed
he had for everything connected with the service of the Church., In the
long cedar chests that lined the west gallery of his house, he had
stored away many rare and beautiful specimens of what is really the
raiment of the Bride of Christ, who must wear purple and jewels and
fine linen that she may hide the pallid macerated body that is worn by
the suffering that she seeks for and wounded by self-inflicted pain., He possessed a gorgeous cope of crimson silk and gold-thread damask,
figured with a repeating pattern of golden pomegranates set in
six-petalled formal blossoms, beyond which on either side was the
pine-apple device wrought in seed-pearls., The orphreys were divided
into panels representing scenes from the life of the Virgin, and the
coronation of the Virgin was figured in coloured silks upon the hood., This was Italian work of the fifteenth century., Another cope was of
green velvet, embroidered with heart-shaped groups of acanthus-leaves,
from which spread long-stemmed white blossoms, the details of which
were picked out with silver thread and coloured crystals., The morse
bore a seraph's head in gold-thread raised work., The orphreys were
woven in a diaper of red and gold silk, and were starred with
medallions of many saints and martyrs, among whom was St. Sebastian., He had chasubles, also, of amber-coloured silk, and blue silk and gold
brocade, and yellow silk damask and cloth of gold, figured with
representations of the Passion and Crucifixion of Christ, and
embroidered with lions and peacocks and other emblems; dalmatics of
white satin and pink silk damask, decorated with tulips and dolphins
and _fleurs-de-lis_; altar frontals of crimson velvet and blue linen; and
many corporals, chalice-veils, and sudaria., In the mystic offices to
which such things were put, there was something that quickened his
imagination., For these treasures, and everything that he collected in his lovely
house, were to be to him means of forgetfulness, modes by which he
could escape, for a season, from the fear that seemed to him at times
to be almost too great to be borne., Upon the walls of the lonely
locked room where he had spent so much of his boyhood, he had hung with
his own hands the terrible portrait whose changing features showed him
the real degradation of his life, and in front of it had draped the
purple-and-gold pall as a curtain., For weeks he would not go there,
would forget the hideous painted thing, and get back his light heart,
his wonderful joyousness, his passionate absorption in mere existence., Then, suddenly, some night he would creep out of the house, go down to
dreadful places near Blue Gate Fields, and stay there, day after day,
until he was driven away., On his return he would sit in front of the
picture, sometimes loathing it and himself, but filled, at other
times, with that pride of individualism that is half the
fascination of sin, and smiling with secret pleasure at the misshapen
shadow that had to bear the burden that should have been his own., After a few years he could not endure to be long out of England, and
gave up the villa that he had shared at Trouville with Lord Henry, as
well as the little white walled-in house at Algiers where they had more
than once spent the winter., He hated to be separated from the picture
that was such a part of his life, and was also afraid that during his
absence some one might gain access to the room, in spite of the
elaborate bars that he had caused to be placed upon the door., He was quite conscious that this would tell them nothing., It was true
that the portrait still preserved, under all the foulness and ugliness
of the face, its marked likeness to himself; but what could they learn
from that?, He would laugh at any one who tried to taunt him., He had
not painted it., What was it to him how vile and full of shame it
looked?, Even if he told them, would they believe it?, Yet he was afraid., Sometimes when he was down at his great house in
Nottinghamshire, entertaining the fashionable young men of his own rank
who were his chief companions, and astounding the county by the wanton
luxury and gorgeous splendour of his mode of life, he would suddenly
leave his guests and rush back to town to see that the door had not
been tampered with and that the picture was still there., What if it
should be stolen?, The mere thought made him cold with horror., Surely
the world would know his secret then., Perhaps the world already
suspected it., For, while he fascinated many, there were not a few who distrusted him., He was very nearly blackballed at a West End club of which his birth
and social position fully entitled him to become a member, and it was
said that on one occasion, when he was brought by a friend into the
smoking-room of the Churchill, the Duke of Berwick and another
gentleman got up in a marked manner and went out., Curious stories
became current about him after he had passed his twenty-fifth year., It
was rumoured that he had been seen brawling with foreign sailors in a
low den in the distant parts of Whitechapel, and that he consorted with
thieves and coiners and knew the mysteries of their trade., His
extraordinary absences became notorious, and, when he used to reappear
again in society, men would whisper to each other in corners, or pass
him with a sneer, or look at him with cold searching eyes, as though
they were determined to discover his secret., Of such insolences and attempted slights he, of course, took no notice,
and in the opinion of most people his frank debonair manner, his
charming boyish smile, and the infinite grace of that wonderful youth
that seemed never to leave him, were in themselves a sufficient answer
to the calumnies, for so they termed them, that were circulated about
him., It was remarked, however, that some of those who had been most
intimate with him appeared, after a time, to shun him., Women who had
wildly adored him, and for his sake had braved all social censure and
set convention at defiance, were seen to grow pallid with shame or
horror if Dorian Gray entered the room., Yet these whispered scandals only increased in the eyes of many his
strange and dangerous charm., His great wealth was a certain element of
security., Society--civilized society, at least--is never very ready to
believe anything to the detriment of those who are both rich and
fascinating., It feels instinctively that manners are of more
importance than morals, and, in its opinion, the highest respectability
is of much less value than the possession of a good _chef_., And, after
all, it is a very poor consolation to be told that the man who has
given one a bad dinner, or poor wine, is irreproachable in his private
life., Even the cardinal virtues cannot atone for half-cold _entrees_, as
Lord Henry remarked once, in a discussion on the subject, and there is
possibly a good deal to be said for his view., For the canons of good
society are, or should be, the same as the canons of art., Form is
absolutely essential to it., It should have the dignity of a ceremony,
as well as its unreality, and should combine the insincere character of
a romantic play with the wit and beauty that make such plays delightful
to us., Is insincerity such a terrible thing?, I think not., It is
merely a method by which we can multiply our personalities., Such, at any rate, was Dorian Gray's opinion., He used to wonder at the
shallow psychology of those who conceive the ego in man as a thing
simple, permanent, reliable, and of one essence., To him, man was a
being with myriad lives and myriad sensations, a complex multiform
creature that bore within itself strange legacies of thought and
passion, and whose very flesh was tainted with the monstrous maladies
of the dead., He loved to stroll through the gaunt cold picture-gallery
of his country house and look at the various portraits of those whose
blood flowed in his veins., Here was Philip Herbert, described by
Francis Osborne, in his Memoires on the Reigns of Queen Elizabeth and
King James, as one who was ""caressed by the Court for his handsome
face, which kept him not long company."", Was it young Herbert's life
that he sometimes led?, Had some strange poisonous germ crept from body
to body till it had reached his own?, Was it some dim sense of that
ruined grace that had made him so suddenly, and almost without cause,
give utterance, in Basil Hallward's studio, to the mad prayer that had
so changed his life?, Here, in gold-embroidered red doublet, jewelled
surcoat, and gilt-edged ruff and wristbands, stood Sir Anthony Sherard,
with his silver-and-black armour piled at his feet., What had this
man's legacy been?, Had the lover of Giovanna of Naples bequeathed him
some inheritance of sin and shame?, Were his own actions merely the
dreams that the dead man had not dared to realize?, Here, from the
fading canvas, smiled Lady Elizabeth Devereux, in her gauze hood, pearl
stomacher, and pink slashed sleeves., A flower was in her right hand,
and her left clasped an enamelled collar of white and damask roses., On
a table by her side lay a mandolin and an apple., There were large
green rosettes upon her little pointed shoes., He knew her life, and
the strange stories that were told about her lovers., Had he something
of her temperament in him?, These oval, heavy-lidded eyes seemed to
look curiously at him., What of George Willoughby, with his powdered
hair and fantastic patches?, How evil he looked!, The face was
saturnine and swarthy, and the sensual lips seemed to be twisted with
disdain., Delicate lace ruffles fell over the lean yellow hands that
were so overladen with rings., He had been a macaroni of the eighteenth
century, and the friend, in his youth, of Lord Ferrars., What of the
second Lord Beckenham, the companion of the Prince Regent in his
wildest days, and one of the witnesses at the secret marriage with Mrs.
Fitzherbert?, How proud and handsome he was, with his chestnut curls
and insolent pose!, What passions had he bequeathed?, The world had
looked upon him as infamous., He had led the orgies at Carlton House., The star of the Garter glittered upon his breast., Beside him hung the
portrait of his wife, a pallid, thin-lipped woman in black., Her blood,
also, stirred within him., How curious it all seemed!, And his mother
with her Lady Hamilton face and her moist, wine-dashed lips--he knew
what he had got from her., He had got from her his beauty, and his
passion for the beauty of others., She laughed at him in her loose
Bacchante dress., ...]"|2
21|"[As Dorian Gray was lighting a half-burned candle that was
standing on the mantelshelf, he saw that the whole place was covered
with dust and that the carpet was in holes., A mouse ran scuffling
behind the wainscoting., There was a damp odour of mildew., ""So you think that it is only God who sees the soul, Basil?, Draw that
curtain back, and you will see mine."", The voice that spoke was cold and cruel., ""You are mad, Dorian, or
playing a part,"" muttered Hallward, frowning., ""You won't?, Then I must do it myself,"" said the young man, and he tore
the curtain from its rod and flung it on the ground., An exclamation of horror broke from the painter's lips as he saw in the
dim light the hideous face on the canvas grinning at him., There was
something in its expression that filled him with disgust and loathing., Good heavens!, it was Dorian Gray's own face that he was looking at!, The horror, whatever it was, had not yet entirely spoiled that
marvellous beauty., There was still some gold in the thinning hair and
some scarlet on the sensual mouth., The sodden eyes had kept something
of the loveliness of their blue, the noble curves had not yet
completely passed away from chiselled nostrils and from plastic throat., Yes, it was Dorian himself., But who had done it?, He seemed to
recognize his own brushwork, and the frame was his own design., The
idea was monstrous, yet he felt afraid., He seized the lighted candle,
and held it to the picture., In the left-hand corner was his own name,
traced in long letters of bright vermilion., It was some foul parody, some infamous ignoble satire., He had never
done that., Still, it was his own picture., He knew it, and he felt as
if his blood had changed in a moment from fire to sluggish ice., His
own picture!, What did it mean?, Why had it altered?, He turned and
looked at Dorian Gray with the eyes of a sick man., His mouth twitched,
and his parched tongue seemed unable to articulate., He passed his hand
across his forehead., It was dank with clammy sweat., The young man was leaning against the mantelshelf, watching him with
that strange expression that one sees on the faces of those who are
absorbed in a play when some great artist is acting., There was neither
real sorrow in it nor real joy., There was simply the passion of the
spectator, with perhaps a flicker of triumph in his eyes., He had taken
the flower out of his coat, and was smelling it, or pretending to do so., ""What does this mean?"", cried Hallward, at last., His own voice sounded
shrill and curious in his ears., ""Years ago, when I was a boy,"" said Dorian Gray, crushing the flower in
his hand, ""you met me, flattered me, and taught me to be vain of my
good looks., One day you introduced me to a friend of yours, who
explained to me the wonder of youth, and you finished a portrait of me
that revealed to me the wonder of beauty., In a mad moment that, even
now, I don't know whether I regret or not, I made a wish, perhaps you
would call it a prayer....""

""I remember it!, Oh, how well I remember it!, No!, the thing is
impossible., The room is damp., Mildew has got into the canvas., The
paints I used had some wretched mineral poison in them., I tell you the
thing is impossible."", ""Ah, what is impossible?"", murmured the young man, going over to the
window and leaning his forehead against the cold, mist-stained glass., ""You told me you had destroyed it."", ""I was wrong., It has destroyed me."", ""I don't believe it is my picture."", ""Can't you see your ideal in it?"", said Dorian bitterly., ""My ideal, as you call it...""

""As you called it."", ""There was nothing evil in it, nothing shameful., You were to me such
an ideal as I shall never meet again., This is the face of a satyr."", ""It is the face of my soul."", ""Christ!, what a thing I must have worshipped!, It has the eyes of a
devil."", ""Each of us has heaven and hell in him, Basil,"" cried Dorian with a
wild gesture of despair., Hallward turned again to the portrait and gazed at it., ""My God!, If it
is true,"" he exclaimed, ""and this is what you have done with your life,
why, you must be worse even than those who talk against you fancy you
to be!"", He held the light up again to the canvas and examined it., The
surface seemed to be quite undisturbed and as he had left it., It was
from within, apparently, that the foulness and horror had come., Through some strange quickening of inner life the leprosies of sin were
slowly eating the thing away., The rotting of a corpse in a watery
grave was not so fearful., His hand shook, and the candle fell from its socket on the floor and
lay there sputtering., He placed his foot on it and put it out., Then
he flung himself into the rickety chair that was standing by the table
and buried his face in his hands., ""Good God, Dorian, what a lesson!, What an awful lesson!"", There was no
answer, but he could hear the young man sobbing at the window., ""Pray,
Dorian, pray,"" he murmured., ""What is it that one was taught to say in
one's boyhood?, 'Lead us not into temptation., Forgive us our sins., Wash away our iniquities.', Let us say that together., The prayer of
your pride has been answered., The prayer of your repentance will be
answered also., I worshipped you too much., I am punished for it., You
worshipped yourself too much., We are both punished."", Dorian Gray turned slowly around and looked at him with tear-dimmed
eyes., ""It is too late, Basil,"" he faltered., ""It is never too late, Dorian., Let us kneel down and try if we cannot
remember a prayer., Isn't there a verse somewhere, 'Though your sins be
as scarlet, yet I will make them as white as snow'?"", ""Those words mean nothing to me now."", ""Hush!, ...]"|2
22|"[He may not have intended
it, the result was the same."", ""Murder!, Good God, Dorian, is that what you have come to?, I shall not
inform upon you., It is not my business., Besides, without my stirring
in the matter, you are certain to be arrested., Nobody ever commits a
crime without doing something stupid., But I will have nothing to do
with it."", ""You must have something to do with it., Wait, wait a moment; listen to
me., Only listen, Alan., All I ask of you is to perform a certain
scientific experiment., You go to hospitals and dead-houses, and the
horrors that you do there don't affect you., If in some hideous
dissecting-room or fetid laboratory you found this man lying on a
leaden table with red gutters scooped out in it for the blood to flow
through, you would simply look upon him as an admirable subject., You
would not turn a hair., You would not believe that you were doing
anything wrong., On the contrary, you would probably feel that you were
benefiting the human race, or increasing the sum of knowledge in the
world, or gratifying intellectual curiosity, or something of that kind., What I want you to do is merely what you have often done before., Indeed, to destroy a body must be far less horrible than what you are
accustomed to work at., And, remember, it is the only piece of evidence
against me., If it is discovered, I am lost; and it is sure to be
discovered unless you help me."", ""I have no desire to help you., You forget that., I am simply
indifferent to the whole thing., It has nothing to do with me."", ""Alan, I entreat you., Think of the position I am in., Just before you
came I almost fainted with terror., You may know terror yourself some
day., No!, don't think of that., Look at the matter purely from the
scientific point of view., You don't inquire where the dead things on
which you experiment come from., Don't inquire now., I have told you
too much as it is., But I beg of you to do this., We were friends once,
Alan."", ""Don't speak about those days, Dorian--they are dead."", ""The dead linger sometimes., The man upstairs will not go away., He is
sitting at the table with bowed head and outstretched arms., Alan!, Alan!, If you don't come to my assistance, I am ruined., Why, they will
hang me, Alan!, Don't you understand?, They will hang me for what I
have done."", ""There is no good in prolonging this scene., I absolutely refuse to do
anything in the matter., It is insane of you to ask me."", ""You refuse?"", ""Yes."", ""I entreat you, Alan."", ""It is useless."", The same look of pity came into Dorian Gray's eyes., Then he stretched
out his hand, took a piece of paper, and wrote something on it., He
read it over twice, folded it carefully, and pushed it across the
table., Having done this, he got up and went over to the window., Campbell looked at him in surprise, and then took up the paper, and
opened it., As he read it, his face became ghastly pale and he fell
back in his chair., A horrible sense of sickness came over him., He
felt as if his heart was beating itself to death in some empty hollow., After two or three minutes of terrible silence, Dorian turned round and
came and stood behind him, putting his hand upon his shoulder., ""I am so sorry for you, Alan,"" he murmured, ""but you leave me no
alternative., I have a letter written already., Here it is., You see
the address., If you don't help me, I must send it., If you don't help
me, I will send it., You know what the result will be., But you are
going to help me., It is impossible for you to refuse now., I tried to
spare you., You will do me the justice to admit that., You were stern,
harsh, offensive., You treated me as no man has ever dared to treat
me--no living man, at any rate., I bore it all., Now it is for me to
dictate terms."", Campbell buried his face in his hands, and a shudder passed through him., ""Yes, it is my turn to dictate terms, Alan., You know what they are., The thing is quite simple., Come, don't work yourself into this fever., The thing has to be done., Face it, and do it."", A groan broke from Campbell's lips and he shivered all over., The
ticking of the clock on the mantelpiece seemed to him to be dividing
time into separate atoms of agony, each of which was too terrible to be
borne., He felt as if an iron ring was being slowly tightened round his
forehead, as if the disgrace with which he was threatened had already
come upon him., The hand upon his shoulder weighed like a hand of lead., It was intolerable., It seemed to crush him., ""Come, Alan, you must decide at once."", ""I cannot do it,"" he said, mechanically, as though words could alter
things., ""You must., You have no choice., Don't delay."", He hesitated a moment., ""Is there a fire in the room upstairs?"", ""Yes, there is a gas-fire with asbestos."", ""I shall have to go home and get some things from the laboratory."", ...]"|2
23|"[I
didn't go to the club., I walked about., I forget what I did.... How
inquisitive you are, Harry!, You always want to know what one has been
doing., I always want to forget what I have been doing., I came in at
half-past two, if you wish to know the exact time., I had left my
latch-key at home, and my servant had to let me in., If you want any
corroborative evidence on the subject, you can ask him."", Lord Henry shrugged his shoulders., ""My dear fellow, as if I cared!, Let us go up to the drawing-room., No sherry, thank you, Mr. Chapman., Something has happened to you, Dorian., Tell me what it is., You are
not yourself to-night."", ""Don't mind me, Harry., I am irritable, and out of temper., I shall
come round and see you to-morrow, or next day., Make my excuses to Lady
Narborough., I shan't go upstairs., I shall go home., I must go home."", ""All right, Dorian., I dare say I shall see you to-morrow at tea-time., The duchess is coming."", ""I will try to be there, Harry,"" he said, leaving the room., As he
drove back to his own house, he was conscious that the sense of terror
he thought he had strangled had come back to him., Lord Henry's casual
questioning had made him lose his nerve for the moment, and he wanted
his nerve still., Things that were dangerous had to be destroyed., He
winced., He hated the idea of even touching them., Yet it had to be done., He realized that, and when he had locked the
door of his library, he opened the secret press into which he had
thrust Basil Hallward's coat and bag., A huge fire was blazing., He
piled another log on it., The smell of the singeing clothes and burning
leather was horrible., It took him three-quarters of an hour to consume
everything., At the end he felt faint and sick, and having lit some
Algerian pastilles in a pierced copper brazier, he bathed his hands and
forehead with a cool musk-scented vinegar., Suddenly he started., His eyes grew strangely bright, and he gnawed
nervously at his underlip., Between two of the windows stood a large
Florentine cabinet, made out of ebony and inlaid with ivory and blue
lapis., He watched it as though it were a thing that could fascinate
and make afraid, as though it held something that he longed for and yet
almost loathed., His breath quickened., A mad craving came over him., He lit a cigarette and then threw it away., His eyelids drooped till
the long fringed lashes almost touched his cheek., But he still watched
the cabinet., At last he got up from the sofa on which he had been
lying, went over to it, and having unlocked it, touched some hidden
spring., A triangular drawer passed slowly out., His fingers moved
instinctively towards it, dipped in, and closed on something., It was a
small Chinese box of black and gold-dust lacquer, elaborately wrought,
the sides patterned with curved waves, and the silken cords hung with
round crystals and tasselled in plaited metal threads., He opened it., Inside was a green paste, waxy in lustre, the odour curiously heavy and
persistent., He hesitated for some moments, with a strangely immobile smile upon his
face., Then shivering, though the atmosphere of the room was terribly
hot, he drew himself up and glanced at the clock., It was twenty
minutes to twelve., He put the box back, shutting the cabinet doors as
he did so, and went into his bedroom., As midnight was striking bronze blows upon the dusky air, Dorian Gray,
dressed commonly, and with a muffler wrapped round his throat, crept
quietly out of his house., In Bond Street he found a hansom with a good
horse., He hailed it and in a low voice gave the driver an address., The man shook his head., ""It is too far for me,"" he muttered., ""Here is a sovereign for you,"" said Dorian., ""You shall have another if
you drive fast."", ""All right, sir,"" answered the man, ""you will be there in an hour,"" and
after his fare had got in he turned his horse round and drove rapidly
towards the river., A cold rain began to fall, and the blurred street-lamps looked ghastly
in the dripping mist., The public-houses were just closing, and dim men
and women were clustering in broken groups round their doors., From
some of the bars came the sound of horrible laughter., In others,
drunkards brawled and screamed., Lying back in the hansom, with his hat pulled over his forehead, Dorian
Gray watched with listless eyes the sordid shame of the great city, and
now and then he repeated to himself the words that Lord Henry had said
to him on the first day they had met, ""To cure the soul by means of the
senses, and the senses by means of the soul."", Yes, that was the
secret., He had often tried it, and would try it again now., There were
opium dens where one could buy oblivion, dens of horror where the
memory of old sins could be destroyed by the madness of sins that were
new., The moon hung low in the sky like a yellow skull., From time to time a
huge misshapen cloud stretched a long arm across and hid it., The
gas-lamps grew fewer, and the streets more narrow and gloomy., Once the
man lost his way and had to drive back half a mile., A steam rose from
the horse as it splashed up the puddles., The sidewindows of the hansom
were clogged with a grey-flannel mist., ""To cure the soul by means of the senses, and the senses by means of
the soul!"", How the words rang in his ears!, His soul, certainly, was
sick to death., Was it true that the senses could cure it?, Innocent
blood had been spilled., What could atone for that?, Ah!, for that there
was no atonement; but though forgiveness was impossible, forgetfulness
was possible still, and he was determined to forget, to stamp the thing
out, to crush it as one would crush the adder that had stung one., Indeed, what right had Basil to have spoken to him as he had done?, Who
had made him a judge over others?, He had said things that were
dreadful, horrible, not to be endured., On and on plodded the hansom, going slower, it seemed to him, at each
step., He thrust up the trap and called to the man to drive faster., The hideous hunger for opium began to gnaw at him., His throat burned
and his delicate hands twitched nervously together., He struck at the
horse madly with his stick., The driver laughed and whipped up., He
laughed in answer, and the man was silent., The way seemed interminable, and the streets like the black web of some
sprawling spider., The monotony became unbearable, and as the mist
thickened, he felt afraid., Then they passed by lonely brickfields., ...]"|2
24|"[""Ugliness is one of the seven deadly virtues, Gladys., You, as a good
Tory, must not underrate them., Beer, the Bible, and the seven deadly
virtues have made our England what she is."", ""You don't like your country, then?"", she asked., ""I live in it."", ""That you may censure it the better."", ""Would you have me take the verdict of Europe on it?"", he inquired., ""What do they say of us?"", ""That Tartuffe has emigrated to England and opened a shop."", ""Is that yours, Harry?"", ""I give it to you."", ""I could not use it., It is too true."", ""You need not be afraid., Our countrymen never recognize a description."", ""They are practical."", ""They are more cunning than practical., When they make up their ledger,
they balance stupidity by wealth, and vice by hypocrisy."", ""Still, we have done great things."", ""Great things have been thrust on us, Gladys."", ""We have carried their burden."", ""Only as far as the Stock Exchange."", She shook her head., ""I believe in the race,"" she cried., ""It represents the survival of the pushing."", ""It has development."", ""Decay fascinates me more."", ""What of art?"", she asked., ""It is a malady."", ""Love?"", ""An illusion."", ""Religion?"", ""The fashionable substitute for belief."", ""You are a sceptic."", ""Never!, Scepticism is the beginning of faith."", ""What are you?"", ""To define is to limit."", ""Give me a clue."", ""Threads snap., You would lose your way in the labyrinth."", ""You bewilder me., Let us talk of some one else."", ""Our host is a delightful topic., Years ago he was christened Prince
Charming."", ""Ah!, don't remind me of that,"" cried Dorian Gray., ""Our host is rather horrid this evening,"" answered the duchess,
colouring., ""I believe he thinks that Monmouth married me on purely
scientific principles as the best specimen he could find of a modern
butterfly."", ""Well, I hope he won't stick pins into you, Duchess,"" laughed Dorian., ""Oh!, my maid does that already, Mr. Gray, when she is annoyed with me."", ""And what does she get annoyed with you about, Duchess?"", ""For the most trivial things, Mr. Gray, I assure you., Usually because
I come in at ten minutes to nine and tell her that I must be dressed by
half-past eight."", ""How unreasonable of her!, You should give her warning."", ""I daren't, Mr. Gray., Why, she invents hats for me., You remember the
one I wore at Lady Hilstone's garden-party?, You don't, but it is nice
of you to pretend that you do., Well, she made it out of nothing., All
good hats are made out of nothing."", ""Like all good reputations, Gladys,"" interrupted Lord Henry., ""Every
effect that one produces gives one an enemy., To be popular one must be
a mediocrity."", ""Not with women,"" said the duchess, shaking her head; ""and women rule
the world., I assure you we can't bear mediocrities., We women, as some
one says, love with our ears, just as you men love with your eyes, if
you ever love at all."", ""It seems to me that we never do anything else,"" murmured Dorian., ""Ah!, then, you never really love, Mr. Gray,"" answered the duchess with
mock sadness., ""My dear Gladys!"", cried Lord Henry., ""How can you say that?, Romance
lives by repetition, and repetition converts an appetite into an art., Besides, each time that one loves is the only time one has ever loved., Difference of object does not alter singleness of passion., It merely
intensifies it., We can have in life but one great experience at best,
and the secret of life is to reproduce that experience as often as
possible."", ""Even when one has been wounded by it, Harry?"", asked the duchess after
a pause., ""Especially when one has been wounded by it,"" answered Lord Henry., The duchess turned and looked at Dorian Gray with a curious expression
in her eyes., ""What do you say to that, Mr., Gray?"", she inquired., Dorian hesitated for a moment., Then he threw his head back and
laughed., ""I always agree with Harry, Duchess."", ""Even when he is wrong?"", ""Harry is never wrong, Duchess."", ""And does his philosophy make you happy?"", ""I have never searched for happiness., Who wants happiness?, I have
searched for pleasure."", ""And found it, Mr., ...]"|2
25|"[""I wish I knew,"" she said at last., He shook his head., ""Knowledge would be fatal., It is the uncertainty
that charms one., A mist makes things wonderful."", ""One may lose one's way."", ""All ways end at the same point, my dear Gladys."", ""What is that?"", ""Disillusion."", ""It was my _debut_ in life,"" she sighed., ""It came to you crowned."", ""I am tired of strawberry leaves."", ""They become you."", ""Only in public."", ""You would miss them,"" said Lord Henry., ""I will not part with a petal."", ""Monmouth has ears."", ""Old age is dull of hearing."", ""Has he never been jealous?"", ""I wish he had been."", He glanced about as if in search of something., ""What are you looking
for?"", she inquired., ""The button from your foil,"" he answered., ""You have dropped it."", She laughed., ""I have still the mask."", ""It makes your eyes lovelier,"" was his reply., She laughed again., Her teeth showed like white seeds in a scarlet
fruit., Upstairs, in his own room, Dorian Gray was lying on a sofa, with terror
in every tingling fibre of his body., Life had suddenly become too
hideous a burden for him to bear., The dreadful death of the unlucky
beater, shot in the thicket like a wild animal, had seemed to him to
pre-figure death for himself also., He had nearly swooned at what Lord
Henry had said in a chance mood of cynical jesting., At five o'clock he rang his bell for his servant and gave him orders to
pack his things for the night-express to town, and to have the brougham
at the door by eight-thirty., He was determined not to sleep another
night at Selby Royal., It was an ill-omened place., Death walked there
in the sunlight., The grass of the forest had been spotted with blood., Then he wrote a note to Lord Henry, telling him that he was going up to
town to consult his doctor and asking him to entertain his guests in
his absence., As he was putting it into the envelope, a knock came to
the door, and his valet informed him that the head-keeper wished to see
him., He frowned and bit his lip., ""Send him in,"" he muttered, after
some moments' hesitation., As soon as the man entered, Dorian pulled his chequebook out of a
drawer and spread it out before him., ""I suppose you have come about the unfortunate accident of this
morning, Thornton?"", he said, taking up a pen., ""Yes, sir,"" answered the gamekeeper., ""Was the poor fellow married?, Had he any people dependent on him?"", asked Dorian, looking bored., ""If so, I should not like them to be left
in want, and will send them any sum of money you may think necessary."", ""We don't know who he is, sir., That is what I took the liberty of
coming to you about."", ""Don't know who he is?"", said Dorian, listlessly., ""What do you mean?, Wasn't he one of your men?"", ""No, sir., Never saw him before., Seems like a sailor, sir."", The pen dropped from Dorian Gray's hand, and he felt as if his heart
had suddenly stopped beating., ""A sailor?"", he cried out., ""Did you say
a sailor?"", ""Yes, sir., He looks as if he had been a sort of sailor; tattooed on
both arms, and that kind of thing."", ""Was there anything found on him?"", said Dorian, leaning forward and
looking at the man with startled eyes., ""Anything that would tell his
name?"", ""Some money, sir--not much, and a six-shooter., There was no name of any
kind., A decent-looking man, sir, but rough-like., A sort of sailor we
think."", Dorian started to his feet., A terrible hope fluttered past him., He
clutched at it madly., ""Where is the body?"", he exclaimed., ""Quick!, I
must see it at once."", ""It is in an empty stable in the Home Farm, sir., The folk don't like
to have that sort of thing in their houses., They say a corpse brings
bad luck."", ""The Home Farm!, Go there at once and meet me., Tell one of the grooms
to bring my horse round., No., Never mind., I'll go to the stables
myself., It will save time."", In less than a quarter of an hour, Dorian Gray was galloping down the
long avenue as hard as he could go., The trees seemed to sweep past him
in spectral procession, and wild shadows to fling themselves across his
path., Once the mare swerved at a white gate-post and nearly threw him., He lashed her across the neck with his crop., She cleft the dusky air
like an arrow., The stones flew from her hoofs., At last he reached the Home Farm., Two men were loitering in the yard., He leaped from the saddle and threw the reins to one of them., In the
farthest stable a light was glimmering., ...]"|2
26|"[You have set yourself to
music., Your days are your sonnets."", Dorian rose up from the piano and passed his hand through his hair., ""Yes, life has been exquisite,"" he murmured, ""but I am not going to
have the same life, Harry., And you must not say these extravagant
things to me., You don't know everything about me., I think that if you
did, even you would turn from me., You laugh., Don't laugh."", ""Why have you stopped playing, Dorian?, Go back and give me the
nocturne over again., Look at that great, honey-coloured moon that
hangs in the dusky air., She is waiting for you to charm her, and if
you play she will come closer to the earth., You won't?, Let us go to
the club, then., It has been a charming evening, and we must end it
charmingly., There is some one at White's who wants immensely to know
you--young Lord Poole, Bournemouth's eldest son., He has already copied
your neckties, and has begged me to introduce him to you., He is quite
delightful and rather reminds me of you."", ""I hope not,"" said Dorian with a sad look in his eyes., ""But I am tired
to-night, Harry., I shan't go to the club., It is nearly eleven, and I
want to go to bed early."", ""Do stay., You have never played so well as to-night., There was
something in your touch that was wonderful., It had more expression
than I had ever heard from it before."", ""It is because I am going to be good,"" he answered, smiling., ""I am a
little changed already."", ""You cannot change to me, Dorian,"" said Lord Henry., ""You and I will
always be friends."", ""Yet you poisoned me with a book once., I should not forgive that., Harry, promise me that you will never lend that book to any one., It
does harm."", ""My dear boy, you are really beginning to moralize., You will soon be
going about like the converted, and the revivalist, warning people
against all the sins of which you have grown tired., You are much too
delightful to do that., Besides, it is no use., You and I are what we
are, and will be what we will be., As for being poisoned by a book,
there is no such thing as that., Art has no influence upon action., It
annihilates the desire to act., It is superbly sterile., The books that
the world calls immoral are books that show the world its own shame., That is all., But we won't discuss literature., Come round to-morrow., I
am going to ride at eleven., We might go together, and I will take you
to lunch afterwards with Lady Branksome., She is a charming woman, and
wants to consult you about some tapestries she is thinking of buying., Mind you come., Or shall we lunch with our little duchess?, She says
she never sees you now., Perhaps you are tired of Gladys?, I thought
you would be., Her clever tongue gets on one's nerves., Well, in any
case, be here at eleven."", ""Must I really come, Harry?"", ""Certainly., The park is quite lovely now., I don't think there have
been such lilacs since the year I met you."", ""Very well., I shall be here at eleven,"" said Dorian., ""Good night,
Harry."", As he reached the door, he hesitated for a moment, as if he
had something more to say., Then he sighed and went out., It was a lovely night, so warm that he threw his coat over his arm and
did not even put his silk scarf round his throat., As he strolled home,
smoking his cigarette, two young men in evening dress passed him., He
heard one of them whisper to the other, ""That is Dorian Gray."", He
remembered how pleased he used to be when he was pointed out, or stared
at, or talked about., He was tired of hearing his own name now., Half
the charm of the little village where he had been so often lately was
that no one knew who he was., He had often told the girl whom he had
lured to love him that he was poor, and she had believed him., He had
told her once that he was wicked, and she had laughed at him and
answered that wicked people were always very old and very ugly., What a
laugh she had!--just like a thrush singing., And how pretty she had
been in her cotton dresses and her large hats!, She knew nothing, but
she had everything that he had lost., When he reached home, he found his servant waiting up for him., He sent
him to bed, and threw himself down on the sofa in the library, and
began to think over some of the things that Lord Henry had said to him., Was it really true that one could never change?, He felt a wild longing
for the unstained purity of his boyhood--his rose-white boyhood, as
Lord Henry had once called it., He knew that he had tarnished himself,
filled his mind with corruption and given horror to his fancy; that he
had been an evil influence to others, and had experienced a terrible
joy in being so; and that of the lives that had crossed his own, it had
been the fairest and the most full of promise that he had brought to
shame., But was it all irretrievable?, Was there no hope for him?, Ah!, in what a monstrous moment of pride and passion he had prayed that
the portrait should bear the burden of his days, and he keep the
unsullied splendour of eternal youth!, All his failure had been due to
that., Better for him that each sin of his life had brought its sure
swift penalty along with it., There was purification in punishment., Not ""Forgive us our sins"" but ""Smite us for our iniquities"" should be
the prayer of man to a most just God., The curiously carved mirror that Lord Henry had given to him, so many
years ago now, was standing on the table, and the white-limbed Cupids
laughed round it as of old., He took it up, as he had done on that
night of horror when he had first noted the change in the fatal
picture, and with wild, tear-dimmed eyes looked into its polished
shield., Once, some one who had terribly loved him had written to him a
mad letter, ending with these idolatrous words: ""The world is changed
because you are made of ivory and gold., The curves of your lips
rewrite history."", The phrases came back to his memory, and he repeated
them over and over to himself., Then he loathed his own beauty, and

beneath his heel., It was his beauty that had ruined him, his beauty

mask, his youth but a mockery., ...]"|2

   Ay!, once;
   In mean attire, like a vineyard dresser,
   I stole to Rimini., GUIDO [_taking his hand_]

   O generous heart!, MORANZONE

   One can buy everything in Rimini,
   And so I bought the gaolers!, when your father
   Heard that a man child had been born to him,
   His noble face lit up beneath his helm
   Like a great fire seen far out at sea,
   And taking my two hands, he bade me, Guido,
   To rear you worthy of him; so I have reared you
   To revenge his death upon the friend who sold him., GUIDO

   Thou hast done well; I for my father thank thee., And now his name?, MORANZONE

   Are coming hither., GUIDO

   Of honourable, honest gentlemen?, GUIDO

other gentlemen of his Court_.], MORANZONE [_quickly_]

   Is he who sold your father!, mark me well., GUIDO [_clutches hit dagger_]

   Leave off that fingering of thy knife., Hast thou so soon forgotten?, [_Kneels to the_ DUKE.], My noble Lord., DUKE

   Welcome, Count Moranzone; ?tis some time
   Since we have seen you here in Padua., We hunted near your castle yesterday?, Call you it castle?, that bleak house of yours
   Wherein you sit a-mumbling o?er your beads,
   Telling your vices like a good old man., [_Catches sight of_ GUIDO _and starts back_.], Who is that?, MORANZONE

   My sister?s son, your Grace,
   Who being now of age to carry arms,
   Would for a season tarry at your Court

DUKE [_still looking at_ GUIDO]

   What is his name?, MORANZONE

   Guido Ferranti, sir., DUKE

   His city?, MORANZONE

   He is Mantuan by birth., DUKE [_advancing towards_ GUIDO]

   You have the eyes of one I used to know,
   But he died childless., Are you honest, boy?, Then be not spendthrift of your honesty,
   But keep it to yourself; in Padua
   Men think that honesty is ostentatious, so
   It is not of the fashion., Look at these lords., COUNT BARDI [_aside_]

   Here is some bitter arrow for us, sure., DUKE

   Why, every man among them has his price,
   Although, to do them justice, some of them
   Are quite expensive., COUNT BARDI [_aside_]

   There it comes indeed., DUKE

   So be not honest; eccentricity
   Is not a thing should ever be encouraged,
   Although, in this dull stupid age of ours,
   The most eccentric thing a man can do
   Is to have brains, then the mob mocks at him;
   And for the mob, despise it as I do,
   I hold its bubble praise and windy favours
   In such account, that popularity
   Is the one insult I have never suffered., MAFFIO [_aside_]

   He has enough of hate, if he needs that., DUKE

   Have prudence; in your dealings with the world
   Be not too hasty; act on the second thought,
   First impulses are generally good., GUIDO [_aside_]

   Surely a toad sits on his lips, and spills its venom there., DUKE

   See thou hast enemies,
   Else will the world think very little of thee;
   It is its test of power; yet see thou show?st
   A smiling mask of friendship to all men,
   Until thou hast them safely in thy grip,
   Then thou canst crush them., GUIDO [_aside_]

   O wise philosopher!, That for thyself dost dig so deep a grave., MORANZONE [_to him_]

   Dost thou mark his words?, GUIDO

   Oh, be thou sure I do., DUKE

   And be not over-scrupulous; clean hands
   With nothing in them make a sorry show., If you would have the lion?s share of life
   You must wear the fox?s skin., Oh, it will fit you;
   It is a coat which fitteth every man., GUIDO

   Your Grace, I shall remember., DUKE

   That is well, boy, well., I would not have about me shallow fools,
   Who with mean scruples weigh the gold of life,
   And faltering, paltering, end by failure; failure,
   The only crime which I have not committed:
   I would have _men_ about me., As for conscience,
   Conscience is but the name which cowardice
   Fleeing from battle scrawls upon its shield., You understand me, boy?, GUIDO

   I do, your Grace,
   And will in all things carry out the creed
   Which you have taught me., MAFFIO

   I never heard your Grace
   So much in the vein for preaching; let the Cardinal
   Look to his laurels, sir., DUKE

   The Cardinal!, Men follow my creed, and they gabble his., I do not think much of the Cardinal;
   Although he is a holy churchman, and
   I quite admit his dulness., Well, sir, from now
   We count you of our household

horror_, _but at a gesture from_ COUNT MORANZONE, _kneels and kisses
it_.], We will see
   That you are furnished with such equipage
   As doth befit your honour and our state., GUIDO

   I thank your Grace most heartily., DUKE

   Tell me again

   Guido Ferranti, sir., DUKE

   And you are Mantuan?, Look to your wives, my lords,
   When such a gallant comes to Padua., Thou dost well to laugh, Count Bardi; I have noted
   How merry is that husband by whose hearth
   Sits an uncomely wife., MAFFIO

   May it please your Grace,
   The wives of Padua are above suspicion., DUKE

   What, are they so ill-favoured!, Let us go,
   This Cardinal detains our pious Duchess;
   His sermon and his beard want cutting both:
   Will you come with us, sir, and hear a text
   From holy Jerome?, MORANZONE [_bowing_]

   My liege, there are some matters?, DUKE [_interrupting_]

   Thou need?st make no excuse for missing mass., Come, gentlemen., [_Exit with his suite into Cathedral_.], GUIDO [_after a pause_]

   So the Duke sold my father;
   I kissed his hand., MORANZONE

   Thou shalt do that many times., GUIDO

   Must it be so?, MORANZONE

   Ay!, thou hast sworn an oath., GUIDO

   That oath shall make me marble., MORANZONE

   Farewell, boy,
   Thou wilt not see me till the time is ripe., GUIDO

   I pray thou comest quickly., MORANZONE

   I will come
   When it is time; be ready., GUIDO

   Fear me not., MORANZONE

   Here is your friend; see that you banish him
   Both from your heart and Padua., GUIDO

   From Padua,
   Not from my heart., MORANZONE

   Nay, from thy heart as well,
   I will not leave thee till I see thee do it., GUIDO

   Can I have no friend?, MORANZONE

   Revenge shall be thy friend;
   Thou need?st no other., GUIDO

   Well, then be it so., [_Enter_ ASCANIO CRISTOFANO.], ASCANIO

   Come, Guido, I have been beforehand with you in everything, for I have
   drunk a flagon of wine, eaten a pasty, and kissed the maid who served
   it., Why, you look as melancholy as a schoolboy who cannot buy apples,
   or a politician who cannot sell his vote., What news, Guido, what
   news?, GUIDO

   Why, that we two must part, Ascanio., ASCANIO

   I am afraid that is impossible., [_The_ DUCHESS _hands him a ring_,

   Soldiers_.], Stand without there., [_Exeunt the Soldiers_.], DUCHESS

   Officer, your men are somewhat rough., FIRST SOLDIER

   They mean no harm., DUCHESS

   I shall be going back in a few minutes., As I pass through the
   corridor do not let them try and lift my mask., FIRST SOLDIER

   You need not be afraid, madam., DUCHESS

   I have a particular reason for wishing my face not to be seen., FIRST SOLDIER

   Madam, with this ring you can go in and out as you please; it is the
   Duchess?s own ring., DUCHESS

   Leave us., [_The Soldier turns to go out_.], A moment, sir., For what
   hour is ., ., ., FIRST SOLDIER

   At twelve o?clock, madam, we have orders to lead him out; but I dare
   say he won?t wait for us; he?s more like to take a drink out of that
   poison yonder., Men are afraid of the headsman., DUCHESS

   Is that poison?, FIRST SOLDIER

   Ay, madam, and very sure poison too., DUCHESS

   You may go, sir., FIRST SOLDIER

   By Saint James, a pretty hand!, I wonder who she is., Some woman who
   loved him, perhaps., [_Exit_.], DUCHESS [_taking her mark off_]

   At last!, He can escape now in this cloak and vizard,
   We are of a height almost: they will not know him;
   As for myself what matter?, So that he does not curse me as he goes,
   I care but little: I wonder will he curse me., He has the right., It is eleven now;
   They will not come till twelve., [_Goes over to the table_.], So this is poison., Is it not strange that in this liquor here
   There lies the key to all philosophies?, [_Takes the cup up_.], It smells of poppies., I remember well
   That, when I was a child in Sicily,
   I took the scarlet poppies from the corn,
   And made a little wreath, and my grave uncle,
   Don John of Naples, laughed: I did not know
   That they had power to stay the springs of life,
   To make the pulse cease beating, and to chill
   The blood in its own vessels, till men come
   And with a hook hale the poor body out,
   And throw it in a ditch: the body, ay,?, What of the soul?, that goes to heaven or hell., Where will mine go?, [_Takes the torch from the wall_, _and goes over to the bed_.], How peacefully here he sleeps,
   Like a young schoolboy tired out with play:
   I would that I could sleep so peacefully,
   But I have dreams., [_Bending over him_.], Poor boy: what if I kissed him?, No, no, my lips would burn him like a fire., He has had enough of Love., Still that white neck
   Will ?scape the headsman: I have seen to that:
   He will get hence from Padua to-night,
   And that is well., You are very wise, Lord Justices,
   And yet you are not half so wise as I am,
   And that is well., O God!, how I have loved you,
   And what a bloody flower did Love bear!, [_Comes back to the table_.], What if I drank these juices, and so ceased?, Were it not better than to wait till Death
   Come to my bed with all his serving men,
   Remorse, disease, old age, and misery?, I wonder does one suffer much: I think
   That I am very young to die like this,
   But so it must be., Why, why should I die?, He will escape to-night, and so his blood
   Will not be on my head., No, I must die;
   I have been guilty, therefore I must die;
   He loves me not, and therefore I must die:
   I would die happier if he would kiss me,
   But he will not do that., I did not know him., I thought he meant to sell me to the Judge;
   That is not strange; we women never know
   Our lovers till they leave us., [_Bell begins to toll_.], Thou vile bell,
   That like a bloodhound from thy brazen throat
   Call?st for this man?s life, cease!, thou shalt not get it., He stirs?I must be quick:  [_Takes up cup_.], O Love, Love, Love,
   I did not think that I would pledge thee thus!, [_Drinks poison_, _and sets the cup down on the table behind her_: _the
noise wakens_ GUIDO, _who starts up_, _and does not see what she has
done_., _There is silence for a minute_, _each looking at the other_.], I do not come to ask your pardon now,
   Seeing I know I stand beyond all pardon;
   Enough of that: I have already, sir,
   Confessed my sin to the Lords Justices;
   They would not listen to me: and some said
   I did invent a tale to save your life;
   You have trafficked with me; others said
   That women played with pity as with men;
   Others that grief for my slain Lord and husband
   Had robbed me of my wits: they would not hear me,
   And, when I sware it on the holy book,
   They bade the doctor cure me., They are ten,
   Ten against one, and they possess your life., They call me Duchess here in Padua., I do not know, sir; if I be the Duchess,
   I wrote your pardon, and they would not take it;
   They call it treason, say I taught them that;
   Maybe I did., Within an hour, Guido,
   They will be here, and drag you from the cell,
   And bind your hands behind your back, and bid you
   Kneel at the block: I am before them there;
   Here is the signet ring of Padua,
   ?Twill bring you safely through the men on guard;
   There is my cloak and vizard; they have orders
   Not to be curious: when you pass the gate
   Turn to the left, and at the second bridge
   You will find horses waiting: by to-morrow
   You will be at Venice, safe., [_A pause_.], Do you not speak?, Will you not even curse me ere you go??, ...]"|2
31|"[Jack., How perfectly delightful!, Algernon., Yes, that is all very well; but I am afraid Aunt Augusta won't
quite approve of your being here., Jack., May I ask why?, Algernon., My dear fellow, the way you flirt with Gwendolen is perfectly
disgraceful., It is almost as bad as the way Gwendolen flirts with you., Jack., I am in love with Gwendolen., I have come up to town expressly to
propose to her., Algernon., I thought you had come up for pleasure?, ., ., ., I call that
business., Jack., How utterly unromantic you are!, Algernon., I really don't see anything romantic in proposing., It is very
romantic to be in love., But there is nothing romantic about a definite
proposal., Why, one may be accepted., One usually is, I believe., Then
the excitement is all over., The very essence of romance is uncertainty., If ever I get married, I'll certainly try to forget the fact., Jack., I have no doubt about that, dear Algy., The Divorce Court was
specially invented for people whose memories are so curiously
constituted., Algernon., Oh!, there is no use speculating on that subject., Divorces are
made in Heaven--[Jack puts out his hand to take a sandwich., Algernon at
once interferes.], Please don't touch the cucumber sandwiches., They are
ordered specially for Aunt Augusta., [Takes one and eats it.], Jack., Well, you have been eating them all the time., Algernon., That is quite a different matter., She is my aunt., [Takes
plate from below.], Have some bread and butter., The bread and butter is
for Gwendolen., Gwendolen is devoted to bread and butter., Jack., [Advancing to table and helping himself.], And very good bread and
butter it is too., Algernon., Well, my dear fellow, you need not eat as if you were going to
eat it all., You behave as if you were married to her already., You are
not married to her already, and I don't think you ever will be., Jack., Why on earth do you say that?, Algernon., Well, in the first place girls never marry the men they flirt
with., Girls don't think it right., Jack., Oh, that is nonsense!, Algernon., It isn't., It is a great truth., It accounts for the
extraordinary number of bachelors that one sees all over the place., In
the second place, I don't give my consent., Jack., Your consent!, Algernon., My dear fellow, Gwendolen is my first cousin., And before I
allow you to marry her, you will have to clear up the whole question of
Cecily., [Rings bell.], Jack., Cecily!, What on earth do you mean?, What do you mean, Algy, by
Cecily!, I don't know any one of the name of Cecily., [Enter Lane.], Algernon., Bring me that cigarette case Mr. Worthing left in the smoking-
room the last time he dined here., Lane., Yes, sir., [Lane goes out.], Jack., Do you mean to say you have had my cigarette case all this time?, I
wish to goodness you had let me know., I have been writing frantic
letters to Scotland Yard about it., I was very nearly offering a large
reward., Algernon., Well, I wish you would offer one., I happen to be more than
usually hard up., Jack., There is no good offering a large reward now that the thing is
found., [Enter Lane with the cigarette case on a salver., Algernon takes it at
once., Lane goes out.], Algernon., I think that is rather mean of you, Ernest, I must say., ...]"|2
32|"[[Exchanges glances with
Jack.], They seem to think I should be with him., Lady Bracknell., It is very strange., This Mr. Bunbury seems to suffer
from curiously bad health., Algernon., Yes; poor Bunbury is a dreadful invalid., Lady Bracknell., Well, I must say, Algernon, that I think it is high time
that Mr. Bunbury made up his mind whether he was going to live or to die., This shilly-shallying with the question is absurd., Nor do I in any way
approve of the modern sympathy with invalids., I consider it morbid., Illness of any kind is hardly a thing to be encouraged in others., Health
is the primary duty of life., I am always telling that to your poor
uncle, but he never seems to take much notice ., ., ., as far as any
improvement in his ailment goes., I should be much obliged if you would
ask Mr. Bunbury, from me, to be kind enough not to have a relapse on
Saturday, for I rely on you to arrange my music for me., It is my last
reception, and one wants something that will encourage conversation,
particularly at the end of the season when every one has practically said
whatever they had to say, which, in most cases, was probably not much., Algernon., I'll speak to Bunbury, Aunt Augusta, if he is still conscious,
and I think I can promise you he'll be all right by Saturday., Of course
the music is a great difficulty., You see, if one plays good music,
people don't listen, and if one plays bad music people don't talk., But
I'll run over the programme I've drawn out, if you will kindly come into
the next room for a moment., Lady Bracknell., Thank you, Algernon., It is very thoughtful of you., [Rising, and following Algernon.], I'm sure the programme will be
delightful, after a few expurgations., French songs I cannot possibly
allow., People always seem to think that they are improper, and either
look shocked, which is vulgar, or laugh, which is worse., But German
sounds a thoroughly respectable language, and indeed, I believe is so., Gwendolen, you will accompany me., Gwendolen., Certainly, mamma., [Lady Bracknell and Algernon go into the music-room, Gwendolen remains
behind.], Jack., Charming day it has been, Miss Fairfax., Gwendolen., Pray don't talk to me about the weather, Mr. Worthing., Whenever people talk to me about the weather, I always feel quite certain
that they mean something else., And that makes me so nervous., Jack., I do mean something else., Gwendolen., I thought so., In fact, I am never wrong., Jack., And I would like to be allowed to take advantage of Lady
Bracknell's temporary absence ., ., ., Gwendolen., I would certainly advise you to do so., Mamma has a way of
coming back suddenly into a room that I have often had to speak to her
about., Jack., [Nervously.], Miss Fairfax, ever since I met you I have admired
you more than any girl ., ., ., I have ever met since ., ., ., I met you., Gwendolen., Yes, I am quite well aware of the fact., And I often wish
that in public, at any rate, you had been more demonstrative., For me you
have always had an irresistible fascination., Even before I met you I was
far from indifferent to you., [Jack looks at her in amazement.], We live,
as I hope you know, Mr. Worthing, in an age of ideals., The fact is
constantly mentioned in the more expensive monthly magazines, and has
reached the provincial pulpits, I am told; and my ideal has always been
to love some one of the name of Ernest., There is something in that name
that inspires absolute confidence., The moment Algernon first mentioned
to me that he had a friend called Ernest, I knew I was destined to love
you., Jack., You really love me, Gwendolen?, Gwendolen., Passionately!, Jack., Darling!, You don't know how happy you've made me., Gwendolen., My own Ernest!, Jack., But you don't really mean to say that you couldn't love me if my
name wasn't Ernest?, Gwendolen., But your name is Ernest., Jack., Yes, I know it is., But supposing it was something else?, Do you
mean to say you couldn't love me then?, Gwendolen., [Glibly.], Ah!, that is clearly a metaphysical speculation,
and like most metaphysical speculations has very little reference at all
to the actual facts of real life, as we know them., Jack., Personally, darling, to speak quite candidly, I don't much care
about the name of Ernest ., ., ., I don't think the name suits me at all., ...]"|2
33|"[Never
met such a Gorgon ., ., ., I don't really know what a Gorgon is like, but I
am quite sure that Lady Bracknell is one., In any case, she is a monster,
without being a myth, which is rather unfair ., ., ., I beg your pardon,
Algy, I suppose I shouldn't talk about your own aunt in that way before
you., Algernon., My dear boy, I love hearing my relations abused., It is the
only thing that makes me put up with them at all., Relations are simply a
tedious pack of people, who haven't got the remotest knowledge of how to
live, nor the smallest instinct about when to die., Jack., Oh, that is nonsense!, Algernon., It isn't!, Jack., Well, I won't argue about the matter., You always want to argue
about things., Algernon., That is exactly what things were originally made for., Jack., Upon my word, if I thought that, I'd shoot myself ., ., ., [A pause.], You don't think there is any chance of Gwendolen becoming like her mother
in about a hundred and fifty years, do you, Algy?, Algernon., All women become like their mothers., That is their tragedy., No man does., That's his., Jack., Is that clever?, Algernon., It is perfectly phrased!, and quite as true as any observation
in civilised life should be., Jack., I am sick to death of cleverness., Everybody is clever nowadays., You can't go anywhere without meeting clever people., The thing has
become an absolute public nuisance., I wish to goodness we had a few
fools left., Algernon., We have., Jack., I should extremely like to meet them., What do they talk about?, Algernon., The fools?, Oh!, about the clever people, of course., Jack., What fools!, Algernon., By the way, did you tell Gwendolen the truth about your being
Ernest in town, and Jack in the country?, Jack., [In a very patronising manner.], My dear fellow, the truth isn't
quite the sort of thing one tells to a nice, sweet, refined girl., What
extraordinary ideas you have about the way to behave to a woman!, Algernon., The only way to behave to a woman is to make love to her, if
she is pretty, and to some one else, if she is plain., Jack., Oh, that is nonsense., Algernon., What about your brother?, What about the profligate Ernest?, Jack., Oh, before the end of the week I shall have got rid of him., I'll
say he died in Paris of apoplexy., Lots of people die of apoplexy, quite
suddenly, don't they?, Algernon., Yes, but it's hereditary, my dear fellow., It's a sort of
thing that runs in families., You had much better say a severe chill., Jack., You are sure a severe chill isn't hereditary, or anything of that
kind?, Algernon., Of course it isn't!, Jack., Very well, then., My poor brother Ernest to carried off suddenly,
in Paris, by a severe chill., That gets rid of him., Algernon., But I thought you said that ., ., ., Miss Cardew was a little too
much interested in your poor brother Ernest?, Won't she feel his loss a
good deal?, Jack., Oh, that is all right., Cecily is not a silly romantic girl, I am
glad to say., She has got a capital appetite, goes long walks, and pays
no attention at all to her lessons., Algernon., I would rather like to see Cecily., Jack., I will take very good care you never do., She is excessively
pretty, and she is only just eighteen., Algernon., Have you told Gwendolen yet that you have an excessively
pretty ward who is only just eighteen?, ...]"|2

problems have their melodramatic side., [Goes down the garden with Dr., Chasuble.], Cecily., [Picks up books and throws them back on table.], Horrid

speak to you privately for a moment., Cecily., Ask Mr. Ernest Worthing to come here., I suppose you had better
talk to the housekeeper about a room for him., Merriman., Yes, Miss., [Merriman goes off.], Cecily., I have never met any really wicked person before., I feel rather
frightened., I am so afraid he will look just like every one else., [Enter Algernon, very gay and debonnair.], He does!, Algernon., [Raising his hat.], You are my little cousin Cecily, I'm sure., Cecily., You are under some strange mistake., I am not little., In fact,
I believe I am more than usually tall for my age., [Algernon is rather
taken aback.], But I am your cousin Cecily., You, I see from your card,
are Uncle Jack's brother, my cousin Ernest, my wicked cousin Ernest., Algernon., Oh!, I am not really wicked at all, cousin Cecily., You mustn't
think that I am wicked., Cecily., If you are not, then you have certainly been deceiving us all in
a very inexcusable manner., I hope you have not been leading a double
life, pretending to be wicked and being really good all the time., That
would be hypocrisy., Algernon., [Looks at her in amazement.], Oh!, Of course I have been
rather reckless., Cecily., I am glad to hear it., Algernon., In fact, now you mention the subject, I have been very bad in

it must have been very pleasant., Algernon., It is much pleasanter being here with you., Cecily., I can't understand how you are here at all., Uncle Jack won't be

business engagement, if one wants to retain any sense of the beauty of
life, but still I think you had better wait till Uncle Jack arrives., I
know he wants to speak to you about your emigrating., Algernon., About my what?, Cecily., Your emigrating., He has gone up to buy your outfit., Algernon., I certainly wouldn't let Jack buy my outfit., He has no taste

about anything else., It is enough to drive one perfectly frantic., Algernon., Of course I admit that the faults were all on my side., But I

entirely unknown., I think that is quite as it should be., The home seems
to me to be the proper sphere for the man., And certainly once a man
begins to neglect his domestic duties he becomes painfully effeminate,

say, one should always be quite candid., Gwendolen., Well, to speak with perfect candour, Cecily, I wish that you
were fully forty-two, and more than usually plain for your age., Ernest
has a strong upright nature., He is the very soul of truth and honour., Disloyalty would be as impossible to him as deception., But even men of
the noblest possible moral character are extremely susceptible to the
influence of the physical charms of others., Modern, no less than Ancient
History, supplies us with many most painful examples of what I refer to., If it were not so, indeed, History would be quite unreadable., Cecily., I beg your pardon, Gwendolen, did you say Ernest?, Gwendolen., Yes., Cecily., Oh, but it is not Mr. Ernest Worthing who is my guardian., It is
his brother--his elder brother., Gwendolen., [Sitting down again.], Ernest never mentioned to me that he
had a brother., Cecily., I am sorry to say they have not been on good terms for a long

never heard any man mention his brother., The subject seems distasteful

me., Indeed, when I am in really great trouble, as any one who knows me
intimately will tell you, I refuse everything except food and drink., At
the present moment I am eating muffins because I am unhappy., Besides, I
am particularly fond of muffins., [Rising.], Jack., [Rising.], Well, that is no reason why you should eat them all in
that greedy way., [Takes muffins from Algernon.], Algernon., [Offering tea-cake.], I wish you would have tea-cake instead., I don't like tea-cake., Jack., Good heavens!, I suppose a man may eat his own muffins in his own

all that I have ever been christened by anybody., I should think it
extremely probable I never was, and so does Dr. Chasuble., It is entirely
different in your case., You have been christened already., Algernon., Yes, but I have not been christened for years., Jack., Yes, but you have been christened., That is the important thing., Algernon., Quite so., So I know my constitution can stand it., If you are
not quite sure about your ever having been christened, I must say I think
it rather dangerous your venturing on it now., It might make you very
unwell., You can hardly have forgotten that some one very closely

triviality., Jack., On the contrary, Aunt Augusta, I've now realised for the first
time in my life the vital Importance of Being Earnest., HISTORICAL criticism nowhere occurs as an isolated fact in the
civilisation or literature of any people., It is part of that complex
working towards freedom which may be described as the revolt against
authority., It is merely one facet of that speculative spirit of an
innovation, which in the sphere of action produces democracy and
revolution, and in that of thought is the parent of philosophy and
physical science; and its importance as a factor of progress is based not
so much on the results it attains, as on the tone of thought which it
represents, and the method by which it works., Being thus the resultant of forces essentially revolutionary, it is not
to be found in the ancient world among the material despotisms of Asia or
the stationary civilisation of Egypt., The clay cylinders of Assyria and
Babylon, the hieroglyphics of the pyramids, form not history but the
material for history., The Chinese annals, ascending as they do to the barbarous forest life of
the nation, are marked with a soberness of judgment, a freedom from
invention, which is almost unparalleled in the writings of any people;
but the protective spirit which is the characteristic of that people
proved as fatal to their literature as to their commerce., Free criticism
is as unknown as free trade., While as regards the Hindus, their acute,
analytical and logical mind is directed rather to grammar, criticism and
philosophy than to history or chronology., Indeed, in history their
imagination seems to have run wild, legend and fact are so indissolubly
mingled together that any attempt to separate them seems vain., If we
except the identification of the Greek Sandracottus with the Indian
Chandragupta, we have really no clue by which we can test the truth of
their writings or examine their method of investigation., It is among the Hellenic branch of the Indo-Germanic race that history
proper is to be found, as well as the spirit of historical criticism;
among that wonderful offshoot of the primitive Aryans, whom we call by
the name of Greeks and to whom, as has been well said, we owe all that
moves in the world except the blind forces of nature., For, from the day when they left the chill table-lands of Tibet and
journeyed, a nomad people, to ?gean shores, the characteristic of their
nature has been the search for light, and the spirit of historical
criticism is part of that wonderful Aufkl?rung or illumination of the
intellect which seems to have burst on the Greek race like a great flood
of light about the sixth century B.C., _L?esprit d?un si?cle ne na?t pas et ne meurt pas ?, jour fixe_, and the
first critic is perhaps as difficult to discover as the first man., It is
from democracy that the spirit of criticism borrows its intolerance of
dogmatic authority, from physical science the alluring analogies of law
and order, from philosophy the conception of an essential unity
underlying the complex manifestations of phenomena., It appears first
rather as a changed attitude of mind than as a principle of research, and
its earliest influences are to be found in the sacred writings., For men begin to doubt in questions of religion first, and then in
matters of more secular interest; and as regards the nature of the spirit
of historical criticism itself in its ultimate development, it is not
confined merely to the empirical method of ascertaining whether an event
happened or not, but is concerned also with the investigation into the
causes of events, the general relations which phenomena of life hold to
one another, and in its ultimate development passes into the wider
question of the philosophy of history., Now, while the workings of historical criticism in these two spheres of
sacred and uninspired history are essentially manifestations of the same
spirit, yet their methods are so different, the canons of evidence so
entirely separate, and the motives in each case so unconnected, that it
will be necessary for a clear estimation of the progress of Greek
thought, that we should consider these two questions entirely apart from
one another., I shall then in both cases take the succession of writers
in their chronological order as representing the rational order?not that
the succession of time is always the succession of ideas, or that
dialectics moves ever in the straight line in which Hegel conceives its
advance., In Greek thought, as elsewhere, there are periods of stagnation
and apparent retrogression, yet their intellectual development, not
merely in the question of historical criticism, but in their art, their
poetry and their philosophy, seems so essentially normal, so free from
all disturbing external influences, so peculiarly rational, that in
following in the footsteps of time we shall really be progressing in the
order sanctioned by reason., AT an early period in their intellectual development the Greeks reached
that critical point in the history of every civilised nation, when
speculative invades the domain of revealed truth, when the spiritual
ideas of the people can no longer be satisfied by the lower, material
conceptions of their inspired writers, and when men find it impossible to
pour the new wine of free thought into the old bottles of a narrow and a
trammelling creed., From their Aryan ancestors they had received the fatal legacy of a
mythology stained with immoral and monstrous stories which strove to hide
the rational order of nature in a chaos of miracles, and to mar by
imputed wickedness the perfection of God?s nature?a very shirt of Nessos
in which the Heracles of rationalism barely escaped annihilation., Now
while undoubtedly the speculations of Thales, and the alluring analogies
of law and order afforded by physical science, were most important forces
in encouraging the rise of the spirit of scepticism, yet it was on its
ethical side that the Greek mythology was chiefly open to attack., It is difficult to shake the popular belief in miracles, but no man will
admit sin and immorality as attributes of the Ideal he worships; so the
first symptoms of a new order of thought are shown in the passionate
outcries of Xenophanes and Heraclitos against the evil things said by
Homer of the sons of God; and in the story told of Pythagoras, how that
he saw tortured in Hell the ?two founders of Greek theology,?, we can
recognise the rise of the Aufkl?rung as clearly as we see the Reformation
foreshadowed in the _Inferno_ of Dante., Any honest belief, then, in the plain truth of these stories soon
succumbed before the destructive effects of the _a priori_ ethical
criticism of this school; but the orthodox party, as is its custom, found
immediately a convenient shelter under the ?gis of the doctrine of
metaphors and concealed meanings., To this allegorical school the tale of the fight around the walls of Troy
was a mystery, behind which, as behind a veil, were hidden certain moral
and physical truths., The contest between Athena and Ares was that
eternal contest between rational thought and the brute force of
ignorance; the arrows which rattled in the quiver of the ?Far Darter?, were no longer the instruments of vengeance shot from the golden bow of
the child of God, but the common rays of the sun, which was itself
nothing but a mere inert mass of burning metal., Modern investigation, with the ruthlessness of Philistine analysis, has
ultimately brought Helen of Troy down to a symbol of the dawn., There
were Philistines among the Greeks also who saw in the _????, ????, ?_ a mere
metaphor for atmospheric power., ...]"|2
40|"[Aristotle meets the whole simply by an appeal to facts., If the theory of
the periodic decay of all created things, he urges, be scientific, it
must be universal, and so true of all the other states as well as of the
ideal., Besides, a state usually changes into its contrary and not to the
form next to it; so the ideal state would not change into Timocracy;
while Oligarchy, more often than Tyranny, succeeds Democracy., Plato,
besides, says nothing of what a Tyranny would change to., According to
the cycle theory it ought to pass into the ideal state again, but as a
fact one Tyranny is changed into another as at Sicyon, or into a
Democracy as at Syracuse, or into an Aristocracy as at Carthage., The
example of Sicily, too, shows that an Oligarchy is often followed by a
Tyranny, as at Leontini and Gela., Besides, it is absurd to represent
greed as the chief motive of decay, or to talk of avarice as the root of
Oligarchy, when in nearly all true oligarchies money-making is forbidden
by law., And finally the Platonic theory neglects the different kinds of
democracies and of tyrannies., Now nothing can be more important than this passage in Aristotle?s
_Politics_ (_v._ 12., ), which may he said to mark an era in the evolution
of historical criticism., For there is nothing on which Aristotle insists
so strongly as that the generalisations from facts ought to be added to
the data of the _a priori_ method?a principle which we know to be true
not merely of deductive speculative politics but of physics also: for are
not the residual phenomena of chemists a valuable source of improvement
in theory?, His own method is essentially historical though by no means empirical., On the contrary, this far-seeing thinker, rightly styled _il maestro di
color che sanno_, may be said to have apprehended clearly that the true
method is neither exclusively empirical nor exclusively speculative, but
rather a union of both in the process called Analysis or the
Interpretation of Facts, which has been defined as the application to
facts of such general conceptions as may fix the important
characteristics of the phenomena, and present them permanently in their
true relations., He too was the first to point out, what even in our own
day is incompletely appreciated, that nature, including the development
of man, is not full of incoherent episodes like a bad tragedy, that
inconsistency and anomaly are as impossible in the moral as they are in
the physical world, and that where the superficial observer thinks he
sees a revolution the philosophical critic discerns merely the gradual
and rational evolution of the inevitable results of certain antecedents., And while admitting the necessity of a psychological basis for the
philosophy of history, he added to it the important truth that man, to be
apprehended in his proper position in the universe as well as in his
natural powers, must be studied from below in the hierarchical
progression of higher function from the lower forms of life., The
important maxim, that to obtain a clear conception of anything we must
?study it in its growth from the very beginning,?, is formally set down in
the opening of the _Politics_, where, indeed, we shall find the other
characteristic features of the modern Evolutionary theory, such as the
?Differentiation of Function?, and the ?Survival of the Fittest?, explicitly set forth., What a valuable step this was in the improvement of the method of
historical criticism it is needless to point out., By it, one may say,
the true thread was given to guide one?s steps through the bewildering
labyrinth of facts., For history (to use terms with which Aristotle has
made us familiar) may be looked at from two essentially different
standpoints; either as a work of art whose _????, ?_ or final cause is
external to it and imposed on it from without; or as an organism
containing the law of its own development in itself, and working out its
perfection merely by the fact of being what it is., Now, if we adopt the
former, which we may style the theological view, we shall be in continual
danger of tripping into the pitfall of some _a priori_ conclusion?that
bourne from which, it has been truly said, no traveller ever returns., The latter is the only scientific theory and was apprehended in its
fulness by Aristotle, whose application of the inductive method to
history, and whose employment of the evolutionary theory of humanity,
show that he was conscious that the philosophy of history is nothing
separate from the facts of history but is contained in them, and that the
rational law of the complex phenomena of life, like the ideal in the
world of thought, is to be reached through the facts, not superimposed on
them?_????, ?????, ?_ not _????, ?????_., And finally, in estimating the enormous debt which the science of
historical criticism owes to Aristotle, we must not pass over his
attitude towards those two great difficulties in the formation of a
philosophy of history on which I have touched above., I mean the
assertion of extra-natural interference with the normal development of
the world and of the incalculable influence exercised by the power of
free will., Now, as regards the former, he may be said to have neglected it entirely., The special acts of providence proceeding from God?s immediate government
of the world, which Herodotus saw as mighty landmarks in history, would
have been to him essentially disturbing elements in that universal reign
of law, the extent of whose limitless empire he of all the great thinkers
of antiquity was the first explicitly to recognise., Standing aloof from the popular religion as well as from the deeper
conceptions of Herodotus and the Tragic School, he no longer thought of
God as of one with fair limbs and treacherous face haunting wood and
glade, nor would he see in him a jealous judge continually interfering in
the world?s history to bring the wicked to punishment and the proud to a
fall., God to him was the incarnation of the pure Intellect, a being
whose activity was the contemplation of his own perfection, one whom
Philosophy might imitate but whom prayers could never move, to the
sublime indifference of whose passionless wisdom what were the sons of
men, their desires or their sins?, While, as regards the other difficulty
and the formation of a philosophy of history, the conflict of free will
with general laws appears first in Greek thought in the usual theological
form in which all great ideas seem to be cradled at their birth., It was such legends as those of ?dipus and Adrastus, exemplifying the
struggles of individual humanity against the overpowering force of
circumstances and necessity, which gave to the early Greeks those same
lessons which we of modern days draw, in somewhat less artistic fashion,
from the study of statistics and the laws of physiology., In Aristotle, of course, there is no trace of supernatural influence., The Furies, which drive their victim into sin first and then punishment,
are no longer ?viper-tressed goddesses with eyes and mouth aflame,?, but
those evil thoughts which harbour within the impure soul., In this, as in
all other points, to arrive at Aristotle is to reach the pure atmosphere
of scientific and modern thought., But while he rejected pure necessitarianism in its crude form as
essentially a _reductio ad absurdum_ of life, he was fully conscious of
the fact that the will is not a mysterious and ultimate unit of force
beyond which we cannot go and whose special characteristic is
inconsistency, but a certain creative attitude of the mind which is, from
the first, continually influenced by habits, education and circumstance;
so absolutely modifiable, in a word, that the good and the bad man alike
seem to lose the power of free will; for the one is morally unable to
sin, the other physically incapacitated for reformation., And of the influence of climate and temperature in forming the nature of
man (a conception perhaps pressed too far in modern days when the ?race
theory?, is supposed to be a sufficient explanation of the Hindoo, and the
latitude and longitude of a country the best guide to its morals {57})
Aristotle is completely unaware., I do not allude to such smaller points
as the oligarchical tendencies of a horse-breeding country and the
democratic influence of the proximity of the sea (important though they
are for the consideration of Greek history), but rather to those wider
views in the seventh book of his _Politics_, where he attributes the
happy union in the Greek character of intellectual attainments with the
spirit of progress to the temperate climate they enjoyed, and points out
how the extreme cold of the north dulls the mental faculties of its
inhabitants and renders them incapable of social organisation or extended
empire; while to the enervating heat of eastern countries was due that
want of spirit and bravery which then, as now, was the characteristic of
the population in that quarter of the globe., Thucydides has shown the causal connection between political revolutions
and the fertility of the soil, but goes a step farther and points out the
psychological influences on a people?s character exercised by the various
extremes of climate?in both cases the first appearance of a most valuable
form of historical criticism., To the development of Dialectic, as to God, intervals of time are of no
account., From Plato and Aristotle we pass direct to Polybius., The progress of thought from the philosopher of the Academe to the
Arcadian historian may be best illustrated by a comparison of the method
by which each of the three writers, whom I have selected as the highest
expression of the rationalism of his respective age, attained to his
ideal state: for the latter conception may be in a measure regarded as
representing the most spiritual principle which they could discern in
history., Now, Plato created his on _a priori_ principles; Aristotle formed his by
an analysis of existing constitutions; Polybius found his realised for
him in the actual world of fact., Aristotle criticised the deductive
speculations of Plato by means of inductive negative instances, but
Polybius will not take the ?Cloud City?, of the _Republic_ into account at
all., He compares it to an athlete who has never run on ?Constitution
Hill,?, to a statue so beautiful that it is entirely removed from the
ordinary conditions of humanity, and consequently from the canons of
criticism., The Roman state had attained in his eyes, by means of the mutual
counteraction of three opposing forces, {59} that stable equilibrium in
politics which was the ideal of all the theoretical writers of antiquity., And in connection with this point it will be convenient to notice here
how much truth there is contained in the accusation often brought against
the ancients that they knew nothing of the idea of Progress, for the
meaning of many of their speculations will be hidden from us if we do not
try and comprehend first what their aim was, and secondly why it was so., Now, like all wide generalities, this statement is at least inaccurate., The prayer of Plato?s ideal City?_??, ??????, ???????, ?_, _???, ??, ????????, ?????????????, ???, ????, ????????, ????????, ?_, might be written as a text
over the door of the last Temple to Humanity raised by the disciples of
Fourier and Saint-Simon, but it is certainly true that their ideal
principle was order and permanence, not indefinite progress., For,
setting aside the artistic prejudices which would have led the Greeks to
reject this idea of unlimited improvement, we may note that the modern
conception of progress rests partly on the new enthusiasm and worship of
humanity, partly on the splendid hopes of material improvements in
civilisation which applied science has held out to us, two influences
from which ancient Greek thought seems to have been strangely free., For
the Greeks marred the perfect humanism of the great men whom they
worshipped, by imputing to them divinity and its supernatural powers;
while their science was eminently speculative and often almost mystic in
its character, aiming at culture and not utility, at higher spirituality
and more intense reverence for law, rather than at the increased
facilities of locomotion and the cheap production of common things about
which our modern scientific school ceases not to boast., And lastly, and
perhaps chiefly, we must remember that the ?plague spot of all Greek
states,?, as one of their own writers has called it, was the terrible
insecurity to life and property which resulted from the factions and
revolutions which ceased not to trouble Greece at all times, raising a
spirit of fanaticism such as religion raised in the middle ages of
Europe., These considerations, then, will enable us to understand first how it was
that, radical and unscrupulous reformers as the Greek political theorists
were, yet, their end once attained, no modern conservatives raised such
outcry against the slightest innovation., Even acknowledged improvements
in such things as the games of children or the modes of music were
regarded by them with feelings of extreme apprehension as the herald of
the _drapeau rouge_ of reform., And secondly, it will show us how it was
that Polybius found his ideal in the commonwealth of Rome, and Aristotle,
like Mr., Bright, in the middle classes., Polybius, however, is not
content merely with pointing out his ideal state, but enters at
considerable length into the question of those general laws whose
consideration forms the chief essential of the philosophy of history., He starts by accepting the general principle that all things are fated to
decay (which I noticed in the case of Plato), and that ?as iron produces
rust and as wood breeds the animals that destroy it, so every state has
in it the seeds of its own corruption.?, He is not, however, content to
rest there, but proceeds to deal with the more immediate causes of
revolutions, which he says are twofold in nature, either external or
internal., Now, the former, depending as they do on the synchronous
conjunction of other events outside the sphere of scientific estimation,
are from their very character incalculable; but the latter, though
assuming many forms, always result from the over-great preponderance of
any single element to the detriment of the others, the rational law lying
at the base of all varieties of political changes being that stability
can result only from the statical equilibrium produced by the
counteraction of opposing parts, since the more simple a constitution is
the more it is insecure., Plato had pointed out before how the extreme
liberty of a democracy always resulted in despotism, but Polybius
analyses the law and shows the scientific principles on which it rests., The doctrine of the instability of pure constitutions forms an important
era in the philosophy of history., Its special applicability to the
politics of our own day has been illustrated in the rise of the great
Napoleon, when the French state had lost those divisions of caste and
prejudice, of landed aristocracy and moneyed interest, institutions in
which the vulgar see only barriers to Liberty but which are indeed the
only possible defences against the coming of that periodic Sirius of
politics, the _????????, ??, ???????????, ?????_., There is a principle which Tocqueville never wearies of explaining, and
which has been subsumed by Mr. Herbert Spencer under that general law
common to all organic bodies which we call the Instability of the
Homogeneous., The various manifestations of this law, as shown in the
normal, regular revolutions and evolutions of the different forms of
government, {63a} are expounded with great clearness by Polybius, who
claimed for his theory, in the Thucydidean spirit, that it is a _?????, ??, ??, ?_, not a mere _????????, ??, ??, ????????, ?_, and that a knowledge of it
will enable the impartial observer {63b} to discover at any time what
period of its constitutional evolution any particular state has already
reached and into what form it will be next differentiated, though
possibly the exact time of the changes may be more or less uncertain., {63c}

Now in this necessarily incomplete account of the laws of political
revolutions as expounded by Polybius enough perhaps has been said to show
what is his true position in the rational development of the ?Idea?, which
I have called the Philosophy of History, because it is the unifying of
history., Seen darkly as it is through the glass of religion in the pages
of Herodotus, more metaphysical than scientific with Thucydides, Plato
strove to seize it by the eagle-flight of speculation, to reach it with
the eager grasp of a soul impatient of those slower and surer inductive
methods which Aristotle, in his trenchant criticism of his greater
master, showed were more brilliant than any vague theory, if the test of
brilliancy is truth., What then is the position of Polybius?, Does any new method remain for
him?, ...]"|2
41|"[Wearied of the dull monotony of the pontifical annals, which dwelt on
little else but the rise and fall in provisions and the eclipses of the
sun, Cato wrote out a history with his own hand for the instruction of
his child, to which he gave the name of Origines, and before his time
some aristocratic families had written histories in Greek much in the
same spirit in which the Germans of the eighteenth century used French as
the literary language., But the first regular Roman historian is Sallust., Between the extravagant eulogies passed on this author by the French
(such as De Closset), and Dr. Mommsen?s view of him as merely a political
pamphleteer, it is perhaps difficult to reach the _via media_ of
unbiassed appreciation., He has, at any rate, the credit of being a
purely rationalistic historian, perhaps the only one in Roman literature., Cicero had a good many qualifications for a scientific historian, and (as
he usually did) thought very highly of his own powers., On passages of
ancient legend, however, he is rather unsatisfactory, for while he is too
sensible to believe them he is too patriotic to reject them., And this is
really the attitude of Livy, who claims for early Roman legend a certain
uncritical homage from the rest of the subject world., His view in his
history is that it is not worth while to examine the truth of these
stories., In his hands the history of Rome unrolls before our eyes like some
gorgeous tapestry, where victory succeeds victory, where triumph treads
on the heels of triumph, and the line of heroes seems never to end., It
is not till we pass behind the canvas and see the slight means by which
the effect is produced that we apprehend the fact that like most
picturesque writers Livy is an indifferent critic., As regards his
attitude towards the credibility of early Roman history he is quite as
conscious as we are of its mythical and unsound nature., He will not, for
instance, decide whether the Horatii were Albans or Romans; who was the
first dictator; how many tribunes there were, and the like., His method,
as a rule, is merely to mention all the accounts and sometimes to decide
in favour of the most probable, but usually not to decide at all., No
canons of historical criticism will ever discover whether the Roman women
interviewed the mother of Coriolanus of their own accord or at the
suggestion of the senate; whether Remus was killed for jumping over his
brother?s wall or because they quarrelled about birds; whether the
ambassadors found Cincinnatus ploughing or only mending a hedge., Livy
suspends his judgment over these important facts and history when
questioned on their truth is dumb., If he does select between two
historians he chooses the one who is nearer to the facts he describes., But he is no critic, only a conscientious writer., It is mere vain waste
to dwell on his critical powers, for they do not exist., * * * * *

In the case of Tacitus imagination has taken the place of history., The
past lives again in his pages, but through no laborious criticism; rather
through a dramatic and psychological faculty which he specially
possessed., In the philosophy of history he has no belief., He can never make up his
mind what to believe as regards God?s government of the world., There is
no method in him and none elsewhere in Roman literature., Nations may not have missions but they certainly have functions., And the
function of ancient Italy was not merely to give us what is statical in
our institutions and rational in our law, but to blend into one elemental
creed the spiritual aspirations of Aryan and of Semite., Italy was not a
pioneer in intellectual progress, nor a motive power in the evolution of
thought., The owl of the goddess of Wisdom traversed over the whole land
and found nowhere a resting-place., The dove, which is the bird of
Christ, flew straight to the city of Rome and the new reign began., It
was the fashion of early Italian painters to represent in medi?val
costume the soldiers who watched over the tomb of Christ, and this, which
was the result of the frank anachronism of all true art, may serve to us
as an allegory., For it was in vain that the Middle Ages strove to guard
the buried spirit of progress., When the dawn of the Greek spirit arose,
the sepulchre was empty, the grave-clothes laid aside., Humanity had
risen from the dead., The study of Greek, it has been well said, implies the birth of
criticism, comparison and research., At the opening of that education of
modern by ancient thought which we call the Renaissance, it was the words
of Aristotle which sent Columbus sailing to the New World, while a
fragment of Pythagorean astronomy set Copernicus thinking on that train
of reasoning which has revolutionised the whole position of our planet in
the universe., Then it was seen that the only meaning of progress is a
return to Greek modes of thought., The monkish hymns which obscured the
pages of Greek manuscripts were blotted out, the splendours of a new
method were unfolded to the world, and out of the melancholy sea of
medi?valism rose the free spirit of man in all that splendour of glad
adolescence, when the bodily powers seem quickened by a new vitality,
when the eye sees more clearly than its wont and the mind apprehends what
was beforetime hidden from it., To herald the opening of the sixteenth
century, from the little Venetian printing press came forth all the great
authors of antiquity, each bearing on the title-page the words _?????, ?, ?????????, ???????, ???, ???????, ?_; words which may serve to remind us with
what wondrous prescience Polybius saw the world?s fate when he foretold
the material sovereignty of Roman institutions and exemplified in himself
the intellectual empire of Greece., The course of the study of the spirit of historical criticism has not
been a profitless investigation into modes and forms of thought now
antiquated and of no account., The only spirit which is entirely removed
from us is the medi?val; the Greek spirit is essentially modern., The
introduction of the comparative method of research which has forced
history to disclose its secrets belongs in a measure to us., Ours, too,
is a more scientific knowledge of philology and the method of survival., Nor did the ancients know anything of the doctrine of averages or of
crucial instances, both of which methods have proved of such importance
in modern criticism, the one adding a most important proof of the
statical elements of history, and exemplifying the influences of all
physical surroundings on the life of man; the other, as in the single
instance of the Moulin Quignon skull, serving to create a whole new
science of prehistoric arch?ology and to bring us back to a time when man
was coeval with the stone age, the mammoth and the woolly rhinoceros., But, except these, we have added no new canon or method to the science of
historical criticism., Across the drear waste of a thousand years the
Greek and the modern spirit join hands., In the torch race which the Greek boys ran from the Cerameician field of
death to the home of the goddess of Wisdom, not merely he who first
reached the goal but he also who first started with the torch aflame
received a prize., In the Lampadephoria of civilisation and free thought
let us not forget to render due meed of honour to those who first lit
that sacred flame, the increasing splendour of which lights our footsteps
to the far-off divine event of the attainment of perfect truth., THE ENGLISH RENAISSANCE OF ART


?The English Renaissance of Art?, was delivered as a lecture for the first
time in the Chickering Hall, New York, on January 9, 1882., A portion of
it was reported in the _New York Tribune_ on the following day and in
other American papers subsequently., Since then this portion has been
reprinted, more or less accurately, from time to time, in unauthorised
editions., There are in existence no less than four copies of the lecture, the
earliest of which is entirely in the author?s handwriting., The others
are type-written and contain many corrections and additions made by the
author in manuscript., These have all been collated and the text here
given contains, as nearly as possible, the lecture in the original form
as delivered by the author during his tour in the United States., AMONG the many debts which we owe to the supreme ?sthetic faculty of
Goethe is that he was the first to teach us to define beauty in terms the
most concrete possible, to realise it, I mean, always in its special
manifestations., So, in the lecture which I have the honour to deliver
before you, I will not try to give you any abstract definition of
beauty?any such universal formula for it as was sought for by the
philosophy of the eighteenth century?still less to communicate to you
that which in its essence is incommunicable, the virtue by which a
particular picture or poem affects us with a unique and special joy; but
rather to point out to you the general ideas which characterise the great
English Renaissance of Art in this century, to discover their source, as
far as that is possible, and to estimate their future as far as that is
possible., I call it our English Renaissance because it is indeed a sort of new
birth of the spirit of man, like the great Italian Renaissance of the
fifteenth century, in its desire for a more gracious and comely way of
life, its passion for physical beauty, its exclusive attention to form,
its seeking for new subjects for poetry, new forms of art, new
intellectual and imaginative enjoyments: and I call it our romantic
movement because it is our most recent expression of beauty., It has been described as a mere revival of Greek modes of thought, and
again as a mere revival of medi?val feeling., Rather I would say that to
these forms of the human spirit it has added whatever of artistic value
the intricacy and complexity and experience of modern life can give:
taking from the one its clearness of vision and its sustained calm, from
the other its variety of expression and the mystery of its vision., For
what, as Goethe said, is the study of the ancients but a return to the
real world (for that is what they did); and what, said Mazzini, is
medi?valism but individuality?, It is really from the union of Hellenism, in its breadth, its sanity of
purpose, its calm possession of beauty, with the adventive, the
intensified individualism, the passionate colour of the romantic spirit,
that springs the art of the nineteenth century in England, as from the
marriage of Faust and Helen of Troy sprang the beautiful boy Euphorion., Such expressions as ?classical?, and ?romantic?, are, it is true, often apt
to become the mere catchwords of schools., We must always remember that
art has only one sentence to utter: there is for her only one high law,
the law of form or harmony?yet between the classical and romantic spirit
we may say that there lies this difference at least, that the one deals
with the type and the other with the exception., In the work produced
under the modern romantic spirit it is no longer the permanent, the
essential truths of life that are treated of; it is the momentary
situation of the one, the momentary aspect of the other that art seeks to
render., In sculpture, which is the type of one spirit, the subject
predominates over the situation; in painting, which is the type of the
other, the situation predominates over the subject., There are two spirits, then: the Hellenic spirit and the spirit of
romance may be taken as forming the essential elements of our conscious
intellectual tradition, of our permanent standard of taste., As regards
their origin, in art as in politics there is but one origin for all
revolutions, a desire on the part of man for a nobler form of life, for a
freer method and opportunity of expression., Yet, I think that in
estimating the sensuous and intellectual spirit which presides over our
English Renaissance, any attempt to isolate it in any way from in the
progress and movement and social life of the age that has produced it
would be to rob it of its true vitality, possibly to mistake its true
meaning., And in disengaging from the pursuits and passions of this
crowded modern world those passions and pursuits which have to do with
art and the love of art, we must take into account many great events of
history which seem to be the most opposed to any such artistic feeling., Alien then from any wild, political passion, or from the harsh voice of a
rude people in revolt, as our English Renaissance must seem, in its
passionate cult of pure beauty, its flawless devotion to form, its
exclusive and sensitive nature, it is to the French Revolution that we
must look for the most primary factor of its production, the first
condition of its birth: that great Revolution of which we are all the
children though the voices of some of us be often loud against it; that
Revolution to which at a time when even such spirits as Coleridge and
Wordsworth lost heart in England, noble messages of love blown across
seas came from your young Republic., It is true that our modern sense of the continuity of history has shown
us that neither in politics nor in nature are there revolutions ever but
evolutions only, and that the prelude to that wild storm which swept over
France in 1789 and made every king in Europe tremble for his throne, was
first sounded in literature years before the Bastille fell and the Palace
was taken., The way for those red scenes by Seine and Loire was paved by
that critical spirit of Germany and England which accustomed men to bring
all things to the test of reason or utility or both, while the discontent
of the people in the streets of Paris was the echo that followed the life
of Emile and of Werther., For Rousseau, by silent lake and mountain, had
called humanity back to the golden age that still lies before us and
preached a return to nature, in passionate eloquence whose music still
lingers about our keen northern air., And Goethe and Scott had brought
romance back again from the prison she had lain in for so many
centuries?and what is romance but humanity?, Yet in the womb of the Revolution itself, and in the storm and terror of
that wild time, tendencies were hidden away that the artistic Renaissance
bent to her own service when the time came?a scientific tendency first,
which has borne in our own day a brood of somewhat noisy Titans, yet in
the sphere of poetry has not been unproductive of good., I do not mean
merely in its adding to enthusiasm that intellectual basis which in its
strength, or that more obvious influence about which Wordsworth was
thinking when he said very nobly that poetry was merely the impassioned
expression in the face of science, and that when science would put on a
form of flesh and blood the poet would lend his divine spirit to aid the
transfiguration., Nor do I dwell much on the great cosmical emotion and
deep pantheism of science to which Shelley has given its first and
Swinburne its latest glory of song, but rather on its influence on the
artistic spirit in preserving that close observation and the sense of
limitation as well as of clearness of vision which are the
characteristics of the real artist., The great and golden rule of art as well as of life, wrote William Blake,
is that the more distinct, sharp and defined the boundary line, the more
perfect is the work of art; and the less keen and sharp the greater is
the evidence of weak imitation, plagiarism and bungling., ?Great
inventors in all ages knew this?Michael Angelo and Albert Durer are known
by this and by this alone?, ; and another time he wrote, with all the
simple directness of nineteenth-century prose, ?to generalise is to be an
idiot.?, And this love of definite conception, this clearness of vision, this
artistic sense of limit, is the characteristic of all great work and
poetry; of the vision of Homer as of the vision of Dante, of Keats and
William Morris as of Chaucer and Theocritus., It lies at the base of all
noble, realistic and romantic work as opposed to the colourless and empty
abstractions of our own eighteenth-century poets and of the classical
dramatists of France, or of the vague spiritualities of the German
sentimental school: opposed, too, to that spirit of transcendentalism
which also was root and flower itself of the great Revolution, underlying
the impassioned contemplation of Wordsworth and giving wings and fire to
the eagle-like flight of Shelley, and which in the sphere of philosophy,
though displaced by the materialism and positiveness of our day,
bequeathed two great schools of thought, the school of Newman to Oxford,
the school of Emerson to America., Yet is this spirit of
transcendentalism alien to the spirit of art., For the artist can accept
no sphere of life in exchange for life itself., For him there is no
escape from the bondage of the earth: there is not even the desire of
escape., He is indeed the only true realist: symbolism, which is the essence of
the transcendental spirit, is alien to him., The metaphysical mind of
Asia will create for itself the monstrous, many-breasted idol of Ephesus,
but to the Greek, pure artist, that work is most instinct with spiritual
life which conforms most clearly to the perfect facts of physical life., ?The storm of revolution,?, as Andre Chenier said, ?blows out the torch of
poetry.?, It is not for some little time that the real influence of such
a wild cataclysm of things is felt: at first the desire for equality
seems to have produced personalities of more giant and Titan stature than
the world had ever known before., Men heard the lyre of Byron and the
legions of Napoleon; it was a period of measureless passions and of
measureless despair; ambition, discontent, were the chords of life and
art; the age was an age of revolt: a phase through which the human spirit
must pass, but one in which it cannot rest., For the aim of culture is
not rebellion but peace, the valley perilous where ignorant armies clash
by night being no dwelling-place meet for her to whom the gods have
assigned the fresh uplands and sunny heights and clear, untroubled air., And soon that desire for perfection, which lay at the base of the
Revolution, found in a young English poet its most complete and flawless
realisation., ...]"|2
42|"[But indeed, in looking through the history of costume, seeking
an answer to the questions we have propounded, there is little that is
either beautiful or appropriate., One of the earliest forms is the Greek
drapery which is exquisite for young girls., And then, I think we may be
pardoned a little enthusiasm over the dress of the time of Charles I., so
beautiful indeed, that in spite of its invention being with the Cavaliers
it was copied by the Puritans., And the dress for the children of that
time must not be passed over., It was a very golden age of the little
ones., I do not think that they have ever looked so lovely as they do in
the pictures of that time., The dress of the last century in England is
also peculiarly gracious and graceful., There is nothing bizarre or
strange about it, but it is full of harmony and beauty., In these days,
when we have suffered dreadfully from the incursions of the modern
milliner, we hear ladies boast that they do not wear a dress more than
once., In the old days, when the dresses were decorated with beautiful
designs and worked with exquisite embroidery, ladies rather took a pride
in bringing out the garment and wearing it many times and handing it down
to their daughters?a process that would, I think, be quite appreciated by
a modern husband when called upon to settle his wife?s bills., And how shall men dress?, Men say that they do not particularly care how
they dress, and that it is little matter., I am bound to reply that I do
not think that you do., In all my journeys through the country, the only
well-dressed men that I saw?and in saying this I earnestly deprecate the
polished indignation of your Fifth Avenue dandies?were the Western
miners., Their wide-brimmed hats, which shaded their faces from the sun
and protected them from the rain, and the cloak, which is by far the most
beautiful piece of drapery ever invented, may well be dwelt on with
admiration., Their high boots, too, were sensible and practical., They
wore only what was comfortable, and therefore beautiful., As I looked at
them I could not help thinking with regret of the time when these
picturesque miners would have made their fortunes and would go East to
assume again all the abominations of modern fashionable attire., Indeed,
so concerned was I that I made some of them promise that when they again
appeared in the more crowded scenes of Eastern civilisation they would
still continue to wear their lovely costume., But I do not believe they
will., Now, what America wants to-day is a school of rational art., Bad art is a
great deal worse than no art at all., You must show your workmen
specimens of good work so that they come to know what is simple and true
and beautiful., To that end I would have you have a museum attached to
these schools?not one of those dreadful modern institutions where there
is a stuffed and very dusty giraffe, and a case or two of fossils, but a
place where there are gathered examples of art decoration from various
periods and countries., Such a place is the South Kensington Museum in
London, whereon we build greater hopes for the future than on any other
one thing., There I go every Saturday night, when the museum is open
later than usual, to see the handicraftsman, the wood-worker, the
glass-blower and the worker in metals., And it is here that the man of
refinement and culture comes face to face with the workman who ministers
to his joy., He comes to know more of the nobility of the workman, and
the workman, feeling the appreciation, comes to know more of the nobility
of his work., You have too many white walls., More colour is wanted., You should have
such men as Whistler among you to teach you the beauty and joy of colour., Take Mr. Whistler?s ?Symphony in White,?, which you no doubt have imagined
to be something quite bizarre., It is nothing of the sort., Think of a
cool grey sky flecked here and there with white clouds, a grey ocean and
three wonderfully beautiful figures robed in white, leaning over the
water and dropping white flowers from their fingers., Here is no
extensive intellectual scheme to trouble you, and no metaphysics of which
we have had quite enough in art., But if the simple and unaided colour
strike the right key-note, the whole conception is made clear., I regard
Mr. Whistler?s famous Peacock Room as the finest thing in colour and art
decoration which the world has known since Correggio painted that
wonderful room in Italy where the little children are dancing on the
walls., Mr. Whistler finished another room just before I came away?a
breakfast room in blue and yellow., The ceiling was a light blue, the
cabinet-work and the furniture were of a yellow wood, the curtains at the
windows were white and worked in yellow, and when the table was set for
breakfast with dainty blue china nothing can be conceived at once so
simple and so joyous., The fault which I have observed in most of your rooms is that there is
apparent no definite scheme of colour., Everything is not attuned to a
key-note as it should be., The apartments are crowded with pretty things
which have no relation to one another., Again, your artists must decorate
what is more simply useful., In your art schools I found no attempt to
decorate such things as the vessels for water., I know of nothing uglier
than the ordinary jug or pitcher., A museum could be filled with the
different kinds of water vessels which are used in hot countries., Yet we
continue to submit to the depressing jug with the handle all on one side., I do not see the wisdom of decorating dinner-plates with sunsets and
soup-plates with moonlight scenes., I do not think it adds anything to
the pleasure of the canvas-back duck to take it out of such glories., Besides, we do not want a soup-plate whose bottom seems to vanish in the
distance., One feels neither safe nor comfortable under such conditions., In fact, I did not find in the art schools of the country that the
difference was explained between decorative and imaginative art., The conditions of art should be simple., A great deal more depends upon
the heart than upon the head., Appreciation of art is not secured by any
elaborate scheme of learning., Art requires a good healthy atmosphere., The motives for art are still around about us as they were round about
the ancients., And the subjects are also easily found by the earnest
sculptor and the painter., Nothing is more picturesque and graceful than
a man at work., The artist who goes to the children?s playground, watches
them at their sport and sees the boy stoop to tie his shoe, will find the
same themes that engaged the attention of the ancient Greeks, and such
observation and the illustrations which follow will do much to correct
that foolish impression that mental and physical beauty are always
divorced., To you, more than perhaps to any other country, has Nature been generous
in furnishing material for art workers to work in., You have marble
quarries where the stone is more beautiful in colour than any the Greeks
ever had for their beautiful work, and yet day after day I am confronted
with the great building of some stupid man who has used the beautiful
material as if it were not precious almost beyond speech., Marble should
not be used save by noble workmen., There is nothing which gave me a
greater sense of barrenness in travelling through the country than the
entire absence of wood carving on your houses., Wood carving is the
simplest of the decorative arts., In Switzerland the little barefooted
boy beautifies the porch of his father?s house with examples of skill in
this direction., Why should not American boys do a great deal more and
better than Swiss boys?, There is nothing to my mind more coarse in conception and more vulgar in
execution than modern jewellery., This is something that can easily be
corrected., Something better should be made out of the beautiful gold
which is stored up in your mountain hollows and strewn along your river
beds., When I was at Leadville and reflected that all the shining silver
that I saw coming from the mines would be made into ugly dollars, it made
me sad., It should be made into something more permanent., The golden
gates at Florence are as beautiful to-day as when Michael Angelo saw
them., We should see more of the workman than we do., We should not be content
to have the salesman stand between us?the salesman who knows nothing of
what he is selling save that he is charging a great deal too much for it., And watching the workman will teach that most important lesson?the
nobility of all rational workmanship., I said in my last lecture that art would create a new brotherhood among
men by furnishing a universal language., I said that under its beneficent
influences war might pass away., Thinking this, what place can I ascribe
to art in our education?, If children grow up among all fair and lovely
things, they will grow to love beauty and detest ugliness before they
know the reason why., If you go into a house where everything is coarse,
you find things chipped and broken and unsightly., Nobody exercises any
care., If everything is dainty and delicate, gentleness and refinement of
manner are unconsciously acquired., When I was in San Francisco I used to
visit the Chinese Quarter frequently., There I used to watch a great
hulking Chinese workman at his task of digging, and used to see him every
day drink his tea from a little cup as delicate in texture as the petal
of a flower, whereas in all the grand hotels of the land, where thousands
of dollars have been lavished on great gilt mirrors and gaudy columns, I
have been given my coffee or my chocolate in cups an inch and a quarter
thick., I think I have deserved something nicer., The art systems of the past have been devised by philosophers who looked
upon human beings as obstructions., They have tried to educate boys?, minds before they had any., How much better it would be in these early
years to teach children to use their hands in the rational service of
mankind., I would have a workshop attached to every school, and one hour
a day given up to the teaching of simple decorative arts., It would be a
golden hour to the children., And you would soon raise up a race of
handicraftsmen who would transform the face of your country., I have seen
only one such school in the United States, and this was in Philadelphia
and was founded by my friend Mr. Leyland., I stopped there yesterday and
have brought some of the work here this afternoon to show you., Here are
two disks of beaten brass: the designs on them are beautiful, the
workmanship is simple, and the entire result is satisfactory., The work
was done by a little boy twelve years old., This is a wooden bowl
decorated by a little girl of thirteen., The design is lovely and the
colouring delicate and pretty., ...]"|2

But, you will say, modern dress, that is bad., If you cannot paint black
cloth you could not have painted silken doublet., Ugly dress is better
for art?facts of vision, not of the object., What is a picture?, Primarily, a picture is a beautifully coloured
surface, merely, with no more spiritual message or meaning for you than
an exquisite fragment of Venetian glass or a blue tile from the wall of
Damascus., It is, primarily, a purely decorative thing, a delight to look
at., All arch?ological pictures that make you say ?How curious!?, all
sentimental pictures that make you say, ?How sad!?, all historical
pictures that make you say ?How interesting!?, all pictures that do not
immediately give you such artistic joy as to make you say ?How
beautiful!?, are bad pictures., * * * * *

We never know what an artist is going to do., Of course not., The artist
is not a specialist., All such divisions as animal painters, landscape
painters, painters of Scotch cattle in an English mist, painters of
English cattle in a Scotch mist, racehorse painters, bull-terrier
painters, all are shallow., If a man is an artist he can paint
everything., The object of art is to stir the most divine and remote of the chords
which make music in our soul; and colour is indeed, of itself a mystical
presence on things, and tone a kind of sentinel., Am I pleading, then, for mere technique?, No., As long as there are any
signs of technique at all, the picture is unfinished., What is finish?, A
picture is finished when all traces of work, and of the means employed to
bring about the result, have disappeared., In the case of handicraftsmen?the weaver, the potter, the smith?on their
work are the traces of their hand., But it is not so with the painter; it
is not so with the artist., Art should have no sentiment about it but its beauty, no technique except
what you cannot observe., One should be able to say of a picture not that
it is ?well painted,?, but that it is ?not painted.?, What is the difference between absolutely decorative art and a painting?, Decorative art emphasises its material: imaginative art annihilates it., Tapestry shows its threads as part of its beauty: a picture annihilates
its canvas: it shows nothing of it., Porcelain emphasises its glaze:
water-colours reject the paper., A picture has no meaning but its beauty, no message but its joy., That is
the first truth about art that you must never lose sight of., A picture
is a purely decorative thing., LONDON MODELS


_English Illustrated Magazine_, January 1889., PROFESSIONAL models are a purely modern invention., To the Greeks, for
instance, they were quite unknown., Mr. Mahaffy, it is true, tells us
that Pericles used to present peacocks to the great ladies of Athenian
society in order to induce them to sit to his friend Phidias, and we know
that Polygnotus introduced into his picture of the Trojan women the face
of Elpinice, the celebrated sister of the great Conservative leader of
the day, but these _grandes dames_ clearly do not come under our
category., As for the old masters, they undoubtedly made constant studies
from their pupils and apprentices, and even their religious pictures are
full of the portraits of their friends and relations, but they do not
seem to have had the inestimable advantage of the existence of a class of
people whose sole profession is to pose., In fact the model, in our sense
of the word, is the direct creation of Academic Schools., Every country now has its own models, except America., In New York, and
even in Boston, a good model is so great a rarity that most of the
artists are reduced to painting Niagara and millionaires., In Europe,
however, it is different., Here we have plenty of models, and of every
nationality., The Italian models are the best., The natural grace of
their attitudes, as well as the wonderful picturesqueness of their
colouring, makes them facile?often too facile?subjects for the painter?s
brush., The French models, though not so beautiful as the Italian,
possess a quickness of intellectual sympathy, a capacity, in fact, of
understanding the artist, which is quite remarkable., They have also a
great command over the varieties of facial expression, are peculiarly
dramatic, and can chatter the _argot_ of the _atelier_ as cleverly as the
critic of the _Gil Blas_., The English models form a class entirely by
themselves., They are not so picturesque as the Italian, nor so clever as
the French, and they have absolutely no tradition, so to speak, of their
order., Now and then some old veteran knocks at the studio door, and
proposes to sit as Ajax defying the lightning, or as King Lear upon the
blasted heath., One of them some time ago called on a popular painter
who, happening at the moment to require his services, engaged him, and
told him to begin by kneeling down in the attitude of prayer., ?Shall I
be Biblical or Shakespearean, sir??, asked the veteran., ?Well?Shakespearean,?, answered the artist, wondering by what subtle
_nuance_ of expression the model would convey the difference., ?All
right, sir,?, said the professor of posing, and he solemnly knelt down and
began to wink with his left eye!, This class, however, is dying out., As
a rule the model, nowadays, is a pretty girl, from about twelve to
twenty-five years of age, who knows nothing about art, cares less, and is
merely anxious to earn seven or eight shillings a day without much
trouble., English models rarely look at a picture, and never venture on
any ?sthetic theories., In fact, they realise very completely Mr.
Whistler?s idea of the function of an art critic, for they pass no
criticisms at all., They accept all schools of art with the grand
catholicity of the auctioneer, and sit to a fantastic young impressionist
as readily as to a learned and laborious academician., They are neither
for the Whistlerites nor against them; the quarrel between the school of
facts and the school of effects touches them not; idealistic and
naturalistic are words that convey no meaning to their ears; they merely
desire that the studio shall be warm, and the lunch hot, for all charming
artists give their models lunch., As to what they are asked to do they are equally indifferent., On Monday
they will don the rags of a beggar-girl for Mr. Pumper, whose pathetic
pictures of modern life draw such tears from the public, and on Tuesday
they will pose in a peplum for Mr. Phoebus, who thinks that all really
artistic subjects are necessarily B.C., They career gaily through all
centuries and through all costumes, and, like actors, are interesting
only when they are not themselves., They are extremely good-natured, and
very accommodating., ?What do you sit for??, said a young artist to a
model who had sent him in her card (all models, by the way, have cards
and a small black bag)., ?Oh, for anything you like, sir,?, said the girl,
?landscape if necessary!?, Intellectually, it must be acknowledged, they are Philistines, but
physically they are perfect?at least some are., Though none of them can
talk Greek, many can look Greek, which to a nineteenth-century painter is
naturally of great importance., If they are allowed, they chatter a great
deal, but they never say anything., Their observations are the only
_banalit?s_ heard in Bohemia., However, though they cannot appreciate the
artist as artist, they are quite ready to appreciate the artist as a man., They are very sensitive to kindness, respect and generosity., A beautiful
model who had sat for two years to one of our most distinguished English
painters, got engaged to a street vendor of penny ices., On her marriage the painter sent her a pretty wedding present, and
received in return a nice letter of thanks with the following remarkable
postscript: ?Never eat the green ices!?, When they are tired a wise artist gives them a rest., Then they sit in a
chair and read penny dreadfuls, till they are roused from the tragedy of
literature to take their place again in the tragedy of art., A few of
them smoke cigarettes., This, however, is regarded by the other models as
showing a want of seriousness, and is not generally approved of., They
are engaged by the day and by the half-day., The tariff is a shilling an
hour, to which great artists usually add an omnibus fare., The two best
things about them are their extraordinary prettiness, and their extreme
respectability., As a class they are very well behaved, particularly
those who sit for the figure, a fact which is curious or natural
according to the view one takes of human nature., They usually marry
well, and sometimes they marry the artist., For an artist to marry his
model is as fatal as for a _gourmet_ to marry his cook: the one gets no
sittings, and the other gets no dinners., On the whole the English female models are very na?ve, very natural, and
very good-humoured., The virtues which the artist values most in them are
prettiness and punctuality., Every sensible model consequently keeps a
diary of her engagements, and dresses neatly., The bad season is, of
course, the summer, when the artists are out of town., However, of late
years some artists have engaged their models to follow them, and the wife
of one of our most charming painters has often had three or four models
under her charge in the country, so that the work of her husband and his
friends should not be interrupted., In France the models migrate _en
masse_ to the little seaport villages or forest hamlets where the
painters congregate., The English models, however, wait patiently in
London, as a rule, till the artists come back., Nearly all of them live
with their parents, and help to support the house., They have every
qualification for being immortalised in art except that of beautiful
hands., The hands of the English model are nearly always coarse and red., ...]"|2

their political dealings: and in politics the man who is personally
honourable and refined will not scruple to do anything for his party., {86}  Polybius, xii., 25., {124}  As an instance of the inaccuracy of published reports of this

Prince., He was gilded all over with thin leaves of fine gold, for eyes
he had two bright sapphires, and a large red ruby glowed on his
sword-hilt., He was very much admired indeed., ?He is as beautiful as a weathercock,?, remarked one of the Town Councillors who wished to gain a reputation for
having artistic tastes; ?only not quite so useful,?, he added, fearing
lest people should think him unpractical, which he really was not., ?Why can?t you be like the Happy Prince??, asked a sensible mother of her
little boy who was crying for the moon., ?The Happy Prince never dreams
of crying for anything.?, ?I am glad there is some one in the world who is quite happy,?, muttered a
disappointed man as he gazed at the wonderful statue., ?He looks just like an angel,?, said the Charity Children as they came out
of the cathedral in their bright scarlet cloaks and their clean white
pinafores., ?How do you know??, said the Mathematical Master, ?you have never seen
one.?, ?Ah!, but we have, in our dreams,?, answered the children; and the
Mathematical Master frowned and looked very severe, for he did not
approve of children dreaming., One night there flew over the city a little Swallow., His friends had
gone away to Egypt six weeks before, but he had stayed behind, for he was
in love with the most beautiful Reed., He had met her early in the spring
as he was flying down the river after a big yellow moth, and had been so
attracted by her slender waist that he had stopped to talk to her., ?Shall I love you??, said the Swallow, who liked to come to the point at
once, and the Reed made him a low bow., So he flew round and round her,
touching the water with his wings, and making silver ripples., ...]"|2
45|"[?Here indeed is the true lover,?, said the Nightingale., ?What I sing of,
he suffers?what is joy to me, to him is pain., Surely Love is a wonderful
thing., It is more precious than emeralds, and dearer than fine opals., Pearls and pomegranates cannot buy it, nor is it set forth in the
marketplace., It may not be purchased of the merchants, nor can it be
weighed out in the balance for gold.?, ?The musicians will sit in their gallery,?, said the young Student, ?and
play upon their stringed instruments, and my love will dance to the sound
of the harp and the violin., She will dance so lightly that her feet will
not touch the floor, and the courtiers in their gay dresses will throng
round her., But with me she will not dance, for I have no red rose to
give her?, ; and he flung himself down on the grass, and buried his face in
his hands, and wept., ?Why is he weeping??, asked a little Green Lizard, as he ran past him with
his tail in the air., ?Why, indeed??, said a Butterfly, who was fluttering about after a
sunbeam., ?Why, indeed??, whispered a Daisy to his neighbour, in a soft, low voice., ?He is weeping for a red rose,?, said the Nightingale., ?For a red rose??, they cried; ?how very ridiculous!?, and the little
Lizard, who was something of a cynic, laughed outright., But the Nightingale understood the secret of the Student?s sorrow, and
she sat silent in the oak-tree, and thought about the mystery of Love., Suddenly she spread her brown wings for flight, and soared into the air., She passed through the grove like a shadow, and like a shadow she sailed
across the garden., In the centre of the grass-plot was standing a beautiful Rose-tree, and
when she saw it she flew over to it, and lit upon a spray., ?Give me a red rose,?, she cried, ?and I will sing you my sweetest song.?, But the Tree shook its head., ?My roses are white,?, it answered; ?as white as the foam of the sea, and
whiter than the snow upon the mountain., But go to my brother who grows
round the old sun-dial, and perhaps he will give you what you want.?, So the Nightingale flew over to the Rose-tree that was growing round the
old sun-dial., ?Give me a red rose,?, she cried, ?and I will sing you my sweetest song.?, But the Tree shook its head., ?My roses are yellow,?, it answered; ?as yellow as the hair of the
mermaiden who sits upon an amber throne, and yellower than the daffodil
that blooms in the meadow before the mower comes with his scythe., But go
to my brother who grows beneath the Student?s window, and perhaps he will
give you what you want.?, So the Nightingale flew over to the Rose-tree that was growing beneath
the Student?s window., ?Give me a red rose,?, she cried, ?and I will sing you my sweetest song.?, But the Tree shook its head., ?My roses are red,?, it answered, ?as red as the feet of the dove, and
redder than the great fans of coral that wave and wave in the
ocean-cavern., But the winter has chilled my veins, and the frost has
nipped my buds, and the storm has broken my branches, and I shall have no
roses at all this year.?, ?One red rose is all I want,?, cried the Nightingale, ?only one red rose!, Is there no way by which I can get it??, ?There is a way,?, answered the Tree; ?but it is so terrible that I dare
not tell it to you.?, ?Tell it to me,?, said the Nightingale, ?I am not afraid.?, ?If you want a red rose,?, said the Tree, ?you must build it out of music
by moonlight, and stain it with your own heart?s-blood., You must sing to
me with your breast against a thorn., All night long you must sing to me,
and the thorn must pierce your heart, and your life-blood must flow into
my veins, and become mine.?, ?Death is a great price to pay for a red rose,?, cried the Nightingale,
?and Life is very dear to all., It is pleasant to sit in the green wood,
and to watch the Sun in his chariot of gold, and the Moon in her chariot
of pearl., Sweet is the scent of the hawthorn, and sweet are the
bluebells that hide in the valley, and the heather that blows on the
hill., Yet Love is better than Life, and what is the heart of a bird
compared to the heart of a man??, So she spread her brown wings for flight, and soared into the air., She
swept over the garden like a shadow, and like a shadow she sailed through
the grove., The young Student was still lying on the grass, where she had left him,
and the tears were not yet dry in his beautiful eyes., ?Be happy,?, cried the Nightingale, ?be happy; you shall have your red
rose., I will build it out of music by moonlight, and stain it with my
own heart?s-blood., All that I ask of you in return is that you will be a
true lover, for Love is wiser than Philosophy, though she is wise, and
mightier than Power, though he is mighty., Flame-coloured are his wings,
and coloured like flame is his body., His lips are sweet as honey, and
his breath is like frankincense.?, The Student looked up from the grass, and listened, but he could not
understand what the Nightingale was saying to him, for he only knew the
things that are written down in books., But the Oak-tree understood, and felt sad, for he was very fond of the
little Nightingale who had built her nest in his branches., ?Sing me one last song,?, he whispered; ?I shall feel very lonely when you
are gone.?, So the Nightingale sang to the Oak-tree, and her voice was like water
bubbling from a silver jar., When she had finished her song the Student got up, and pulled a note-book
and a lead-pencil out of his pocket., ?She has form,?, he said to himself, as he walked away through the
grove?, ?that cannot be denied to her; but has she got feeling?, I am
afraid not., In fact, she is like most artists; she is all style, without
any sincerity., She would not sacrifice herself for others., She thinks
merely of music, and everybody knows that the arts are selfish., Still,
it must be admitted that she has some beautiful notes in her voice., What
a pity it is that they do not mean anything, or do any practical good.?, And he went into his room, and lay down on his little pallet-bed, and
began to think of his love; and, after a time, he fell asleep., And when the Moon shone in the heavens the Nightingale flew to the
Rose-tree, and set her breast against the thorn., All night long she sang
with her breast against the thorn, and the cold crystal Moon leaned down
and listened., All night long she sang, and the thorn went deeper and
deeper into her breast, and her life-blood ebbed away from her., She sang first of the birth of love in the heart of a boy and a girl., And on the top-most spray of the Rose-tree there blossomed a marvellous
rose, petal following petal, as song followed song., Pale was it, at
first, as the mist that hangs over the river?pale as the feet of the
morning, and silver as the wings of the dawn., As the shadow of a rose in
a mirror of silver, as the shadow of a rose in a water-pool, so was the
rose that blossomed on the topmost spray of the Tree., But the Tree cried to the Nightingale to press closer against the thorn., ?Press closer, little Nightingale,?, cried the Tree, ?or the Day will come
before the rose is finished.?, So the Nightingale pressed closer against the thorn, and louder and
louder grew her song, for she sang of the birth of passion in the soul of
a man and a maid., And a delicate flush of pink came into the leaves of the rose, like the
flush in the face of the bridegroom when he kisses the lips of the bride., ...]"|2
46|"[said the Miller, ?and
wondered how you were getting on.?, ?, ?That was kind of you,?, said Hans; ?I was half afraid you had forgotten
me.?, ?, ?Hans, I am surprised at you,?, said the Miller; ?friendship never
forgets., That is the wonderful thing about it, but I am afraid you don?t
understand the poetry of life., How lovely your primroses are looking,
by-the-bye!?, ?, ?They are certainly very lovely,?, said Hans, ?and it is a most lucky
thing for me that I have so many., I am going to bring them into the
market and sell them to the Burgomaster?s daughter, and buy back my
wheelbarrow with the money.?, ?, ?Buy back your wheelbarrow?, You don?t mean to say you have sold it?, What a very stupid thing to do!?, ?, ?Well, the fact is,?, said Hans, ?that I was obliged to., You see the
winter was a very bad time for me, and I really had no money at all to
buy bread with., So I first sold the silver buttons off my Sunday coat,
and then I sold my silver chain, and then I sold my big pipe, and at last
I sold my wheelbarrow., But I am going to buy them all back again now.?, ??Hans,?, said the Miller, ?I will give you my wheelbarrow., It is not in
very good repair; indeed, one side is gone, and there is something wrong
with the wheel-spokes; but in spite of that I will give it to you., I
know it is very generous of me, and a great many people would think me
extremely foolish for parting with it, but I am not like the rest of the
world., I think that generosity is the essence of friendship, and,
besides, I have got a new wheelbarrow for myself., Yes, you may set your
mind at ease, I will give you my wheelbarrow.?, ?, ?Well, really, that is generous of you,?, said little Hans, and his funny
round face glowed all over with pleasure., ?I can easily put it in
repair, as I have a plank of wood in the house.?, ?, ?A plank of wood!?, said the Miller; ?why, that is just what I want for
the roof of my barn., There is a very large hole in it, and the corn will
all get damp if I don?t stop it up., How lucky you mentioned it!, It is
quite remarkable how one good action always breeds another., I have given
you my wheelbarrow, and now you are going to give me your plank., Of
course, the wheelbarrow is worth far more than the plank, but true,
friendship never notices things like that., Pray get it at once, and I
will set to work at my barn this very day.?, ??Certainly,?, cried little Hans, and he ran into the shed and dragged the
plank out., ?, ?It is not a very big plank,?, said the Miller, looking at it, ?and I am
afraid that after I have mended my barn-roof there won?t be any left for
you to mend the wheelbarrow with; but, of course, that is not my fault., And now, as I have given you my wheelbarrow, I am sure you would like to
give me some flowers in return., Here is the basket, and mind you fill it
quite full.?, ?, ?Quite full??, said little Hans, rather sorrowfully, for it was really a
very big basket, and he knew that if he filled it he would have no
flowers left for the market and he was very anxious to get his silver
buttons back., ?, ?Well, really,?, answered the Miller, ?as I have given you my
wheelbarrow, I don?t think that it is much to ask you for a few flowers., I may be wrong, but I should have thought that friendship, true
friendship, was quite free from selfishness of any kind.?, ?, ?My dear friend, my best friend,?, cried little Hans, ?you are welcome to
all the flowers in my garden., I would much sooner have your good opinion
than my silver buttons, any day?, ; and he ran and plucked all his pretty
primroses, and filled the Miller?s basket., ?, ?Good-bye, little Hans,?, said the Miller, as he went up the hill with
the plank on his shoulder, and the big basket in his hand., ??Good-bye,?, said little Hans, and he began to dig away quite merrily, he
was so pleased about the wheelbarrow., ?The next day he was nailing up some honeysuckle against the porch, when
he heard the Miller?s voice calling to him from the road., So he jumped
off the ladder, and ran down the garden, and looked over the wall., ?There was the Miller with a large sack of flour on his back., ?, ?Dear little Hans,?, said the Miller, ?would you mind carrying this sack
of flour for me to market??, ?, ?Oh, I am so sorry,?, said Hans, ?but I am really very busy to-day., I
have got all my creepers to nail up, and all my flowers to water, and all
my grass to roll.?, ?, ?Well, really,?, said the Miller, ?I think that, considering that I am
going to give you my wheelbarrow, it is rather unfriendly of you to
refuse.?, ?, ?Oh, don?t say that,?, cried little Hans, ?I wouldn?t be unfriendly for
the whole world?, ; and he ran in for his cap, and trudged off with the big
sack on his shoulders., ?It was a very hot day, and the road was terribly dusty, and before Hans
had reached the sixth milestone he was so tired that he had to sit down
and rest., However, he went on bravely, and as last he reached the
market., After he had waited there some time, he sold the sack of flour
for a very good price, and then he returned home at once, for he was
afraid that if he stopped too late he might meet some robbers on the way., ?, ?It has certainly been a hard day,?, said little Hans to himself as he
was going to bed, ?but I am glad I did not refuse the Miller, for he is
my best friend, and, besides, he is going to give me his wheelbarrow.?, ?Early the next morning the Miller came down to get the money for his
sack of flour, but little Hans was so tired that he was still in bed., ?, ?Upon my word,?, said the Miller, ?you are very lazy., Really,
considering that I am going to give you my wheelbarrow, I think you might
work harder., Idleness is a great sin, and I certainly don?t like any of
my friends to be idle or sluggish., You must not mind my speaking quite
plainly to you., Of course I should not dream of doing so if I were not
your friend., But what is the good of friendship if one cannot say
exactly what one means?, Anybody can say charming things and try to
please and to flatter, but a true friend always says unpleasant things,
and does not mind giving pain., Indeed, if he is a really true friend he
prefers it, for he knows that then he is doing good.?, ...]"|2

joyful occasion, and when I soar up into the air I intend to tell the
stars all about it., You will see them twinkle when I talk to them about

I expected., There is nothing in you; you are hollow and empty., Why,
perhaps the Prince and Princess may go to live in a country where there
is a deep river, and perhaps they may have one only son, a little
fair-haired boy with violet eyes like the Prince himself; and perhaps
some day he may go out to walk with his nurse; and perhaps the nurse may
go to sleep under a great elder-tree; and perhaps the little boy may fall
into the deep river and be drowned., What a terrible misfortune!, Poor
people, to lose their only son!, It is really too dreadful!, I shall
never get over it.?, ?But they have not lost their only son,?, said the Roman Candle; ?no
misfortune has happened to them at all.?, ?I never said that they had,?, replied the Rocket; ?I said that they
might., If they had lost their only son there would be no use in saying
anything more about the matter., I hate people who cry over spilt milk., But when I think that they might lose their only son, I certainly am very
much affected.?, ?You certainly are!?, cried the Bengal Light., ?In fact, you are the most
affected person I ever met.?, ?You are the rudest person I ever met,?, said the Rocket, ?and you cannot
understand my friendship for the Prince.?, ?Why, you don?t even know him,?, growled the Roman Candle., ?I never said I knew him,?, answered the Rocket., ?I dare say that if I
knew him I should not be his friend at all., It is a very dangerous thing
to know one?s friends.?, ?You had really better keep yourself dry,?, said the Fire-balloon., ?That
is the important thing.?, ?Very important for you, I have no doubt,?, answered the Rocket, ?but I
shall weep if I choose?, ; and he actually burst into real tears, which
flowed down his stick like rain-drops, and nearly drowned two little
beetles, who were just thinking of setting up house together, and were
looking for a nice dry spot to live in., ?He must have a truly romantic nature,?, said the Catherine Wheel, ?for he
weeps when there is nothing at all to weep about?, ; and she heaved a deep
sigh, and thought about the deal box., But the Roman Candle and the Bengal Light were quite indignant, and kept
saying, ?Humbug!, humbug!?, at the top of their voices., They were
extremely practical, and whenever they objected to anything they called
it humbug., Then the moon rose like a wonderful silver shield; and the stars began to
shine, and a sound of music came from the palace., The Prince and Princess were leading the dance., They danced so
beautifully that the tall white lilies peeped in at the window and
watched them, and the great red poppies nodded their heads and beat time., Then ten o?clock struck, and then eleven, and then twelve, and at the
last stroke of midnight every one came out on the terrace, and the King
sent for the Royal Pyrotechnist., ?Let the fireworks begin,?, said the King; and the Royal Pyrotechnist made
a low bow, and marched down to the end of the garden., He had six
attendants with him, each of whom carried a lighted torch at the end of a
long pole., It was certainly a magnificent display., Whizz!, Whizz!, went the Catherine Wheel, as she spun round and round., Boom!, Boom!, went the Roman Candle., Then the Squibs danced all over the
place, and the Bengal Lights made everything look scarlet., ?Good-bye,?, cried the Fire-balloon, as he soared away, dropping tiny blue sparks., Bang!, Bang!, answered the Crackers, who were enjoying themselves
immensely., Every one was a great success except the Remarkable Rocket., He was so damp with crying that he could not go off at all., The best
thing in him was the gunpowder, and that was so wet with tears that it
was of no use., All his poor relations, to whom he would never speak,
except with a sneer, shot up into the sky like wonderful golden flowers
with blossoms of fire., Huzza!, Huzza!, cried the Court; and the little
Princess laughed with pleasure., ?I suppose they are reserving me for some grand occasion,?, said the
Rocket; ?no doubt that is what it means,?, and he looked more supercilious
than ever., The next day the workmen came to put everything tidy., ?This is evidently
a deputation,?, said the Rocket; ?I will receive them with becoming
dignity?, so he put his nose in the air, and began to frown severely as if
he were thinking about some very important subject., But they took no
notice of him at all till they were just going away., Then one of them
caught sight of him., ?Hallo!?, he cried, ?what a bad rocket!?, and he
threw him over the wall into the ditch., ?BAD Rocket?, BAD Rocket??, he said, as he whirled through the air;
?impossible!, GRAND Rocket, that is what the man said., BAD and GRAND
sound very much the same, indeed they often are the same?, ; and he fell
into the mud., ?It is not comfortable here,?, he remarked, ?but no doubt it is some
fashionable watering-place, and they have sent me away to recruit my
health., My nerves are certainly very much shattered, and I require
rest.?, Then a little Frog, with bright jewelled eyes, and a green mottled coat,
swam up to him., ?A new arrival, I see!?, said the Frog., ?Well, after all there is nothing
like mud., Give me rainy weather and a ditch, and I am quite happy., Do

younger_., _Clean-shaven_, _with finely-cut features_, _dark-haired and

are_., _But intensely admired by the few_, _and deeply respected by the
many_., _The note of his manner is that of perfect distinction_, _with a
slight touch of pride_., _One feels that he is conscious of the success
he has made in life_., _A nervous temperament_, _with a tired look_., _The firmly-chiselled mouth and chin contrast strikingly with the
romantic expression in the deep-set eyes_., _The variance is suggestive
of an almost complete separation of passion and intellect_, _as though
thought and emotion were each isolated in its own sphere through some
violence of will-power_., _There is nervousness in the nostrils_, _and in
the pale_, _thin_, _pointed hands_., _It would be inaccurate to call him
picturesque_., _Picturesqueness cannot survive the House of Commons_., _But Vandyck would have liked to have painted his head_.], SIR ROBERT CHILTERN., Good evening, Lady Markby!, I hope you have brought
Sir John with you?, LADY MARKBY., Oh!, I have brought a much more charming person than Sir
John., Sir John?s temper since he has taken seriously to politics has
become quite unbearable., Really, now that the House of Commons is trying
to become useful, it does a great deal of harm., SIR ROBERT CHILTERN., I hope not, Lady Markby., At any rate we do our

in the House stand these long debates., LORD GORING., By never listening., LADY BASILDON., Really?, LORD GORING., [_In his most serious manner_.], Of course., You see, it is
a very dangerous thing to listen., If one listens one may be convinced;

thoroughly unreasonable person., LADY BASILDON., Ah!, that accounts for so much in men that I have never
understood, and so much in women that their husbands never appreciate in
them!, MRS. MARCHMONT., [_With a sigh_.], Our husbands never appreciate anything

a bachelor., MRS. MARCHMONT., [_Pressing_ LADY BASILDON?S _hand_.], My poor Olivia!, We have married perfect husbands, and we are well punished for it., LORD GORING., I should have thought it was the husbands who were

all!, Remember to what a point your Puritanism in England has brought
you., In old days nobody pretended to be a bit better than his
neighbours., In fact, to be a bit better than one?s neighbour was
considered excessively vulgar and middle-class., Nowadays, with our
modern mania for morality, every one has to pose as a paragon of purity,
incorruptibility, and all the other seven deadly virtues?and what is the

passes in England without somebody disappearing., Scandals used to lend
charm, or at least interest, to a man?now they crush him., And yours is a
very nasty scandal., You couldn?t survive it., If it were known that as a
young man, secretary to a great and important minister, you sold a
Cabinet secret for a large sum of money, and that that was the origin of
your wealth and career, you would be hounded out of public life, you
would disappear completely., And after all, Sir Robert, why should you

splendid position, but it is your splendid position that makes you so

possible., Sir Robert, you know what your English newspapers are like., Suppose that when I leave this house I drive down to some newspaper
office, and give them this scandal and the proofs of it!, Think of their
loathsome joy, of the delight they would have in dragging you down, of
the mud and mire they would plunge you in., Think of the hypocrite with
his greasy smile penning his leading article, and arranging the foulness
of the public placard., SIR ROBERT CHILTERN., Stop!, You want me to withdraw the report and to
make a short speech stating that I believe there are possibilities in the
scheme?, MRS. CHEVELEY., [_Sitting down on the sofa_.], Those are my terms., SIR ROBERT CHILTERN., [_In a low voice_.], I will give you any sum of

sorrow of her life at present is that she can?t manage to have enough of
them., SIR ROBERT CHILTERN., [_Writing_.], Why do you say that?, LORD GORING., [_Turning round_.], Well, she wore far too much rouge last

he is the best secretary he has ever had., MABEL CHILTERN., Well, Tommy has proposed to me again., Tommy really does
nothing but propose to me., He proposed to me last night in the
music-room, when I was quite unprotected, as there was an elaborate trio
going on., I didn?t dare to make the smallest repartee, I need hardly
tell you., If I had, it would have stopped the music at once., Musical
people are so absurdly unreasonable., They always want one to be
perfectly dumb at the very moment when one is longing to be absolutely
deaf., Then he proposed to me in broad daylight this morning, in front of
that dreadful statue of Achilles., Really, the things that go on in front
of that work of art are quite appalling., The police should interfere., At luncheon I saw by the glare in his eye that he was going to propose
again, and I just managed to check him in time by assuring him that I was
a bimetallist., Fortunately I don?t know what bimetallism means., And I
don?t believe anybody else does either., But the observation crushed
Tommy for ten minutes., He looked quite shocked., And then Tommy is so
annoying in the way he proposes., If he proposed at the top of his voice,
I should not mind so much., That might produce some effect on the public., But he does it in a horrid confidential way., When Tommy wants to be
romantic he talks to one just like a doctor., I am very fond of Tommy,
but his methods of proposing are quite out of date., I wish, Gertrude,
you would speak to him, and tell him that once a week is quite often
enough to propose to any one, and that it should always be done in a
manner that attracts some attention., LADY CHILTERN., Dear Mabel, don?t talk like that., Besides, Robert thinks
very highly of Mr. Trafford., He believes he has a brilliant future
before him., MABEL CHILTERN., Oh!, I wouldn?t marry a man with a future before him for
anything under the sun., LADY CHILTERN., Mabel!, MABEL CHILTERN., I know, dear., You married a man with a future, didn?t
you?, But then Robert was a genius, and you have a noble,
self-sacrificing character., You can stand geniuses., I have no character
at all, and Robert is the only genius I could ever bear., As a rule, I

want them to be thinking about me., I must go round now and rehearse at
Lady Basildon?s., You remember, we are having tableaux, don?t you?, The
Triumph of something, I don?t know what!, I hope it will be triumph of

have made up my mind what I am going to do to-night in the House., The
debate on the Argentine Canal is to begin at eleven., [_A chair falls in
the drawing-room_.], What is that?, LORD GORING., Nothing., SIR ROBERT CHILTERN., I heard a chair fall in the next room., Some one
has been listening., LORD GORING., No, no; there is no one there., SIR ROBERT CHILTERN., There is some one., There are lights in the room,
and the door is ajar., Some one has been listening to every secret of my
life., Arthur, what does this mean?, LORD GORING., Robert, you are excited, unnerved., I tell you there is no
one in that room., Sit down, Robert., SIR ROBERT CHILTERN., Do you give me your word that there is no one
there?, LORD GORING., Yes., SIR ROBERT CHILTERN., Your word of honour?, [_Sits down_.], LORD GORING., Yes., SIR ROBERT CHILTERN., [_Rises_.], Arthur, let me see for myself., LORD GORING., No, no., SIR ROBERT CHILTERN., If there is no one there why should I not look in
that room?, Arthur, you must let me go into that room and satisfy myself., Let me know that no eavesdropper has heard my life?s secret., Arthur, you
don?t realise what I am going through., LORD GORING., Robert, this must stop., I have told you that there is no
one in that room?that is enough., SIR ROBERT CHILTERN., [_Rushes to the door of the room_.], It is not
enough., I insist on going into this room., You have told me there is no
one there, so what reason can you have for refusing me?, ...]"|2

be no forgiveness., MRS. CHEVELEY., Arthur, you are unjust to me., Believe me, you are quite
unjust to me., I didn?t go to taunt Gertrude at all., I had no idea of
doing anything of the kind when I entered., I called with Lady Markby

night, had been found at the Chilterns?., If you don?t believe me, you
can ask Lady Markby., She will tell you it is true., The scene that
occurred happened after Lady Markby had left, and was really forced on me
by Gertrude?s rudeness and sneers., I called, oh!, ?a little out of malice

well on me as a bracelet, doesn?t it?, LORD GORING., Yes; much better than when I saw it last., MRS. CHEVELEY., When did you see it last?, LORD GORING., [_Calmly_.], Oh, ten years ago, on Lady Berkshire, from
whom you stole it., MRS. CHEVELEY., [_Starting_.], What do you mean?, LORD GORING., I mean that you stole that ornament from my cousin, Mary
Berkshire, to whom I gave it when she was married., Suspicion fell on a
wretched servant, who was sent away in disgrace., I recognised it last
night., I determined to say nothing about it till I had found the thief., I have found the thief now, and I have heard her own confession., MRS. CHEVELEY., [_Tossing her head_.], It is not true., LORD GORING., You know it is true., Why, thief is written across your

my possession., [MRS. CHEVELEY _tries to get the bracelet off her arm_, _but fails_., LORD GORING _looks on amused_., _Her thin fingers tear at the jewel to no

one never knows how wonderful the thing that one steals is., You can?t
get that bracelet off, unless you know where the spring is., And I see
you don?t know where the spring is., It is rather difficult to find., MRS. CHEVELEY., You brute!, You coward!, [_She tries again to unclasp the

observation., ...]"|2
61|"[Wordsworth went to the lakes,
but he was never a lake poet., He found in stones the sermons he had
already hidden there., He went moralising about the district, but his
good work was produced when he returned, not to Nature but to poetry., Poetry gave him ?Laodamia,?, and the fine sonnets, and the great Ode, such
as it is., Nature gave him ?Martha Ray?, and ?Peter Bell,?, and the address
to Mr. Wilkinson?s spade., CYRIL., I think that view might be questioned., I am rather inclined to
believe in ?the impulse from a vernal wood,?, though of course the
artistic value of such an impulse depends entirely on the kind of
temperament that receives it, so that the return to Nature would come to
mean simply the advance to a great personality., You would agree with
that, I fancy., However, proceed with your article., VIVIAN (_reading_)., ?Art begins with abstract decoration, with purely
imaginative and pleasurable work dealing with what is unreal and
non-existent., This is the first stage., Then Life becomes fascinated
with this new wonder, and asks to be admitted into the charmed circle., Art takes life as part of her rough material, recreates it, and
refashions it in fresh forms, is absolutely indifferent to fact, invents,
imagines, dreams, and keeps between herself and reality the impenetrable
barrier of beautiful style, of decorative or ideal treatment., The third
stage is when Life gets the upper hand, and drives Art out into the
wilderness., That is the true decadence, and it is from this that we are
now suffering., ?Take the case of the English drama., At first in the hands of the monks
Dramatic Art was abstract, decorative and mythological., Then she
enlisted Life in her service, and using some of life?s external forms,
she created an entirely new race of beings, whose sorrows were more
terrible than any sorrow man has ever felt, whose joys were keener than
lover?s joys, who had the rage of the Titans and the calm of the gods,
who had monstrous and marvellous sins, monstrous and marvellous virtues., To them she gave a language different from that of actual use, a language
full of resonant music and sweet rhythm, made stately by solemn cadence,
or made delicate by fanciful rhyme, jewelled with wonderful words, and
enriched with lofty diction., She clothed her children in strange raiment
and gave them masks, and at her bidding the antique world rose from its
marble tomb., A new C?sar stalked through the streets of risen Rome, and
with purple sail and flute-led oars another Cleopatra passed up the river
to Antioch., Old myth and legend and dream took shape and substance., History was entirely re-written, and there was hardly one of the
dramatists who did not recognise that the object of Art is not simple
truth but complex beauty., In this they were perfectly right., Art itself
is really a form of exaggeration; and selection, which is the very spirit
of art, is nothing more than an intensified mode of over-emphasis., ?But Life soon shattered the perfection of the form., Even in Shakespeare
we can see the beginning of the end., It shows itself by the gradual
breaking-up of the blank-verse in the later plays, by the predominance
given to prose, and by the over-importance assigned to characterisation., The passages in Shakespeare?and they are many?where the language is
uncouth, vulgar, exaggerated, fantastic, obscene even, are entirely due
to Life calling for an echo of her own voice, and rejecting the
intervention of beautiful style, through which alone should life be
suffered to find expression., Shakespeare is not by any means a flawless
artist., He is too fond of going directly to life, and borrowing life?s
natural utterance., He forgets that when Art surrenders her imaginative
medium she surrenders everything., Goethe says, somewhere?, In der Beschr?nkung zeigt Fsich erst der Meister,

?It is in working within limits that the master reveals himself,?, and the
limitation, the very condition of any art is style., However, we need not
linger any longer over Shakespeare?s realism., _The Tempest_ is the most
perfect of palinodes., All that we desired to point out was, that the
magnificent work of the Elizabethan and Jacobean artists contained within
itself the seeds of its own dissolution, and that, if it drew some of its
strength from using life as rough material, it drew all its weakness from
using life as an artistic method., As the inevitable result of this
substitution of an imitative for a creative medium, this surrender of an
imaginative form, we have the modern English melodrama., The characters
in these plays talk on the stage exactly as they would talk off it; they
have neither aspirations nor aspirates; they are taken directly from life
and reproduce its vulgarity down to the smallest detail; they present the
gait, manner, costume and accent of real people; they would pass
unnoticed in a third-class railway carriage., And yet how wearisome the
plays are!, They do not succeed in producing even that impression of
reality at which they aim, and which is their only reason for existing., As a method, realism is a complete failure., ?What is true about the drama and the novel is no less true about those
arts that we call the decorative arts., The whole history of these arts
in Europe is the record of the struggle between Orientalism, with its
frank rejection of imitation, its love of artistic convention, its
dislike to the actual representation of any object in Nature, and our own
imitative spirit., Wherever the former has been paramount, as in
Byzantium, Sicily and Spain, by actual contact, or in the rest of Europe
by the influence of the Crusades, we have had beautiful and imaginative
work in which the visible things of life are transmuted into artistic
conventions, and the things that Life has not are invented and fashioned
for her delight., But wherever we have returned to Life and Nature, our
work has always become vulgar, common and uninteresting., Modern
tapestry, with its a?rial effects, its elaborate perspective, its broad
expanses of waste sky, its faithful and laborious realism, has no beauty
whatsoever., The pictorial glass of Germany is absolutely detestable., We
are beginning to weave possible carpets in England, but only because we
have returned to the method and spirit of the East., Our rugs and carpets
of twenty years ago, with their solemn depressing truths, their inane
worship of Nature, their sordid reproductions of visible objects, have
become, even to the Philistine, a source of laughter., A cultured
Mahomedan once remarked to us, ?You Christians are so occupied in
misinterpreting the fourth commandment that you have never thought of
making an artistic application of the second.?, He was perfectly right,
and the whole truth of the matter is this: The proper school to learn art
in is not Life but Art.?, And now let me read you a passage which seems to me to settle the
question very completely., ?It was not always thus., We need not say anything about the poets, for
they, with the unfortunate exception of Mr. Wordsworth, have been really
faithful to their high mission, and are universally recognised as being
absolutely unreliable., But in the works of Herodotus, who, in spite of
the shallow and ungenerous attempts of modern sciolists to verify his
history, may justly be called the ?Father of Lies?, ; in the published
speeches of Cicero and the biographies of Suetonius; in Tacitus at his
best; in Pliny?s _Natural History_; in Hanno?s _Periplus_; in all the
early chronicles; in the Lives of the Saints; in Froissart and Sir Thomas
Malory; in the travels of Marco Polo; in Olaus Magnus, and Aldrovandus,
and Conrad Lycosthenes, with his magnificent _Prodigiorum et Ostentorum
Chronicon_; in the autobiography of Benvenuto Cellini; in the memoirs of
Casanova; in Defoe?s _History of the Plague_; in Boswell?s _Life of
Johnson_; in Napoleon?s despatches, and in the works of our own Carlyle,
whose _French Revolution_ is one of the most fascinating historical
novels ever written, facts are either kept in their proper subordinate
position, or else entirely excluded on the general ground of dulness., Now, everything is changed., Facts are not merely finding a footing-place
in history, but they are usurping the domain of Fancy, and have invaded
the kingdom of Romance., Their chilling touch is over everything., They
are vulgarising mankind., The crude commercialism of America, its
materialising spirit, its indifference to the poetical side of things,
and its lack of imagination and of high unattainable ideals, are entirely
due to that country having adopted for its national hero a man who,
according to his own confession, was incapable of telling a lie, and it
is not too much to say that the story of George Washington and the
cherry-tree has done more harm, and in a shorter space of time, than any
other moral tale in the whole of literature.?, CYRIL., My dear boy!, VIVIAN., I assure you it is the case, and the amusing part of the whole
thing is that the story of the cherry-tree is an absolute myth., However,
you must not think that I am too despondent about the artistic future
either of America or of our own country., Listen to this:?, ?That some change will take place before this century has drawn to its
close we have no doubt whatsoever., Bored by the tedious and improving
conversation of those who have neither the wit to exaggerate nor the
genius to romance, tired of the intelligent person whose reminiscences
are always based upon memory, whose statements are invariably limited by
probability, and who is at any time liable to be corroborated by the
merest Philistine who happens to be present, Society sooner or later must
return to its lost leader, the cultured and fascinating liar., Who he was
who first, without ever having gone out to the rude chase, told the
wandering cavemen at sunset how he had dragged the Megatherium from the
purple darkness of its jasper cave, or slain the Mammoth in single combat
and brought back its gilded tusks, we cannot tell, and not one of our
modern anthropologists, for all their much-boasted science, has had the
ordinary courage to tell us., Whatever was his name or race, he certainly
was the true founder of social intercourse., For the aim of the liar is
simply to charm, to delight, to give pleasure., He is the very basis of
civilised society, and without him a dinner-party, even at the mansions
of the great, is as dull as a lecture at the Royal Society, or a debate
at the Incorporated Authors, or one of Mr. Burnand?s farcical comedies., ?Nor will he be welcomed by society alone., Art, breaking from the
prison-house of realism, will run to greet him, and will kiss his false,
beautiful lips, knowing that he alone is in possession of the great
secret of all her manifestations, the secret that Truth is entirely and
absolutely a matter of style; while Life?poor, probable, uninteresting
human life?tired of repeating herself for the benefit of Mr. Herbert
Spencer, scientific historians, and the compilers of statistics in
general, will follow meekly after him, and try to reproduce, in her own
simple and untutored way, some of the marvels of which he talks., ?No doubt there will always be critics who, like a certain writer in the
_Saturday Review_, will gravely censure the teller of fairy tales for his
defective knowledge of natural history, who will measure imaginative work
by their own lack of any imaginative faculty, and will hold up their
ink-stained hands in horror if some honest gentleman, who has never been
farther than the yew-trees of his own garden, pens a fascinating book of
travels like Sir John Mandeville, or, like great Raleigh, writes a whole
history of the world, without knowing anything whatsoever about the past., To excuse themselves they will try and shelter under the shield of him
who made Prospero the magician, and gave him Caliban and Ariel as his
servants, who heard the Tritons blowing their horns round the coral reefs
of the Enchanted Isle, and the fairies singing to each other in a wood
near Athens, who led the phantom kings in dim procession across the misty
Scottish heath, and hid Hecate in a cave with the weird sisters., They
will call upon Shakespeare?they always do?and will quote that hackneyed
passage forgetting that this unfortunate aphorism about Art holding the
mirror up to Nature, is deliberately said by Hamlet in order to convince
the bystanders of his absolute insanity in all art-matters.?, CYRIL., Ahem!, Another cigarette, please., VIVIAN., My dear fellow, whatever you may say, it is merely a dramatic
utterance, and no more represents Shakespeare?s real views upon art than
the speeches of Iago represent his real views upon morals., But let me
get to the end of the passage:

?Art finds her own perfection within, and not outside of, herself., She
is not to be judged by any external standard of resemblance., She is a
veil, rather than a mirror., She has flowers that no forests know of,
birds that no woodland possesses., She makes and unmakes many worlds, and
can draw the moon from heaven with a scarlet thread., Hers are the ?forms
more real than living man,?, and hers the great archetypes of which things
that have existence are but unfinished copies., Nature has, in her eyes,
no laws, no uniformity., She can work miracles at her will, and when she
calls monsters from the deep they come., ...]"|2
62|"[Art never expresses anything but
itself., It has an independent life, just as Thought has, and develops
purely on its own lines., It is not necessarily realistic in an age of
realism, nor spiritual in an age of faith., So far from being the
creation of its time, it is usually in direct opposition to it, and the
only history that it preserves for us is the history of its own progress., Sometimes it returns upon its footsteps, and revives some antique form,
as happened in the archaistic movement of late Greek Art, and in the
pre-Raphaelite movement of our own day., At other times it entirely
anticipates its age, and produces in one century work that it takes
another century to understand, to appreciate and to enjoy., In no case
does it reproduce its age., To pass from the art of a time to the time
itself is the great mistake that all historians commit., The second doctrine is this., All bad art comes from returning to Life
and Nature, and elevating them into ideals., Life and Nature may
sometimes be used as part of Art?s rough material, but before they are of
any real service to art they must be translated into artistic
conventions., The moment Art surrenders its imaginative medium it
surrenders everything., As a method Realism is a complete failure, and
the two things that every artist should avoid are modernity of form and
modernity of subject-matter., To us, who live in the nineteenth century,
any century is a suitable subject for art except our own., The only
beautiful things are the things that do not concern us., It is, to have
the pleasure of quoting myself, exactly because Hecuba is nothing to us
that her sorrows are so suitable a motive for a tragedy., Besides, it is
only the modern that ever becomes old-fashioned., M. Zola sits down to
give us a picture of the Second Empire., Who cares for the Second Empire
now?, It is out of date., Life goes faster than Realism, but Romanticism
is always in front of Life., The third doctrine is that Life imitates Art far more than Art imitates
Life., This results not merely from Life?s imitative instinct, but from
the fact that the self-conscious aim of Life is to find expression, and
that Art offers it certain beautiful forms through which it may realise
that energy., It is a theory that has never been put forward before, but
it is extremely fruitful, and throws an entirely new light upon the
history of Art., It follows, as a corollary from this, that external Nature also imitates
Art., The only effects that she can show us are effects that we have
already seen through poetry, or in paintings., This is the secret of
Nature?s charm, as well as the explanation of Nature?s weakness., The final revelation is that Lying, the telling of beautiful untrue
things, is the proper aim of Art., But of this I think I have spoken at
sufficient length., And now let us go out on the terrace, where ?droops
the milk-white peacock like a ghost,?, while the evening star ?washes the
dusk with silver.?, At twilight nature becomes a wonderfully suggestive
effect, and is not without loveliness, though perhaps its chief use is to
illustrate quotations from the poets., Come!, We have talked long enough., PEN, PENCIL AND POISON
A STUDY IN GREEN


IT has constantly been made a subject of reproach against artists and men
of letters that they are lacking in wholeness and completeness of nature., As a rule this must necessarily be so., That very concentration of vision
and intensity of purpose which is the characteristic of the artistic
temperament is in itself a mode of limitation., To those who are
preoccupied with the beauty of form nothing else seems of much
importance., Yet there are many exceptions to this rule., Rubens served
as ambassador, and Goethe as state councillor, and Milton as Latin
secretary to Cromwell., Sophocles held civic office in his own city; the
humourists, essayists, and novelists of modern America seem to desire
nothing better than to become the diplomatic representatives of their
country; and Charles Lamb?s friend, Thomas Griffiths Wainewright, the
subject of this brief memoir, though of an extremely artistic
temperament, followed many masters other than art, being not merely a
poet and a painter, an art-critic, an antiquarian, and a writer of prose,
an amateur of beautiful things, and a dilettante of things delightful,
but also a forger of no mean or ordinary capabilities, and as a subtle
and secret poisoner almost without rival in this or any age., This remarkable man, so powerful with ?pen, pencil and poison,?, as a
great poet of our own day has finely said of him, was born at Chiswick,
in 1794., His father was the son of a distinguished solicitor of Gray?s
Inn and Hatton Garden., His mother was the daughter of the celebrated Dr.
Griffiths, the editor and founder of the _Monthly Review_, the partner in
another literary speculation of Thomas Davis, that famous bookseller of
whom Johnson said that he was not a bookseller, but ?a gentleman who
dealt in books,?, the friend of Goldsmith and Wedgwood, and one of the
most well-known men of his day., Mrs. Wainewright died, in giving him
birth, at the early age of twenty-one, and an obituary notice in the
_Gentleman?s Magazine_ tells us of her ?amiable disposition and numerous
accomplishments,?, and adds somewhat quaintly that ?she is supposed to
have understood the writings of Mr. Locke as well as perhaps any person
of either sex now living.?, His father did not long survive his young
wife, and the little child seems to have been brought up by his
grandfather, and, on the death of the latter in 1803, by his uncle George
Edward Griffiths, whom he subsequently poisoned., His boyhood was passed
at Linden House, Turnham Green, one of those many fine Georgian mansions
that have unfortunately disappeared before the inroads of the suburban
builder, and to its lovely gardens and well-timbered park he owed that
simple and impassioned love of nature which never left him all through
his life, and which made him so peculiarly susceptible to the spiritual
influences of Wordsworth?s poetry., He went to school at Charles Burney?s
academy at Hammersmith., Mr. Burney was the son of the historian of
music, and the near kinsman of the artistic lad who was destined to turn
out his most remarkable pupil., He seems to have been a man of a good
deal of culture, and in after years Mr. Wainewright often spoke of him
with much affection as a philosopher, an arch?ologist, and an admirable
teacher who, while he valued the intellectual side of education, did not
forget the importance of early moral training., It was under Mr. Burney
that he first developed his talent as an artist, and Mr. Hazlitt tells us
that a drawing-book which he used at school is still extant, and displays
great talent and natural feeling., Indeed, painting was the first art
that fascinated him., It was not till much later that he sought to find
expression by pen or poison., Before this, however, he seems to have been carried away by boyish dreams
of the romance and chivalry of a soldier?s life, and to have become a
young guardsman., But the reckless dissipated life of his companions
failed to satisfy the refined artistic temperament of one who was made
for other things., In a short time he wearied of the service., ?Art,?, he
tells us, in words that still move many by their ardent sincerity and
strange fervour, ?Art touched her renegade; by her pure and high
influence the noisome mists were purged; my feelings, parched, hot, and
tarnished, were renovated with cool, fresh bloom, simple, beautiful to
the simple-hearted.?, But Art was not the only cause of the change., ?The
writings of Wordsworth,?, he goes on to say, ?did much towards calming the
confusing whirl necessarily incident to sudden mutations., I wept over
them tears of happiness and gratitude.?, He accordingly left the army,
with its rough barrack-life and coarse mess-room tittle-tattle, and
returned to Linden House, full of this new-born enthusiasm for culture., A severe illness, in which, to use his own words, he was ?broken like a
vessel of clay,?, prostrated him for a time., His delicately strung
organisation, however indifferent it might have been to inflicting pain
on others, was itself most keenly sensitive to pain., He shrank from
suffering as a thing that mars and maims human life, and seems to have
wandered through that terrible valley of melancholia from which so many
great, perhaps greater, spirits have never emerged., But he was
young?only twenty-five years of age?and he soon passed out of the ?dead
black waters,?, as he called them, into the larger air of humanistic
culture., As he was recovering from the illness that had led him almost
to the gates of death, he conceived the idea of taking up literature as
an art., ?I said with John Woodvil,?, he cries, ?it were a life of gods to
dwell in such an element,?, to see and hear and write brave things:?, ?These high and gusty relishes of life
    Have no allayings of mortality.?, It is impossible not to feel that in this passage we have the utterance
of a man who had a true passion for letters., ?To see and hear and write
brave things,?, this was his aim., Scott, the editor of the _London Magazine_, struck by the young man?s
genius, or under the influence of the strange fascination that he
exercised on every one who knew him, invited him to write a series of
articles on artistic subjects, and under a series of fanciful pseudonym
he began to contribute to the literature of his day., _Janus
Weathercock_, _Egomet Bonmot_, and _Van Vinkvooms_, were some of the
grotesque masks under which he choose to hide his seriousness or to
reveal his levity., A mask tells us more than a face., These disguises
intensified his personality., In an incredibly short time he seems to
have made his mark., Charles Lamb speaks of ?kind, light-hearted
Wainewright,?, whose prose is ?capital.?, We hear of him entertaining
Macready, John Forster, Maginn, Talfourd, Sir Wentworth Dilke, the poet
John Clare, and others, at _a petit-d?ner_., Like Disraeli, he determined
to startle the town as a dandy, and his beautiful rings, his antique
cameo breast-pin, and his pale lemon-coloured kid gloves, were well
known, and indeed were regarded by Hazlitt as being the signs of a new
manner in literature: while his rich curly hair, fine eyes, and exquisite
white hands gave him the dangerous and delightful distinction of being
different from others., There was something in him of Balzac?s Lucien de
Rubempr?., At times he reminds us of Julien Sorel., De Quincey saw him
once., It was at a dinner at Charles Lamb?s., ?Amongst the company, all
literary men, sat a murderer,?, he tells us, and he goes on to describe
how on that day he had been ill, and had hated the face of man and woman,
and yet found himself looking with intellectual interest across the table
at the young writer beneath whose affectations of manner there seemed to
him to lie so much unaffected sensibility, and speculates on ?what sudden
growth of another interest?, would have changed his mood, had he known of
what terrible sin the guest to whom Lamb paid so much attention was even
then guilty., His life-work falls naturally under the three heads suggested by Mr.
Swinburne, and it may be partly admitted that, if we set aside his
achievements in the sphere of poison, what he has actually left to us
hardly justifies his reputation., But then it is only the Philistine who seeks to estimate a personality by
the vulgar test of production., This young dandy sought to be somebody,
rather than to do something., He recognised that Life itself is in art,
and has its modes of style no less than the arts that seek to express it., ...]"|2
63|"[The mode of thought that Cardinal Newman represented?if that
can be called a mode of thought which seeks to solve intellectual
problems by a denial of the supremacy of the intellect?may not, cannot, I
think, survive., But the world will never weary of watching that troubled
soul in its progress from darkness to darkness., The lonely church at
Littlemore, where ?the breath of the morning is damp, and worshippers are
few,?, will always be dear to it, and whenever men see the yellow
snapdragon blossoming on the wall of Trinity they will think of that
gracious undergraduate who saw in the flower?s sure recurrence a prophecy
that he would abide for ever with the Benign Mother of his days?a
prophecy that Faith, in her wisdom or her folly, suffered not to be
fulfilled., Yes; autobiography is irresistible., Poor, silly, conceited
Mr. Secretary Pepys has chattered his way into the circle of the
Immortals, and, conscious that indiscretion is the better part of valour,
bustles about among them in that ?shaggy purple gown with gold buttons
and looped lace?, which he is so fond of describing to us, perfectly at
his ease, and prattling, to his own and our infinite pleasure, of the
Indian blue petticoat that he bought for his wife, of the ?good hog?s
hars-let,?, and the ?pleasant French fricassee of veal?, that he loved to
eat, of his game of bowls with Will Joyce, and his ?gadding after
beauties,?, and his reciting of _Hamlet_ on a Sunday, and his playing of
the viol on week days, and other wicked or trivial things., Even in
actual life egotism is not without its attractions., When people talk to
us about others they are usually dull., When they talk to us about
themselves they are nearly always interesting, and if one could shut them
up, when they become wearisome, as easily as one can shut up a book of
which one has grown wearied, they would be perfect absolutely., ERNEST., There is much virtue in that If, as Touchstone would say., But
do you seriously propose that every man should become his own Boswell?, What would become of our industrious compilers of Lives and Recollections
in that case?, GILBERT., What has become of them?, They are the pest of the age, nothing
more and nothing less., Every great man nowadays has his disciples, and
it is always Judas who writes the biography., ERNEST., My dear fellow!, GILBERT., I am afraid it is true., Formerly we used to canonise our
heroes., The modern method is to vulgarise them., Cheap editions of great
books may be delightful, but cheap editions of great men are absolutely
detestable., ERNEST., May I ask, Gilbert, to whom you allude?, GILBERT., Oh!, to all our second-rate _litt?rateurs_., We are overrun by a
set of people who, when poet or painter passes away, arrive at the house
along with the undertaker, and forget that their one duty is to behave as
mutes., But we won?t talk about them., They are the mere body-snatchers
of literature., The dust is given to one, and the ashes to another, and
the soul is out of their reach., And now, let me play Chopin to you, or
Dvor?k?, Shall I play you a fantasy by Dvor?k?, He writes passionate,
curiously-coloured things., ERNEST., No; I don?t want music just at present., It is far too
indefinite., Besides, I took the Baroness Bernstein down to dinner last
night, and, though absolutely charming in every other respect, she
insisted on discussing music as if it were actually written in the German
language., Now, whatever music sounds like I am glad to say that it does
not sound in the smallest degree like German., There are forms of
patriotism that are really quite degrading., No; Gilbert, don?t play any
more., Turn round and talk to me., Talk to me till the white-horned day
comes into the room., There is something in your voice that is wonderful., GILBERT (_rising from the piano_)., I am not in a mood for talking
to-night., I really am not., How horrid of you to smile!, Where are the
cigarettes?, Thanks., How exquisite these single daffodils are!, They
seem to be made of amber and cool ivory., They are like Greek things of
the best period., What was the story in the confessions of the remorseful
Academician that made you laugh?, Tell it to me., After playing Chopin, I
feel as if I had been weeping over sins that I had never committed, and
mourning over tragedies that were not my own., Music always seems to me
to produce that effect., It creates for one a past of which one has been
ignorant, and fills one with a sense of sorrows that have been hidden
from one?s tears., I can fancy a man who had led a perfectly commonplace
life, hearing by chance some curious piece of music, and suddenly
discovering that his soul, without his being conscious of it, had passed
through terrible experiences, and known fearful joys, or wild romantic
loves, or great renunciations., And so tell me this story, Ernest., I
want to be amused., ERNEST., Oh!, I don?t know that it is of any importance., But I thought
it a really admirable illustration of the true value of ordinary
art-criticism., It seems that a lady once gravely asked the remorseful
Academician, as you call him, if his celebrated picture of ?A Spring-Day
at Whiteley?s,?, or, ?Waiting for the Last Omnibus,?, or some subject of
that kind, was all painted by hand?, GILBERT., And was it?, ERNEST., You are quite incorrigible., But, seriously speaking, what is
the use of art-criticism?, Why cannot the artist be left alone, to create
a new world if he wishes it, or, if not, to shadow forth the world which
we already know, and of which, I fancy, we would each one of us be
wearied if Art, with her fine spirit of choice and delicate instinct of
selection, did not, as it were, purify it for us, and give to it a
momentary perfection., It seems to me that the imagination spreads, or
should spread, a solitude around it, and works best in silence and in
isolation., Why should the artist be troubled by the shrill clamour of
criticism?, Why should those who cannot create take upon themselves to
estimate the value of creative work?, What can they know about it?, If a
man?s work is easy to understand, an explanation is unnecessary., ., ., ., GILBERT., And if his work is incomprehensible, an explanation is wicked., ERNEST., I did not say that., GILBERT., Ah!, but you should have., Nowadays, we have so few mysteries
left to us that we cannot afford to part with one of them., The members
of the Browning Society, like the theologians of the Broad Church Party,
or the authors of Mr. Walter Scott?s Great Writers Series, seem to me to
spend their time in trying to explain their divinity away., Where one had
hoped that Browning was a mystic they have sought to show that he was
simply inarticulate., Where one had fancied that he had something to
conceal, they have proved that he had but little to reveal., But I speak
merely of his incoherent work., ...]"|2
64|"[And yet, I feel I am a little unfair in this matter., As a
rule, the critics?I speak, of course, of the higher class, of those in
fact who write for the sixpenny papers?are far more cultured than the
people whose work they are called upon to review., This is, indeed, only
what one would expect, for criticism demands infinitely more cultivation
than creation does., ERNEST., Really?, GILBERT., Certainly., Anybody can write a three-volumed novel., It merely
requires a complete ignorance of both life and literature., The
difficulty that I should fancy the reviewer feels is the difficulty of
sustaining any standard., Where there is no style a standard must be
impossible., The poor reviewers are apparently reduced to be the
reporters of the police-court of literature, the chroniclers of the
doings of the habitual criminals of art., It is sometimes said of them
that they do not read all through the works they are called upon to
criticise., They do not., Or at least they should not., If they did so,
they would become confirmed misanthropes, or if I may borrow a phrase
from one of the pretty Newnham graduates, confirmed womanthropes for the
rest of their lives., Nor is it necessary., To know the vintage and
quality of a wine one need not drink the whole cask., It must be
perfectly easy in half an hour to say whether a book is worth anything or
worth nothing., Ten minutes are really sufficient, if one has the
instinct for form., Who wants to wade through a dull volume?, One tastes
it, and that is quite enough?more than enough, I should imagine., I am
aware that there are many honest workers in painting as well as in
literature who object to criticism entirely., They are quite right., Their work stands in no intellectual relation to their age., It brings us
no new element of pleasure., It suggests no fresh departure of thought,
or passion, or beauty., It should not be spoken of., It should be left to
the oblivion that it deserves., ERNEST., But, my dear fellow?excuse me for interrupting you?you seem to
me to be allowing your passion for criticism to lead you a great deal too
far., For, after all, even you must admit that it is much more difficult
to do a thing than to talk about it., GILBERT., More difficult to do a thing than to talk about it?, Not at
all., That is a gross popular error., It is very much more difficult to
talk about a thing than to do it., In the sphere of actual life that is
of course obvious., Anybody can make history., Only a great man can write
it., There is no mode of action, no form of emotion, that we do not share
with the lower animals., It is only by language that we rise above them,
or above each other?by language, which is the parent, and not the child,
of thought., Action, indeed, is always easy, and when presented to us in
its most aggravated, because most continuous form, which I take to be
that of real industry, becomes simply the refuge of people who have
nothing whatsoever to do., No, Ernest, don?t talk about action., It is a
blind thing dependent on external influences, and moved by an impulse of
whose nature it is unconscious., It is a thing incomplete in its essence,
because limited by accident, and ignorant of its direction, being always
at variance with its aim., Its basis is the lack of imagination., It is
the last resource of those who know not how to dream., ERNEST., Gilbert, you treat the world as if it were a crystal ball., You
hold it in your hand, and reverse it to please a wilful fancy., You do
nothing but re-write history., GILBERT., The one duty we owe to history is to re-write it., That is not
the least of the tasks in store for the critical spirit., When we have
fully discovered the scientific laws that govern life, we shall realise
that the one person who has more illusions than the dreamer is the man of
action., He, indeed, knows neither the origin of his deeds nor their
results., From the field in which he thought that he had sown thorns, we
have gathered our vintage, and the fig-tree that he planted for our
pleasure is as barren as the thistle, and more bitter., It is because
Humanity has never known where it was going that it has been able to find
its way., ERNEST., You think, then, that in the sphere of action a conscious aim is
a delusion?, GILBERT., It is worse than a delusion., If we lived long enough to see
the results of our actions it may be that those who call themselves good
would be sickened with a dull remorse, and those whom the world calls
evil stirred by a noble joy., Each little thing that we do passes into
the great machine of life which may grind our virtues to powder and make
them worthless, or transform our sins into elements of a new
civilisation, more marvellous and more splendid than any that has gone
before., But men are the slaves of words., They rage against Materialism,
as they call it, forgetting that there has been no material improvement
that has not spiritualised the world, and that there have been few, if
any, spiritual awakenings that have not wasted the world?s faculties in
barren hopes, and fruitless aspirations, and empty or trammelling creeds., What is termed Sin is an essential element of progress., Without it the
world would stagnate, or grow old, or become colourless., By its
curiosity Sin increases the experience of the race., Through its
intensified assertion of individualism, it saves us from monotony of
type., In its rejection of the current notions about morality, it is one
with the higher ethics., And as for the virtues!, What are the virtues?, Nature, M. Renan tells us, cares little about chastity, and it may be
that it is to the shame of the Magdalen, and not to their own purity,
that the Lucretias of modern life owe their freedom from stain., Charity,
as even those of whose religion it makes a formal part have been
compelled to acknowledge, creates a multitude of evils., The mere
existence of conscience, that faculty of which people prate so much
nowadays, and are so ignorantly proud, is a sign of our imperfect
development., It must be merged in instinct before we become fine., Self-denial is simply a method by which man arrests his progress, and
self-sacrifice a survival of the mutilation of the savage, part of that
old worship of pain which is so terrible a factor in the history of the
world, and which even now makes its victims day by day, and has its
altars in the land., Virtues!, Who knows what the virtues are?, Not you., Not I., Not any one., It is well for our vanity that we slay the
criminal, for if we suffered him to live he might show us what we had
gained by his crime., It is well for his peace that the saint goes to his
martyrdom., He is spared the sight of the horror of his harvest., ERNEST., Gilbert, you sound too harsh a note., Let us go back to the more
gracious fields of literature., What was it you said?, That it was more
difficult to talk about a thing than to do it?, GILBERT (_after a pause_)., Yes: I believe I ventured upon that simple
truth., Surely you see now that I am right?, When man acts he is a
puppet., When he describes he is a poet., The whole secret lies in that., It was easy enough on the sandy plains by windy Ilion to send the notched
arrow from the painted bow, or to hurl against the shield of hide and
flamelike brass the long ash-handled spear., It was easy for the
adulterous queen to spread the Tyrian carpets for her lord, and then, as
he lay couched in the marble bath, to throw over his head the purple net,
and call to her smooth-faced lover to stab through the meshes at the
heart that should have broken at Aulis., ...]"|2
65|"[And the chief
thing that makes life a failure from this artistic point of view is the
thing that lends to life its sordid security, the fact that one can never
repeat exactly the same emotion., How different it is in the world of
Art!, On a shelf of the bookcase behind you stands the _Divine Comedy_,
and I know that, if I open it at a certain place, I shall be filled with
a fierce hatred of some one who has never wronged me, or stirred by a
great love for some one whom I shall never see., There is no mood or
passion that Art cannot give us, and those of us who have discovered her
secret can settle beforehand what our experiences are going to be., We
can choose our day and select our hour., We can say to ourselves,
?To-morrow, at dawn, we shall walk with grave Virgil through the valley
of the shadow of death,?, and lo!, the dawn finds us in the obscure wood,
and the Mantuan stands by our side., We pass through the gate of the
legend fatal to hope, and with pity or with joy behold the horror of
another world., The hypocrites go by, with their painted faces and their
cowls of gilded lead., Out of the ceaseless winds that drive them, the
carnal look at us, and we watch the heretic rending his flesh, and the
glutton lashed by the rain., We break the withered branches from the tree
in the grove of the Harpies, and each dull-hued poisonous twig bleeds
with red blood before us, and cries aloud with bitter cries., Out of a
horn of fire Odysseus speaks to us, and when from his sepulchre of flame
the great Ghibelline rises, the pride that triumphs over the torture of
that bed becomes ours for a moment., Through the dim purple air fly those
who have stained the world with the beauty of their sin, and in the pit
of loathsome disease, dropsy-stricken and swollen of body into the
semblance of a monstrous lute, lies Adamo di Brescia, the coiner of false
coin., He bids us listen to his misery; we stop, and with dry and gaping
lips he tells us how he dreams day and night of the brooks of clear water
that in cool dewy channels gush down the green Casentine hills., Sinon,
the false Greek of Troy, mocks at him., He smites him in the face, and
they wrangle., We are fascinated by their shame, and loiter, till Virgil
chides us and leads us away to that city turreted by giants where great
Nimrod blows his horn., Terrible things are in store for us, and we go to
meet them in Dante?s raiment and with Dante?s heart., We traverse the
marshes of the Styx, and Argenti swims to the boat through the slimy
waves., He calls to us, and we reject him., When we hear the voice of his
agony we are glad, and Virgil praises us for the bitterness of our scorn., We tread upon the cold crystal of Cocytus, in which traitors stick like
straws in glass., Our foot strikes against the head of Bocca., He will
not tell us his name, and we tear the hair in handfuls from the screaming
skull., Alberigo prays us to break the ice upon his face that he may weep
a little., We pledge our word to him, and when he has uttered his
dolorous tale we deny the word that we have spoken, and pass from him;
such cruelty being courtesy indeed, for who more base than he who has
mercy for the condemned of God?, In the jaws of Lucifer we see the man
who sold Christ, and in the jaws of Lucifer the men who slew C?sar., We
tremble, and come forth to re-behold the stars., In the land of Purgation the air is freer, and the holy mountain rises
into the pure light of day., There is peace for us, and for those who for
a season abide in it there is some peace also, though, pale from the
poison of the Maremma, Madonna Pia passes before us, and Ismene, with the
sorrow of earth still lingering about her, is there., Soul after soul
makes us share in some repentance or some joy., He whom the mourning of
his widow taught to drink the sweet wormwood of pain, tells us of Nella
praying in her lonely bed, and we learn from the mouth of Buonconte how a
single tear may save a dying sinner from the fiend., Sordello, that noble
and disdainful Lombard, eyes us from afar like a couchant lion., When he
learns that Virgil is one of Mantua?s citizens, he falls upon his neck,
and when he learns that he is the singer of Rome he falls before his
feet., In that valley whose grass and flowers are fairer than cleft
emerald and Indian wood, and brighter than scarlet and silver, they are
singing who in the world were kings; but the lips of Rudolph of Hapsburg
do not move to the music of the others, and Philip of France beats his
breast and Henry of England sits alone., On and on we go, climbing the
marvellous stair, and the stars become larger than their wont, and the
song of the kings grows faint, and at length we reach the seven trees of
gold and the garden of the Earthly Paradise., In a griffin-drawn chariot
appears one whose brows are bound with olive, who is veiled in white, and
mantled in green, and robed in a vesture that is coloured like live fire., The ancient flame wakes within us., Our blood quickens through terrible
pulses., We recognise her., It is Beatrice, the woman we have worshipped., The ice congealed about our heart melts., Wild tears of anguish break
from us, and we bow our forehead to the ground, for we know that we have
sinned., When we have done penance, and are purified, and have drunk of
the fountain of Lethe and bathed in the fountain of Eunoe, the mistress
of our soul raises us to the Paradise of Heaven., Out of that eternal
pearl, the moon, the face of Piccarda Donati leans to us., Her beauty
troubles us for a moment, and when, like a thing that falls through
water, she passes away, we gaze after her with wistful eyes., The sweet
planet of Venus is full of lovers., Cunizza, the sister of Ezzelin, the
lady of Sordello?s heart, is there, and Folco, the passionate singer of
Provence, who in sorrow for Azalais forsook the world, and the
Canaanitish harlot whose soul was the first that Christ redeemed., Joachim of Flora stands in the sun, and, in the sun, Aquinas recounts the
story of St. Francis and Bonaventure the story of St. Dominic., Through
the burning rubies of Mars, Cacciaguida approaches., He tells us of the
arrow that is shot from the bow of exile, and how salt tastes the bread
of another, and how steep are the stairs in the house of a stranger., In
Saturn the soul sings not, and even she who guides us dare not smile., On
a ladder of gold the flames rise and fall., At last, we see the pageant
of the Mystical Rose., Beatrice fixes her eyes upon the face of God to
turn them not again., The beatific vision is granted to us; we know the
Love that moves the sun and all the stars., Yes, we can put the earth back six hundred courses and make ourselves one
with the great Florentine, kneel at the same altar with him, and share
his rapture and his scorn., And if we grow tired of an antique time, and
desire to realise our own age in all its weariness and sin, are there not
books that can make us live more in one single hour than life can make us
live in a score of shameful years?, Close to your hand lies a little
volume, bound in some Nile-green skin that has been powdered with gilded
nenuphars and smoothed with hard ivory., It is the book that Gautier
loved, it is Baudelaire?s masterpiece., Open it at that sad madrigal that
begins

    Que m?importe que tu sois sage?, Sois belle!, et sois triste!, and you will find yourself worshipping sorrow as you have never
worshipped joy., Pass on to the poem on the man who tortures himself, let
its subtle music steal into your brain and colour your thoughts, and you
will become for a moment what he was who wrote it; nay, not for a moment
only, but for many barren moonlit nights and sunless sterile days will a
despair that is not your own make its dwelling within you, and the misery
of another gnaw your heart away., Read the whole book, suffer it to tell
even one of its secrets to your soul, and your soul will grow eager to
know more, and will feed upon poisonous honey, and seek to repent of
strange crimes of which it is guiltless, and to make atonement for
terrible pleasures that it has never known., And then, when you are tired
of these flowers of evil, turn to the flowers that grow in the garden of
Perdita, and in their dew-drenched chalices cool your fevered brow, and
let their loveliness heal and restore your soul; or wake from his
forgotten tomb the sweet Syrian, Meleager, and bid the lover of Heliodore
make you music, for he too has flowers in his song, red pomegranate
blossoms, and irises that smell of myrrh, ringed daffodils and dark blue
hyacinths, and marjoram and crinkled ox-eyes., Dear to him was the
perfume of the bean-field at evening, and dear to him the odorous
eared-spikenard that grew on the Syrian hills, and the fresh green thyme,
the wine-cup?s charm., The feet of his love as she walked in the garden
were like lilies set upon lilies., Softer than sleep-laden poppy petals
were her lips, softer than violets and as scented., The flame-like crocus
sprang from the grass to look at her., For her the slim narcissus stored
the cool rain; and for her the anemones forgot the Sicilian winds that
wooed them., And neither crocus, nor anemone, nor narcissus was as fair
as she was., It is a strange thing, this transference of emotion., We sicken with the
same maladies as the poets, and the singer lends us his pain., Dead lips
have their message for us, and hearts that have fallen to dust can
communicate their joy., We run to kiss the bleeding mouth of Fantine, and
we follow Manon Lescaut over the whole world., Ours is the love-madness
of the Tyrian, and the terror of Orestes is ours also., There is no
passion that we cannot feel, no pleasure that we may not gratify, and we
can choose the time of our initiation and the time of our freedom also., Life!, Life!, Don?t let us go to life for our fulfilment or our
experience., It is a thing narrowed by circumstances, incoherent in its
utterance, and without that fine correspondence of form and spirit which
is the only thing that can satisfy the artistic and critical temperament., It makes us pay too high a price for its wares, and we purchase the
meanest of its secrets at a cost that is monstrous and infinite., ERNEST., Must we go, then, to Art for everything?, GILBERT., For everything., Because Art does not hurt us., The tears that
we shed at a play are a type of the exquisite sterile emotions that it is
the function of Art to awaken., We weep, but we are not wounded., We
grieve, but our grief is not bitter., In the actual life of man, sorrow,
as Spinoza says somewhere, is a passage to a lesser perfection., But the
sorrow with which Art fills us both purifies and initiates, if I may
quote once more from the great art critic of the Greeks., It is through
Art, and through Art only, that we can realise our perfection; through
Art, and through Art only, that we can shield ourselves from the sordid
perils of actual existence., This results not merely from the fact that
nothing that one can imagine is worth doing, and that one can imagine
everything, but from the subtle law that emotional forces, like the
forces of the physical sphere, are limited in extent and energy., One can
feel so much, and no more., And how can it matter with what pleasure life
tries to tempt one, or with what pain it seeks to maim and mar one?s
soul, if in the spectacle of the lives of those who have never existed
one has found the true secret of joy, and wept away one?s tears over
their deaths who, like Cordelia and the daughter of Brabantio, can never
die?, ERNEST., ...]"|2
66|"[It is too splendid to
be sane., Those of whose lives it forms the dominant note will always
seem to the world to be pure visionaries., ERNEST., Well, at least, the critic will be sincere., GILBERT., A little sincerity is a dangerous thing, and a great deal of it
is absolutely fatal., The true critic will, indeed, always be sincere in
his devotion to the principle of beauty, but he will seek for beauty in
every age and in each school, and will never suffer himself to be limited
to any settled custom of thought or stereotyped mode of looking at
things., He will realise himself in many forms, and by a thousand
different ways, and will ever be curious of new sensations and fresh
points of view., Through constant change, and through constant change
alone, he will find his true unity., He will not consent to be the slave
of his own opinions., For what is mind but motion in the intellectual
sphere?, The essence of thought, as the essence of life, is growth., You
must not be frightened by word, Ernest., What people call insincerity is
simply a method by which we can multiply our personalities., ERNEST., I am afraid I have not been fortunate in my suggestions., GILBERT., Of the three qualifications you mentioned, two, sincerity and
fairness, were, if not actually moral, at least on the borderland of
morals, and the first condition of criticism is that the critic should be
able to recognise that the sphere of Art and the sphere of Ethics are
absolutely distinct and separate., When they are confused, Chaos has come
again., They are too often confused in England now, and though our modern
Puritans cannot destroy a beautiful thing, yet, by means of their
extraordinary prurience, they can almost taint beauty for a moment., It
is chiefly, I regret to say, through journalism that such people find
expression., I regret it because there is much to be said in favour of
modern journalism., By giving us the opinions of the uneducated, it keeps
us in touch with the ignorance of the community., By carefully
chronicling the current events of contemporary life, it shows us of what
very little importance such events really are., By invariably discussing
the unnecessary it makes us understand what things are requisite for
culture, and what are not., But it should not allow poor Tartuffe to
write articles upon modern art., When it does this it stultifies itself., And yet Tartuffe?s articles and Chadband?s notes do this good, at least., They serve to show how extremely limited is the area over which ethics,
and ethical considerations, can claim to exercise influence., Science is
out of the reach of morals, for her eyes are fixed upon eternal truths., Art is out of the reach of morals, for her eyes are fixed upon things
beautiful and immortal and ever-changing., To morals belong the lower and
less intellectual spheres., However, let these mouthing Puritans pass;
they have their comic side., Who can help laughing when an ordinary
journalist seriously proposes to limit the subject-matter at the disposal
of the artist?, Some limitation might well, and will soon, I hope, be
placed upon some of our newspapers and newspaper writers., For they give
us the bald, sordid, disgusting facts of life., They chronicle, with
degrading avidity, the sins of the second-rate, and with the
conscientiousness of the illiterate give us accurate and prosaic details
of the doings of people of absolutely no interest whatsoever., But the
artist, who accepts the facts of life, and yet transforms them into
shapes of beauty, and makes them vehicles of pity or of awe, and shows
their colour-element, and their wonder, and their true ethical import
also, and builds out of them a world more real than reality itself, and
of loftier and more noble import?who shall set limits to him?, Not the
apostles of that new Journalism which is but the old vulgarity ?writ
large.?, Not the apostles of that new Puritanism, which is but the whine
of the hypocrite, and is both writ and spoken badly., The mere suggestion
is ridiculous., Let us leave these wicked people, and proceed to the
discussion of the artistic qualifications necessary for the true critic., ERNEST., And what are they?, Tell me yourself., GILBERT., Temperament is the primary requisite for the critic?a
temperament exquisitely susceptible to beauty, and to the various
impressions that beauty gives us., Under what conditions, and by what
means, this temperament is engendered in race or individual, we will not
discuss at present., It is sufficient to note that it exists, and that
there is in us a beauty-sense, separate from the other senses and above
them, separate from the reason and of nobler import, separate from the
soul and of equal value?a sense that leads some to create, and others,
the finer spirits as I think, to contemplate merely., But to be purified
and made perfect, this sense requires some form of exquisite environment., Without this it starves, or is dulled., You remember that lovely passage
in which Plato describes how a young Greek should be educated, and with
what insistence he dwells upon the importance of surroundings, telling us
how the lad is to be brought up in the midst of fair sights and sounds,
so that the beauty of material things may prepare his soul for the
reception of the beauty that is spiritual., Insensibly, and without
knowing the reason why, he is to develop that real love of beauty which,
as Plato is never weary of reminding us, is the true aim of education., By slow degrees there is to be engendered in him such a temperament as
will lead him naturally and simply to choose the good in preference to
the bad, and, rejecting what is vulgar and discordant, to follow by fine
instinctive taste all that possesses grace and charm and loveliness., Ultimately, in its due course, this taste is to become critical and
self-conscious, but at first it is to exist purely as a cultivated
instinct, and ?he who has received this true culture of the inner man
will with clear and certain vision perceive the omissions and faults in
art or nature, and with a taste that cannot err, while he praises, and
finds his pleasure in what is good, and receives it into his soul, and so
becomes good and noble, he will rightly blame and hate the bad, now in
the days of his youth, even before he is able to know the reason why?, :
and so, when, later on, the critical and self-conscious spirit develops
in him, he ?will recognise and salute it as a friend with whom his
education has made him long familiar.?, I need hardly say, Ernest, how
far we in England have fallen short of this ideal, and I can imagine the
smile that would illuminate the glossy face of the Philistine if one
ventured to suggest to him that the true aim of education was the love of
beauty, and that the methods by which education should work were the
development of temperament, the cultivation of taste, and the creation of
the critical spirit., Yet, even for us, there is left some loveliness of environment, and the
dulness of tutors and professors matters very little when one can loiter
in the grey cloisters at Magdalen, and listen to some flute-like voice
singing in Waynfleete?s chapel, or lie in the green meadow, among the
strange snake-spotted fritillaries, and watch the sunburnt noon smite to
a finer gold the tower?s gilded vanes, or wander up the Christ Church
staircase beneath the vaulted ceiling?s shadowy fans, or pass through the
sculptured gateway of Laud?s building in the College of St. John., Nor is
it merely at Oxford, or Cambridge, that the sense of beauty can be formed
and trained and perfected., All over England there is a Renaissance of
the decorative Arts., Ugliness has had its day., Even in the houses of
the rich there is taste, and the houses of those who are not rich have
been made gracious and comely and sweet to live in., Caliban, poor noisy
Caliban, thinks that when he has ceased to make mows at a thing, the
thing ceases to exist., But if he mocks no longer, it is because he has
been met with mockery, swifter and keener than his own, and for a moment
has been bitterly schooled into that silence which should seal for ever
his uncouth distorted lips., What has been done up to now, has been
chiefly in the clearing of the way., It is always more difficult to
destroy than it is to create, and when what one has to destroy is
vulgarity and stupidity, the task of destruction needs not merely courage
but also contempt., Yet it seems to me to have been, in a measure, done., We have got rid of what was bad., We have now to make what is beautiful., And though the mission of the ?sthetic movement is to lure people to
contemplate, not to lead them to create, yet, as the creative instinct is
strong in the Celt, and it is the Celt who leads in art, there is no
reason why in future years this strange Renaissance should not become
almost as mighty in its way as was that new birth of Art that woke many
centuries ago in the cities of Italy., Certainly, for the cultivation of temperament, we must turn to the
decorative arts: to the arts that touch us, not to the arts that teach
us., Modern pictures are, no doubt, delightful to look at., At least,
some of them are., But they are quite impossible to live with; they are
too clever, too assertive, too intellectual., Their meaning is too
obvious, and their method too clearly defined., One exhausts what they
have to say in a very short time, and then they become as tedious as
one?s relations., I am very fond of the work of many of the Impressionist
painters of Paris and London., Subtlety and distinction have not yet left
the school., Some of their arrangements and harmonies serve to remind one
of the unapproachable beauty of Gautier?s immortal _Symphonie en Blanc
Majeur_, that flawless masterpiece of colour and music which may have
suggested the type as well as the titles of many of their best pictures., For a class that welcomes the incompetent with sympathetic eagerness, and
that confuses the bizarre with the beautiful, and vulgarity with truth,
they are extremely accomplished., They can do etchings that have the
brilliancy of epigrams, pastels that are as fascinating as paradoxes, and
as for their portraits, whatever the commonplace may say against them, no
one can deny that they possess that unique and wonderful charm which
belongs to works of pure fiction., But even the Impressionists, earnest
and industrious as they are, will not do., I like them., Their white
keynote, with its variations in lilac, was an era in colour., Though the
moment does not make the man, the moment certainly makes the
Impressionist, and for the moment in art, and the ?moment?s monument,?, as
Rossetti phrased it, what may not be said?, They are suggestive also., If
they have not opened the eyes of the blind, they have at least given
great encouragement to the short-sighted, and while their leaders may
have all the inexperience of old age, their young men are far too wise to
be ever sensible., Yet they will insist on treating painting as if it
were a mode of autobiography invented for the use of the illiterate, and
are always prating to us on their coarse gritty canvases of their
unnecessary selves and their unnecessary opinions, and spoiling by a
vulgar over-emphasis that fine contempt of nature which is the best and
only modest thing about them., One tires, at the end, of the work of
individuals whose individuality is always noisy, and generally
uninteresting., There is far more to be said in favour of that newer
school at Paris, the _Archaicistes_, as they call themselves, who,
refusing to leave the artist entirely at the mercy of the weather, do not
find the ideal of art in mere atmospheric effect, but seek rather for the
imaginative beauty of design and the loveliness of fair colour, and
rejecting the tedious realism of those who merely paint what they see,
try to see something worth seeing, and to see it not merely with actual
and physical vision, but with that nobler vision of the soul which is as
far wider in spiritual scope as it is far more splendid in artistic
purpose., They, at any rate, work under those decorative conditions that
each art requires for its perfection, and have sufficient ?sthetic
instinct to regret those sordid and stupid limitations of absolute
modernity of form which have proved the ruin of so many of the
Impressionists., Still, the art that is frankly decorative is the art to
live with., It is, of all our visible arts, the one art that creates in
us both mood and temperament., Mere colour, unspoiled by meaning, and
unallied with definite form, can speak to the soul in a thousand
different ways., The harmony that resides in the delicate proportions of
lines and masses becomes mirrored in the mind., The repetitions of
pattern give us rest., The marvels of design stir the imagination., In
the mere loveliness of the materials employed there are latent elements
of culture., Nor is this all., ...]"|2
67|"[And those who saw Mr. Irving in the last act of _Richard the
Third_ have not, I am sure, forgotten how much the agony and terror of
his dream was intensified, by contrast, through the calm and quiet that
preceded it, and the delivery of such lines as

lines which had a double meaning for the audience, remembering the last
words which Richard?s mother called after him as he was marching to
Bosworth:?, As regards the resources which Shakespeare had at his disposal, it is to
be remarked that, while he more than once complains of the smallness of
the stage on which he has to produce big historical plays, and of the
want of scenery which obliges him to cut out many effective open-air
incidents, he always writes as a dramatist who had at his disposal a most
elaborate theatrical wardrobe, and who could rely on the actors taking
pains about their make-up., Even now it is difficult to produce such a
play as the _Comedy of Errors_; and to the picturesque accident of Miss
Ellen Terry?s brother resembling herself we owe the opportunity of seeing
_Twelfth Night_ adequately performed., Indeed, to put any play of
Shakespeare?s on the stage, absolutely as he himself wished it to be
done, requires the services of a good property-man, a clever wig-maker, a
costumier with a sense of colour and a knowledge of textures, a master of
the methods of making-up, a fencing-master, a dancing-master, and an
artist to direct personally the whole production., For he is most careful
to tell us the dress and appearance of each character., ?Racine abhorre
la r?alit?,?, says Auguste Vacquerie somewhere; ?il ne daigne pas
s?occuper de son costume., Si l?on s?en rapportait aux indications du
po?te, Agamemnon serait v?tu d?un sceptre et Achille d?une ?p?e.?, But
with Shakespeare it is very different., He gives us directions about the
costumes of Perdita, Florizel, Autolycus, the Witches in _Macbeth_, and
the apothecary in _Romeo and Juliet_, several elaborate descriptions of
his fat knight, and a detailed account of the extraordinary garb in which
Petruchio is to be married., Rosalind, he tells us, is tall, and is to
carry a spear and a little dagger; Celia is smaller, and is to paint her
face brown so as to look sunburnt., The children who play at fairies in
Windsor Forest are to be dressed in white and green?a compliment, by the
way, to Queen Elizabeth, whose favourite colours they were?and in white,
with green garlands and gilded vizors, the angels are to come to
Katherine in Kimbolton., Bottom is in homespun, Lysander is distinguished
from Oberon by his wearing an Athenian dress, and Launce has holes in his
boots., The Duchess of Gloucester stands in a white sheet with her
husband in mourning beside her., The motley of the Fool, the scarlet of
the Cardinal, and the French lilies broidered on the English coats, are
all made occasion for jest or taunt in the dialogue., We know the
patterns on the Dauphin?s armour and the Pucelle?s sword, the crest on
Warwick?s helmet and the colour of Bardolph?s nose., Portia has golden
hair, Phoebe is black-haired, Orlando has chestnut curls, and Sir Andrew
Aguecheek?s hair hangs like flax on a distaff, and won?t curl at all., Some of the characters are stout, some lean, some straight, some
hunchbacked, some fair, some dark, and some are to blacken their faces., Lear has a white beard, Hamlet?s father a grizzled, and Benedick is to
shave his in the course of the play., Indeed, on the subject of stage
beards Shakespeare is quite elaborate; tells us of the many different
colours in use, and gives a hint to actors always to see that their own
are properly tied on., There is a dance of reapers in rye-straw hats, and
of rustics in hairy coats like satyrs; a masque of Amazons, a masque of
Russians, and a classical masque; several immortal scenes over a weaver
in an ass?s head, a riot over the colour of a coat which it takes the
Lord Mayor of London to quell, and a scene between an infuriated husband
and his wife?s milliner about the slashing of a sleeve., As for the metaphors Shakespeare draws from dress, and the aphorisms he
makes on it, his hits at the costume of his age, particularly at the
ridiculous size of the ladies?, bonnets, and the many descriptions of the
_mundus muliebris_, from the long of Autolycus in the _Winter?s Tale_
down to the account of the Duchess of Milan?s gown in _Much Ado About
Nothing_, they are far too numerous to quote; though it may be worth
while to remind people that the whole of the Philosophy of Clothes is to
be found in Lear?s scene with Edgar?a passage which has the advantage of
brevity and style over the grotesque wisdom and somewhat mouthing
metaphysics of _Sartor Resartus_., But I think that from what I have
already said it is quite clear that Shakespeare was very much interested
in costume., I do not mean in that shallow sense by which it has been
concluded from his knowledge of deeds and daffodils that he was the
Blackstone and Paxton of the Elizabethan age; but that he saw that
costume could be made at once impressive of a certain effect on the
audience and expressive of certain types of character, and is one of the
essential factors of the means which a true illusionist has at his
disposal., Indeed to him the deformed figure of Richard was of as much
value as Juliet?s loveliness; he sets the serge of the radical beside the
silks of the lord, and sees the stage effects to be got from each: he has
as much delight in Caliban as he has in Ariel, in rags as he has in cloth
of gold, and recognises the artistic beauty of ugliness., The difficulty Ducis felt about translating _Othello_ in consequence of
the importance given to such a vulgar thing as a handkerchief, and his
attempt to soften its grossness by making the Moor reiterate ?Le bandeau!, le bandeau!?, may be taken as an example of the difference between _la
trag?die philosophique_ and the drama of real life; and the introduction
for the first time of the word _mouchoir_ at the Th?, ?tre Fran?ais was an
era in that romantic-realistic movement of which Hugo is the father and
M. Zola the _enfant terrible_, just as the classicism of the earlier part
of the century was emphasised by Talma?s refusal to play Greek heroes any
longer in a powdered periwig?one of the many instances, by the way, of
that desire for arch?ological accuracy in dress which has distinguished
the great actors of our age., In criticising the importance given to money in _La Com?die Humaine_,
Th?ophile Gautier says that Balzac may claim to have invented a new hero
in fiction, _le h?ros m?tallique_., Of Shakespeare it may be said he was
the first to see the dramatic value of doublets, and that a climax may
depend on a crinoline., The burning of the Globe Theatre?an event due, by the way, to the results
of the passion for illusion that distinguished Shakespeare?s
stage-management?has unfortunately robbed us of many important documents;
but in the inventory, still in existence, of the costume-wardrobe of a
London theatre in Shakespeare?s time, there are mentioned particular
costumes for cardinals, shepherds, kings, clowns, friars, and fools;
green coats for Robin Hood?s men, and a green gown for Maid Marian; a
white and gold doublet for Henry the Fifth, and a robe for Longshanks;
besides surplices, copes, damask gowns, gowns of cloth of gold and of
cloth of silver, taffeta gowns, calico gowns, velvet coats, satin coats,
frieze coats, jerkins of yellow leather and of black leather, red suits,
grey suits, French Pierrot suits, a robe ?for to goo invisibell,?, which
seems inexpensive at ?3, 10s., and four incomparable fardingales?all of
which show a desire to give every character an appropriate dress., There
are also entries of Spanish, Moorish and Danish costumes, of helmets,
lances, painted shields, imperial crowns, and papal tiaras, as well as of
costumes for Turkish Janissaries, Roman Senators, and all the gods and
goddesses of Olympus, which evidence a good deal of arch?ological
research on the part of the manager of the theatre., It is true that
there is a mention of a bodice for Eve, but probably the _donn?e_ of the
play was after the Fall., Indeed, anybody who cares to examine the age of Shakespeare will see that
arch?ology was one of its special characteristics., After that revival of
the classical forms of architecture which was one of the notes of the
Renaissance, and the printing at Venice and elsewhere of the masterpieces
of Greek and Latin literature, had come naturally an interest in the
ornamentation and costume of the antique world., Nor was it for the
learning that they could acquire, but rather for the loveliness that they
might create, that the artists studied these things., The curious objects
that were being constantly brought to light by excavations were not left
to moulder in a museum, for the contemplation of a callous curator, and
the _ennui_ of a policeman bored by the absence of crime., They were used
as motives for the production of a new art, which was to be not beautiful
merely, but also strange., Infessura tells us that in 1485 some workmen digging on the Appian Way
came across an old Roman sarcophagus inscribed with the name ?Julia,
daughter of Claudius.?, On opening the coffer they found within its
marble womb the body of a beautiful girl of about fifteen years of age,
preserved by the embalmer?s skill from corruption and the decay of time., Her eyes were half open, her hair rippled round her in crisp curling
gold, and from her lips and cheek the bloom of maidenhood had not yet
departed., Borne back to the Capitol, she became at once the centre of a
new cult, and from all parts of the city crowded pilgrims to worship at
the wonderful shrine, till the Pope, fearing lest those who had found the
secret of beauty in a Pagan tomb might forget what secrets Jud?a?s rough
and rock-hewn sepulchre contained, had the body conveyed away by night,
and in secret buried., Legend though it may be, yet the story is none the
less valuable as showing us the attitude of the Renaissance towards the
antique world., Arch?ology to them was not a mere science for the
antiquarian; it was a means by which they could touch the dry dust of
antiquity into the very breath and beauty of life, and fill with the new
wine of romanticism forms that else had been old and outworn., From the
pulpit of Niccola Pisano down to Mantegna?s ?Triumph of C?sar,?, and the
service Cellini designed for King Francis, the influence of this spirit
can be traced; nor was it confined merely to the immobile arts?the arts
of arrested movement?but its influence was to be seen also in the great
Gr?co-Roman masques which were the constant amusement of the gay courts
of the time, and in the public pomps and processions with which the
citizens of big commercial towns were wont to greet the princes that
chanced to visit them; pageants, by the way, which were considered so
important that large prints were made of them and published?a fact which
is a proof of the general interest at the time in matters of such kind., And this use of arch?ology in shows, so far from being a bit of priggish
pedantry, is in every way legitimate and beautiful., For the stage is not
merely the meeting-place of all the arts, but is also the return of art
to life., Sometimes in an arch?ological novel the use of strange and
obsolete terms seems to hide the reality beneath the learning, and I dare
say that many of the readers of _Notre Dame de Paris_ have been much
puzzled over the meaning of such expressions as _la casaque ?, mahoitres_,
_les voulgiers_, _le gallimard tach?, d?encre_, _les craaquiniers_, and
the like; but with the stage how different it is!, The ancient world
wakes from its sleep, and history moves as a pageant before our eyes,
without obliging us to have recourse to a dictionary or an encyclop?dia
for the perfection of our enjoyment., Indeed, there is not the slightest
necessity that the public should know the authorities for the mounting of
any piece., From such materials, for instance, as the disk of Theodosius,
materials with which the majority of people are probably not very
familiar, Mr. E. W. Godwin, one of the most artistic spirits of this
century in England, created the marvellous loveliness of the first act of
_Claudian_, and showed us the life of Byzantium in the fourth century,
not by a dreary lecture and a set of grimy casts, not by a novel which
requires a glossary to explain it, but by the visible presentation before
us of all the glory of that great town., And while the costumes were true
to the smallest points of colour and design, yet the details were not
assigned that abnormal importance which they must necessarily be given in
a piecemeal lecture, but were subordinated to the rules of lofty
composition and the unity of artistic effect., Mr. Symonds, speaking of
that great picture of Mantegna?s, now in Hampton Court, says that the
artist has converted an antiquarian motive into a theme for melodies of
line., The same could have been said with equal justice of Mr. Godwin?s
scene., Only the foolish called it pedantry, only those who would neither
look nor listen spoke of the passion of the play being killed by its
paint., It was in reality a scene not merely perfect in its
picturesqueness, but absolutely dramatic also, getting rid of any
necessity for tedious descriptions, and showing us, by the colour and
character of Claudian?s dress, and the dress of his attendants, the whole
nature and life of the man, from what school of philosophy he affected,
down to what horses he backed on the turf., And indeed arch?ology is only really delightful when transfused into some
form of art., I have no desire to underrate the services of laborious
scholars, but I feel that the use Keats made of Lempri?re?s Dictionary is
of far more value to us than Professor Max M?ller?s treatment of the same
mythology as a disease of language., Better _Endymion_ than any theory,
however sound, or, as in the present instance, unsound, of an epidemic
among adjectives!, And who does not feel that the chief glory of
Piranesi?s book on Vases is that it gave Keats the suggestion for his
?Ode on a Grecian Urn??, Art, and art only, can make arch?ology
beautiful; and the theatric art can use it most directly and most
vividly, for it can combine in one exquisite presentation the illusion of
actual life with the wonder of the unreal world., But the sixteenth
century was not merely the age of Vitruvius; it was the age of Vecellio
also., Every nation seems suddenly to have become interested in the dress
of its neighbours., Europe began to investigate its own clothes, and the
amount of books published on national costumes is quite extraordinary., At the beginning of the century the _Nuremberg Chronicle_, with its two
thousand illustrations, reached its fifth edition, and before the century
was over seventeen editions were published of Munster?s _Cosmography_., Besides these two books there were also the works of Michael Colyns, of
Hans Weigel, of Amman, and of Vecellio himself, all of them well
illustrated, some of the drawings in Vecellio being probably from the
hand of Titian., Nor was it merely from books and treatises that they acquired their
knowledge., The development of the habit of foreign travel, the increased
commercial intercourse between countries, and the frequency of diplomatic
missions, gave every nation many opportunities of studying the various
forms of contemporary dress., After the departure from England, for
instance, of the ambassadors from the Czar, the Sultan and the Prince of
Morocco, Henry the Eighth and his friends gave several masques in the
strange attire of their visitors., Later on London saw, perhaps too
often, the sombre splendour of the Spanish Court, and to Elizabeth came
envoys from all lands, whose dress, Shakespeare tells us, had an
important influence on English costume., And the interest was not confined merely to classical dress, or the dress
of foreign nations; there was also a good deal of research, amongst
theatrical people especially, into the ancient costume of England itself:
and when Shakespeare, in the prologue to one of his plays, expresses his
regret at being unable to produce helmets of the period, he is speaking
as an Elizabethan manager and not merely as an Elizabethan poet., At
Cambridge, for instance, during his day, a play of _Richard The Third_
was performed, in which the actors were attired in real dresses of the
time, procured from the great collection of historical costume in the
Tower, which was always open to the inspection of managers, and sometimes
placed at their disposal., And I cannot help thinking that this
performance must have been far more artistic, as regards costume, than
Garrick?s mounting of Shakespeare?s own play on the subject, in which he
himself appeared in a nondescript fancy dress, and everybody else in the
costume of the time of George the Third, Richmond especially being much
admired in the uniform of a young guardsman., For what is the use to the stage of that arch?ology which has so
strangely terrified the critics, but that it, and it alone, can give us
the architecture and apparel suitable to the time in which the action of
the play passes?, It enables us to see a Greek dressed like a Greek, and
an Italian like an Italian; to enjoy the arcades of Venice and the
balconies of Verona; and, if the play deals with any of the great eras in
our country?s history, to contemplate the age in its proper attire, and
the king in his habit as he lived., And I wonder, by the way, what Lord
Lytton would have said some time ago, at the Princess?s Theatre, had the
curtain risen on his father?s Brutus reclining in a Queen Anne chair,
attired in a flowing wig and a flowered dressing-gown, a costume which in
the last century was considered peculiarly appropriate to an antique
Roman!, For in those halcyon days of the drama no arch?ology troubled the
stage, or distressed the critics, and our inartistic grandfathers sat
peaceably in a stifling atmosphere of anachronisms, and beheld with the
calm complacency of the age of prose an Iachimo in powder and patches, a
Lear in lace ruffles, and a Lady Macbeth in a large crinoline., I can
understand arch?ology being attacked on the ground of its excessive
realism, but to attack it as pedantic seems to be very much beside the
mark., However, to attack it for any reason is foolish; one might just as
well speak disrespectfully of the equator., For arch?ology, being a
science, is neither good nor bad, but a fact simply., Its value depends
entirely on how it is used, and only an artist can use it., We look to
the arch?ologist for the materials, to the artist for the method., In designing the scenery and costumes for any of Shakespeare?s plays, the
first thing the artist has to settle is the best date for the drama., This should be determined by the general spirit of the play, more than by
any actual historical references which may occur in it., Most _Hamlets_ I
have seen were placed far too early., _Hamlet_ is essentially a scholar
of the Revival of Learning; and if the allusion to the recent invasion of
England by the Danes puts it back to the ninth century, the use of foils
brings it down much later., Once, however, that the date has been fixed,
then the arch?ologist is to supply us with the facts which the artist is
to convert into effects., It has been said that the anachronisms in the plays themselves show us
that Shakespeare was indifferent to historical accuracy, and a great deal
of capital has been made out of Hector?s indiscreet quotation from
Aristotle., Upon the other hand, the anachronisms are really few in
number, and not very important, and, had Shakespeare?s attention been
drawn to them by a brother artist, he would probably have corrected them., For, though they can hardly be called blemishes, they are certainly not
the great beauties of his work; or, at least, if they are, their
anachronistic charm cannot be emphasised unless the play is accurately
mounted according to its proper date., In looking at Shakespeare?s plays
as a whole, however, what is really remarkable is their extraordinary
fidelity as regards his personages and his plots., Many of his _dramatis
person?_ are people who had actually existed, and some of them might have
been seen in real life by a portion of his audience., Indeed the most
violent attack that was made on Shakespeare in his time was for his
supposed caricature of Lord Cobham., As for his plots, Shakespeare
constantly draws them either from authentic history, or from the old
ballads and traditions which served as history to the Elizabethan public,
and which even now no scientific historian would dismiss as absolutely
untrue., ...]"|2

71|"[In the eyes of humanity
it should be a horrible thing for him to be there at all., This terror that seizes and dominates the child, as it seizes the grown
man also, is of course intensified beyond power of expression by the
solitary cellular system of our prisons., Every child is confined to its
cell for twenty-three hours out of the twenty-four., This is the
appalling thing., To shut up a child in a dimly-lit cell for twenty-three
hours out of the twenty-four is an example of the cruelty of stupidity., If an individual, parent or guardian, did this to a child he would be
severely punished., The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children
would take the matter up at once., There would be on all hands the utmost
detestation of whomsoever had been guilty of such cruelty., A heavy
sentence would undoubtedly follow conviction., But our own actual society
does worse itself, and to the child to be so treated by a strange
abstract force, of whose claims it has no cognizance, is much worse than
it would be to receive the same treatment from its father or mother, or
someone it knew., The inhuman treatment of a child is always inhuman, by
whomsoever it is inflicted., But inhuman treatment by Society is to the
child the more terrible because there is no appeal., A parent or guardian
can be moved, and let out the child from the dark lonely room in which
it is confined., But a warder cannot., Most warders are very fond of
children., But the system prohibits them from rendering the child any
assistance., Should they do so, as Warder Martin did, they are dismissed., The second thing from which a child suffers in prison is hunger., The
food that is given to it consists of a piece of usually badly-baked
prison bread and a tin of water for breakfast at half-past seven., At
twelve o'clock it gets dinner, composed of a tin of coarse Indian meal
stirabout, and at half-past five it gets a piece of dry bread and a tin
of water for its supper., This diet in the case of a strong grown man is
always productive of illness of some kind, chiefly of course
diarrhoea, with its attendant weakness., In fact in a big prison
astringent medicines are served out regularly by the warders as a matter
of course., In the case of a child, the child is, as a rule, incapable of
eating the food at all., Anyone who knows anything about children knows
how easily a child's digestion is upset by a fit of crying, or trouble
and mental distress of any kind., A child who has been crying all day
long, and perhaps half the night, in a lonely dimly-lit cell, and is
preyed upon by terror, simply cannot eat food of this coarse, horrible
kind., In the case of the little child to whom Warder Martin gave the
biscuits, the child was crying with hunger on Tuesday morning, and
utterly unable to eat the bread and water served to it for its
breakfast., Martin went out after the breakfasts had been served and
bought the few sweet biscuits for the child rather than see it starving., It was a beautiful action on his part, and was so recognised by the
child, who, utterly unconscious of the regulation of the Prison Board,
told one of the senior warders how kind this junior warder had been to
him., The result was, of course, a report and a dismissal., I know Martin extremely well, and I was under his charge for the last
seven weeks of my imprisonment., On his appointment at Reading he had
charge of Gallery C, in which I was confined, so I saw him constantly., I
was struck by the singular kindness and humanity of the way in which he
spoke to me and to the other prisoners., Kind words are much in prison,
and a pleasant ""Good morning"" or ""Good evening"" will make one as happy
as one can be in solitary confinement., He was always gentle and
considerate., I happen to know another case in which he showed great
kindness to one of the prisoners, and I have no hesitation in mentioning
it., One of the most horrible things in prison is the badness of the
sanitary arrangements., No prisoner is allowed under any circumstances to
leave his cell after half-past five p.m., If, consequently, he is
suffering from diarrhoea, he has to use his cell as a latrine, and
pass the night in a most fetid and unwholesome atmosphere., Some days
before my release Martin was going the rounds at half-past seven with
one of the senior warders for the purpose of collecting the oakum and
tools of the prisoners., A man just convicted, and suffering from
violent diarrhoea in consequence of the food, as is always the case,
asked this senior warder to allow him to empty the slops in his cell on
account of the horrible odour of the cell and the possibility of illness
again in the night., The senior warder refused absolutely; it was against
the rules., The man, as far as he was concerned, had to pass the night in
this dreadful condition., Martin, however, rather than see this wretched
man in such a loathsome predicament, said he would empty the man's slops
himself, and did so., A warder emptying a prisoner's slops is, of course,
against the rules, but Martin did this act of kindness to the man out of
the simple humanity of his nature, and the man was naturally most
grateful., As regards the children, a great deal has been talked and written lately
about the contaminating influence of prison on young children., What is
said is quite true., A child is utterly contaminated by prison life., But
the contaminating influence is not that of the prisoners., It is that of
the whole prison system--of the governor, the chaplain, the warders, the
lonely cell, the isolation, the revolting food, the rules of the Prison
Commissioners, the mode of discipline as it is termed, of the life., Every care is taken to isolate a child from the sight even of all
prisoners over sixteen years of age., Children sit behind a curtain in
chapel, and are sent to take exercise in small sunless yards--sometimes
a stone-yard, sometimes a yard at the back of the mills--rather than
that they should see the elder prisoners at exercise., But the only
really humanising influence in prison is the influence of the prisoners., Their cheerfulness under terrible circumstances, their sympathy for each
other, their humility, their gentleness, their pleasant smiles of
greeting when they meet each other, their complete acquiescence in their
punishments, are all quite wonderful, and I myself learnt many sound
lessons from them., I am not proposing that the children should not sit
behind a curtain in chapel, or that they should take exercise in a
corner of the common yard., I am merely pointing out that the bad
influence on children is not, and could never be, that of the prisoners,
but is, and will always remain, that of the prison system itself., There
is not a single man in Reading Gaol that would not gladly have done the
three children's punishment for them., When I saw them last it was on the
Tuesday following their conviction., I was taking exercise at half-past
eleven with about twelve other men, as the three children passed near
us, in charge of a warder, from the damp, dreary stone-yard in which
they had been at their exercise., I saw the greatest pity and sympathy in
the eyes of my companions as they looked at them., Prisoners are, as a
class, extremely kind and sympathetic to each other., Suffering and the
community of suffering makes people kind, and day after day as I tramped
the yard I used to feel with pleasure and comfort what Carlyle calls
somewhere ""the silent rhythmic charm of human companionship."", In this as
in all other things, philanthropists and people of that kind are astray., It is not the prisoners who need reformation., It is the prisons., Of course no child under fourteen years of age should be sent to prison
at all., It is an absurdity, and, like many absurdities, of absolutely
tragic results., If, however, they are to be sent to prison, during the
daytime they should be in a workshop or schoolroom with a warder., At
night they should sleep in a dormitory, with a night-warder to look
after them., They should be allowed exercise for at least three hours a
day., The dark, badly-ventilated, ill-smelling prison cells are dreadful
for a child, dreadful indeed for anyone., One is always breathing bad air
in prison., The food given to children should consist of tea and
bread-and-butter and soup., Prison soup is very good and wholesome., A
resolution of the House of Commons could settle the treatment of
children in half an hour., I hope you will use your influence to have
this done., The way that children are treated at present is really an
outrage on humanity and common-sense., It comes from stupidity., Let me draw attention now to another terrible thing that goes on in
English prisons, indeed in prisons all over the world where the system
of silence and cellular confinement is practised., I refer to the large
number of men who become insane or weak-minded in prison., In convict
prisons this is, of course, quite common; but in ordinary gaols also,
such as that I was confined in, it is to be found., About three months ago, I noticed amongst the prisoners who took
exercise with me a young man who seemed to me to be silly or
half-witted., Every prison of course has its half-witted clients, who
return again and again, and may be said to live in the prison., But this
young man struck me as being more than usually half-witted on account of
his silly grin and idiotic laughter to himself, and the peculiar
restlessness of his eternally twitching hands., He was noticed by all the
other prisoners on account of the strangeness of his conduct., From time
to time he did not appear at exercise, which showed me that he was being
punished by confinement to his cell., Finally, I discovered that he was
under observation, and being watched night and day by warders., When he
did appear at exercise, he always seemed hysterical, and used to walk
round crying or laughing., At chapel he had to sit right under the
observation of two warders, who carefully watched him all the time., Sometimes he would bury his head in his hands, an offence against the
chapel regulations, and his head would be immediately struck up by a
warder, so that he should keep his eyes fixed permanently in the
direction of the Communion-table., Sometimes he would cry--not making any
disturbance--but with tears streaming down his face and a hysterical
throbbing in the throat., Sometimes he would grin idiot-like to himself
and make faces., He was on more than one occasion sent out of chapel to
his cell, and of course he was continually punished., As the bench on
which I used to sit in chapel was directly behind the bench at the end
of which this unfortunate man was placed, I had full opportunity of
observing him., I also saw him, of course, at exercise continually, and I
saw that he was becoming insane, and was being treated as if he was
shamming., On Saturday week last, I was in my cell at about one o'clock occupied in
cleaning and polishing the tins I had been using for dinner., Suddenly I
was startled by the prison silence being broken by the most horrible and
revolting shrieks or rather howls, for at first I thought some animal
like a bull or a cow was being unskilfully slaughtered outside the
prison walls., I soon realised, however, that the howls proceeded from
the basement of the prison, and I knew that some wretched man was being
flogged., I need not say how hideous and terrible it was for me, and I
began to wonder who it was who was being punished in this revolting
manner., Suddenly it dawned upon me that they might be flogging this
unfortunate lunatic., My feelings on the subject need not be chronicled;
they have nothing to do with the question., ...]"|2
72|"[It was always springtime once in my heart., My temperament
was akin to joy., I filled my life to the very brim with pleasure, as one
might fill a cup to the very brim with wine., Now I am approaching life
from a completely new standpoint, and even to conceive happiness is often
extremely difficult for me., I remember during my first term at Oxford
reading in Pater's _Renaissance_--that book which has had such strange
influence over my life--how Dante places low in the Inferno those who
wilfully live in sadness; and going to the college library and turning to
the passage in the _Divine Comedy_ where beneath the dreary marsh lie
those who were 'sullen in the sweet air,' saying for ever and ever
through their sighs--

I knew the church condemned _accidia_, but the whole idea seemed to me
quite fantastic, just the sort of sin, I fancied, a priest who knew
nothing about real life would invent., Nor could I understand how Dante,
who says that 'sorrow remarries us to God,' could have been so harsh to
those who were enamoured of melancholy, if any such there really were., I
had no idea that some day this would become to me one of the greatest
temptations of my life., While I was in Wandsworth prison I longed to die., It was my one desire., When after two months in the infirmary I was transferred here, and found
myself growing gradually better in physical health, I was filled with
rage., I determined to commit suicide on the very day on which I left
prison., After a time that evil mood passed away, and I made up my mind
to live, but to wear gloom as a king wears purple: never to smile again:
to turn whatever house I entered into a house of mourning: to make my
friends walk slowly in sadness with me: to teach them that melancholy is
the true secret of life: to maim them with an alien sorrow: to mar them
with my own pain., Now I feel quite differently., I see it would be both
ungrateful and unkind of me to pull so long a face that when my friends
came to see me they would have to make their faces still longer in order
to show their sympathy; or, if I desired to entertain them, to invite
them to sit down silently to bitter herbs and funeral baked meats., I
must learn how to be cheerful and happy., The last two occasions on which I was allowed to see my friends here, I
tried to be as cheerful as possible, and to show my cheerfulness, in
order to make them some slight return for their trouble in coming all the
way from town to see me., It is only a slight return, I know, but it is
the one, I feel certain, that pleases them most., I saw R--- for an hour
on Saturday week, and I tried to give the fullest possible expression of
the delight I really felt at our meeting., And that, in the views and
ideas I am here shaping for myself, I am quite right is shown to me by
the fact that now for the first time since my imprisonment I have a real
desire for life., There is before me so much to do, that I would regard it as a terrible
tragedy if I died before I was allowed to complete at any rate a little
of it., I see new developments in art and life, each one of which is a
fresh mode of perfection., I long to live so that I can explore what is
no less than a new world to me., Do you want to know what this new world
is?, I think you can guess what it is., It is the world in which I have
been living., Sorrow, then, and all that it teaches one, is my new world., I used to live entirely for pleasure., I shunned suffering and sorrow of
every kind., I hated both., I resolved to ignore them as far as possible:
to treat them, that is to say, as modes of imperfection., They were not
part of my scheme of life., They had no place in my philosophy., My
mother, who knew life as a whole, used often to quote to me Goethe's
lines--written by Carlyle in a book he had given her years ago, and
translated by him, I fancy, also:--

They were the lines which that noble Queen of Prussia, whom Napoleon
treated with such coarse brutality, used to quote in her humiliation and
exile; they were the lines my mother often quoted in the troubles of her
later life., I absolutely declined to accept or admit the enormous truth
hidden in them., I could not understand it., I remember quite well how I
used to tell her that I did not want to eat my bread in sorrow, or to
pass any night weeping and watching for a more bitter dawn., I had no idea that it was one of the special things that the Fates had in
store for me: that for a whole year of my life, indeed, I was to do
little else., But so has my portion been meted out to me; and during the
last few months I have, after terrible difficulties and struggles, been
able to comprehend some of the lessons hidden in the heart of pain., Clergymen and people who use phrases without wisdom sometimes talk of
suffering as a mystery., It is really a revelation., One discerns things
one never discerned before., One approaches the whole of history from a
different standpoint., What one had felt dimly, through instinct, about
art, is intellectually and emotionally realised with perfect clearness of
vision and absolute intensity of apprehension., I now see that sorrow, being the supreme emotion of which man is capable,
is at once the type and test of all great art., What the artist is always
looking for is the mode of existence in which soul and body are one and
indivisible: in which the outward is expressive of the inward: in which
form reveals., Of such modes of existence there are not a few: youth and
the arts preoccupied with youth may serve as a model for us at one
moment: at another we may like to think that, in its subtlety and
sensitiveness of impression, its suggestion of a spirit dwelling in
external things and making its raiment of earth and air, of mist and city
alike, and in its morbid sympathy of its moods, and tones, and colours,
modern landscape art is realising for us pictorially what was realised in
such plastic perfection by the Greeks., Music, in which all subject is
absorbed in expression and cannot be separated from it, is a complex
example, and a flower or a child a simple example, of what I mean; but
sorrow is the ultimate type both in life and art., Behind joy and laughter there may be a temperament, coarse, hard and
callous., But behind sorrow there is always sorrow., Pain, unlike
pleasure, wears no mask., Truth in art is not any correspondence between
the essential idea and the accidental existence; it is not the
resemblance of shape to shadow, or of the form mirrored in the crystal to
the form itself; it is no echo coming from a hollow hill, any more than
it is a silver well of water in the valley that shows the moon to the
moon and Narcissus to Narcissus., Truth in art is the unity of a thing
with itself: the outward rendered expressive of the inward: the soul made
incarnate: the body instinct with spirit., For this reason there is no
truth comparable to sorrow., There are times when sorrow seems to me to
be the only truth., Other things may be illusions of the eye or the
appetite, made to blind the one and cloy the other, but out of sorrow
have the worlds been built, and at the birth of a child or a star there
is pain., More than this, there is about sorrow an intense, an extraordinary
reality., I have said of myself that I was one who stood in symbolic
relations to the art and culture of my age., There is not a single
wretched man in this wretched place along with me who does not stand in
symbolic relation to the very secret of life., For the secret of life is
suffering., It is what is hidden behind everything., When we begin to
live, what is sweet is so sweet to us, and what is bitter so bitter, that
we inevitably direct all our desires towards pleasures, and seek not
merely for a 'month or twain to feed on honeycomb,' but for all our years
to taste no other food, ignorant all the while that we may really be
starving the soul., I remember talking once on this subject to one of the most beautiful
personalities I have ever known: a woman, whose sympathy and noble
kindness to me, both before and since the tragedy of my imprisonment,
have been beyond power and description; one who has really assisted me,
though she does not know it, to bear the burden of my troubles more than
any one else in the whole world has, and all through the mere fact of her
existence, through her being what she is--partly an ideal and partly an
influence: a suggestion of what one might become as well as a real help
towards becoming it; a soul that renders the common air sweet, and makes
what is spiritual seem as simple and natural as sunlight or the sea: one
for whom beauty and sorrow walk hand in hand, and have the same message., On the occasion of which I am thinking I recall distinctly how I said to
her that there was enough suffering in one narrow London lane to show
that God did not love man, and that wherever there was any sorrow, though
but that of a child, in some little garden weeping over a fault that it
had or had not committed, the whole face of creation was completely
marred., I was entirely wrong., She told me so, but I could not believe
her., I was not in the sphere in which such belief was to be attained to., Now it seems to me that love of some kind is the only possible
explanation of the extraordinary amount of suffering that there is in the
world., I cannot conceive of any other explanation., I am convinced that
there is no other, and that if the world has indeed, as I have said, been
built of sorrow, it has been built by the hands of love, because in no
other way could the soul of man, for whom the world was made, reach the
full stature of its perfection., Pleasure for the beautiful body, but
pain for the beautiful soul., When I say that I am convinced of these things I speak with too much
pride., Far off, like a perfect pearl, one can see the city of God., It
is so wonderful that it seems as if a child could reach it in a summer's
day., And so a child could., But with me and such as me it is different., One can realise a thing in a single moment, but one loses it in the long
hours that follow with leaden feet., It is so difficult to keep 'heights
that the soul is competent to gain.', We think in eternity, but we move
slowly through time; and how slowly time goes with us who lie in prison I
need not tell again, nor of the weariness and despair that creep back
into one's cell, and into the cell of one's heart, with such strange
insistence that one has, as it were, to garnish and sweep one's house for
their coming, as for an unwelcome guest, or a bitter master, or a slave
whose slave it is one's chance or choice to be., And, though at present my friends may find it a hard thing to believe, it
is true none the less, that for them living in freedom and idleness and
comfort it is more easy to learn the lessons of humility than it is for
me, who begin the day by going down on my knees and washing the floor of
my cell., For prison life with its endless privations and restrictions
makes one rebellious., The most terrible thing about it is not that it
breaks one's heart--hearts are made to be broken--but that it turns one's
heart to stone., One sometimes feels that it is only with a front of
brass and a lip of scorn that one can get through the day at all., And he
who is in a state of rebellion cannot receive grace, to use the phrase of
which the Church is so fond--so rightly fond, I dare say--for in life as
in art the mood of rebellion closes up the channels of the soul, and
shuts out the airs of heaven., Yet I must learn these lessons here, if I
am to learn them anywhere, and must be filled with joy if my feet are on
the right road and my face set towards 'the gate which is called
beautiful,' though I may fall many times in the mire and often in the
mist go astray., This New Life, as through my love of Dante I like sometimes to call it,
is of course no new life at all, but simply the continuance, by means of
development, and evolution, of my former life., I remember when I was at
Oxford saying to one of my friends as we were strolling round Magdalen's
narrow bird-haunted walks one morning in the year before I took my
degree, that I wanted to eat of the fruit of all the trees in the garden
of the world, and that I was going out into the world with that passion
in my soul., And so, indeed, I went out, and so I lived., My only mistake
was that I confined myself so exclusively to the trees of what seemed to
me the sun-lit side of the garden, and shunned the other side for its
shadow and its gloom., Failure, disgrace, poverty, sorrow, despair,
suffering, tears even, the broken words that come from lips in pain,
remorse that makes one walk on thorns, conscience that condemns, self-
abasement that punishes, the misery that puts ashes on its head, the
anguish that chooses sack-cloth for its raiment and into its own drink
puts gall:--all these were things of which I was afraid., And as I had
determined to know nothing of them, I was forced to taste each of them in
turn, to feed on them, to have for a season, indeed, no other food at
all., I don't regret for a single moment having lived for pleasure., I did it
to the full, as one should do everything that one does., There was no
pleasure I did not experience., I threw the pearl of my soul into a cup
of wine., I went down the primrose path to the sound of flutes., I lived
on honeycomb., But to have continued the same life would have been wrong
because it would have been limiting., I had to pass on., The other half
of the garden had its secrets for me also., Of course all this is
foreshadowed and prefigured in my books., ...]"|2
73|"[I have a right to share in sorrow, and he who can look at the loveliness
of the world and share its sorrow, and realise something of the wonder of
both, is in immediate contact with divine things, and has got as near to
God's secret as any one can get., Perhaps there may come into my art also, no less than into my life, a
still deeper note, one of greater unity of passion, and directness of
impulse., Not width but intensity is the true aim of modern art., We are
no longer in art concerned with the type., It is with the exception that
we have to do., I cannot put my sufferings into any form they took, I
need hardly say., Art only begins where Imitation ends, but something
must come into my work, of fuller memory of words perhaps, of richer
cadences, of more curious effects, of simpler architectural order, of
some aesthetic quality at any rate., When Marsyas was 'torn from the scabbard of his limbs'--_della vagina
della membre sue_, to use one of Dante's most terrible Tacitean
phrases--he had no more song, the Greek said., Apollo had been victor., The lyre had vanquished the reed., But perhaps the Greeks were mistaken., I hear in much modern Art the cry of Marsyas., It is bitter in
Baudelaire, sweet and plaintive in Lamartine, mystic in Verlaine., It is
in the deferred resolutions of Chopin's music., It is in the discontent
that haunts Burne-Jones's women., Even Matthew Arnold, whose song of
Callicles tells of 'the triumph of the sweet persuasive lyre,' and the
'famous final victory,' in such a clear note of lyrical beauty, has not a
little of it; in the troubled undertone of doubt and distress that haunts
his verses, neither Goethe nor Wordsworth could help him, though he
followed each in turn, and when he seeks to mourn for _Thyrsis_ or to
sing of the _Scholar Gipsy_, it is the reed that he has to take for the
rendering of his strain., But whether or not the Phrygian Faun was
silent, I cannot be., Expression is as necessary to me as leaf and
blossoms are to the black branches of the trees that show themselves
above the prison walls and are so restless in the wind., Between my art
and the world there is now a wide gulf, but between art and myself there
is none., I hope at least that there is none., To each of us different fates are meted out., My lot has been one of
public infamy, of long imprisonment, of misery, of ruin, of disgrace, but
I am not worthy of it--not yet, at any rate., I remember that I used to
say that I thought I could bear a real tragedy if it came to me with
purple pall and a mask of noble sorrow, but that the dreadful thing about
modernity was that it put tragedy into the raiment of comedy, so that the
great realities seemed commonplace or grotesque or lacking in style., It
is quite true about modernity., It has probably always been true about
actual life., It is said that all martyrdoms seemed mean to the looker
on., The nineteenth century is no exception to the rule., Everything about my tragedy has been hideous, mean, repellent, lacking in
style; our very dress makes us grotesque., We are the zanies of sorrow., We are clowns whose hearts are broken., We are specially designed to
appeal to the sense of humour., On November 13th, 1895, I was brought
down here from London., From two o'clock till half-past two on that day I
had to stand on the centre platform of Clapham Junction in convict dress,
and handcuffed, for the world to look at., I had been taken out of the
hospital ward without a moment's notice being given to me., Of all
possible objects I was the most grotesque., When people saw me they
laughed., Each train as it came up swelled the audience., Nothing could
exceed their amusement., That was, of course, before they knew who I was., As soon as they had been informed they laughed still more., For half an
hour I stood there in the grey November rain surrounded by a jeering mob., For a year after that was done to me I wept every day at the same hour
and for the same space of time., That is not such a tragic thing as
possibly it sounds to you., To those who are in prison tears are a part
of every day's experience., A day in prison on which one does not weep is
a day on which one's heart is hard, not a day on which one's heart is
happy., Well, now I am really beginning to feel more regret for the people who
laughed than for myself., Of course when they saw me I was not on my
pedestal, I was in the pillory., But it is a very unimaginative nature
that only cares for people on their pedestals., A pedestal may be a very
unreal thing., A pillory is a terrific reality., They should have known
also how to interpret sorrow better., I have said that behind sorrow
there is always sorrow., It were wiser still to say that behind sorrow
there is always a soul., And to mock at a soul in pain is a dreadful
thing., In the strangely simple economy of the world people only get what
they give, and to those who have not enough imagination to penetrate the
mere outward of things, and feel pity, what pity can be given save that
of scorn?, I write this account of the mode of my being transferred here simply that
it should be realised how hard it has been for me to get anything out of
my punishment but bitterness and despair., I have, however, to do it, and
now and then I have moments of submission and acceptance., All the spring
may be hidden in the single bud, and the low ground nest of the lark may
hold the joy that is to herald the feet of many rose-red dawns., So
perhaps whatever beauty of life still remains to me is contained in some
moment of surrender, abasement, and humiliation., I can, at any rate,
merely proceed on the lines of my own development, and, accepting all
that has happened to me, make myself worthy of it., People used to say of me that I was too individualistic., I must be far
more of an individualist than ever I was., I must get far more out of
myself than ever I got, and ask far less of the world than ever I asked., Indeed, my ruin came not from too great individualism of life, but from
too little., The one disgraceful, unpardonable, and to all time
contemptible action of my life was to allow myself to appeal to society
for help and protection., To have made such an appeal would have been
from the individualist point of view bad enough, but what excuse can
there ever be put forward for having made it?, Of course once I had put
into motion the forces of society, society turned on me and said, 'Have
you been living all this time in defiance of my laws, and do you now
appeal to those laws for protection?, You shall have those laws exercised
to the full., You shall abide by what you have appealed to.', The result
is I am in gaol., Certainly no man ever fell so ignobly, and by such
ignoble instruments, as I did., The Philistine element in life is not the failure to understand art., Charming people, such as fishermen, shepherds, ploughboys, peasants and
the like, know nothing about art, and are the very salt of the earth., He
is the Philistine who upholds and aids the heavy, cumbrous, blind,
mechanical forces of society, and who does not recognise dynamic force
when he meets it either in a man or a movement., People thought it dreadful of me to have entertained at dinner the evil
things of life, and to have found pleasure in their company., But then,
from the point of view through which I, as an artist in life, approach
them they were delightfully suggestive and stimulating., The danger was
half the excitement., ., ., ., My business as an artist was with Ariel., I
set myself to wrestle with Caliban., ., ., ., A great friend of mine--a friend of ten years' standing--came to see me
some time ago, and told me that he did not believe a single word of what
was said against me, and wished me to know that he considered me quite
innocent, and the victim of a hideous plot., I burst into tears at what
he said, and told him that while there was much amongst the definite
charges that was quite untrue and transferred to me by revolting malice,
still that my life had been full of perverse pleasures, and that unless
he accepted that as a fact about me and realised it to the full I could
not possibly be friends with him any more, or ever be in his company., It
was a terrible shock to him, but we are friends, and I have not got his
friendship on false pretences., Emotional forces, as I say somewhere in _Intentions_, are as limited in
extent and duration as the forces of physical energy., The little cup
that is made to hold so much can hold so much and no more, though all the
purple vats of Burgundy be filled with wine to the brim, and the treaders
stand knee-deep in the gathered grapes of the stony vineyards of Spain., There is no error more common than that of thinking that those who are
the causes or occasions of great tragedies share in the feelings suitable
to the tragic mood: no error more fatal than expecting it of them., The
martyr in his 'shirt of flame' may be looking on the face of God, but to
him who is piling the faggots or loosening the logs for the blast the
whole scene is no more than the slaying of an ox is to the butcher, or
the felling of a tree to the charcoal burner in the forest, or the fall
of a flower to one who is mowing down the grass with a scythe., Great
passions are for the great of soul, and great events can be seen only by
those who are on a level with them., * * * * *

I know of nothing in all drama more incomparable from the point of view
of art, nothing more suggestive in its subtlety of observation, than
Shakespeare's drawing of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern., They are Hamlet's
college friends., They have been his companions., They bring with them
memories of pleasant days together., At the moment when they come across
him in the play he is staggering under the weight of a burden intolerable
to one of his temperament., The dead have come armed out of the grave to
impose on him a mission at once too great and too mean for him., He is a
dreamer, and he is called upon to act., ...]"|2

               And with laughter loud they heaped the shroud
                 In which the convict lies., The Chaplain would not kneel to pray

                 Is that the wall is strong;
               And that each day is like a year,
                 A year whose days are long., But this I know, that every Law

               That every prison that men build
                 Is built with bricks of shame,
               And bound with bars lest Christ should see
                 How men their brothers maim., With bars they blur the gracious moon,
                 And blind the goodly sun:

               Pale Anguish keeps the heavy gate,
                 And the warder is Despair., For they starve the little frightened child

                 And none a word may say., Each narrow cell in which we dwell

                 Chokes up each grated screen,
               And all, but Lust, is turned to dust
                 In Humanity's machine., The brackish water that we drink
                 Creeps with a loathsome slime,
               And the bitter bread they weigh in scales
                 Is full of chalk and lime,
               And Sleep will not lie down, but walks
                 Wild-eyed, and cries to Time., But though lean Hunger and green Thirst
                 Like asp with adder fight,
               We have little care of prison fare,
                 For what chills and kills outright
               Is that every stone one lifts by day
                 Becomes one's heart by night., With midnight always in one's heart,
                 And twilight in one's cell,
               We turn the crank, or tear the rope,
                 Each in his separate Hell,
               And the silence is more awful far
                 Than the sound of a brazen bell., And never a human voice comes near
                 To speak a gentle word:
               And the eye that watches through the door
                 Is pitiless and hard:
               And by all forgot, we rot and rot,
                 With soul and body marred., And thus we rust Life's iron chain
                 Degraded and alone:
               And some men curse, and some men weep,
                 And some men make no moan:
               But God's eternal Laws are kind
                 And break the heart of stone., And every human heart that breaks,
                 In prison-cell or yard,
               Is as that broken box that gave
                 Its treasure to the Lord,
               And filled the unclean leper's house
                 With the scent of costliest nard., Ah!, happy they whose hearts can break
                 And peace of pardon win!, How else may man make straight his plan
                 And cleanse his soul from Sin?, How else but through a broken heart
                 May Lord Christ enter in?, And he of the swollen purple throat,
                 And the stark and staring eyes,
               Waits for the holy hands that took
                 The Thief to Paradise;
               And a broken and a contrite heart
                 The Lord will not despise., The man in red who reads the Law
                 Gave him three weeks of life,
               Three little weeks in which to heal
                 His soul of his soul's strife,
               And cleanse from every blot of blood
                 The hand that held the knife., And with tears of blood he cleansed the hand,
                 The hand that held the steel:
               For only blood can wipe out blood,
                 And only tears can heal:
               And the crimson stain that was of Cain
                 Became Christ's snow-white seal., VI

               In Reading gaol by Reading town
                 There is a pit of shame,
               And in it lies a wretched man
                 Eaten by teeth of flame,
               In a burning winding-sheet he lies,
                 And his grave has got no name., And there, till Christ call forth the dead,
                 In silence let him lie:
               No need to waste the foolish tear,
                 Or heave the windy sigh:
               The man had killed the thing he loved,
                 And so he had to die., And all men kill the thing they love,
                 By all let this be heard,
               Some do it with a bitter look,
                 Some with a flattering word,
               The coward does it with a kiss,
                 The brave man with a sword!, THE END

It is only in the best Greek gems, on the silver coins of Syracuse,
or among the marble figures of the Parthenon frieze, that one can
find the ideal representation of the marvellous beauty of that face
which laughed through the leaves last night as Hester Grazebrook., Pure Greek it is, with the grave low forehead, the exquisitely
arched brow; the noble chiselling of the mouth, shaped as if it
were the mouthpiece of an instrument of music; the supreme and
splendid curve of the cheek; the augustly pillared throat which
bears it all:  it is Greek, because the lines which compose it are
so definite and so strong, and yet so exquisitely harmonized that
the effect is one of simple loveliness purely:  Greek, because its
essence and its quality, as is the quality of music and of
architecture, is that of beauty based on absolutely mathematical
laws., But while art remains dumb and immobile in its passionless
serenity, with the beauty of this face it is different:  the grey
eyes lighten into blue or deepen into violet as fancy succeeds
fancy; the lips become flower-like in laughter or, tremulous as a
bird's wing, mould themselves at last into the strong and bitter
moulds of pain or scorn., And then motion comes, and the statue
wakes into life., But the life is not the ordinary life of common
days; it is life with a new value given to it, the value of art:
and the charm to me of Hester Grazebrook's acting in the first
scene of the play last night was that mingling of classic grace
with absolute reality which is the secret of all beautiful art, of
the plastic work of the Greeks and of the pictures of Jean Francois
Millet equally., I do not think that the sovereignty and empire of women's beauty
has at all passed away, though we may no longer go to war for them
as the Greeks did for the daughter of Leda., The greatest empire
still remains for them--the empire of art., And, indeed, this
wonderful face, seen last night for the first time in America, has
filled and permeated with the pervading image of its type the whole
of our modern art in England., Last century it was the romantic
type which dominated in art, the type loved by Reynolds and
Gainsborough, of wonderful contrasts of colour, of exquisite and
varying charm of expression, but without that definite plastic
feeling which divides classic from romantic work., This type
degenerated into mere facile prettiness in the hands of lesser
masters, and, in protest against it, was created by the hands of
the Pre-Raphaelites a new type, with its rare combination of Greek
form with Florentine mysticism., But this mysticism becomes over-
strained and a burden, rather than an aid to expression, and a
desire for the pure Hellenic joy and serenity came in its place;
and in all our modern work, in the paintings of such men as Albert
Moore and Leighton and Whistler, we can trace the influence of this
single face giving fresh life and inspiration in the form of a new
artistic ideal., SLAVES OF FASHION



Miss Leffler-Arnim's statement, in a lecture delivered recently at
St. Saviour's Hospital, that ""she had heard of instances where
ladies were so determined not to exceed the fashionable measurement
that they had actually held on to a cross-bar while their maids
fastened the fifteen-inch corset,"" has excited a good deal of
incredulity, but there is nothing really improbable in it., From
the sixteenth century to our own day there is hardly any form of
torture that has not been inflicted on girls, and endured by women,
in obedience to the dictates of an unreasonable and monstrous
Fashion., ""In order to obtain a real Spanish figure,"" says
Montaigne, ""what a Gehenna of suffering will not women endure,
drawn in and compressed by great coches entering the flesh; nay,
sometimes they even die thereof!"", ""A few days after my arrival at
school,"" Mrs. Somerville tells us in her memoirs, ""although
perfectly straight and well made, I was enclosed in stiff stays,
with a steel busk in front; while above my frock, bands drew my
shoulders back till the shoulder-blades met., Then a steel rod with
a semi-circle, which went under my chin, was clasped to the steel
busk in my stays., In this constrained state I and most of the
younger girls had to prepare our lessons""; and in the life of Miss
Edgeworth we read that, being sent to a certain fashionable
establishment, ""she underwent all the usual tortures of back-
boards, iron collars and dumbs, and also (because she was a very
tiny person) the unusual one of being hung by the neck to draw out
the muscles and increase the growth,"" a signal failure in her case., Indeed, instances of absolute mutilation and misery are so common
in the past that it is unnecessary to multiply them; but it is
really sad to think that in our own day a civilized woman can hang
on to a cross-bar while her maid laces her waist into a fifteen-
inch circle., To begin with, the waist is not a circle at all, but
an oval; nor can there be any greater error than to imagine that an
unnaturally small waist gives an air of grace, or even of
slightness, to the whole figure., Its effect, as a rule, is simply
to exaggerate the width of the shoulders and the hips; and those
whose figures possess that stateliness which is called stoutness by
the vulgar, convert what is a quality into a defect by yielding to
the silly edicts of Fashion on the subject of tight-lacing., The
fashionable English waist, also, is not merely far too small, and
consequently quite out of proportion to the rest of the figure, but
it is worn far too low down., I use the expression ""worn""
advisedly, for a waist nowadays seems to be regarded as an article
of apparel to be put on when and where one likes., A long waist
always implies shortness of the lower limbs, and, from the artistic
point of view, has the effect of diminishing the height; and I am
glad to see that many of the most charming women in Paris are
returning to the idea of the Directoire style of dress., This style
is not by any means perfect, but at least it has the merit of
indicating the proper position of the waist., I feel quite sure
that all English women of culture and position will set their faces
against such stupid and dangerous practices as are related by Miss
Leffler-Arnim., Fashion's motto is:  Il faut souffrir pour etre
belle; but the motto of art and of common-sense is:  Il faut etre
bete pour souffrir., Talking of Fashion, a critic in the Pall Mall Gazelle expresses his
surprise that I should have allowed an illustration of a hat,
covered with ""the bodies of dead birds,"" to appear in the first
number of the Woman's World; and as I have received many letters on
the subject, it is only right that I should state my exact position
in the matter., Fashion is such an essential part of the mundus
muliebris of our day, that it seems to me absolutely necessary that
its growth, development, and phases should be duly chronicled; and
the historical and practical value of such a record depends
entirely upon its perfect fidelity to fact., ...]"|2
75|"[They said it so often and so tediously that, at
last, the Church has begun to say it., One hears it now from every
pulpit., It is perfectly true., Property not merely has duties, but has
so many duties that its possession to any large extent is a bore., It
involves endless claims upon one, endless attention to business, endless
bother., If property had simply pleasures, we could stand it; but its
duties make it unbearable., In the interest of the rich we must get rid
of it., The virtues of the poor may be readily admitted, and are much to
be regretted., We are often told that the poor are grateful for charity., Some of them are, no doubt, but the best amongst the poor are never
grateful., They are ungrateful, discontented, disobedient, and
rebellious., They are quite right to be so., Charity they feel to be a
ridiculously inadequate mode of partial restitution, or a sentimental
dole, usually accompanied by some impertinent attempt on the part of the
sentimentalist to tyrannise over their private lives., Why should they be
grateful for the crumbs that fall from the rich man?s table?, They should
be seated at the board, and are beginning to know it., As for being
discontented, a man who would not be discontented with such surroundings
and such a low mode of life would be a perfect brute., Disobedience, in
the eyes of anyone who has read history, is man?s original virtue., It is
through disobedience that progress has been made, through disobedience
and through rebellion., Sometimes the poor are praised for being thrifty., But to recommend thrift to the poor is both grotesque and insulting., It
is like advising a man who is starving to eat less., For a town or
country labourer to practise thrift would be absolutely immoral., Man
should not be ready to show that he can live like a badly-fed animal., He
should decline to live like that, and should either steal or go on the
rates, which is considered by many to be a form of stealing., As for
begging, it is safer to beg than to take, but it is finer to take than to
beg., No: a poor man who is ungrateful, unthrifty, discontented, and
rebellious, is probably a real personality, and has much in him., He is
at any rate a healthy protest., As for the virtuous poor, one can pity
them, of course, but one cannot possibly admire them., They have made
private terms with the enemy, and sold their birthright for very bad
pottage., They must also be extraordinarily stupid., I can quite
understand a man accepting laws that protect private property, and admit
of its accumulation, as long as he himself is able under those conditions
to realise some form of beautiful and intellectual life., But it is
almost incredible to me how a man whose life is marred and made hideous
by such laws can possibly acquiesce in their continuance., However, the explanation is not really difficult to find., It is simply
this., Misery and poverty are so absolutely degrading, and exercise such
a paralysing effect over the nature of men, that no class is ever really
conscious of its own suffering., They have to be told of it by other
people, and they often entirely disbelieve them., What is said by great
employers of labour against agitators is unquestionably true., Agitators
are a set of interfering, meddling people, who come down to some
perfectly contented class of the community, and sow the seeds of
discontent amongst them., That is the reason why agitators are so
absolutely necessary., Without them, in our incomplete state, there would
be no advance towards civilisation., Slavery was put down in America, not
in consequence of any action on the part of the slaves, or even any
express desire on their part that they should be free., It was put down
entirely through the grossly illegal conduct of certain agitators in
Boston and elsewhere, who were not slaves themselves, nor owners of
slaves, nor had anything to do with the question really., It was,
undoubtedly, the Abolitionists who set the torch alight, who began the
whole thing., And it is curious to note that from the slaves themselves
they received, not merely very little assistance, but hardly any sympathy
even; and when at the close of the war the slaves found themselves free,
found themselves indeed so absolutely free that they were free to starve,
many of them bitterly regretted the new state of things., To the thinker,
the most tragic fact in the whole of the French Revolution is not that
Marie Antoinette was killed for being a queen, but that the starved
peasant of the Vend?e voluntarily went out to die for the hideous cause
of feudalism., It is clear, then, that no Authoritarian Socialism will do., For while
under the present system a very large number of people can lead lives of
a certain amount of freedom and expression and happiness, under an
industrial-barrack system, or a system of economic tyranny, nobody would
be able to have any such freedom at all., It is to be regretted that a
portion of our community should be practically in slavery, but to propose
to solve the problem by enslaving the entire community is childish., Every man must be left quite free to choose his own work., No form of
compulsion must be exercised over him., If there is, his work will not be
good for him, will not be good in itself, and will not be good for
others., And by work I simply mean activity of any kind., I hardly think that any Socialist, nowadays, would seriously propose that
an inspector should call every morning at each house to see that each
citizen rose up and did manual labour for eight hours., Humanity has got
beyond that stage, and reserves such a form of life for the people whom,
in a very arbitrary manner, it chooses to call criminals., But I confess
that many of the socialistic views that I have come across seem to me to
be tainted with ideas of authority, if not of actual compulsion., Of
course, authority and compulsion are out of the question., All
association must be quite voluntary., It is only in voluntary
associations that man is fine., But it may be asked how Individualism, which is now more or less
dependent on the existence of private property for its development, will
benefit by the abolition of such private property., The answer is very
simple., It is true that, under existing conditions, a few men who have
had private means of their own, such as Byron, Shelley, Browning, Victor
Hugo, Baudelaire, and others, have been able to realise their personality
more or less completely., Not one of these men ever did a single day?s
work for hire., They were relieved from poverty., They had an immense
advantage., The question is whether it would be for the good of
Individualism that such an advantage should be taken away., Let us
suppose that it is taken away., What happens then to Individualism?, How
will it benefit?, It will benefit in this way., Under the new conditions Individualism will
be far freer, far finer, and far more intensified than it is now., I am
not talking of the great imaginatively-realised Individualism of such
poets as I have mentioned, but of the great actual Individualism latent
and potential in mankind generally., For the recognition of private
property has really harmed Individualism, and obscured it, by confusing a
man with what he possesses., It has led Individualism entirely astray., It has made gain not growth its aim., So that man thought that the
important thing was to have, and did not know that the important thing is
to be., The true perfection of man lies, not in what man has, but in what
man is., Private property has crushed true Individualism, and set up an
Individualism that is false., It has debarred one part of the community
from being individual by starving them., It has debarred the other part
of the community from being individual by putting them on the wrong road,
and encumbering them., Indeed, so completely has man?s personality been
absorbed by his possessions that the English law has always treated
offences against a man?s property with far more severity than offences
against his person, and property is still the test of complete
citizenship., The industry necessary for the making money is also very
demoralising., In a community like ours, where property confers immense
distinction, social position, honour, respect, titles, and other pleasant
things of the kind, man, being naturally ambitious, makes it his aim to
accumulate this property, and goes on wearily and tediously accumulating
it long after he has got far more than he wants, or can use, or enjoy, or
perhaps even know of., Man will kill himself by overwork in order to
secure property, and really, considering the enormous advantages that
property brings, one is hardly surprised., One?s regret is that society
should be constructed on such a basis that man has been forced into a
groove in which he cannot freely develop what is wonderful, and
fascinating, and delightful in him?in which, in fact, he misses the true
pleasure and joy of living., He is also, under existing conditions, very
insecure., An enormously wealthy merchant may be?often is?at every moment
of his life at the mercy of things that are not under his control., If
the wind blows an extra point or so, or the weather suddenly changes, or
some trivial thing happens, his ship may go down, his speculations may go
wrong, and he finds himself a poor man, with his social position quite
gone., Now, nothing should be able to harm a man except himself., Nothing
should be able to rob a man at all., What a man really has, is what is in
him., What is outside of him should be a matter of no importance., With the abolition of private property, then, we shall have true,
beautiful, healthy Individualism., Nobody will waste his life in
accumulating things, and the symbols for things., One will live., To live
is the rarest thing in the world., Most people exist, that is all., It is a question whether we have ever seen the full expression of a
personality, except on the imaginative plane of art., In action, we never
have., C?sar, says Mommsen, was the complete and perfect man., But how
tragically insecure was C?sar!, ...]"|2
76|"[?exotic,?, and ?unhealthy.?, There
is one other word that they use., That word is ?morbid.?, They do not use
it often., The meaning of the word is so simple that they are afraid of
using it., Still, they use it sometimes, and, now and then, one comes
across it in popular newspapers., It is, of course, a ridiculous word to
apply to a work of art., For what is morbidity but a mood of emotion or a
mode of thought that one cannot express?, The public are all morbid,
because the public can never find expression for anything., The artist is
never morbid., He expresses everything., He stands outside his subject,
and through its medium produces incomparable and artistic effects., To
call an artist morbid because he deals with morbidity as his
subject-matter is as silly as if one called Shakespeare mad because he
wrote ?King Lear.?, On the whole, an artist in England gains something by being attacked., His individuality is intensified., He becomes more completely himself., Of course, the attacks are very gross, very impertinent, and very
contemptible., But then no artist expects grace from the vulgar mind, or
style from the suburban intellect., Vulgarity and stupidity are two very
vivid facts in modern life., One regrets them, naturally., But there they
are., They are subjects for study, like everything else., And it is only
fair to state, with regard to modern journalists, that they always
apologise to one in private for what they have written against one in
public., Within the last few years two other adjectives, it may be mentioned, have
been added to the very limited vocabulary of art-abuse that is at the
disposal of the public., One is the word ?unhealthy,?, the other is the
word ?exotic.?, The latter merely expresses the rage of the momentary
mushroom against the immortal, entrancing, and exquisitely lovely orchid., It is a tribute, but a tribute of no importance., The word ?unhealthy,?, however, admits of analysis., It is a rather interesting word., In fact,
it is so interesting that the people who use it do not know what it
means., What does it mean?, What is a healthy, or an unhealthy work of art?, All
terms that one applies to a work of art, provided that one applies them
rationally, have reference to either its style or its subject, or to both
together., From the point of view of style, a healthy work of art is one
whose style recognises the beauty of the material it employs, be that
material one of words or of bronze, of colour or of ivory, and uses that
beauty as a factor in producing the ?sthetic effect., From the point of
view of subject, a healthy work of art is one the choice of whose subject
is conditioned by the temperament of the artist, and comes directly out
of it., In fine, a healthy work of art is one that has both perfection
and personality., Of course, form and substance cannot be separated in a
work of art; they are always one., But for purposes of analysis, and
setting the wholeness of ?sthetic impression aside for a moment, we can
intellectually so separate them., An unhealthy work of art, on the other
hand, is a work whose style is obvious, old-fashioned, and common, and
whose subject is deliberately chosen, not because the artist has any
pleasure in it, but because he thinks that the public will pay him for
it., In fact, the popular novel that the public calls healthy is always a
thoroughly unhealthy production; and what the public call an unhealthy
novel is always a beautiful and healthy work of art., I need hardly say that I am not, for a single moment, complaining that
the public and the public press misuse these words., I do not see how,
with their lack of comprehension of what Art is, they could possibly use
them in the proper sense., I am merely pointing out the misuse; and as
for the origin of the misuse and the meaning that lies behind it all, the
explanation is very simple., It comes from the barbarous conception of
authority., It comes from the natural inability of a community corrupted
by authority to understand or appreciate Individualism., In a word, it
comes from that monstrous and ignorant thing that is called Public
Opinion, which, bad and well-meaning as it is when it tries to control
action, is infamous and of evil meaning when it tries to control Thought
or Art., Indeed, there is much more to be said in favour of the physical force of
the public than there is in favour of the public?s opinion., The former
may be fine., The latter must be foolish., It is often said that force is
no argument., That, however, entirely depends on what one wants to prove., Many of the most important problems of the last few centuries, such as
the continuance of personal government in England, or of feudalism in
France, have been solved entirely by means of physical force., The very
violence of a revolution may make the public grand and splendid for a
moment., It was a fatal day when the public discovered that the pen is
mightier than the paving-stone, and can be made as offensive as the
brickbat., They at once sought for the journalist, found him, developed
him, and made him their industrious and well-paid servant., It is greatly
to be regretted, for both their sakes., Behind the barricade there may be
much that is noble and heroic., But what is there behind the
leading-article but prejudice, stupidity, cant, and twaddle?, And when
these four are joined together they make a terrible force, and constitute
the new authority., In old days men had the rack., Now they have the press., That is an
improvement certainly., But still it is very bad, and wrong, and
demoralising., Somebody?was it Burke?, ?called journalism the fourth
estate., That was true at the time, no doubt., But at the present moment
it really is the only estate., It has eaten up the other three., The
Lords Temporal say nothing, the Lords Spiritual have nothing to say, and
the House of Commons has nothing to say and says it., We are dominated by
Journalism., In America the President reigns for four years, and
Journalism governs for ever and ever., Fortunately in America Journalism
has carried its authority to the grossest and most brutal extreme., As a
natural consequence it has begun to create a spirit of revolt., People
are amused by it, or disgusted by it, according to their temperaments., But it is no longer the real force it was., It is not seriously treated., In England, Journalism, not, except in a few well-known instances, having
been carried to such excesses of brutality, is still a great factor, a
really remarkable power., The tyranny that it proposes to exercise over
people?s private lives seems to me to be quite extraordinary., The fact
is, that the public have an insatiable curiosity to know everything,
except what is worth knowing., Journalism, conscious of this, and having
tradesman-like habits, supplies their demands., In centuries before ours
the public nailed the ears of journalists to the pump., That was quite
hideous., In this century journalists have nailed their own ears to the
keyhole., That is much worse., And what aggravates the mischief is that
the journalists who are most to blame are not the amusing journalists who
write for what are called Society papers., The harm is done by the
serious, thoughtful, earnest journalists, who solemnly, as they are doing
at present, will drag before the eyes of the public some incident in the
private life of a great statesman, of a man who is a leader of political
thought as he is a creator of political force, and invite the public to
discuss the incident, to exercise authority in the matter, to give their
views, and not merely to give their views, but to carry them into action,
to dictate to the man upon all other points, to dictate to his party, to
dictate to his country; in fact, to make themselves ridiculous,
offensive, and harmful., The private lives of men and women should not be
told to the public., The public have nothing to do with them at all., In
France they manage these things better., There they do not allow the
details of the trials that take place in the divorce courts to be
published for the amusement or criticism of the public., All that the
public are allowed to know is that the divorce has taken place and was
granted on petition of one or other or both of the married parties
concerned., In France, in fact, they limit the journalist, and allow the
artist almost perfect freedom., Here we allow absolute freedom to the
journalist, and entirely limit the artist., English public opinion, that
is to say, tries to constrain and impede and warp the man who makes
things that are beautiful in effect, and compels the journalist to retail
things that are ugly, or disgusting, or revolting in fact, so that we
have the most serious journalists in the world, and the most indecent
newspapers., It is no exaggeration to talk of compulsion., There are
possibly some journalists who take a real pleasure in publishing horrible
things, or who, being poor, look to scandals as forming a sort of
permanent basis for an income., But there are other journalists, I feel
certain, men of education and cultivation, who really dislike publishing
these things, who know that it is wrong to do so, and only do it because
the unhealthy conditions under which their occupation is carried on
oblige them to supply the public with what the public wants, and to
compete with other journalists in making that supply as full and
satisfying to the gross popular appetite as possible., ...]"|2
77|"[Pain is
not the ultimate mode of perfection., It is merely provisional and a
protest., It has reference to wrong, unhealthy, unjust surroundings., When the wrong, and the disease, and the injustice are removed, it will
have no further place., It will have done its work., It was a great work,
but it is almost over., Its sphere lessens every day., Nor will man miss it., For what man has sought for is, indeed, neither
pain nor pleasure, but simply Life., Man has sought to live intensely,
fully, perfectly., When he can do so without exercising restraint on
others, or suffering it ever, and his activities are all pleasurable to
him, he will be saner, healthier, more civilised, more himself., Pleasure
is Nature?s test, her sign of approval., When man is happy, he is in
harmony with himself and his environment., The new Individualism, for
whose service Socialism, whether it wills it or not, is working, will be
perfect harmony., It will be what the Greeks sought for, but could not,
except in Thought, realise completely, because they had slaves, and fed
them; it will be what the Renaissance sought for, but could not realise
completely except in Art, because they had slaves, and starved them., It
will be complete, and through it each man will attain to his perfection., The new Individualism is the new Hellenism., PROLOGUE., SCENE.--_A Russian Inn._

PETER (_warming his hands at a stove_)., Has Vera not come back yet,
Michael?, MICH. No, Father Peter, not yet; 'tis a good three miles to the post
office, and she has to milk the cows besides, and that dun one is a rare
plaguey creature for a wench to handle., PETER., Why didn't you go with her, you young fool?, she'll never love you
unless you are always at her heels; women like to be bothered., MICH. She says I bother her too much already, Father Peter, and I fear
she'll never love me after all., PETER., Tut, tut, boy, why shouldn't she?, you're young and wouldn't be
ill-favoured either, had God or thy mother given thee another face., Aren't you one of Prince Maraloffski's gamekeepers; and haven't you got
a good grass farm, and the best cow in the village?, What more does a
girl want?, MICH., But Vera, Father Peter--

PETER., Vera, my lad, has got too many ideas; I don't think much of ideas
myself; I've got on well enough in life without 'em; why shouldn't my
children?, There's Dmitri!, could have stayed here and kept the inn; many
a young lad would have jumped at the offer in these hard times; but he,
scatter-brained featherhead of a boy, must needs go off to Moscow to
study the law!, What does he want knowing about the law!, let a man do his
duty, say I, and no one will trouble him., MICH. Ay!, but Father Peter, they say a good lawyer can break the law as
often as he likes, and no one can say him nay., PETER., That is about all they are good for; and there he stays, and has
not written a line to us for four months now--a good son that, eh?, MICH. Come, come, Father Peter, Dmitri's letters must have gone
astray--perhaps the new postman can't read; he looks stupid enough, and
Dmitri, why, he was the best fellow in the village., Do you remember how
he shot the bear at the barn in the great winter?, PETER., Ay, it was a good shot; I never did a better myself., MICH. And as for dancing, he tired out three fiddlers Christmas come two
years., PETER., Ay, ay, he was a merry lad., It is the girl that has the
seriousness--she goes about as solemn as a priest for days at a time., MICH. Vera is always thinking of others., PETER., There is her mistake, boy., Let God and our Little Father look to
the world., It is none of my work to mend my neighbour's thatch., Why,
last winter old Michael was frozen to death in his sleigh in the
snowstorm, and his wife and children starved afterwards when the hard
times came; but what business was it of mine?, I didn't make the world., Let God and the Czar look to it., And then the blight came, and the black
plague with it, and the priests couldn't bury the people fast enough,
and they lay dead on the roads--men and women both., But what business
was it of mine?, I didn't make the world., Let God and the Czar look to
it., Or two autumns ago, when the river overflowed on a sudden, and the
children's school was carried away and drowned every girl and boy in it., I didn't make the world--let God and the Czar look to it., MICH., But, Father Peter--

PETER., No, no, boy; no man could live if he took his neighbour's pack
on his shoulders., (_Enter VERA in peasant's dress._) Well, my girl,
you've been long enough away--where is the letter?, VERA., There is none to-day, Father., PETER., I knew it., VERA., But there will be one to-morrow, Father., PETER., Curse him, for an ungrateful son., VERA., Oh, Father, don't say that; he must be sick., PETER., Ay!, sick of profligacy, perhaps., VERA., How dare you say that of him, Father?, You know that is not true., PETER., Where does the money go, then?, Michael, listen., I gave Dmitri
half his mother's fortune to bring with him to pay the lawyer folk of
Moscow., He has only written three times, and every time for more money., He got it, not at my wish, but at hers (_pointing to VERA_), and now for
five months, close on six almost, we have heard nothing from him., VERA., Father, he will come back., PETER., Ay!, the prodigals always return; but let him never darken my
doors again., VERA (_sitting down pensive_)., Some evil has come on him; he must be
dead!, Oh!, Michael, I am so wretched about Dmitri., MICH. Will you never love any one but him, Vera?, VERA (_smiling_)., ...]"|2

Czar's life and movements, and I knew you could tell me all about the
palace., Every poor student of medicine in Moscow knows all about king's
houses., It is their duty, is it not?, ALEXIS (_aside_)., Can Michael suspect me?, There is something strange in
his manner to-night., Why doesn't she come?, The whole fire of revolution

a time., Go, boy, go; I have much to think about to-night., (_Goes to back
of stage, draws aside curtain., View of Moscow by moonlight._) The snow
has fallen heavily since sunset., How white and cold my city looks under
this pale moon!, And yet, what hot and fiery hearts beat in this icy
Russia, for all its frost and snow!, Oh, to see her for a moment; to tell
her all; to tell her why I am a king!, But she does not doubt me; she
said she would trust in me., Though I have broken my oath, she will have
trust., It is very cold., Where is my cloak?, I shall sleep for an hour., Then I have ordered my sledge, and, though I die for it, I shall see
Vera to-night., Did I not bid thee go, boy?, What!, must I play the tyrant
so soon?, Go, go!, I cannot live without seeing her., My horses will be
here in an hour; one hour between me and love!, How heavy this charcoal
fire smells., (_Exit the PAGE., Lies down on a couch beside brazier._)

republican who hath worn a crown, the traitor who hath lied to us., Michael was right., He loved not the people., He loved me not., [9] (_Bends
over him._) Oh, why should such deadly poison lie in such sweet lips?, Was there not gold enough in his hair before, that he should tarnish it
with this crown?, But my day has come now; the day of the people, of
liberty, has come!, Your day, my brother, has come!, Though I have
strangled whatever nature is in me, I did not think it had been so easy
to kill., One blow and it is over, and I can wash my hands in water
afterwards, I can wash my hands afterwards., Come, I shall save Russia., I
have sworn it., (_Raises dagger to strike._)

CZAR (_staring up, seizes her by both hands_)., Vera, you here!, My dream
was no dream at all., Why have you left me three days alone, when I most
needed you?, O God, you think I am a traitor, a liar, a king?, I am, for
love of you., Vera, it was for you I broke my oath and wear my father's
crown., I would lay at your feet this mighty Russia, which you and I
have loved so well; would give you this earth as a footstool!, set this
crown on your head., The people will love us., We will rule them by love,
as a father rules his children., There shall be liberty in Russia for
every man to think as his heart bids him; liberty for men to speak as
they think., I have banished the wolves that preyed on us; I have brought
back your brother from Siberia; I have opened the blackened jaws of the
mine., The courier is already on his way; within a week Dmitri and all
those with him will be back in their own land., The people shall be
free--are free now--and you and I, Emperor and Empress of this mighty
realm, will walk among them openly, in love., When they gave me this
crown first, I would have flung it back to them, had it not been for
you, Vera., O God!, It is men's custom in Russia to bring gifts to those
they love., I said, I will bring to the woman I love a people, an empire,
a world!, Vera, it is for you, for you alone, I kept this crown; for you
alone I am a king., Oh, I have loved you better than my oath!, Why will
you not speak to me?, You love me not!, You love me not!, You have come to
warn me of some plot against my life., What is life worth to me without
you?, (_CONSPIRATORS murmur outside._)

VERA., Oh, lost!, lost!, lost!, CZAR., Nay, you are safe here., It wants five hours still of dawn., To-morrow, I will lead you forth to the whole people--

VERA., To-morrow--!, CZAR., Will crown you with my own hands as Empress in that great
cathedral which my fathers built., VERA (_loosens her hands violently from him, and starts up_)., I am a
Nihilist!, I cannot wear a crown!, CZAR (_falls at her feet_)., I am no king now., I am only a boy who has
loved you better than his honour, better than his oath., ...]"|2

probably paying her bills?do you think that the wife should not console
herself?, LADY WINDERMERE., [_Frowning_.], Console herself?, LORD DARLINGTON., Yes, I think she should?I think she has the right., LADY WINDERMERE., Because the husband is vile?should the wife be vile
also?, LORD DARLINGTON., Vileness is a terrible word, Lady Windermere., LADY WINDERMERE., It is a terrible thing, Lord Darlington., LORD DARLINGTON., Do you know I am afraid that good people do a great
deal of harm in this world., Certainly the greatest harm they do is that
they make badness of such extraordinary importance., It is absurd to
divide people into good and bad., People are either charming or tedious., I take the side of the charming, and you, Lady Windermere, can?t help

you are very hard on modern life, Lady Windermere., Of course there is
much against it, I admit., Most women, for instance, nowadays, are rather
mercenary., LADY WINDERMERE., Don?t talk about such people., LORD DARLINGTON., Well then, setting aside mercenary people, who, of
course, are dreadful, do you think seriously that women who have
committed what the world calls a fault should never be forgiven?, LADY WINDERMERE., [_Standing at table_.], I think they should never be
forgiven., LORD DARLINGTON., And men?, Do you think that there should be the same
laws for men as there are for women?, LADY WINDERMERE., Certainly!, LORD DARLINGTON., I think life too complex a thing to be settled by these
hard and fast rules., LADY WINDERMERE., If we had ?these hard and fast rules,?, we should find
life much more simple., LORD DARLINGTON., You allow of no exceptions?, LADY WINDERMERE., None!, LORD DARLINGTON., Ah, what a fascinating Puritan you are, Lady
Windermere!, LADY WINDERMERE., The adjective was unnecessary, Lord Darlington., LORD DARLINGTON., I couldn?t help it., I can resist everything except
temptation., LADY WINDERMERE., You have the modern affectation of weakness., LORD DARLINGTON., [_Looking at her_.], It?s only an affectation, Lady

complete failure., Why, there are lots of people who say I have never
really done anything wrong in the whole course of my life., Of course
they only say it behind my back., DUCHESS OF BERWICK., Isn?t he dreadful?, Agatha, this is Lord Darlington., Mind you don?t believe a word he says., [LORD DARLINGTON _crosses R.C._]

her life., I tell you simply this?Mrs., Erlynne was once honoured, loved,
respected., She was well born, she had position?she lost everything?threw
it away, if you like., That makes it all the more bitter., Misfortunes
one can endure?they come from outside, they are accidents., But to suffer
for one?s own faults?ah!, ?there is the sting of life., It was twenty years
ago, too., She was little more than a girl then., She had been a wife for
even less time than you have., LADY WINDERMERE., I am not interested in her?and?you should not mention
this woman and me in the same breath., It is an error of taste., [_Sitting R. at desk_.], LORD WINDERMERE., Margaret, you could save this woman., She wants to get

ask it of you, though you have discovered what I had intended you should
never have known that I have given Mrs. Erlynne a large sum of money., I
want you to send her an invitation for our party to-night., [_Standing L.
of her_.], LADY WINDERMERE., You are mad!, [_Rises_.], LORD WINDERMERE., I entreat you., People may chatter about her, do
chatter about her, of course, but they don?t know anything definite
against her., She has been to several houses?not to houses where you
would go, I admit, but still to houses where women who are in what is
called Society nowadays do go., That does not content her., She wants you
to receive her once., LADY WINDERMERE., As a triumph for her, I suppose?, LORD WINDERMERE., No; but because she knows that you are a good woman?and
that if she comes here once she will have a chance of a happier, a surer
life than she has had., She will make no further effort to know you., Won?t you help a woman who is trying to get back?, LADY WINDERMERE., No!, If a woman really repents, she never wishes to
return to the society that has made or seen her ruin., LORD WINDERMERE., I beg of you., LADY WINDERMERE., [_Crossing to door R._]  I am going to dress for

dangerous nowadays for a husband to pay any attention to his wife in
public., It always makes people think that he beats her when they?re
alone., The world has grown so suspicious of anything that looks like a
happy married life., But I?ll tell you what it is at supper., [_Moves

any way annoy or wound her, you will bring shame and sorrow on us both., Remember that!, Ah, Margaret!, only trust me!, A wife should trust her

stand anything rather than face the censure of a world, whose praise you

much., Let us go away to the country., You?ll be all right at Selby., The
season is almost over., There is no use staying on., Poor darling!, We?ll
go away to-day, if you like., [_Rises_.], We can easily catch the 3.40., I?ll send a wire to Fannen., [_Crosses and sits down at table to write a
telegram_.], LADY WINDERMERE., Yes; let us go away to-day., No; I can?t go to-day,
Arthur., There is some one I must see before I leave town?some one who
has been kind to me., LORD WINDERMERE., [_Rising and leaning over sofa_.], Kind to you?, LADY WINDERMERE., Far more than that., [_Rises and goes to him_.], I will
tell you, Arthur, but only love me, love me as you used to love me., LORD WINDERMERE., Used to?, You are not thinking of that wretched woman
who came here last night?, [_Coming round and sitting R. of her_.], You
don?t still imagine?no, you couldn?t., LADY WINDERMERE., I don?t., I know now I was wrong and foolish., LORD WINDERMERE., It was very good of you to receive her last night?but
you are never to see her again., LADY WINDERMERE., Why do you say that?, [_A pause_.], LORD WINDERMERE., [_Holding her hand_.], Margaret, I thought Mrs. Erlynne
was a woman more sinned against than sinning, as the phrase goes., I
thought she wanted to be good, to get back into a place that she had lost
by a moment?s folly, to lead again a decent life., I believed what she
told me?I was mistaken in her., She is bad?as bad as a woman can be., LADY WINDERMERE., Arthur, Arthur, don?t talk so bitterly about any woman., I don?t think now that people can be divided into the good and the bad as
though they were two separate races or creations., What are called good
women may have terrible things in them, mad moods of recklessness,
assertion, jealousy, sin., Bad women, as they are termed, may have in
them sorrow, repentance, pity, sacrifice., And I don?t think Mrs. Erlynne
a bad woman?I know she?s not., LORD WINDERMERE., My dear child, the woman?s impossible., No matter what
harm she tries to do us, you must never see her again., She is
inadmissible anywhere., LADY WINDERMERE., But I want to see her., ...]"|2

do not allow., It is my secret, it is not yours., If I make up my mind to
tell her, and I think I will, I shall tell her before I leave the

husband?s dressing-room?he had stolen it., MRS. ERLYNNE., [_Takes the photograph from her and looks at it_.], I am
not surprised?it is charming., [_Goes over to sofa with_ LADY WINDERMERE,

that is your little boy!, What is he called?, LADY WINDERMERE., Gerard, after my dear father., MRS. ERLYNNE., [_Laying the photograph down_.], Really?, LADY WINDERMERE., Yes., If it had been a girl, I would have called it
after my mother., My mother had the same name as myself, Margaret., MRS. ERLYNNE., My name is Margaret too., LADY WINDERMERE., Indeed!, MRS. ERLYNNE., Yes., [_Pause_.], You are devoted to your mother?s memory,

have., Mine is my mother., MRS. ERLYNNE., Ideals are dangerous things., Realities are better., They
wound, but they?re better., LADY WINDERMERE., [_Shaking her head_.], If I lost my ideals, I should
lose everything., MRS. ERLYNNE., Everything?, LADY WINDERMERE., Yes., [_Pause_.], MRS. ERLYNNE., Did your father often speak to you of your mother?, LADY WINDERMERE., No, it gave him too much pain., He told me how my
mother had died a few months after I was born., His eyes filled with
tears as he spoke., Then he begged me never to mention her name to him
again., It made him suffer even to hear it., My father?my father really
died of a broken heart., His was the most ruined life know., MRS. ERLYNNE., [_Rising_.], I am afraid I must go now, Lady Windermere., LADY WINDERMERE., [_Rising_.], Oh no, don?t., MRS. ERLYNNE., I think I had better., My carriage must have come back by
this time., I sent it to Lady Jedburgh?s with a note., LADY WINDERMERE., Arthur, would you mind seeing if Mrs. Erlynne?s
carriage has come back?, MRS. ERLYNNE., Pray don?t trouble, Lord Windermere., LADY WINDERMERE., Yes, Arthur, do go, please., [LORD WINDERMERE _hesitated for a moment and looks at_ MRS. ERLYNNE., _She remains quite impassive_., _He leaves the room_.], [_To_ MRS., ERLYNNE.], Oh!, What am I to say to you?, You saved me last
night?, [_Goes towards her_.], MRS. ERLYNNE., Hush?don?t speak of it., LADY WINDERMERE., I must speak of it., I can?t let you think that I am
going to accept this sacrifice., ...]"|2

Worsley., HESTER., Are you very pleased about it?, GERALD., Of course I am., It means everything to me?things that were out
of the reach of hope before may be within hope?s reach now., HESTER., Nothing should be out of the reach of hope., Life is a hope., LADY HUNSTANTON., I fancy, Caroline, that Diplomacy is what Lord
Illingworth is aiming at., I heard that he was offered Vienna., But that
may not be true., LADY CAROLINE., I don?t think that England should be represented abroad
by an unmarried man, Jane., It might lead to complications., LADY HUNSTANTON., You are too nervous, Caroline., Believe me, you are too
nervous., Besides, Lord Illingworth may marry any day., I was in hopes he
would have married lady Kelso., But I believe he said her family was too
large., Or was it her feet?, I forget which., I regret it very much., She
was made to be an ambassador?s wife., LADY CAROLINE., She certainly has a wonderful faculty of remembering
people?s names, and forgetting their faces., LADY HUNSTANTON., Well, that is very natural, Caroline, is it not?, [_To
Footman_.], Tell Henry to wait for an answer., I have written a line to
your dear mother, Gerald, to tell her your good news, and to say she

fortune., He is quite a _prot?g?_ of mine., And I am particularly pleased
that Lord Illingworth should have made the offer of his own accord
without my suggesting anything., Nobody likes to be asked favours., I
remember poor Charlotte Pagden making herself quite unpopular one season,
because she had a French governess she wanted to recommend to every one., LADY CAROLINE., I saw the governess, Jane., Lady Pagden sent her to me., It was before Eleanor came out., She was far too good-looking to be in
any respectable household., I don?t wonder Lady Pagden was so anxious to
get rid of her., LADY HUNSTANTON., Ah, that explains it., LADY CAROLINE., John, the grass is too damp for you., You had better go

to be well timbered., MRS. ALLONBY., The trees are wonderful, Lady Hunstanton., LADY STUTFIELD., Quite, quite wonderful., MRS. ALLONBY., But somehow, I feel sure that if I lived in the country
for six months, I should become so unsophisticated that no one would take
the slightest notice of me., LADY HUNSTANTON., I assure you, dear, that the country has not that
effect at all., Why, it was from Melthorpe, which is only two miles from
here, that Lady Belton eloped with Lord Fethersdale., I remember the
occurrence perfectly., Poor Lord Belton died three days afterwards of
joy, or gout., I forget which., We had a large party staying here at the
time, so we were all very much interested in the whole affair., MRS. ALLONBY., I think to elope is cowardly., It?s running away from
danger., And danger has become so rare in modern life., LADY CAROLINE., As far as I can make out, the young women of the present
day seem to make it the sole object of their lives to be always playing
with fire., MRS. ALLONBY., The one advantage of playing with fire, Lady Caroline, is
that one never gets even singed., It is the people who don?t know how to
play with it who get burned up., LADY STUTFIELD., Yes; I see that., It is very, very helpful., LADY HUNSTANTON., ...]"|2

husbands, beautiful women never are!, LORD ILLINGWORTH., Beautiful women never have time., They are always so
occupied in being jealous of other people?s husbands., MRS. ALLONBY., I should have thought Lady Caroline would have grown tired
of conjugal anxiety by this time!, Sir John is her fourth!, LORD ILLINGWORTH., So much marriage is certainly not becoming., Twenty
years of romance make a woman look like a ruin; but twenty years of
marriage make her something like a public building., MRS. ALLONBY., Twenty years of romance!, Is there such a thing?, LORD ILLINGWORTH., Not in our day., Women have become too brilliant., Nothing spoils a romance so much as a sense of humour in the woman., MRS. ALLONBY., Or the want of it in the man., LORD ILLINGWORTH., You are quite right., In a Temple every one should be
serious, except the thing that is worshipped., MRS. ALLONBY., And that should be man?, LORD ILLINGWORTH., Women kneel so gracefully; men don?t., MRS. ALLONBY., You are thinking of Lady Stutfield!, LORD ILLINGWORTH., I assure you I have not thought of Lady Stutfield for
the last quarter of an hour., MRS. ALLONBY., Is she such a mystery?, ...]"|2

your married life, but that you like to hide your happiness from others., MRS.

fair-haired woman with no chin., MRS. ALLONBY., Ah, Ernest has a chin., He has a very strong chin, a
square chin., Ernest?s chin is far too square., LADY STUTFIELD., But do you really think a man?s chin can be too square?, I think a man should look very, very strong, and that his chin should be
quite, quite square., MRS. ALLONBY., Then you should certainly know Ernest, Lady Stutfield., It
is only fair to tell you beforehand he has got no conversation at all., LADY STUTFIELD., I adore silent men., MRS. ALLONBY., Oh, Ernest isn?t silent., He talks the whole time., But he
has got no conversation., What he talks about I don?t know., I haven?t
listened to him for years., LADY STUTFIELD., Have you never forgiven him then?, How sad that seems!, But all life is very, very sad, is it not?, MRS. ALLONBY., Life, Lady Stutfield, is simply a _mauvais quart d?heure_
made up of exquisite moments., LADY STUTFIELD., Yes, there are moments, certainly., But was it something
very, very wrong that Mr. Allonby did?, Did he become angry with you, and
say anything that was unkind or true?, MRS. ALLONBY., Oh dear, no., Ernest is invariably calm., That is one of
the reasons he always gets on my nerves., Nothing is so aggravating as
calmness., There is something positively brutal about the good temper of
most modern men., I wonder we women stand it as well as we do., LADY STUTFIELD., Yes; men?s good temper shows they are not so sensitive
as we are, not so finely strung., It makes a great barrier often between
husband and wife, does it not?, But I would so much like to know what was
the wrong thing Mr. Allonby did., MRS. ALLONBY., Well, I will tell you, if you solemnly promise to tell
everybody else., LADY STUTFIELD., Thank you, thank you., I will make a point of repeating
it., MRS. ALLONBY., When Ernest and I were engaged, he swore to me positively
on his knees that he had never loved any one before in the whole course
of his life., I was very young at the time, so I didn?t believe him, I
needn?t tell you., Unfortunately, however, I made no enquiries of any
kind till after I had been actually married four or five months., I found
out then that what he had told me was perfectly true., And that sort of
thing makes a man so absolutely uninteresting., LADY HUNSTANTON., My dear!, MRS. ALLONBY., Men always want to be a woman?s first love., That is their
clumsy vanity., We women have a more subtle instinct about things., What
we like is to be a man?s last romance., LADY STUTFIELD., I see what you mean., It?s very, very beautiful., LADY HUNSTANTON., My dear child, you don?t mean to tell me that you won?t
forgive your husband because he never loved any one else?, Did you ever
hear such a thing, Caroline?, I am quite surprised., LADY CAROLINE., Oh, women have become so highly educated, Jane, that
nothing should surprise us nowadays, except happy marriages., They
apparently are getting remarkably rare., MRS. ALLONBY., Oh, they?re quite out of date., LADY STUTFIELD., Except amongst the middle classes, I have been told., MRS. ALLONBY., How like the middle classes!, LADY STUTFIELD., Yes?is it not?, ?very, very like them., LADY CAROLINE., If what you tell us about the middle classes is true,
Lady Stutfield, it redounds greatly to their credit., It is much to be
regretted that in our rank of life the wife should be so persistently
frivolous, under the impression apparently that it is the proper thing to
be., It is to that I attribute the unhappiness of so many marriages we
all know of in society., MRS. ALLONBY., Do you know, Lady Caroline, I don?t think the frivolity of
the wife has ever anything to do with it., More marriages are ruined
nowadays by the common sense of the husband than by anything else., How
can a woman be expected to be happy with a man who insists on treating
her as if she were a perfectly rational being?, LADY HUNSTANTON., My dear!, MRS. ALLONBY., Man, poor, awkward, reliable, necessary man belongs to a
sex that has been rational for millions and millions of years., ...]"|2

couldn?t get if he chose to ask for it., Of course, he is comparatively a
young man still, and he has only come to his title within?how long
exactly is it, Caroline, since Lord Illingworth succeeded?, LADY CAROLINE., About four years, I think, Jane., I know it was the same
year in which my brother had his last exposure in the evening newspapers., LADY HUNSTANTON., Ah, I remember., That would be about four years ago., Of course, there were a great many people between the present Lord
Illingworth and the title, Mrs. Arbuthnot., There was?who was there,
Caroline?, LADY CAROLINE., There was poor Margaret?s baby., You remember how anxious
she was to have a boy, and it was a boy, but it died, and her husband
died shortly afterwards, and she married almost immediately one of Lord
Ascot?s sons, who, I am told, beats her., LADY HUNSTANTON., Ah, that is in the family, dear, that is in the family., And there was also, I remember, a clergyman who wanted to be a lunatic,
or a lunatic who wanted to be a clergyman, I forget which, but I know the
Court of Chancery investigated the matter, and decided that he was quite
sane., And I saw him afterwards at poor Lord Plumstead?s with straws in
his hair, or something very odd about him., I can?t recall what., I often
regret, Lady Caroline, that dear Lady Cecilia never lived to see her son
get the title., MRS. ARBUTHNOT., Lady Cecilia?, LADY HUNSTANTON., Lord Illingworth?s mother, dear Mrs. Arbuthnot, was one
of the Duchess of Jerningham?s pretty daughters, and she married Sir
Thomas Harford, who wasn?t considered a very good match for her at the
time, though he was said to be the handsomest man in London., I knew them
all quite intimately, and both the sons, Arthur and George., MRS. ARBUTHNOT., It was the eldest son who succeeded, of course, Lady
Hunstanton?, LADY HUNSTANTON., No, dear, he was killed in the hunting field., Or was
it fishing, Caroline?, I forget., But George came in for everything., I
always tell him that no younger son has ever had such good luck as he has
had., MRS. ARBUTHNOT., Lady Hunstanton, I want to speak to Gerald at once., Might I see him?, Can he be sent for?, LADY HUNSTANTON., Certainly, dear., I will send one of the servants into
the dining-room to fetch him., I don?t know what keeps the gentlemen so
long., [_Rings bell_.], When I knew Lord Illingworth first as plain
George Harford, he was simply a very brilliant young man about town, with
not a penny of money except what poor dear Lady Cecilia gave him., She
was quite devoted to him., Chiefly, I fancy, because he was on bad terms
with his father., Oh, here is the dear Archdeacon., [_To Servant_.], It

I suppose, Gerald?, GERALD., Oh, no; my mother has been so good to me., No one ever had such
a mother as I have had., LORD ILLINGWORTH., I am quite sure of that., Still I should imagine that
most mothers don?t quite understand their sons., Don?t realise, I mean,
that a son has ambitions, a desire to see life, to make himself a name., After all, Gerald, you couldn?t be expected to pass all your life in such
a hole as Wrockley, could you?, GERALD., Oh, no!, It would be dreadful!, LORD ILLINGWORTH., A mother?s love is very touching, of course, but it is

inconstant is charming nowadays., MRS. ALLONBY., You have your looking-glass., LORD ILLINGWORTH., It is unkind., It merely shows me my wrinkles., MRS. ALLONBY., Mine is better behaved., It never tells me the truth., LORD ILLINGWORTH., Then it is in love with you., [_Exeunt_ SIR JOHN, LADY STUTFIELD, MR. KELVIL _and_ LORD ALFRED.], GERALD., [_To_ LORD ILLINGWORTH]  May I come too?, LORD ILLINGWORTH., Do, my dear boy., [_Moves towards with_ MRS. ALLONBY
_and_ GERALD.], [LADY CAROLINE _enters_, _looks rapidly round and goes off in opposite
direction to that taken by_ SIR JOHN _and_ LADY STUTFIELD.], MRS. ARBUTHNOT., Gerald!, GERALD., What, mother!, [_Exit_ LORD ILLINGWORTH _with_ MRS., ALLONBY.], MRS. ARBUTHNOT., It is getting late., ...]"|2
98|"[[GERALD ARBUTHNOT _writing at table_.], [_Enter_ ALICE R.C., _followed by_ LADY HUNSTANTON _and_ MRS., ALLONBY.], ALICE., Lady Hunstanton and Mrs. Allonby., [_Exit_ L.C.], LADY HUNSTANTON., Good morning, Gerald., GERALD., [_Rising_.], Good morning, Lady Hunstanton., Good morning, Mrs.
Allonby., LADY HUNSTANTON., [_Sitting down_.], We came to inquire for your dear
mother, Gerald., I hope she is better?, GERALD., My mother has not come down yet, Lady Hunstanton., LADY HUNSTANTON., Ah, I am afraid the heat was too much for her last
night., I think there must have been thunder in the air., Or perhaps it
was the music., Music makes one feel so romantic?at least it always gets
on one?s nerves., MRS. ALLONBY., It?s the same thing, nowadays., LADY HUNSTANTON., I am so glad I don?t know what you mean, dear., I am
afraid you mean something wrong., Ah, I see you?re examining Mrs.
Arbuthnot?s pretty room., Isn?t it nice and old-fashioned?, MRS. ALLONBY., [_Surveying the room through her lorgnette_.], It looks
quite the happy English home., LADY HUNSTANTON., That?s just the word, dear; that just describes it., One feels your mother?s good influence in everything she has about her,
Gerald., MRS. ALLONBY., Lord Illingworth says that all influence is bad, but that
a good influence is the worst in the world., LADY HUNSTANTON., When Lord Illingworth knows Mrs. Arbuthnot better he
will change his mind., I must certainly bring him here., MRS. ALLONBY., I should like to see Lord Illingworth in a happy English
home., LADY HUNSTANTON., It would do him a great deal of good, dear., Most women
in London, nowadays, seem to furnish their rooms with nothing but
orchids, foreigners, and French novels., But here we have the room of a
sweet saint., Fresh natural flowers, books that don?t shock one, pictures
that one can look at without blushing., MRS. ALLONBY., But I like blushing., LADY HUNSTANTON., Well, there _is_ a good deal to be said for blushing,
if one can do it at the proper moment., Poor dear Hunstanton used to tell
me I didn?t blush nearly often enough., But then he was so very
particular., He wouldn?t let me know any of his men friends, except those
who were over seventy, like poor Lord Ashton: who afterwards, by the way,
was brought into the Divorce Court., A most unfortunate case., MRS. ALLONBY., I delight in men over seventy., They always offer one the
devotion of a lifetime., I think seventy an ideal age for a man., LADY HUNSTANTON., She is quite incorrigible, Gerald, isn?t she?, By-the-by, Gerald, I hope your dear mother will come and see me more
often now., You and Lord Illingworth start almost immediately, don?t you?, GERALD., I have given up my intention of being Lord Illingworth?s
secretary., LADY HUNSTANTON., Surely not, Gerald!, It would be most unwise of you., What reason can you have?, GERALD., I don?t think I should be suitable for the post., MRS. ALLONBY., I wish Lord Illingworth would ask me to be his secretary., But he says I am not serious enough., LADY HUNSTANTON., My dear, you really mustn?t talk like that in this
house., Mrs. Arbuthnot doesn?t know anything about the wicked society in
which we all live., She won?t go into it., She is far too good., I
consider it was a great honour her coming to me last night., It gave
quite an atmosphere of respectability to the party., MRS. ALLONBY., Ah, that must have been what you thought was thunder in
the air., LADY HUNSTANTON., My dear, how can you say that?, There is no resemblance
between the two things at all., But really, Gerald, what do you mean by
not being suitable?, GERALD., Lord Illingworth?s views of life and mine are too different., LADY HUNSTANTON., But, my dear Gerald, at your age you shouldn?t have any
views of life., They are quite out of place., You must be guided by
others in this matter., Lord Illingworth has made you the most flattering
offer, and travelling with him you would see the world?as much of it, at
least, as one should look at?under the best auspices possible, and stay
with all the right people, which is so important at this solemn moment in
your career., GERALD., I don?t want to see the world: I?ve seen enough of it., MRS. ALLONBY., I hope you don?t think you have exhausted life, Mr.
Arbuthnot., ...]"|2

unless you love her also., You cannot honour me, unless she?s holier to
you., In her all womanhood is martyred., Not she alone, but all of us are
stricken in her house., GERALD., Hester, Hester, what shall I do?, HESTER., Do you respect the man who is your father?, GERALD., Respect him?, I despise him!, He is infamous., HESTER., I thank you for saving me from him last night., GERALD., Ah, that is nothing., I would die to save you., But you don?t
tell me what to do now!, HESTER., Have I not thanked you for saving _me_?, GERALD., But what should I do?, HESTER., Ask your own heart, not mine., I never had a mother to save, or
shame., MRS. ARBUTHNOT., He is hard?he is hard., Let me go away., GERALD., [_Rushes over and kneels down bedside his mother_.], Mother,
forgive me: I have been to blame., MRS. ARBUTHNOT., Don?t kiss my hands: they are cold., My heart is cold:
something has broken it., HESTER., Ah, don?t say that., Hearts live by being wounded., Pleasure may
turn a heart to stone, riches may make it callous, but sorrow?oh, sorrow
cannot break it., Besides, what sorrows have you now?, Why, at this
moment you are more dear to him than ever, _dear_ though you have _been_,
and oh!, how dear you _have_ been always., Ah!, be kind to him., GERALD., You are my mother and my father all in one., I need no second
parent., It was for you I spoke, for you alone., Oh, say something,
mother., Have I but found one love to lose another?, Don?t tell me that., O mother, you are cruel., [_Gets up and flings himself sobbing on a
sofa_.], MRS. ARBUTHNOT., [_To_ HESTER.], But has he found indeed another love?, HESTER., You know I have loved him always., MRS. ARBUTHNOT., But we are very poor., HESTER., Who, being loved, is poor?, Oh, no one., I hate my riches., They
are a burden., Let him share it with me., MRS. ARBUTHNOT., But we are disgraced., We rank among the outcasts Gerald
is nameless., The sins of the parents should be visited on the children., It is God?s law., HESTER., I was wrong., God?s law is only Love., MRS. ARBUTHNOT., [_Rises_, _and taking_ HESTER _by the hand_, _goes
slowly over to where_ GERALD _is lying on the sofa with his head buried
in his hands_., _She touches him and he looks up_.], Gerald, I cannot
give you a father, but I have brought you a wife., GERALD., Mother, I am not worthy either of her or you., MRS. ARBUTHNOT., So she comes first, you are worthy., And when you are
away, Gerald ., ., ., with ., ., ., her?oh, think of me sometimes., Don?t
forget me., And when you pray, pray for me., We should pray when we are
happiest, and you will be happy, Gerald., HESTER., Oh, you don?t think of leaving us?, GERALD., Mother, you won?t leave us?, MRS. ARBUTHNOT., I might bring shame upon you!, ...]"|2

each other?s waists_., GERALD _goes to table_ L.C., _for his hat_., _On
turning round he sees_ LORD ILLINGWORTH?S _glove lying on the floor_,
