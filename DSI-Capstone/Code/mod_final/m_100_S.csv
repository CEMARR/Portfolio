0,"[THIS little volume (the result of meditation and experience) is not
intended as an exhaustive treatise on the much-written-upon subject
of the power of thought., It is suggestive rather than explanatory,
its object being to stimulate men and women to the discovery and
perception of the truth that--

""They themselves are makers of themselves."", by virtue of the thoughts, which they choose and encourage; that
mind is the master-weaver, both of the inner garment of character
and the outer garment of circumstance, and that, as they may have
hitherto woven in ignorance and pain they may now weave in
enlightenment and happiness., AS A MAN THINKETH

THOUGHT AND CHARACTER


THE aphorism, ""As a man thinketh in his heart so is he,"" not only
embraces the whole of a man's being, but is so comprehensive as to
reach out to every condition and circumstance of his life., A man is
literally _what he thinks,_ his character being the complete sum of
all his thoughts., As the plant springs from, and could not be without, the seed, so
every act of a man springs from the hidden seeds of thought, and
could not have appeared without them., This applies equally to those
acts called ""spontaneous"" and ""unpremeditated"" as to those, which
are deliberately executed., Act is the blossom of thought, and joy and suffering are its fruits;
thus does a man garner in the sweet and bitter fruitage of his own
husbandry., ""Thought in the mind hath made us, What we are
  By thought was wrought and built., If a man's mind
  Hath evil thoughts, pain comes on him as comes
  The wheel the ox behind...., ..If one endure
  In purity of thought, joy follows him
  As his own shadow--sure."", Man is a growth by law, and not a creation by artifice, and cause
and effect is as absolute and undeviating in the hidden realm of
thought as in the world of visible and material things., A noble and
Godlike character is not a thing of favour or chance, but is the
natural result of continued effort in right thinking, the effect of
long-cherished association with Godlike thoughts., An ignoble and
bestial character, by the same process, is the result of the
continued harbouring of grovelling thoughts., Man is made or unmade by himself; in the armoury of thought he
forges the weapons by which he destroys himself; he also fashions
the tools with which he builds for himself heavenly mansions of joy
and strength and peace., By the right choice and true application of
thought, man ascends to the Divine Perfection; by the abuse and
wrong application of thought, he descends below the level of the
beast., Between these two extremes are all the grades of character,
and man is their maker and master., Of all the beautiful truths pertaining to the soul which have been
restored and brought to light in this age, none is more gladdening
or fruitful of divine promise and confidence than this--that man is
the master of thought, the moulder of character, and the maker and
shaper of condition, environment, and destiny., As a being of Power, Intelligence, and Love, and the lord of his own
thoughts, man holds the key to every situation, and contains within
himself that transforming and regenerative agency by which he may
make himself what he wills., Man is always the master, even in his weaker and most abandoned
state; but in his weakness and degradation he is the foolish master
who misgoverns his ""household."", When he begins to reflect upon his
condition, and to search diligently for the Law upon which his being
is established, he then becomes the wise master, directing his
energies with intelligence, and fashioning his thoughts to fruitful
issues., Such is the _conscious_ master, and man can only thus become
by discovering _within himself_ the laws of thought; which discovery
is totally a matter of application, self analysis, and experience., Only by much searching and mining, are gold and diamonds obtained,
and man can find every truth connected with his being, if he will
dig deep into the mine of his soul; and that he is the maker of his
character, the moulder of his life, and the builder of his destiny,
he may unerringly prove, if he will watch, control, and alter his
thoughts, tracing their effects upon himself, upon others, and upon
his life and circumstances, linking cause and effect by patient
practice and investigation, and utilizing his every experience, even
to the most trivial, everyday occurrence, as a means of obtaining
that knowledge of himself which is Understanding, Wisdom, Power., In
this direction, as in no other, is the law absolute that ""He that
seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened;"" for
only by patience, practice, and ceaseless importunity can a man
enter the Door of the Temple of Knowledge., EFFECT OF THOUGHT ON CIRCUMSTANCES


MAN'S mind may be likened to a garden, which may be intelligently
cultivated or allowed to run wild; but whether cultivated or
neglected, it must, and will, _bring forth._ If no useful seeds are
_put_ into it, then an abundance of useless weed-seeds will _fall_
therein, and will continue to produce their kind., Just as a gardener cultivates his plot, keeping it free from weeds,
and growing the flowers and fruits which he requires, so may a man
tend the garden of his mind, weeding out all the wrong, useless, and
impure thoughts, and cultivating toward perfection the flowers and
fruits of right, useful, and pure thoughts., By pursuing this
process, a man sooner or later discovers that he is the
master-gardener of his soul, the director of his life., He also
reveals, within himself, the laws of thought, and understands, with
ever-increasing accuracy, how the thought-forces and mind elements
operate in the shaping of his character, circumstances, and destiny., Thought and character are one, and as character can only manifest
and discover itself through environment and circumstance, the outer
conditions of a person's life will always be found to be
harmoniously related to his inner state., This does not mean that a
man's circumstances at any given time are an indication of his
_entire_ character, but that those circumstances are so intimately
connected with some vital thought-element within himself that, for
the time being, they are indispensable to his development., Every man is where he is by the law of his being; the thoughts which
he has built into his character have brought him there, and in the
arrangement of his life there is no element of chance, but all is
the result of a law which cannot err., This is just as true of those
who feel ""out of harmony"" with their surroundings as of those who
are contented with them., As a progressive and evolving being, man is where he is that he may
learn that he may grow; and as he learns the spiritual lesson which
any circumstance contains for him, it passes away and gives place to
other circumstances., Man is buffeted by circumstances so long as he believes himself to
be the creature of outside conditions, but when he realizes that he
is a creative power, and that he may command the hidden soil and
seeds of his being out of which circumstances grow, he then becomes
the rightful master of himself., That circumstances grow out of thought every man knows who has for
any length of time practised self-control and self-purification, for
he will have noticed that the alteration in his circumstances has
been in exact ratio with his altered mental condition., So true is
this that when a man earnestly applies himself to remedy the defects
in his character, and makes swift and marked progress, he passes
rapidly through a succession of vicissitudes., The soul attracts that which it secretly harbours; that which it
loves, and also that which it fears; it reaches the height of its
cherished aspirations; it falls to the level of its unchastened
desires,--and circumstances are the means by which the soul receives
its own., Every thought-seed sown or allowed to fall into the mind, and to
take root there, produces its own, blossoming sooner or later into
act, and bearing its own fruitage of opportunity and circumstance., Good thoughts bear good fruit, bad thoughts bad fruit., The outer world of circumstance shapes itself to the inner world of
thought, and both pleasant and unpleasant external conditions are
factors, which make for the ultimate good of the individual., As the
reaper of his own harvest, man learns both by suffering and bliss., Following the inmost desires, aspirations, thoughts, by which he
allows himself to be dominated, (pursuing the will-o'-the-wisps of
impure imaginings or steadfastly walking the highway of strong and
high endeavour), a man at last arrives at their fruition and
fulfilment in the outer conditions of his life., The laws of growth
and adjustment everywhere obtains., A man does not come to the almshouse or the jail by the tyranny of
fate or circumstance, but by the pathway of grovelling thoughts and
base desires., Nor does a pure-minded man fall suddenly into crime by
stress of any mere external force; the criminal thought had long
been secretly fostered in the heart, and the hour of opportunity
revealed its gathered power., Circumstance does not make the man; it
reveals him to himself No such conditions can exist as descending
into vice and its attendant sufferings apart from vicious
inclinations, or ascending into virtue and its pure happiness
without the continued cultivation of virtuous aspirations; and man,
therefore, as the lord and master of thought, is the maker of
himself the shaper and author of environment., Even at birth the soul
comes to its own and through every step of its earthly pilgrimage it
attracts those combinations of conditions which reveal itself, which
are the reflections of its own purity and, impurity, its strength
and weakness., Men do not attract that which they _want,_ but that which they _are._
Their whims, fancies, and ambitions are thwarted at every step, but
their inmost thoughts and desires are fed with their own food, be it
foul or clean., The ""divinity that shapes our ends"" is in ourselves;
it is our very self., Only himself manacles man: thought and action
are the gaolers of Fate--they imprison, being base; they are also
the angels of Freedom--they liberate, being noble., Not what he
wishes and prays for does a man get, but what he justly earns., His
wishes and prayers are only gratified and answered when they
harmonize with his thoughts and actions., In the light of this truth, what, then, is the meaning of ""fighting
against circumstances?"", It means that a man is continually revolting
against an _effect_ without, while all the time he is nourishing and
preserving its _cause_ in his heart., That cause may take the form of
a conscious vice or an unconscious weakness; but whatever it is, it
stubbornly retards the efforts of its possessor, and thus calls
aloud for remedy., Men are anxious to improve their circumstances, but are unwilling to
improve themselves; they therefore remain bound., The man who does
not shrink from self-crucifixion can never fail to accomplish the
object upon which his heart is set., This is as true of earthly as of
heavenly things., Even the man whose sole object is to acquire wealth
must be prepared to make great personal sacrifices before he can
accomplish his object; and how much more so he who would realize a
strong and well-poised life?, Here is a man who is wretchedly poor., He is extremely anxious that
his surroundings and home comforts should be improved, yet all the
time he shirks his work, and considers he is justified in trying to
deceive his employer on the ground of the insufficiency of his
wages., Such a man does not understand the simplest rudiments of
those principles which are the basis of true prosperity, and is not
only totally unfitted to rise out of his wretchedness, but is
actually attracting to himself a still deeper wretchedness by
dwelling in, and acting out, indolent, deceptive, and unmanly
thoughts., Here is a rich man who is the victim of a painful and persistent
disease as the result of gluttony., He is willing to give large sums
of money to get rid of it, but he will not sacrifice his gluttonous
desires., He wants to gratify his taste for rich and unnatural viands
and have his health as well., Such a man is totally unfit to have
health, because he has not yet learned the first principles of a
healthy life., Here is an employer of labour who adopts crooked measures to avoid
paying the regulation wage, and, in the hope of making larger
profits, reduces the wages of his workpeople., Such a man is
altogether unfitted for prosperity, and when he finds himself
bankrupt, both as regards reputation and riches, he blames
circumstances, not knowing that he is the sole author of his
condition., I have introduced these three cases merely as illustrative of the
truth that man is the causer (though nearly always is unconsciously)
of his circumstances, and that, whilst aiming at a good end, he is
continually frustrating its accomplishment by encouraging thoughts
and desires which cannot possibly harmonize with that end., Such
cases could be multiplied and varied almost indefinitely, but this
is not necessary, as the reader can, if he so resolves, trace the
action of the laws of thought in his own mind and life, and until
this is done, mere external facts cannot serve as a ground of
reasoning., Circumstances, however, are so complicated, thought is so deeply
rooted, and the conditions of happiness vary so, vastly with
individuals, that a man's entire soul-condition (although it may be
known to himself) cannot be judged by another from the external
aspect of his life alone., A man may be honest in certain directions,
yet suffer privations; a man may be dishonest in certain directions,
yet acquire wealth; but the conclusion usually formed that the one
man fails _because of his particular honesty,_ and that the other
_prospers because of his particular dishonesty,_ is the result of a
superficial judgment, which assumes that the dishonest man is almost
totally corrupt, and the honest man almost entirely virtuous., In the
light of a deeper knowledge and wider experience such judgment is
found to be erroneous., The dishonest man may have some admirable
virtues, which the other does, not possess; and the honest man
obnoxious vices which are absent in the other., The honest man reaps
the good results of his honest thoughts and acts; he also brings
upon himself the sufferings, which his vices produce., The dishonest
man likewise garners his own suffering and happiness., It is pleasing to human vanity to believe that one suffers because
of one's virtue; but not until a man has extirpated every sickly,
bitter, and impure thought from his mind, and washed every sinful
stain from his soul, can he be in a position to know and declare
that his sufferings are the result of his good, and not of his bad
qualities; and on the way to, yet long before he has reached, that
supreme perfection, he will have found, working in his mind and
life, the Great Law which is absolutely just, and which cannot,
therefore, give good for evil, evil for good., Possessed of such
knowledge, he will then know, looking back upon his past ignorance
and blindness, that his life is, and always was, justly ordered, and
that all his past experiences, good and bad, were the equitable
outworking of his evolving, yet unevolved self., Good thoughts and actions can never produce bad results; bad
thoughts and actions can never produce good results., This is but
saying that nothing can come from corn but corn, nothing from
nettles but nettles., Men understand this law in the natural world,
and work with it; but few understand it in the mental and moral
world (though its operation there is just as simple and
undeviating), and they, therefore, do not co-operate with it., Suffering is _always_ the effect of wrong thought in some direction., It is an indication that the individual is out of harmony with
himself, with the Law of his being., The sole and supreme use of
suffering is to purify, to burn out all that is useless and impure., Suffering ceases for him who is pure., There could be no object in
burning gold after the dross had been removed, and a perfectly pure
and enlightened being could not suffer., The circumstances, which a man encounters with suffering, are the
result of his own mental in harmony., The circumstances, which a man
encounters with blessedness, are the result of his own mental
harmony., Blessedness, not material possessions, is the measure of
right thought; wretchedness, not lack of material possessions, is
the measure of wrong thought., A man may be cursed and rich; he may
be blessed and poor., Blessedness and riches are only joined together
when the riches are rightly and wisely used; and the poor man only
descends into wretchedness when he regards his lot as a burden
unjustly imposed., Indigence and indulgence are the two extremes of wretchedness., They
are both equally unnatural and the result of mental disorder., A man
is not rightly conditioned until he is a happy, healthy, and
prosperous being; and happiness, health, and prosperity are the
result of a harmonious adjustment of the inner with the outer, of
the man with his surroundings., A man only begins to be a man when he ceases to whine and revile,
and commences to search for the hidden justice which regulates his
life., And as he adapts his mind to that regulating factor, he ceases
to accuse others as the cause of his condition, and builds himself
up in strong and noble thoughts; ceases to kick against
circumstances, but begins to _use_ them as aids to his more rapid
progress, and as a means of discovering the hidden powers and
possibilities within himself., Law, not confusion, is the dominating principle in the universe;
justice, not injustice, is the soul and substance of life; and
righteousness, not corruption, is the moulding and moving force in
the spiritual government of the world., This being so, man has but to
right himself to find that the universe is right; and during the
process of putting himself right he will find that as he alters his
thoughts towards things and other people, things and other people
will alter towards him., The proof of this truth is in every person, and it therefore admits
of easy investigation by systematic introspection and self-analysis., Let a man radically alter his thoughts, and he will be astonished at
the rapid transformation it will effect in the material conditions
of his life., ...]",100

facilitated through the idea of ice cream., How does ice cream figure in, ontologically speaking?, Why not simply a green tea flavored Oreo?, Were they afraid we would think it wasn??, ?t sweet?, Like that it was gonna be an Oreo that actually tasted like tea?, The natural hope is for a brand-crossover ice cream called Green Tea Ice Cream Oreo Ice Cream.But still I get it., Green Tea Ice Cream is delicious., Oreos are delicious., The idea of putting them together does not disgust me like the Double Delight Oreo series that combines orange/mango, raspberry/blueberry, and grape/peach., These taste like toothpaste., A cookie should not be refreshing.I was excited to try the Green Tea Ice Cream Oreo.They were sold to me by the ??????, (jin ???, about a pound) out of a bucket of individually packaged Oreos, which made me feel like I was buying a timeless staple-like grain.I was disappointed.It didn??, ?t taste anything like green tea flavored ice cream., Or green tea., Or ice cream., It tasted a little like mint., Like a parched Girl Scouts Grasshopper cookie., But I checked: it enthusiastically claimed itself to be green tea flavored ice cream flavored.Eat this cookie only if you

PointsTeam,Quick reminder: Under no circumstances can Mr. Trump be seen holding a Subway sandwich., As you may recall from our briefing in July, the standard size of six-inch and footlong Subway sandwiches are damning sources of scale., A photo of our candidate holding one of these sandwiches would provide concrete evidence to the claim his hands resemble those of an eleven year-old boy??, ?s.So far we??, ?ve done a great job of avoiding photo ops involving Subway., We can all recall times Mr. Trump has sent us to order his beloved Italian BMT on Italian Herbs & Cheese Subway sandwich., I don??, ?t need to remind you that photographic proof of our next president holding this sandwich would not only highlight his petite, non-presidential hands, but also his love for ???ethnic???, sandwiches, which wouldn??, ?t sit well with our base.Let??, ?s not rest on our laurels ???, surely, the media will soon connect the dots., Whether they find Trump eating Subway or not, I??, ?m sure they??, ?ll ask for comment., In case Trump??, ?s explicit avoidance of Subway is dredged up by the media, I??, ?ve compiled talking points to deflect any possible questions or critiques we may encounter.1., Subway is just as unhealthy as McDonald??, ?s.In preparation for Trump??, ?s eight-year stay in the White House, he??, ?s been following a healthy diet., One of the best diets., If needed, his doctor will provide a note proving this., This is the reason you won??, ?t find Trump eating Subway., It has nothing to do with the sandwich providing scale and highlighting his less-than-average hand size.If the media suggests this is an invalid claim, as Trump has been photographed eating food even more unhealthy than Subway, refer to Talking Point 2.2., Subway??, ?s bread contains Azodicarbonamide, the same chemical used to make yoga mats.Donald Trump will not eat anything that is also used to make yoga mats., Trump has never practiced yoga, an Indian ritual, ever in his life., If they want to see a politician get into a pretzel-shape, ask Hillary Clinton about her email!, Absolutely no reason that Trump would be scared to hold a Subway sandwich because his hands would look diminutive in comparison.If the media points out Subway??, ?s bread no longer contains Azodicarbonamide, refer to Talking Point 3.3., Mr. Trump prefers to support local businesses.A salt-of-the-Earth man like Trump does not eat at huge corporations like Subway., He eats at the same places Joe Everyman eats., Use this opportunity to plug a local business, claim that Donald loves to eat there., (Note: Cheryl, PLEASE check that the restaurant you plug is not a chain., How have you not heard of Bertucci???s?), This is a more than sufficient reason to avoid Subway ???, it has nothing to do with Trump??, ?s hands looking small while holding a Subway sandwich, and claiming otherwise is simply absurd.If the media identify photos of Donald consuming large corporate fast-food products such as McDonald??, ?s and KFC, refer to Talking Point 4.4., Mr. Trump will not associate with losers like Jared Fogle.Our next president will not be associated with convicted sex offender and former Subway spokesman, Jared Fogle, in any way., Donald Trump is our only presidential candidate of character, and values ???, values that do not align with Jared Fogle., (Do not mention the

history of the Universe into a single year, starting with the Big Bang at an estimated 13.8 billion years ago set at January 1st at midnight, and ending with this very second as the final, tiniest increment of time on December 31st., Much of the cosmic year passes before we actually reach the formation of Earth and appearance of the oldest known rocks within the first cosmic week of September, or 4 billion years ago., In contrast, the earliest hominids (10-12 million years ago) did not appear until the early afternoon of December 31st., Domestication of fire (400,000 years ago) about 15 cosmic minutes ago, and all of modern civilization (within 500 years) is compressed within the last second.The Cosmic Calendar is a useful tool, because it is really, really difficult to comprehend what a billion years means., By looking at the calendar, we realize that from a chronological aspect, human civilization has been incredibly insignificant., Looking at it a different way, we see that we are here because a combination and sequence of physical, chemical, and biological changes has allowed for ???us???, to happen.Let??, ?s look at early Earth, about 3.5 billion years ago., The atmosphere consisted mainly of carbon dioxide (CO2), ammonia (NH3), and methane (CH4), with just a trace amount of oxygen., A Google Image search of the phrase ??, ?Early Earth???, shows artist renditions featuring plenty of volcanoes and lightning., This is no place for humans, much less plants, reptiles, fish, or the nuclear fallout-surviving cockroach.It is in this environment that the first biomolecules appeared., There are a few different theories as to what drove their formation (Lightning!, Heat?, meteorite impact??), but either way, the first, simple bacterial cells probably formed about this time.Now, one of the major themes in ecology is the ??, ?ecological niche,???, which is defined as a specific, specialized role that an organism has in its habitat., No two species can occupy the same niche; one will almost always outcompete the other.As early Earth had abundant carbon dioxide, a life form appeared to occupy this niche, taking the abundant CO2 out of the air, and converting it to sugar and free oxygen.Sound familiar?, This is photosynthesis.These life forms, called cyanobacteria, or photosynthetic bacteria, were literal catalysts for atmospheric and oceanic change on Earth.1 The abundant amount of sunlight and carbon dioxide allowed for a massive increase and diversification of cyanobacteria, continuously taking up CO2, releasing oxygen, and being buried in sediment., At first, this increase in free oxygen had little effect on the composition of the atmosphere, due to the presence of compounds that can take up oxygen (oxygen sinks) such as hydrogen sulfide, or iron (converted to iron oxide)., After about 1.5 billion years, these sinks began to fill up, resulting in the increasing accumulation of free oxygen in the atmosphere.2This massive change in the composition of the atmosphere is known as the Great Oxygenation Event., It has also been called the Oxygen Catastrophe, Oxygen Crisis, even Oxygen Holocaust.If these names sound a bit dramatic, it??, ?s because it was an extremely dramatic event., As humans, we see the Oxygenation Event as a positive thing, as it made possible the development of higher plants and animals., However, oxygen was highly toxic to the abundant anaerobic bacteria living at this time, causing a massive die-off and retreat to oxygen-poor environments.There was another consequence of the ???rapid???, (remember, we are still on the scale of millions of years) and overwhelming change of the composition of Earth??, ?s atmosphere., It is well-known that CO2 and methane traps sunlight in the atmosphere to maintain a warm temperature, much like a greenhouse., Removal of carbon dioxide and oxidation of methane from the atmosphere took away the greenhouse effect, which resulted in a massive drop in temperature around 2.3 billion years ago, ushering in a complete snowball Earth-type ice age that lasted for several million years.Whoops., The exact dates and duration of these events is disputed,2 for example, opinions differ on the rates and oxygen concentrations, the major driving forces that resulted in the saturation of oxygen sinks, and the number of Snowball Earth events that occurred.There are a few takeaways here.1)	We commonly hear the phrase ??, ?Greenhouse Effect???, in a negative connotation., We do need some greenhouse gases to trap enough heat in the atmosphere so that Earth does not freeze over., But, please note that by the time humans came around, we likely had a sufficient greenhouse effect for our survival, so please do not use this as an argument for burning more fossil fuels.2)	The molecules that make up terrafirma, the ocean, and atmosphere are continuously interacting and reacting with one another., The fact that a buildup of free oxygen in the atmosphere caused a domino effect that resulted in Earth being a snowball for millions of years has suggested that we not underestimate the effect of even a small change in atmospheric composition., No matter what your elected officials tell you, CO2 is not just a ??, ?harmless plant food.??, ?33)	If we look at the current state of affairs,  we are literally reversing the Great Oxygenation Event., By burning fossil fuels, we are taking carbon from the ground, and releasing massive amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere., While some greenhouse effect is necessary, too much is what is causing the rising global temperatures that are wreaking havoc on our polar ice caps, and this leads to many, many things which threaten our livelihoods.I still maintain that the rise of cyanobacteria and the resulting changes that occurred were a good thing, since the most recent result was the development of human civilization., On the other hand, the Great Oxygenation Event did cause a mass extinction, killing off multitudes of critters that could not tolerate oxygen.Mass extinctions are a common, regular occurrence throughout Earth??, ?s history., The GOE was probably the earliest known mass extinction., There was a particularly devastating extinction at the end of the Permian Era (252 million years ago), which was also called the Great Dying., By the start of the subsequent Triassic period, about 96% of sea critters had died out, along with 70% of terrestrial critters.4 Probably the most famous mass extinction occurred at the Triassic-Jurassic period, which we know as that time in which all the dinosaurs died.We are currently in another mass extinction, which is being called the Holocene., There is overwhelming evidence that it is human-made, although for some reason politicians want to argue over that.A rather Circle-of-Life way of looking at Earth is the Gaia Hypothesis, which states that Earth is comprised of synergistic, self-regulating components that work as a whole to maintain life on the planet., It??, ?s a pretty neat way of looking at things., Simply put, all of the organisms, whether it be plants, animals, microbes, and fungi require the action of each other for the maintenance of optimal conditions.Along these lines, there is a second hypothesis that takes into account all of these mass extinctions, called the Medea Hypothesis., Medea was a figure in Greek mythology who killed her own children to get back at her unfaithful husband., I??, ?m not quite sure who is the unfaithful husband in this scenario, but the hypothesis states that Earth will every so often rid itself of higher forms of life, and return to a state where only single-celled organisms exist.5That brings us to our final takeaway:4)	 By figuring out what has happened in Earth??, ?s history, particularly what has shaped the planet for colonization by humans, we can develop strategies to either maintain control of these optimal ???Earth???, conditions, or use this knowledge to Terraform (make Earth-like) other planets., We will need this knowledge if in case we do end up mucking up Earth for human survival, or, that one day about 5 billion years down the road in which the sun will burn out, swell up, and engulf Mercury, Venus, and Earth., Mars will probably get away, the lucky bastard.On a last note, the answer to removal of excess CO2 and methane is not to introduce massive quantities of cyanobacteria into the environment., Cyanobacteria are quite toxic, and tend to spoil important ecosystems., 6 Don??, ?t do that.- -1  Water: The

7, 8, 10Regina George: 2, 5, 9An email blast goes out from the director of composition to all the adjuncts, graduate students, and temporary-contract full-time instructors who teach writing at a large state university., The director of composition is chipper about a professional development opportunity at a neighboring institution and he??, ?ll reserve space for any of the teacher-persons who want to go, the fee paid by the English Department., The invitation is for a workshop with a nationally recognized composition scholar, and the teachers can carpool., For teachers, professional development means a day without teaching, but a day spent talking about teaching, and this is a welcome and often productive change., Almost as an afterthought, the director of composition ends the email by saying anyone who would like to attend the workshop who teaches on that day should arrange for a substitute to teach their classes.If you??, ?ve never heard of substitute teachers for college classes, that??, ?s because they don??, ?t exist., A substitute is a teacher-person who goes from school to school, and from class to class, to sit in when the regular teacher has taken a day off., Since the students who attend high school, middle school, or elementary school are required by law to sit in those classrooms, the job of the substitute is to watch the kids, end of story., The teacher calls their principal and says they won??, ?t be coming in that day and the principal goes down the list until someone agrees to substitute., It??, ?s never been the teacher??, ?s responsibility.Professional development is important for teachers: professors go to conferences to stay relevant and to make contacts., It used to be that the university would pay for this, and that??, ?s still mostly true, though it??, ?s almost never the case for the kinds of teacher-persons who received the director of composition??, ?s email., The director of composition recognized that these were teacher-persons who needed professional development for different reasons., The adjuncts, the graduate students, and the temporary-contract full-time instructors were all in the same boat, valued for their semi-pro status, and the director of composition would escort them to the nationally recognized scholar like Scouts on their first camping trip., No one believes that the workshop attendees will ever achieve the heights of the national scholar, no matter what their potential, and in the meantime, they??, ?re still expected to adhere to university policy and to be sure the classes are being taught.The director of composition should have known more than anyone that it would be next to impossible for composition teachers to get substitutes for their classes, due to the number of them attending the workshop and the number of classes those teachers regularly taught., You see, there??, ?s no substitute pool for them to draw from, so they have to ask unpaid favors of each other, because they certainly can??, ?t ask the tenured professors, who have minimal contact with contingent faculty as they come and go from year to year., Despite the good intentions of the director of composition, the contingent teachers have been reminded that they can??, ?t pretend to claim the perks taken for granted by tenured professors and also do their jobs effectively.What college students buy with tuition dollars has changed, with a shift in the direction of the utility model of the public high school, with bodies in seats, and mandatory attendance., As a full-time teacher-person at a state university, I??, ?m asked to report on attendance, I have a required number of hours I??, ?m supposed to sit in the office I share with another professor who also has a required number of hours to spend there, and I??, ?m supposed to get a substitute if I know ahead of time that I??, ?m going to miss a class., I happen to believe, because I??, ?m an idealist, that students pay for an education, which is an abstract unquantifiable commodity., Meanwhile, administrators see tangibles that can be represented with numbers on spreadsheets: the number of students per department, the number of seats per class, the number of classes per semester., Whatever else we might say about student-persons, they are undoubtedly numbers, and they pay in dollars that can be divided, so that a class period that has been paid for must occur.When a student tells me they want to be a teacher I suggest they try substitute teaching., It doesn??, ?t cost anything, one doesn??, ?t need a license, and there??, ?s no prep., They only work the days they want to work and if they are even semi-competent, the schools will keep calling them back., For my own part, I had good experiences as a substitute teacher., It let me know that I was able to go into a classroom where I was greeted with extremely low expectations, yet I could trick the students into learning despite themselves., Anyone who thinks they want to teach will get a pretty quick sense of whether they still want to teach after they??, ?ve tried substituting.As sensible as this sounds, this suggestion, that a student should try substituting is almost always greeted by the student with disdain., We tend to think of ourselves as better than substitutes, even those with no teaching experience., And so asking someone to be a substitute for a college class only works if that teacher is already in a position that comes with a degree of disrespect., By comparison, instead of asking ??, ?Will you be the substitute for my classes????, a contingent teacher might try out some of these equivalent phrases on their colleagues: ??, ?Will you babysit my child?, Will you be a server at my wedding?, Will you pick up my mom from the airport????, The only reason I need a substitute for my classes is because the director of composition told me I did, and the only reason the director of composition told me I did was because the university administration, a.k.a., the numbers people, told the director that I did.I??, ?m in a position that comes with disrespect, though my students don??, ?t really know it, because whether I go to a workshop for faculty development or not, I??, ?m a professional., Sometimes, the students who turn their noses up at the suggestion that they try substitute teaching will say, ??, ?I don??, ?t want to teach high school., I want to do what you do., I want to teach college.??, ?I tell them that if they teach in the public secondary or elementary schools they??, ?ll have better job security and will likely be paid more., They might have to deal with student discipline or with standardized tests, but maybe that??, ?s not such a big deal., Maybe it just is., It??, ?s teaching after all., It??, ?s a calling.Blind faith in the capitalist meritocracy makes it surprising for a student to hear that a professor with a Ph.D. can make less than a teacher with a bachelor??, ?s degree, someone they might think of as more like a smart mom than a scholar., But at the end of the school year that teacher won??, ?t be let go simply because her contract has run out., She??, ?ll almost automatically be kept on the payroll, and she??, ?ll be given a raise., At public secondary or elementary schools it??, ?s easier to keep someone around than to do a new job search, so even without tenure there??, ?s almost always job security., At institutions of higher education, however, they pretty much always run job searches, even when they have someone they want to keep around., A professor on a temporary contract might be asked to reapply for the job they already have, or their renewable contract could be replaced with one that is nonrenewable, because the rules can change without warning.I cancel class to attend the workshop for faculty development, I make no attempt to get a substitute, and no one complains., I get to the workshop early and the director of composition sits at the table with me., By the end of the day, I think the director of composition has a better idea of me as a teacher than the impression I give shuffling through the halls exhausted between classes., It??, ?s a small triumph, since my contract will run out and a younger less-experienced teacher-person will soon take my place, very likely someone who won??, ?t question the absurdity of being asked to find a substitute for a college class.Numbers people are numbers people., They??, ?re going to do what they??, ?re paid to do., They don??, ?t sit in classrooms and most have never taught., ...]",100

Christianity, a fact that the Church covered up, as it opposed their male chauvinistic agenda.Debunking Claim: Only certain Gnostic Gospels purport this belief and such texts are specious at best, hence why they weren??, ?t incorporated into the Bible., Jesus???, thoughts on the role of women in the Christianity aligned with those of the Church.Rebunking Claim: Jesus favored Mary Magdalene because he felt a direct kinship with her., Mary was a prostitute, a woman who sought the patronage and money of others so that her pimp wouldn??, ?t kill her., Jesus was a proselytizer, a man who sought the patronage and money of others so that his pimp, God, wouldn??, ?t kill him., This is all the more obvious when you realize the Gospel of John is more correctly translated as the Gospel of A John.- -Conspiracy Claim: Not only was she favored, the Gnostic Gospel of Philip refers to Mary Magdalene as Jesus???, partner, proving that the two were married and might have had children., The bloodline of Christ may very well still exist.Debunking Claim: Not only is that text not considered canonical by the Church, the Greek term that supposedly describes Mary as Jesus???, ???partner???, actually refers to a partnership in faith or business, not a romantic or sexual relationship.Rebunking Claim: The Da Vinci Code, a best-selling novel and best-Tom Hanksing film, develops this conspiracy theory in such detail that it is impossible not to draw one obvious conclusion: Dan Brown, author of The Da Vinci Code, is Jesus???, living descendant., If you don??, ?t immediately take my

39,"[?s a lot of students, and a lot of classes, and a lot of papers, and, ironically, while Scribis mundani don??, ?t mind that work, since it comes with the territory, they also tend not to be the ones to do it, since there aren??, ?t enough Scribis mundani to go around, because they are usually hired into administrative positions where they are put in charge of the English teachers who do teach all of those composition students, almost universally the contingent faculty, hired on short-term contracts, as well as the graduate students with teaching assignments, the graduate school??, ?s version of the athletic scholarship., These ???temporary???, teachers can come from any of the three English teacher types, it doesn??, ?t matter, though the hierarchy persists in who gets hired out of these labor-intensive paper-grading coal mines into full-time tenure-track or ???permanent???, positions., Although most of the power is consolidated among the scholar-types, Scribis mundani do quite well for being the newest field with the smallest number of representatives, because they are put in charge of the army of contingent teachers, which can be anywhere from 1/3 to 2/3s of the English instructors in a department., Composition Ph.Ds., further heighten their stature in the broader field of English by claiming minor twentieth-century philosophers and theorists as their own, just as that philosopher has peaked in scholarly attention, especially those who had no interest or awareness of English composition as a field of study when they were alive., As these things go, a famous thinker will become all the rage, inspiring change in writing classrooms populated by nineteen-year-olds all over America, and the same papers (sometimes literally; thank you, plagiarism!), about the same tired subjects, will be graded by the rotating ranks of underpaid disrespected contingent faculty with the current popular philosopher in mind, to shift again five years later, when there??, ?s a new pedagogical trend (there??, ?s that word and they love it!, ).Scribis mundani often start out as Libris scholares, passionate about literature, but then when they find themselves in the classroom they encounter a new love, and they also figure out that it??, ?s easier to get a job as a Scribis mundanus, where scholarship may not even matter, since an administrator who can train, schedule, and speak for all of the underpaid temporary faculty is indeed valued and compensated., Ironically, these teacher-types, Scribis mundani, who love the classroom so much they actually study it and write about it, have fewer classes as a direct result of their administrative work, with enough course releases to get them down to one or two classes per semester., Life as a tenured English composition professor often includes: leadership in the department, a demonstrated love of teaching, and a light course load without much expectation for scholarship., It??, ?s also a field that??, ?s pretty wide open for new subjects ???, so one can see the attraction., Unfortunately, Scribis mundani may learn they either don??, ?t like or aren??, ?t suited for administrative work, except that they??, ?re stuck in it., Scribis mundani believe that literature has no utility, and they have tried to shift the focus of English studies to something more practical (pedagogy!, ), if only in the short term, if only for the self-perpetuating activity of teaching teachers about teaching.The last type of English professor, the artist-type, or Scribis artifex???, Oh boy, where to begin?, In our society you can??, ?t go around calling yourself an artist unless free market capitalism has made you rich enough to make your art your full-time job, such that there are little objects being consumed, either physical or digital, with your name on them., Those who teach prose-writing or poetry-writing at universities, as poets and/or fiction or nonfiction writers, can sometimes achieve financial security, not as a result of the popularity of their art, but by their integrity as artists, by which they might land a sweet (but very rare) tenure-track job., In order to find oneself on the tenure-track as Scribis artifex, however, one must have nearly achieved that nearly impossible pinnacle, self-sufficient artist, or to be born or married into financial independence, or to have married into the English department by partnering with another English professor with a tenure-track job.There are a lot of Scribis artifegum out there, and the work is fulfilling, since their writing is read outside of universities and the literature they are most likely to teach is contemporary., Scribis artifegum are very good writers and editors who may volunteer their time at literary journals or in writer??, ?s communities, but most often Scribis artifegum will be hired into low-paying ???temporary???, positions to be told how to teach by Scribis mundani, to be looked down upon by Libris scholares, and to grade all of those papers produced by the nineteen-year-olds forced to take English composition., One can eek out an existence in this way for quite some time, by moving from college to college, and from city to city, by agreeing to teach on short-term contracts while working on their poems, novels, stories, essays, plays, and screenplays., And Scribis artifex may very well

audience feel as unsafe as possible; and thus we use every moment of Theatre as an opportunity to betray our audience??, ?s trust.The Dien Bien Phu Experimental Theatre Company has redefined the frontiers of theatre, time and time again., Take for instance, our recreation of the American ???classic,???, The Music Man., Perhaps you heard about the 15-minute sexual assault scene that we added to our production, which lasted right up to intermission., Perhaps you also heard that this intermission was signaled only by all of our actors freezing in place throughout the house, forcing the audience to squeeze past us as they exited to the lobby where they could buy soft drinks from the concession stand that we decorated as a dead Osama Bin Laden.We are nothing if not a thoughtful group, dedicated to the craft of performing stage combat that we never rehearse ???, with actual knives., And we continue to explore new ways to incorporate MIXED MEDIA into our performances ???, such as our projection of actual surgery footage onto our re-imagining of Mary Poppins., Furthermore, we usually forbid an actor to take the stage unless he/she is already crying., And of course, dogs., Lots and lots of untrained dogs are always in our shows.This is the future of Theatre., This is what the people need to see., Not actors speaking to each other, standing at a safe distance from the audience., But rather actors screaming words directly into the faces of the audience members, until they respond., The world does not need more Theatre on a stage, but rather more Art that takes place after an audience has been dragged into a parking lot, forced to lie down in each parking space, and doused with gasoline so it Knows How It Feels To Be An American Automobile., And of course, our Society does not need more actors saying what is written on a page, but rather a Theatre company dedicated to saying whatever it wants on stage at all times, completely freed from the tyranny of ??, ?the script.??, ?Perhaps you recall the instance one of our cast members ??, ?had a seizure.???, The terror, the confusion, the total commitment the rest of our cast displayed!, We convinced you, did we

many thousands, is about to sail off the precipice of the teaching profession into a free fall of unemployment for the unforeseeable future, out of no fault of his own, but because someone in an expensive suit with a large corner office decided that at least one third of the teachers at this university, the same as any given university, should be temporary, and in this case, nonrenewable., So

perhaps she doesn??, ?t have any friends, or a phone., She doesn??, ?t even have a deadbolt on her front door, for heaven??, ?s sake., All she has is the gun., That, apparently, is a perfectly good substitute for rational thinking, according to Glock., Who needs a sound mind and a range of options when you have 16 bullets?And who needs love, either?, Or empathy, or tolerance?, Those are all things that will get you killed, because according to the gun lobby there are a lot of bad guys out there., The bad guy is a staple of firearms marketing ???, indeed, the entire ad campaign of any non-hunting or -sporting gun evaporates unless you assume his existence and proximity.Compared to the stalker in the Glock ad, this promotional video from Smith & Wesson (manufacturer of the semiautomatic rifle used in the Aurora, Colorado theatre shooting, gives us very little information about the people who are presumably about to be shot down., We see camouflage-clad men pointing rifles in a swamp., We see police officers pointing their guns across the hood of their car., We see a husband pull a gun from a nightstand while his wife cowers in the bed., We don??, ?t know who is about to die, but the assumption is that they deserve it., If you don??, ?t accept that premise, most gun ads are simply footage of people preparing to commit murder.By encouraging the belief that there are many circumstances under which it??, ?s acceptable for the average person to point a loaded weapon at a living human being, gun makers and seller are preaching the opposite of love: they??, ?re teaching unreasoning hatred., The premise of ads like Glock??, ?s and Smith & Wesson??, ?s is that guns are necessary tools because there are people out there who aren??, ?t merely bad, but who deserve summary execution., Lots of them, and we are all at risk of encountering them in our daily lives.It takes a special breed of salesman to traffic in that kind of ethical brainwashing ???, people like NRA Vice President Wayne LaPierre, who makes $985,000 per year to say things like ???Riots., Terrorists., Gangs., Lone criminals., These are perils we are sure to face ???, not just maybe,???, and ??, ?there is no greater freedom than the right to survive and protect our families with all the rifles, shotguns, and handguns we want.???, LaPierre personifies the American firearms trade: white, male, insulated from risk by his status and wealth, he is also increasingly angry, paranoid, and irrational ???, in public, in the course of doing his job, as an official mouthpiece of the industry., Sometimes I wonder what happened to LaPierre, what trauma he suffered to make him so angry that he feels justified using the deaths of twenty kindergartners to advocate for more gun sales., Then I recall the research showing that the mere presence of guns make us more aggressive, more paranoid., And I think LaPierre may simply be a victim of his own salesmanship.He is no exception;

then it gave the phone number for a hotline for runaway kids., (Cell phones didn??, ?t yet exist and pay phones were still common, so the quarter was to make the phone call., )As it happened, the quarter in my baggie had a little hole drilled in it, right through George Washington??, ?s head., I put it on my key ring, thinking it would truly become my ??, ?emergency quarter???, ???, the coin I would use when I was literally down to my last 25 cents., Nearly three decades later, that quarter has been around the world with me, and it??, ?s still on my key ring., I like that., It??, ?s dated 1981, which means it was circulating for six years before it got to me., It has now spent nearly five times that long on my key ring.Because of the little divot that??, ?s been taken out of it, it no longer weighs as much as a regular quarter, so I??, ?m not sure it would even work in a pay phone or other coin-operated vending machines., I actually have some vintage coin-operated gadgets in my apartment, so I suppose I could put the quarter in one of those to see if it works, but I??, ?d rather not know., Sometimes the question is more interesting than the answer.- -Submit your key ring

50,"[?Hey, this gender thing doesn??, ?t seem fair., How come they get to vote, own property, and go to college and we don???t???, ?No, Mary Wollstonecraft was not the first feminist., That??, ?s like saying she was the first woman; it??, ?s just not possible or rational, and negates the thoughts and opinions of many who came before her.It??, ?s slightly more accurate to say that Mary Wollstonecraft was the first modern feminist., I don??, ?t know that I??, ?m always entirely clear about what that means, either, except that putting the word ???modern???, in there helps us see that her brand of feminism (though they hadn??, ?t yet coined the term when she lived) is recognizable to us today.Not only recognizable, but almost eerily similar., Wollstonecraft was an essayist, novelist, and translator; her best-known work is A Vindication of the Rights of Woman, in which she attributes gender disparities in part ??, ?to a false system of education, gathered from the books written on this subject by men who, considering females rather as women than human creatures, have been more anxious to make them alluring mistresses than affectionate wives and rational mothers; and the understanding of the sex has been so [cheated] by this???, that the civilized women of the present century, with a few exceptions, are only anxious to inspire love, when they ought to cherish ambition, and by their abilities and virtues exact respect.??, ?And if you think that??, ?s not still true, you haven??, ?t watched enough reality TV., I have yet to see an episode of The Bachelor in which the group dates are about which woman is the best reader or most respected mathematician.Isn??, ?t it frustrating to see that we are STILL working on issues that Wollstonecraft wrote about so eloquently over 200 years ago?This is just one reason Mary Wollstonecraft should be pretty pissed off.Wollstonecraft??, ?s ideas lurked in shadows for a long time because after she died her husband tried to do a nice thing., Damn him, anyway.A Vindication of the Rights of Woman was controversial but overall quite well-received., After Wollstonecraft died, her husband, William Godwin, wrote Memoirs of the Author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman., It was a sweet gesture, wanting her to be immortalized that way, but in the book Godwin revealed what few had known, namely that Wollstonecraft had never married the father of her first daughter, Fanny, and had only reluctantly married Godwin after becoming pregnant with her second daughter, Mary.So, Wollstonecraft has another reason to be pretty pissed off: Details about her personal life soiled her reputation to the point of nearly derailing the feminist movement for a time., (This is not to discount other feminist voices, only to emphasize that Wollstonecraft was perhaps the loudest and best-known, therefore any backlash against her would certainly make others shy away from making similar arguments, lest their own personal lives be trotted out for everyone to judge., )If you??, ?re wondering, William Godwin??, ?s considerable reputation as a thinker and writer suffered only minimally for revelations that his child with Wollstonecraft was conceived out of wedlock, to which Wollstonecraft would surely exclaim, ???Yes!, My point exactly!, This is what I??, ?ve been writing about in all of my work!, A double standard exists that is destructive and dangerous to both men and women!??, ?I doubt that she would have used that many exclamation points, but I got excited and editorialized it for her.The final reason (well, the last one I have time to mention here) for Wollstonecraft to be pretty pissed off is also the final irony of her life., When Wollstonecraft gave birth to her second daughter, she was assisted by a female midwife., All was well, except that Wollstonecraft did not deliver the placenta., Because of new (for the time) standards for medical practice dictating that doctors should have specific types of degrees, and because women were excluded from higher education, the number of female midwives dropped as the number of college-educated male doctors rose., Combine this fact with a lack of knowledge about germs and Wollstonecraft ends up with a male doctor at her bedside who uses his unwashed hands to try to remove the placenta, and days later Wollstonecraft dies of infection.Cruel irony, to be sure., But Mary Wollstonecraft has the last laugh, because the very daughter she died giving birth to would go on to become Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin Shelley, author of Frankenstein and fierce feminist in her own right., With thanks to Daniele Dickerson and Sean Pessin- -The game is quite simple., Each participant, starting with the youngest, names a novel published

middle-aged, American, atheistic, liberal, or unfunny., Take a ninth bonus drink if the protagonist and author are male, white, straight, middle-aged, American, atheistic, liberal, and unfunny., Take a tenth bonus drink if the protagonist has all of these characteristics, and is also kind of whiny.19., Instead of a novel, it??, ?s ??, ?creative nonfiction.???20., A character is reading/writing a book of greater literary merit than the book in which s/he is a character., Take an extra drink if there??, ?s no way this character would be reading/writing that book., Take a third drink if the book the character is reading/writing has nothing to do with the book in which its author is a character.21., If the novel is by a man, the main female character is down to earth, or hot., Drink remainder of your bottle if she is both., Drink additional bottle if male protagonist ends up sleeping with her at some point.22., If the story is by a woman, the main female character is astonishingly superior to everyone around her., Drink remainder of your bottle if, at the end of the novel, she experiences an important personal awakening.23., A common phrase in a foreign language is set in italics and then immediately translated.24., A character attends an elite educational institution, but is too smart for it.25., The story endlessly details historical events that nobody cares about.26., There are Nazis.27., There is a disproportionate number of Jewish Americans.28., The story is set during a genocide, any genocide., If the author is from a nation or people totally unconnected to the genocide, drink until alcohol poisoning is induced in all participants.29., A character apologizes for the story??, ?s conceit.30., There are footnotes.31., There are quotes from Wittgenstein., If the quotes are not obviously misused, refrain from this drink (n.b., : this is highly likely).32., A plot element relies on misunderstood theoretical physics.33., The book is set in New York., Take an extra drink if it??, ?s set in Manhattan., Take three extra drinks if it??, ?s set in Brooklyn.34., The protagonist has writer??, ?s block.35., The book is by Paul Auster.36., An animal is very important to

if you??, ?ve read Virginia Woolf??, ?s writing, you??, ?ve probably gotten the sense (as I have) that she was a bit pissed off during her lifetime., She hid it well most of the time, under a proper English Victorian-on-her-way-to-being-Modern veneer., But she was awfully ticked, I think, that the generation before her still had what she felt were old-fashioned expectations, that society was making such slow progress toward equality for women, that there was such trauma in her personal life as well as the world at large, and more.Virginia Woolf, were she still alive, or somehow able to see and hear our world today, would be pissed that talk of her death so often precedes (and sometimes eclipses) talk of her work and her life.In her February 17, 1922 diary, Woolf writes, ??, ?I meant to write about death, only life came breaking in as usual.???, The opposite happens when people today talk about Woolf, as though they mean to talk about life, only death comes breaking in.Yes, she killed herself in 1941, when she was 59 years old., She filled her pockets with stones and walked into the river., It??, ?s tragic, and by no means do I intend to brush it off as insignificant, but it??, ?s not the only compelling thing about her.Adeline Virginia Stephen Woolf was born in 1882 to well-known and highly intellectual parents with a blended family., Woolf suffered greatly when she was 13 years old and her mother died; two years later her half-sister died, and seven years after that her father died., Woolf suffered ???breakdowns???, throughout her life, and was diagnosed with manic-depressive, bipolar affective disorder, and bipolar disorder, depending on who you ask and which generation they are a part of.Woolf married Leonard Woolf in 1912, and had an affair with Vita Sackville-West in 1922., The book Orlando is usually read as a love letter to Vita.Woolf wrote nine novels, six short story collections, three biographies, fourteen nonfiction books, seven autobiographies, one drama, one translation, and many prefaces, letters, and diaries., All of this while not only surviving two world wars, but being in great distress during World War II, after the Woolfs???, London home was destroyed in the Blitz and there was considerable danger for Leonard, who was Jewish.Cheery, no?, We needn??, ?t wonder why she may have been pissed off while alive.I think our focus on Woolf??, ?s death occurs because we??, ?re uncomfortable with her uncertainty or her ambiguity, or the way she draws out our own uncertainties and ambiguities., We can??, ?t categorize her, even though at first glance there are many categories for her: Modernist, feminist, Bloomsbury, writer, suicide, bisexual, and more., But just dip a finger below the surface and you??, ?re beset with contradictions.In our time as our understanding of things like sexuality and gender, age, what constitutes news, our understanding of media and its reputability (or lack thereof), becomes more fluid, both more and less complicated, and our definition of humanity broadens and deepens, we owe it to ourselves to read and appreciate Virginia Woolf., She was 100 years ahead of us in her ideas and experimentation., We should be running to catch up instead of letting her pass by while we chatter on about her death.If this sounds like a giant advertisement for Woolf, well, good., If I made a kerbillion dollars (which I??, ?m sure is coming any day now, since most teachers and writers live the high life), I??, ?d have purchased a 30-second slot during the Super Bowl to say READ VIRGINIA WOOLF., SHE WAS PISSED THEN AND SHE??, ?S PISSED NOW BECAUSE IT IS TAKING FOREVER FOR US TO CATCH UP TO HER., Oh, and STOP FOCUSING FIRST AND ONLY ON HER DEATH.Yes, it??, ?d be in all caps because it??, ?s a proclamation that deserves to be shouted.As connected as I feel to Woolf when I read her work, few things terrify me more than the idea of actually speaking with her., I??, ?m sure I??, ?d be in such awe that I wouldn??, ?t be able to form a complete sentence., Still, when the ??, ?Who, living or dead, would you have a beer with if you could???, question becomes reality (as I know it will), I might still dare to choose Virginia Woolf, for the pleasure of listening to her kick my ass., My fellow Americans, as I have crisscrossed this country, one thing has become clear., When it comes to religion, we are a nation of true believers., But there are so many faiths, and as a candidate, picking the wrong one might be the difference between you trusting me with your vote, and choosing one of my opponents., And that is why I stand before you today as the only candidate with the conviction to say what is in my heart, what is deep in the core of my being: that it is YOUR faith that informs everything I say or do.I know what you are thinking., I have that wrong., It should be MY faith informs everything I say or do., But I did not misspeak., Rather than do the arrogant thing as my opponents do and tell you my beliefs, I will wait for you to tell me what you believe, then magically believe it as well., ...]",100

California with his parents and sister in the late nineties., In 2009, he graduated from the University of California-San Diego where he studied literature and writing., Castillo helped organize ??, ?Lectric Collective, an art and poetry collaboration in the Bay Area, and he was a founding editor of Vertebrae., He has lived in Oceanside, La Jolla, Oakland, San Francisco, and Iowa City, where he received an MFA in poetry from the University of Iowa.Castillo recently spoke over email with McSweeney??, ?s editors Dominic Luxford and Jesse Nathan about his first book, Remains, the tenth collection in the McSweeney??, ?s Poetry Series.- - -McSWEENEY??, ?S: Who are you writing for?JES?, ?S CASTILLO: I guess I imagine I??, ?m writing for someone like myself: someone who needs solitude from time to time to stay sane., Who lives in the fragmented flux of the post-industrial, computerized world, and takes comfort and nourishment from books.McSWEENEY??, ?S: How did the form for Remains develop?CASTILLO: When I was twenty-three, I read Ron Silliman for the first time, and that??, ?s also when I read Ben Lerner??, ?s elegant and instructive Mean Free Path., The way Silliman and Lerner used the book (each in distinct ways) as the measure for structuring a poem was really exciting to me, and it made me want to write a book-length poem., I was excited by the idea of finding a form that could sustain its momentum for a long time and contain potentially any subject., The serial structure seemed ideal, a long poem that advanced via self-sustaining sections that complemented each other.I came about the poem??, ?s actual form, which is fairly simple, sort of by chance., I guess the interesting part is that I wrote the poem on index cards., For the two years that I spent writing it, I carried a stack of twenty or so index cards wherever I went, and whenever I saw, read, or experienced something that made me think of a line, I would take out a card and fill it out, usually in one go, writing intuitively without stopping until the card was filled., Each card constituted a section., Writing on index cards meant I could carry my materials easily wherever I went., I wrote plenty of sections sitting at a desk or a table, but I also wrote many in transit, at parties, on walks, and so on., With the index cards taking care of the poem??, ?s formal unity, I was free to just focus on filling them out., And because the cards weren??, ?t bound, I could more easily think of each as its own separate entity or field, its own small world., And so I felt free to experiment within each one, to try out different modes of voice and formal tricks, trusting they were all part of the same poem, the same book.I came across Jack Spicer??, ?s lectures when I was about half way through writing Remains., I like his description of the serial poem as a poem that could virtually go on forever, or until the poet dies or gets sick of writing the poem., I think another thing that ends a potentially endless poem is when the feeling that engendered the poem ends or changes, in other words when the poet??, ?s worldview changes significantly from the one he had when he started the poem., Then it is no longer the same poem., I think that??, ?s more or less what happened with Remains., Had I stayed the same person, retained the way of seeing the world that I had when I started writing the poem, I might??, ?ve kept going with it, but that didn??, ?t happen., Maybe there is a way to build into a long poem the ability to evolve, so it can live and stay the same poem even as significant changes in its worldview occur., Or maybe you just need an expansive enough external structure that can contain multiple such changes within it., You can do it with a large enough narrative concept of course, but to do it without relying on narrative is a different feat.McSWEENEY??, ?S: Do you read a lot of poetry?CASTILLO: When I was writing Remains, I was reading a lot of poetry., Right now, not so much., I don??, ?t think it??, ?s necessarily good to always be reading a lot of poetry though., I think even if you??, ?re writing poetry, it??, ?s good to read variously, not just poetry and literature., There are times for me when reading poetry feels important and necessary, like when I??, ?m looking to learn or steal from other poets, for example, or when I want to read something that will refocus me and make me feel more present in the world, but sometimes other kinds of reading are more pressing or interesting., Or life is more pressing, and reading superfluous.McSWEENEY??, ?S: The style seems plainspoken., Is that accurate, do you think?, And if so, how did you arrive at it?CASTILLO: I think to a degree, that??, ?s accurate, yeah, though there are many parts in the book that don??, ?t sound to me like plainspoken language., It was all probably mostly unconscious., A friend once said to me that poets must use the language of their socialization., I think there??, ?s a lot of truth to that., I wrote Remains in the style that felt most natural to me., In other words, a style I didn??, ?t think about or make much of an effort to create., One reason I don??, ?t like a lot of contemporary poetry is that I find it too solipsistic and cryptic., My only conscious stylistic goal has always been to not write like that., The subject matter and context of a line can be mysterious, but the feelings in it, the intentions behind it (multiple and contradictory though they may be) should be clear.McSWEENEY??, ?S: How connected to Mexico do you feel?CASTILLO: I feel very connected to Mexico, but also disconnected from it in many ways., I also feel very connected to the United States, and disconnected from it in many ways as well., ...]",100

Wisdom to open., In especially cold weather, the scene may resemble a Depression-era soup kitchen line.On the bright side, the .07% of students who are accepted will soon be rewarded with Honors Gym and similar distinguish-ments., The others will struggle to come to terms with their perceived stupidity., The proctors will find other work, the administrators will collect $100,000+ in exam fees, and the student volunteers probably still won??, ?t have enough service credit to impress colleges.Am I exaggerating?, Not at all.Am I ungrateful?, Possibly.To be fair, I??, ?ve always felt a little bit like an outsider., First of all, the aforementioned .07% will consist almost entirely of White and Asian students., There might be one hijabi in the incoming class, and when I pass her in the third floor hallway months later I will smile and greet her because I know her already, I know her and the long sleeves she will wear in gym class and the role she will play during the ??, ?Islam Unit???, and the role she will play always and the questions she will have to answer and the teachers that will always, always mistake her for me.Second of all ???, and I am slightly ashamed to admit this ???, I only took the entrance exam because my mother bribed me., I knew nothing about my school at the time., My entire specialized high school experience is the product of an ill-conceived desire, many years ago, for a pair of Kenneth Cole ballet flats.Do I regret it?, I honestly don??, ?t know., I haven??, ?t sampled the Unspecial life.Can I still be bribed with a good pair of shoes?, Absolutely.I think that a majority of both the Gifted and the Ordinary can agree upon the general unpleasantness of gym class., In fact, up until this semester, I have maintained a long-held and well-justified hatred of all things PE related., (Do basketballs care about the fact that I have other non-fitness related marketable skills?, Do hockey sticks duly take my religious/ethnic minority status into consideration before they start hacking dents into my shins?, Do I ever have enough time before class to change into: socks, sneakers, baggy sweatpants, a shirt I accidentally stole from some girl at camp, two Nike ??, ?maximum support???, sports bras, and a gray bedazzled headscarf?, Uh, no., )As it turns out, gym class-induced misery is a welcome relief from SAT/ACT/GPA-induced misery; from the cutthroat, number-driven madness that is my school; from the fact that once again I find myself standing in an endless file to gain acceptance into a selective institution., And this time, there??, ?s more on the line than a pair of shoes., Or so I??, ?m told.Despite it all, my gym class remains completely average., Every week I can anticipate arguing about what the team name should be, dismally failing Insert Grudgingly Decided Team Name, and shielding my face from both flying sports equipment and tremendous shame.You could say that gym class is my rock.It can even break (albeit temporarily) the most unbearable of egos., During the period, my classmates and I suddenly don??, ?t look like the city??, ?s Most Gifted., We look like a group of teenagers who will definitely smell bad if approached.In a few short months, the .07 % that I have come to know ???, my graduating class ???, will disperse., In other words, we will get our college decisions back., There will be the Accepted and the Rejected, the ???Winners???, and the ???Losers???, ???, as simple and irrevocable as picking teams ???, and I??, ?m not sure I want to be there when it happens., Some of us will realize that a) maybe we??, ?re not so special anymore, and b) there is something wrong with our nation??, ?s increasingly competitive and racially stratified two-track academic system.The Rejected will eventually recover from their perceived stupidity, the administrators of each respective school will collect hundreds of thousands of dollars in admissions fees, and high school students nationwide will continue to search ???, achingly ???, for easy community service hours.Perhaps the only lingering reminder of my specialized high school experience will be the lone hijabi younger termers who, long after I leave, will continue to be called by my name., Of Ice and MenParadise FrostFahrenheit 32SnowlitaTo Chill a MockingbirdA Tree Froze in

there is love and there are powerful things in the world., Whether you??, ?re Christian or not the hope is that you kind of contribute to that without being irreverent.??, ?Low are nothing if not reverent, and contributed a lasting document of Christmas simplicity in a decade of excess and insincerity., Sixteen years later, Christmas is one of the band??, ?s most popular releases and a beacon of distinction among the Christmas detritus., An album that resonates bigger and brighter every year.Christmas Music Bonus Round with Alan SparhawkFavorite Christmas song: ??, ?I like ??, ?Little Drummer Boy.???, But I have this old Jim Nabors Christmas LP., He had a really unusual, unique, but beautiful voice., I take that one every Christmas; it puts me back in touch with the weird possibilities of music.??, ?Least favorite Christmas song: ""Oh man., [Mimi] (Alan??, ?s wife and band member) and I go back and forth about Amy Grant., She loves it and plays it a lot., I tolerate it., I mean, Amy Grant??, ?s great and that??, ?s a really pure effort that she made., And she brought a lot of really nice things to people, but for some reason when I hear that I just think, ??, ?Oh man, there??, ?s go to be something else.???, (Laughs)To: Resident ServicesSubject: Neighbor complaintMy millennial neighbor??, ?s future is incredibly bright, and it is shining right into my apartment., Due to my recent divorce and subsequent loss of identity, I have developed a real, not made up sensitivity to the vivid, glowing promise of young talented people., Living next to her could cause lasting damage to my corneas and/or dignity., I can only assume it is a violation of some ordinance that one of your residents be put in close proximity to a known allergen., Therefore, for health reasons, I am requesting that she be moved.The glaring light of her future, full of so much untapped potential, is somehow managing to come through every window on all sides of my apartment, defying the laws of logic and physics., I didn??, ?t notice it when I moved in., I thought she was a college drop out., She is, but seems to have a real eye for web design and is going to enter her 24th year debt-free., That knowledge has given me three migraine headaches this month alone.I was erroneously led to believe that a good education would lead to a good life., It seems that this girl was raised to believe that you can follow your own personal happiness., Watching her do so has forced me to double up my Prozac dose.I tried blackout curtains to block out the dazzling light coming from her infinite possibilities, but I can still hear her playing vinyl Jack White albums, and the sound is deafening., Maybe she can switch apartments with Doris from B12?, Doris is well into her 50s and has all but given up on real fulfillment., Her life will provide a much better backdrop for me as I use what??, ?s left of my dwindling youth to stage a career change as a stand-up comic.Her future is also effecting my dating life, as the brightness coming from next door casts a shadow of doubt across my threshold whenever I open the door for a man, and by contrast makes everything in my home appear drab and unattractive, including my children.Speaking of my children, each day that they are exposed to the neighbor??, ?s abundant optimism, they look at me more and more like an outdated piece of furniture., ??, ?Doris is the outdated piece of furniture!???, I try to tell them, but they just look at me confused, and then ask where Daddy is.Please address this health risk immediately., Normally I wouldn??, ?t complain, because I have low self-esteem and don??, ?t often advocate for myself, but the past week has been unbearable., Last Monday, she yelled over to me that she would be out of town for a few days because she??, ?d been cast as an extra on Portlandia, and asked if could I keep an eye on her bonsai trees, which she has named Fitz and Saffron., I have been sick to my stomach ever since, and am unable to go to work.And that is why I haven??, ?t paid the rent., To begin, yes, I??, ?m that Annie., But I go by Anne now., One of my classmates at Cornell introduced me to hair straighteners and, after some intense work with a speech therapist, I??, ?ve mostly stopped spontaneously breaking out into song., (Clears throat)So, um, when Google asked me to give a motivational speech, I thought, What could I possibly talk about?, I mean, sure, I sang that song about the sun coming out tomorrow, but nowadays I need a Zoloft prescription just to get me through a partly cloudy day., (Laughs nervously)I??, ?m kidding., I mean, not about the Zoloft ???, you??, ?ll have to pry that out of my cold dead hands!, Anyway., My speech is called ??, ?Tomorrow: It??, ?s Only a Day Away.???, Get it?, Of course you get it., You??, ?re Google., You??, ?re the thing other people go to when they don??, ?t get it., So this should be fun, right?, Not ??, ?renting out an entire movie theatre to impress the woman you want to sleep with and her weird orphan???-fun., But still fun.So today I??, ?ll be talking about staying motivated at work., So, uh, unless there are any questions, let??, ?s get started., (A hand goes up)Yes????, Ma??, ...]",100

Strawberry Shortcake., Barbie vs. Justice League., A tea party with Abraham Lincoln and Cinderella.These are a few of my favorite things.These ??, ?what if????, scenarios are culled from the imagination of children., Because children have no precautions about creating impossible scenarios, they combine disparate objects and people to actualize their visions., Adults are typically terrible at this., But sometimes, just sometimes, they turn the impossible into reality.In 1977, at the request of absolutely no one, an impossible dream came true.Fresh off a debilitating drug addiction and accusations of Nazi sympathizing, David Bowie was ready to capitalize on the non-chart success of his latest record, Low, by appearing on Bing Crosby??, ?s Merrie Olde Christmas., On paper it made sense to no one., But when these two icons met to record a television segment, it made even less sense., It must have been quite chilly on that mocked English castle set; warmer performances occur at Apple board meetings.The story of their arrangement has been reported to excess and most reports use words such as ???surreal,??, ?1 ???weird,???, and ??, ?defying musical logic"" to describe it., This seemed like the worst pairing since peanut butter and mayonnaise.Clearly written to highlight a generation gap, the segment makes the most of an awkward encounter., First, Bowie mistakes Bing for the new butler (because everyone who lives on Bowie??, ?s street must have a butler), and then asks Bing if he is the ??, ?poor relation???, from America., Nevermind that Bowie can??, ?t be bothered

72,"[They began to suffer sleep apnea and joint pains., As a result, they had to stop hormone treatment as it was clearly having a damaging effect on their body.It was after this life-changing news that Carle began to identify as genderqueer or a-gender (they used both terms interchangeable to the chagrin of some) and began using gender-neutral pronouns rather than the early-in-life she/her and the later in life he/him., Carle??, ?s explanation for their renouncement of themselves as a transman in their autobiography is shown in a series of painful illustrations of their body seeming to get wrapped up in a cocoon of words and ideas, lines of theory and quotes from newspaper articles binding them all up into a closed shell from which they couldn??, ?t escape., When coming out as genderqueer and identifying with neither gender in the last panel of the chapter, Carle emerges as a butterfly, free of societal expectations.Soon after, Carle moved back to their hometown, Syracuse, and became alternately a drag-king and drag-queen for various underground burlesque performances., In recent years, they were the resident performer at Sir, J???accuse!, and made their living off their graphic autobiography as well as speaking engagements regarding fat positivity, body and gender theory, and burlesque workshops., ???We??, ?ll miss CeeCee,???, the club??, ?s owner said tearfully., ??, ?They were our crown butterflying jewel.???, Would I raise the minimum wage if I??, ?m elected?, Well, when I was growing up, my family didn??, ?t have a whole lot of money., I mean almost none., We lived inside of a Sears refrigerator box., To make ends meet, Daddy collected lint from laundromat dryers and rolled it into little balls that he would sell door-to-door to wealthy cat owners., Daddy could usually earn an extra penny or two if he agreed to spread the lint over his naked legs and let the cats paw it off him., He would come home  covered in scratches and smelling like cat urine, but he never complained., Not once., Daddy kept his head down and worked hard., He knew that in other countries you couldn??, ?t make a living just by letting house cats claw your flesh for sport.I don??, ?t mean to say we had it easy., Our box could get pretty cold during ice storms., But Daddy never stopped believing in the promise of this great country., At night it was sometimes hard to sleep because he would always be chanting ???U-S-A!, U-S-A!???, over at his end of the box., Mom would tell him to hush, and he would, but if you listened close enough you could still hear him whispering the Pledge of Allegiance long into the night.That was the thing about Daddy: Where other people saw obstacles, he saw opportunity., When his hunger left him so weak and skinny he no longer had the strength to scrape the lint from the dryers, he realized he could be useful to emergency teams that need to send people down narrow holes that no non-starving person would ever fit into., The next thing we knew, they were lowering Daddy down a hole in Montana in search of some lost miners., Well, I guess Daddy wasn??, ?t quite skinny enough because he got stuck halfway down and they had to wait  a couple of days until he lost a few more pounds., Daddy told us he got through it by reciting the Bill of Rights over and over in his head.Was Daddy upset that the miners he located were in a pretty bad way down there and had made a decision to kill and eat him shortly before they were rescued?, Not in the least., He was just thrilled to have a solid job., He wasn??, ?t even interested in the fame that probably would have come his way had they not forgotten about Daddy amidst all the post-rescue celebrations and left him down there in the mine ???, where he remained for a full 72 hours until the local sheriff was like, ??, ?Oh shit!??, ?By then everyone had forgotten about what Daddy had done for the miners ???, or, that is, everyone except that one miner who attacked Daddy with a 2?, ?4  for fear he might say something about the whole ??, ?trying to eat him???, business., But, to Daddy, that was all part of a good day??, ?s work., It was going to take a lot more than permanent damage to his spinal column to keep him from living his dreams., Based on the look in his eyes when he limped back to our refrigerator box, you would have thought Daddy had just won the lottery., So what he if he also had a horrible hacking cough from all those hours in the mine., Daddy told us he was happy to be coughing for most of the day because in other countries people had even worse coughs ???, and even more open wounds!No sir, Daddy wasn??, ?t about to give in just because of a cough that would often cause him to drop to his knees and convulse for 15-to-20 minutes at a clip., The very next day, he went right back to looking for work., And you can bet he would have found another job had he not passed out after an especially bad coughing fit and landed on that 90-year-old woman and been convicted of sexual assault.I??, ?ll never forget the smile on Daddy??, ?s face when we??, ?d visit him in prison., At least, we thought it was a smile., The other prisoners would beat Daddy pretty bad, and so it was sort of hard to tell if he was smiling or wincing in agony., In any case, Daddy said the beatings were a good thing because afterwards his grotesquely swollen body would be red, white, and blue ???, just like the flag pin he always wore on his prison uniform.I was still a kid then, and I didn??, ?t understand., I asked Daddy why there weren??, ?t any stars on his body flag., Daddy said it was okay because he would see stars while his cellmates were pummeling him.I sure do wish I??, ?d had the chance to say goodbye to Daddy before he was tasered to death by that hungover prison guard., (I guess some men can only listen to another man sing ???You??, ?re a Grand Old Flag???, so many times.), But I??, ?ll never forget the valuable lessons he taught me.And so, no, in answer to your question, I would not raise the minimum wage., 1., I Just Want to Be Where You Are2., I Need You More3., If You Say Go4., Said I Wasn???t5., Make Me

74,"[starts off on the wrong foot.The plan seemed simple in hindsight; record a seasoned group children singing two songs for a television special on CBS to air this December., One song, a traditional carol familiar to anyone who has stayed awake through an entire Yuletide service, the other song a newly written piece of music with an easy melody and simple lyrics, so simple a child should be able to memorize them with no effort., On paper, it??, ?s perfect in it??, ?s simplicity.But the children of St., Paul??, ?s Episcopal Church in San Rafael, California are not perfect., And choir director Barry Mineah is unflagging in his pursuit of spot-on renditions of the songs, while Vince Guaraldi, our man behind the keys, and Lee Mendelson, our man with the money, disagree with Mineah., They wanted ??, ?kids who sounded like kids.???, And now the adults are fighting., And now it??, ?s getting dark., And everyone??, ?s cup of good cheer has long been emptied, if it was ever full., Because it??, ?s not Christmas yet, Charlie Brown., Christmas is still a few months away., It??, ?s only September in California, 1965.- - -For me, the music of Vince Guaraldi is Christmastime, because as long as there is Christmas there will be A Charlie Brown Christmas and there will always be jazz., Because Vince Guaraldi??, ?s songs are the sound of our childhood, the sound of nostalgia made real.Wynton Marsalis once observed that the only jazz he ever heard growing up was on television during the annual broadcast of A Charlie Brown Christmas., Through the proliferation of a televised Christmas special and related soundtrack, Guaraldi brought jazz ???, authentic, accessible, American jazz ???, into the homes of millions of Americans that had never been exposed to it previously.Since its initial broadcast on December 9, 1965, A Charlie Brown Christmas (ACBC) has been part of our American consciousness., ACBC holds the same draw for audiences ???, new ones every year ???, as it once did., And it will likely continue to do so as long as there is Christmas.We know that about 15 million people watched ACBC on its original airdate, nearly half of the available television viewing audience at the time., And we can guesstimate that ACBC has sold somewhere between 4 million and 10 million copies, total.1We do know that the soundtrack has shipped almost 3.5 million copies since 1991 ???, a certified triple platinum release ???, and a number that points to its success in the era of Nielsen Soundscan music sales., But it is also a number that does not account for the time prior to 1991 when Soundscan results were not tallied., Additionally, ACBC has peaked as high as No., 6 on Billboard??, ?s Top Pop Catalog Albums and continues to chart every year on Billboard??, ?s Christmas Album sales list.But who cares about numbers?, Lies, damn lies and statistics., Numbers act as placeholders for the intangible and they distance us from the childlike notion of enjoyment that music brings., Numbers are an adult version of the popularity war we experienced in junior high, a data-driven analysis that distracts from the pleasures of Guaraldi??, ?s music., It seems that our adult brains just can??, ?t agree to cohabitate with our childlike desires.For many, jazz is ???adult???, music; containing difficult structures, sounds, and themes for listeners to unpack and that requiring an understanding of theories beyond our common languages., If album sales are considered to be a worthwhile indicator of popularity, then jazz falls somewhere on the musical spectrum between classical and niche genres like horrorcore, acid jazz, and pagan ambient.The best-selling jazz album of all time, Miles Davis???, timeless Kind of Blue, released in 1959, is an immediately accessible entry point for jazz novices., Like ACBC it is certified nearly four times platinum, but it is still approximately one and a half million units shy of total worldwide album sales for 90s pop WTFers, LFO whose debut album, LFO or Lyte Funky Ones contained the 1999 hit ??, ?Summer Girls,???, with these unforgettable lines:New Kids On the Block had a bunch of hits / Chinese food makes me sickAnd:When you take a sip/ you buzz like a hornet/ Billy Shakespeare wrote a whole bunch of sonnets.In a nod to the literal forced rhyme Shakespeare often employed, the final word ???sonnets???, is pronounced ???sornets.???, See what they did there?By the numbers, LFO has outsold Miles Davis???, Kind of Blue.Numbers cannot quantify our experiences or chart levels of enjoyment., (Believe me we??, ?ve tried.), Numbers cannot quantify the unquantifiable, the intangible cultural reach and impact of the music we hear., The music of ACBC, along with the animation, the script, and the deep manifestation of the individual elements that the show synthesized, are immeasurable ???, especially with respect to the most American of art forms, jazz.Nielsen ratings and advertising sales can??, ?t measure the effect of ACBC on its viewing audience and the impressions left on them., Who heard ??, ?Linus and Lucy???, for the first time on television and hummed it into a permanent earworm?, Who listened to ??, ?Christmas Time is Here???, and felt a wash of melancholia for the first time in their lives?, What child sat by a dim lamp with a gaudy Christmas tree close by and heard ???Skating,???, but never knew what the activity entailed, much less where you would take part in it?, What family sat in a cold, small apartment without any gifts and no Christmas tree and felt some sense of warmth from hearing ??, ?Hark the Herald Angels Sing???, sung slightly out-of-tune by children?As a born cynic, I??, ?ll grant you that these images are indebted to the promise of Christmas, the idea of Christmas nostalgia, and the false hope that somehow goodwill is more abundant in the first twenty-five days of December than throughout the rest of the year., But Guaraldi??, ?s playful compositions and fluid song structures, alternatively written in service to the melody but also free from it, have the sound of unencumbered possibility which is perhaps the truest spirit of Christmas.Vince Guaraldi, Miles Davis, and LFO, despite their artistic differences, trade in the same currency of a shared experience through music., No matter how diluted, profound, or (un)appealing, we look for association through listening experiences but share much more than just communal enjoyment., We share memories., We harbor collective spaces in our brains that only we can access and only music helps us locate., As children, our brains are developmentally fertile, ready to absorb and process any and all of life??, ?s ???adult???, complexities (such as jazz)., It??, ?s the stage in our lives where our receptors are wide open, and self-doubt is barely a concept, let alone a reality., This is essentially Charlie Brown??, ?s struggle throughout the 23-minute show: reconciling childhood with adulthood and creating a peaceful coexistence with the two., His is an insurmountable task and also it is made twice as hard when you must reconcile child and adult feelings that the Christmas season brings.I worry I??, ?ve already taken away a portion of our childlike wonder by overanalyzing the most pure and sincere form of holiday entertainment., In the same way that Jonas, from Lois Lowry??, ?s The Giver, discovers that his memories disappear once they are handed off to others, I discover that the more I rationalize, the more I lose., But to be able to freely share the experience of music is what always draws us back together., Because Guaraldi??, ?s music deserves more than just a cold analysis, it deserves our enjoyment.And that is how we should listen and enjoy ACBC., Not by shunning memory or removing it from the equation of memory, but by allowing it to color the lens through which we view our past Christmas experiences., Then we can examine the pieces we find together; the collective pieces of our childhood Christmases.- -1  The methods used to arrive at total album sales have shifted since 1965 and don??, ?t account for cultural trends, new musical formats, and individual copies sold., [Originally published December 4, 2015., ]- - -MottoWe Are the Girls on the Playground Your Pussy-Ass Moms Warned You About.HistoryIt all began 100 years ago with Juliette Gordon ???Murderess???, Low, who believed in the power of every girl to develop leadership skills, change the world, and ride free or die., Today there are Girl Scouts MC chapters in sixteen states and Scandinavia., The Daughters of Hell Council claims territory throughout North Florida, and has formed alliances with the Succubus Sisters and the Pink Sparkle Bitches against our sworn enemy, the Arendelle??, ?s Angels.Philosophy/Field TripsTroop loyalty is important above all else., If a member is attacked, all other scouts must stand with her., Girls must abide by the Girl Scout MC Law:On my honor, I will try to be honest and fair, considerate and caring, and be a sister to every scout, except those snatch-faced twatwaffles, the Arendelle??, ...]",100

83,"[So much so that he??, ?s fallen for the idea that a textbook is going to help you learn to write., I??, ?m a writer and I know a lot of writers., None of us learned to write by using a textbook., No one ever did., In fact, if you think of yourself as a not-very-good writer then reading about writing from a textbook is probably going to alienate you and make you feel even worse about writing., So we??, ?re not using one, but only because I??, ?m not coming back next year and I no longer need to keep the director of composition happy.Do I need to repeat any of that?, Is there any confusion about not buying the textbook?, Good., We will read essays from professional writers and from my former students who have allowed me to show you the work they did in a class just like this one., But

the kind of teacher-person they??, ?d like to hire for one of the higher-paying respectable positions like theirs., Right now the most popular imaginary teacher-person they??, ?re excited about hiring is one who writes plays., While no one is saying it, it would be extra-fabulous if the imaginary teacher-person were an African-American, or a Latina who writes plays., You can understand their excitement about this potential teacher-person., I will be doodling on my notepad while they go round and round about what else they think this non-existent teacher-person might do., My input won??,

me come to meetings so we can all be together, but my time is going to be wasted by these self-important egotistical people, and they don??, ?t know it yet but they??, ?re going to have to settle when it comes to this favorite new imaginary teacher-person., Nonetheless, next year you should be able to take a playwriting class from someone who has taught playwriting classes before and/or someone who is currently writing a play, and that??, ?s no small thing, not every school is going to be able to say that.If you didn??, ?t require grades for motivation we wouldn??, ?t have to talk about them,

so that you are more familiar with the form, with the assumption that you will write papers that matter more for the esteemed professors, who also matter more., They will grade you according to their own set of criteria, and I won??, ?t be able to help you with that., Generally, it??, ?s a one-shot deal, with no feedback, with your grade in the course largely determined by what they think about your paper-writing skills., Meanwhile, professional writers have editors and proofreaders and they go back-and-forth on a draft before it goes out into the world a guaranteed ???A.???, Very few of you will go down that road so we won??, ?t concern ourselves with the writing process as the professionals know it., You??, ?ll be writing something else while you??, ?re here, something harder to

good looking.Please understand that your years here are precious., Most likely, at no other time in your life will you be afforded the luxury to read and write, or to discuss ideas for the sake of ideas., You??, ?ve got the rest of your life to be a good employee, so try not to be too career-minded while you??, ?re here., You??, ?ve got the rest of your life to drink, so be wary the lure of

93,"[Cut to the eve of the CBS upfront in New York., Jim and I were in attendance at a celebration at the home of Worldwide Pants executive producer Rob Burnett., Letterman even made a brief appearance at the party, although he pretty much kept to himself., Similarly, Jim and I stood huddled in a corner, never feeling entirely comfortable in our skins., So when Jim decided to duck out early to hit a few comedy clubs for stage time, I leapt at his invitation to tag along., Even as he was about to star in his own TV series, Jim still felt most at home breathing the air of New York City??, ?s basement comedy clubs.Unfortunately Welcome to New York lasted only one season., And while it was a funny, well-produced show, it also really wasn??, ?t about Jim., It simply cast him as a TV weatherman from Indiana who became a fish out of water on a New York based morning show., But because the character??, ?s name was ??, ?Jim Gaffigan,???, it seemed that this might be his one shot at having a network sitcom., Undaunted, Jim soldiered on with his life and his career., And his perspective and persona sharpened after he got married, had kids and found a niche in crafting long signature riffs on food (hot pockets, bacon, doughnuts, etc.), He also discovered his ??, ?inside voice,???, a device that offered commentary to Jim??, ?s material from his imagined perspective of the audience., As I have observed time and again, the best comedians only get better with time., And while Jim was a solid act when we first met, I watched in awe and admiration as he grew to become one of the nation??, ?s finest and most beloved comedians.In 2009, after a decade and a half hiatus from performing, I got the itch to try my hand at stand-up again., And when I say ???itch???, I truly mean as in the way someone who had been rubbed head to toe in poison ivy gets an ???itch.???, It was a difficult period in my life and stand-up seemed like the cure for what ailed me., Later that year, I was invited to perform at a club in New York City and, to my great surprise, Jim was booked on the same show., To my great terror, I was scheduled to follow him., I begged to have our spots flipped, but comic-to-comic, Jim tried to talk me down, assuring me that as a clean, mild-mannered performer, he??, ?s not a tough act to follow., I couldn??, ?t imagine how that could be the case, as Jim was now one of the top drawing arena acts in the country., But unlike the stereotype of the hyper-competitive comedian, I knew Jim wasn??, ?t the type to set me up to fail., So I accepted the challenge., If anything, I experienced the phenomenon of ??, ?the Gaffigan lift,???, enjoying riding in on the wave of goodwill he created with that crowd., Following him remains one of the highlights of my brief return to stand-up.A couple of years later, I was working as a development and programming executive at the cable network IFC when I got a call from Jim??, ?s manager, Alex Murray., Alex said that Jim wanted to come in for a meeting., Of course I was thrilled to sit down with him, but I was incredulous., Why would someone with such massive broad appeal even contemplate coming into our little sandbox?, Don??, ?t get me wrong, I was proud of the work we were doing., But our reach was hardly as broad as Jim???s., When we met in my office, Jim explained that he??, ?d been through the wringer elsewhere, trying to develop a semi-autobiographical series that was true to his voice., While I understood his frustration, and would have liked nothing more than to bring a big name like Gaffigan to the channel, I felt honor-bound to tell him the truth., I encouraged Jim to continue to fight to get the show he envisioned onto the biggest stage possible, assuring him that if all else failed he could always come back to us., That counsel would be my ongoing refrain every time I saw Jim after that???, usually at some big industry event where we??, ?d find ourselves hanging out on the sidelines, as we had so many years before.The road one travels in entertainment is rarely a straight line., Jim continued to knock on the doors of the big broadcast networks, eventually landing a deal at TV Land for his new series., I visited Jim and his wife and writing partner Jeannie on the set of the show a few months ago., He looked exhausted but happy as he devoured a bag of Auntie Anne pretzels between scenes., He and Jeannie seemed confident in the work., Now having seen the show, I understand why., A few days ago it was announced that it??, ?s been picked up for a second season., Finally, Jim is having his moment., And boy is he ready for it., You ordered, and boom, now I gotta go ???, I??, ?m off on my bike and I??, ?m fast as lightning., This is how it works!, I??, ?m prepared to deliver your sandwich., I am losing feeling in my groin., I am literally losing the ability to have children as my crotch is pressed tighter and tighter to this hard icepick of a bike seat., My sneakers are on!, They are non-slip and my practiced legs are pumping with an experienced motion perfected over time., I pretend I am a Zamboni as I conquer distances with ultimate speed.I??, ?m the Jimmy John??, ?s Delivery Boy!, I am unable to skirt an abandoned gallon of Minute Maid juice someone left out by their garbage can., I love your sandwich so much., I can??, ?t wait to deliver the sandwich to you that I love so much and I love you, too, so much, only if you love me back.No really!, I??, ?m a delivery boy and I deliver your sandwich and that??, ?s my job!, It??, ?s what I do!, Ha, alright., I am covered in Minute Maid from head to toe and I am already beginning to mourn the loss of my unborn sons, John and Midge., I catch a whir of a cat pawing a tree in my periphery., Another trash can, a lady walking on the sidewalk in a sweat suit ???, ha, the world is amazing!, It??, ?s funny that no one uses their mailboxes anymore., They??, ?re a slow system, and hey, I know a thing or two about speed and convenience.I??, ?m the Jimmy John??, ?s Delivery Boy and there is a large German shepherd bounding after my bicycle!, I take this moment as an opportunity to appreciate the sandwich that I am bringing to you with speed and convenience.My long hair is whipping into my eyes but I am pumping my legs with a practiced skill., There??, ?s another dog on the
