0,"THIS little volume (the result of meditation and experience) is not
intended as an exhaustive treatise on the much-written-upon subject
of the power of thought. It is suggestive rather than explanatory,
its object being to stimulate men and women to the discovery and
perception of the truth that--

""They themselves are makers of themselves.""

by virtue of the thoughts, which they choose and encourage; that
mind is the master-weaver, both of the inner garment of character
and the outer garment of circumstance, and that, as they may have
hitherto woven in ignorance and pain they may now weave in
enlightenment and happiness.

AS A MAN THINKETH

THOUGHT AND CHARACTER


THE aphorism, ""As a man thinketh in his heart so is he,"" not only
embraces the whole of a man's being, but is so comprehensive as to
reach out to every condition and circumstance of his life. A man is
literally _what he thinks,_ his character being the complete sum of
all his thoughts.

As the plant springs from, and could not be without, the seed, so
every act of a man springs from the hidden seeds of thought, and
could not have appeared without them. This applies equally to those
acts called ""spontaneous"" and ""unpremeditated"" as to those, which
are deliberately executed.

Act is the blossom of thought, and joy and suffering are its fruits;
thus does a man garner in the sweet and bitter fruitage of his own
husbandry.

  ""Thought in the mind hath made us, What we are
  By thought was wrought and built. If a man's mind
  Hath evil thoughts, pain comes on him as comes
  The wheel the ox behind....

  ..If one endure
  In purity of thought, joy follows him
  As his own shadow--sure.""

Man is a growth by law, and not a creation by artifice, and cause
and effect is as absolute and undeviating in the hidden realm of
thought as in the world of visible and material things. A noble and
Godlike character is not a thing of favour or chance, but is the
natural result of continued effort in right thinking, the effect of
long-cherished association with Godlike thoughts. An ignoble and
bestial character, by the same process, is the result of the
continued harbouring of grovelling thoughts.

Man is made or unmade by himself; in the armoury of thought he
forges the weapons by which he destroys himself; he also fashions
the tools with which he builds for himself heavenly mansions of joy
and strength and peace. By the right choice and true application of
thought, man ascends to the Divine Perfection; by the abuse and
wrong application of thought, he descends below the level of the
beast. Between these two extremes are all the grades of character,
and man is their maker and master.

Of all the beautiful truths pertaining to the soul which have been
restored and brought to light in this age, none is more gladdening
or fruitful of divine promise and confidence than this--that man is
the master of thought, the moulder of character, and the maker and
shaper of condition, environment, and destiny.

As a being of Power, Intelligence, and Love, and the lord of his own
thoughts, man holds the key to every situation, and contains within
himself that transforming and regenerative agency by which he may
make himself what he wills.

Man is always the master, even in his weaker and most abandoned
state; but in his weakness and degradation he is the foolish master
who misgoverns his ""household."" When he begins to reflect upon his
condition, and to search diligently for the Law upon which his being
is established, he then becomes the wise master, directing his
energies with intelligence, and fashioning his thoughts to fruitful
issues. Such is the _conscious_ master, and man can only thus become
by discovering _within himself_ the laws of thought; which discovery
is totally a matter of application, self analysis, and experience.

Only by much searching and mining, are gold and diamonds obtained,
and man can find every truth connected with his being, if he will
dig deep into the mine of his soul; and that he is the maker of his
character, the moulder of his life, and the builder of his destiny,
he may unerringly prove, if he will watch, control, and alter his
thoughts, tracing their effects upon himself, upon others, and upon
his life and circumstances, linking cause and effect by patient
practice and investigation, and utilizing his every experience, even
to the most trivial, everyday occurrence, as a means of obtaining
that knowledge of himself which is Understanding, Wisdom, Power. In
this direction, as in no other, is the law absolute that ""He that
seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened;"" for
only by patience, practice, and ceaseless importunity can a man
enter the Door of the Temple of Knowledge.




EFFECT OF THOUGHT ON CIRCUMSTANCES


MAN'S mind may be likened to a garden, which may be intelligently
cultivated or allowed to run wild; but whether cultivated or
neglected, it must, and will, _bring forth._ If no useful seeds are
_put_ into it, then an abundance of useless weed-seeds will _fall_
therein, and will continue to produce their kind.

Just as a gardener cultivates his plot, keeping it free from weeds,
and growing the flowers and fruits which he requires, so may a man
tend the garden of his mind, weeding out all the wrong, useless, and
impure thoughts, and cultivating toward perfection the flowers and
fruits of right, useful, and pure thoughts. By pursuing this
process, a man sooner or later discovers that he is the
master-gardener of his soul, the director of his life. He also
reveals, within himself, the laws of thought, and understands, with
ever-increasing accuracy, how the thought-forces and mind elements
operate in the shaping of his character, circumstances, and destiny.

Thought and character are one, and as character can only manifest
and discover itself through environment and circumstance, the outer
conditions of a person's life will always be found to be
harmoniously related to his inner state. This does not mean that a
man's circumstances at any given time are an indication of his
_entire_ character, but that those circumstances are so intimately
connected with some vital thought-element within himself that, for
the time being, they are indispensable to his development.

Every man is where he is by the law of his being; the thoughts which
he has built into his character have brought him there, and in the
arrangement of his life there is no element of chance, but all is
the result of a law which cannot err. This is just as true of those
who feel ""out of harmony"" with their surroundings as of those who
are contented with them.

As a progressive and evolving being, man is where he is that he may
learn that he may grow; and as he learns the spiritual lesson which
any circumstance contains for him, it passes away and gives place to
other circumstances.

Man is buffeted by circumstances so long as he believes himself to
be the creature of outside conditions, but when he realizes that he
is a creative power, and that he may command the hidden soil and
seeds of his being out of which circumstances grow, he then becomes
the rightful master of himself.

That circumstances grow out of thought every man knows who has for
any length of time practised self-control and self-purification, for
he will have noticed that the alteration in his circumstances has
been in exact ratio with his altered mental condition. So true is
this that when a man earnestly applies himself to remedy the defects
in his character, and makes swift and marked progress, he passes
rapi",100
1,"dly through a succession of vicissitudes.

The soul attracts that which it secretly harbours; that which it
loves, and also that which it fears; it reaches the height of its
cherished aspirations; it falls to the level of its unchastened
desires,--and circumstances are the means by which the soul receives
its own.

Every thought-seed sown or allowed to fall into the mind, and to
take root there, produces its own, blossoming sooner or later into
act, and bearing its own fruitage of opportunity and circumstance.
Good thoughts bear good fruit, bad thoughts bad fruit.

The outer world of circumstance shapes itself to the inner world of
thought, and both pleasant and unpleasant external conditions are
factors, which make for the ultimate good of the individual. As the
reaper of his own harvest, man learns both by suffering and bliss.

Following the inmost desires, aspirations, thoughts, by which he
allows himself to be dominated, (pursuing the will-o'-the-wisps of
impure imaginings or steadfastly walking the highway of strong and
high endeavour), a man at last arrives at their fruition and
fulfilment in the outer conditions of his life. The laws of growth
and adjustment everywhere obtains.

A man does not come to the almshouse or the jail by the tyranny of
fate or circumstance, but by the pathway of grovelling thoughts and
base desires. Nor does a pure-minded man fall suddenly into crime by
stress of any mere external force; the criminal thought had long
been secretly fostered in the heart, and the hour of opportunity
revealed its gathered power. Circumstance does not make the man; it
reveals him to himself No such conditions can exist as descending
into vice and its attendant sufferings apart from vicious
inclinations, or ascending into virtue and its pure happiness
without the continued cultivation of virtuous aspirations; and man,
therefore, as the lord and master of thought, is the maker of
himself the shaper and author of environment. Even at birth the soul
comes to its own and through every step of its earthly pilgrimage it
attracts those combinations of conditions which reveal itself, which
are the reflections of its own purity and, impurity, its strength
and weakness.

Men do not attract that which they _want,_ but that which they _are._
Their whims, fancies, and ambitions are thwarted at every step, but
their inmost thoughts and desires are fed with their own food, be it
foul or clean. The ""divinity that shapes our ends"" is in ourselves;
it is our very self. Only himself manacles man: thought and action
are the gaolers of Fate--they imprison, being base; they are also
the angels of Freedom--they liberate, being noble. Not what he
wishes and prays for does a man get, but what he justly earns. His
wishes and prayers are only gratified and answered when they
harmonize with his thoughts and actions.

In the light of this truth, what, then, is the meaning of ""fighting
against circumstances?"" It means that a man is continually revolting
against an _effect_ without, while all the time he is nourishing and
preserving its _cause_ in his heart. That cause may take the form of
a conscious vice or an unconscious weakness; but whatever it is, it
stubbornly retards the efforts of its possessor, and thus calls
aloud for remedy.

Men are anxious to improve their circumstances, but are unwilling to
improve themselves; they therefore remain bound. The man who does
not shrink from self-crucifixion can never fail to accomplish the
object upon which his heart is set. This is as true of earthly as of
heavenly things. Even the man whose sole object is to acquire wealth
must be prepared to make great personal sacrifices before he can
accomplish his object; and how much more so he who would realize a
strong and well-poised life?

Here is a man who is wretchedly poor. He is extremely anxious that
his surroundings and home comforts should be improved, yet all the
time he shirks his work, and considers he is justified in trying to
deceive his employer on the ground of the insufficiency of his
wages. Such a man does not understand the simplest rudiments of
those principles which are the basis of true prosperity, and is not
only totally unfitted to rise out of his wretchedness, but is
actually attracting to himself a still deeper wretchedness by
dwelling in, and acting out, indolent, deceptive, and unmanly
thoughts.

Here is a rich man who is the victim of a painful and persistent
disease as the result of gluttony. He is willing to give large sums
of money to get rid of it, but he will not sacrifice his gluttonous
desires. He wants to gratify his taste for rich and unnatural viands
and have his health as well. Such a man is totally unfit to have
health, because he has not yet learned the first principles of a
healthy life.

Here is an employer of labour who adopts crooked measures to avoid
paying the regulation wage, and, in the hope of making larger
profits, reduces the wages of his workpeople. Such a man is
altogether unfitted for prosperity, and when he finds himself
bankrupt, both as regards reputation and riches, he blames
circumstances, not knowing that he is the sole author of his
condition.

I have introduced these three cases merely as illustrative of the
truth that man is the causer (though nearly always is unconsciously)
of his circumstances, and that, whilst aiming at a good end, he is
continually frustrating its accomplishment by encouraging thoughts
and desires which cannot possibly harmonize with that end. Such
cases could be multiplied and varied almost indefinitely, but this
is not necessary, as the reader can, if he so resolves, trace the
action of the laws of thought in his own mind and life, and until
this is done, mere external facts cannot serve as a ground of
reasoning.

Circumstances, however, are so complicated, thought is so deeply
rooted, and the conditions of happiness vary so, vastly with
individuals, that a man's entire soul-condition (although it may be
known to himself) cannot be judged by another from the external
aspect of his life alone. A man may be honest in certain directions,
yet suffer privations; a man may be dishonest in certain directions,
yet acquire wealth; but the conclusion usually formed that the one
man fails _because of his particular honesty,_ and that the other
_prospers because of his particular dishonesty,_ is the result of a
superficial judgment, which assumes that the dishonest man is almost
totally corrupt, and the honest man almost entirely virtuous. In the
light of a deeper knowledge and wider experience such judgment is
found to be erroneous. The dishonest man may have some admirable
virtues, which the other does, not possess; and the honest man
obnoxious vices which are absent in the other. The honest man reaps
the good results of his honest thoughts and acts; he also brings
upon himself the sufferings, which his vices produce. The dishonest
man likewise garners his own suffering and happiness.

It is pleasing to human vanity to believe that one suffers because
of one's virtue; but not until a man has extirpated every sickly,
bitter, and impure thought from his mind, and washed every sinful
stain from his soul, can he be in a position to know and declare
that his sufferings are the result of his good, and not of his bad
qualities; and on the way to, yet long before he has reached, that
supreme perfection, he will have found, working in his mind and
life, the Great Law which is absolutely just, and which cannot,
therefore, give good for evil, evil for good. Possessed of such
knowledge, he will the",100
2,"n know, looking back upon his past ignorance
and blindness, that his life is, and always was, justly ordered, and
that all his past experiences, good and bad, were the equitable
outworking of his evolving, yet unevolved self.

Good thoughts and actions can never produce bad results; bad
thoughts and actions can never produce good results. This is but
saying that nothing can come from corn but corn, nothing from
nettles but nettles. Men understand this law in the natural world,
and work with it; but few understand it in the mental and moral
world (though its operation there is just as simple and
undeviating), and they, therefore, do not co-operate with it.

Suffering is _always_ the effect of wrong thought in some direction.
It is an indication that the individual is out of harmony with
himself, with the Law of his being. The sole and supreme use of
suffering is to purify, to burn out all that is useless and impure.
Suffering ceases for him who is pure. There could be no object in
burning gold after the dross had been removed, and a perfectly pure
and enlightened being could not suffer.

The circumstances, which a man encounters with suffering, are the
result of his own mental in harmony. The circumstances, which a man
encounters with blessedness, are the result of his own mental
harmony. Blessedness, not material possessions, is the measure of
right thought; wretchedness, not lack of material possessions, is
the measure of wrong thought. A man may be cursed and rich; he may
be blessed and poor. Blessedness and riches are only joined together
when the riches are rightly and wisely used; and the poor man only
descends into wretchedness when he regards his lot as a burden
unjustly imposed.

Indigence and indulgence are the two extremes of wretchedness. They
are both equally unnatural and the result of mental disorder. A man
is not rightly conditioned until he is a happy, healthy, and
prosperous being; and happiness, health, and prosperity are the
result of a harmonious adjustment of the inner with the outer, of
the man with his surroundings.

A man only begins to be a man when he ceases to whine and revile,
and commences to search for the hidden justice which regulates his
life. And as he adapts his mind to that regulating factor, he ceases
to accuse others as the cause of his condition, and builds himself
up in strong and noble thoughts; ceases to kick against
circumstances, but begins to _use_ them as aids to his more rapid
progress, and as a means of discovering the hidden powers and
possibilities within himself.

Law, not confusion, is the dominating principle in the universe;
justice, not injustice, is the soul and substance of life; and
righteousness, not corruption, is the moulding and moving force in
the spiritual government of the world. This being so, man has but to
right himself to find that the universe is right; and during the
process of putting himself right he will find that as he alters his
thoughts towards things and other people, things and other people
will alter towards him.

The proof of this truth is in every person, and it therefore admits
of easy investigation by systematic introspection and self-analysis.
Let a man radically alter his thoughts, and he will be astonished at
the rapid transformation it will effect in the material conditions
of his life. Men imagine that thought can be kept secret, but it
cannot; it rapidly crystallizes into habit, and habit solidifies
into circumstance. Bestial thoughts crystallize into habits of
drunkenness and sensuality, which solidify into circumstances of
destitution and disease: impure thoughts of every kind crystallize
into enervating and confusing habits, which solidify into
distracting and adverse circumstances: thoughts of fear, doubt, and
indecision crystallize into weak, unmanly, and irresolute habits,
which solidify into circumstances of failure, indigence, and slavish
dependence: lazy thoughts crystallize into habits of uncleanliness
and dishonesty, which solidify into circumstances of foulness and
beggary: hateful and condemnatory thoughts crystallize into habits
of accusation and violence, which solidify into circumstances of
injury and persecution: selfish thoughts of all kinds crystallize
into habits of self-seeking, which solidify into circumstances more
or less distressing. On the other hand, beautiful thoughts of all
kinds crystallize into habits of grace and kindliness, which
solidify into genial and sunny circumstances: pure thoughts
crystallize into habits of temperance and self-control, which
solidify into circumstances of repose and peace: thoughts of
courage, self-reliance, and decision crystallize into manly habits,
which solidify into circumstances of success, plenty, and freedom:
energetic thoughts crystallize into habits of cleanliness and
industry, which solidify into circumstances of pleasantness: gentle
and forgiving thoughts crystallize into habits of gentleness, which
solidify into protective and preservative circumstances: loving and
unselfish thoughts crystallize into habits of self-forgetfulness for
others, which solidify into circumstances of sure and abiding
prosperity and true riches.

A particular train of thought persisted in, be it good or bad,
cannot fail to produce its results on the character and
circumstances. A man cannot _directly_ choose his circumstances, but
he can choose his thoughts, and so indirectly, yet surely, shape his
circumstances.

Nature helps every man to the gratification of the thoughts, which
he most encourages, and opportunities are presented which will most
speedily bring to the surface both the good and evil thoughts.

Let a man cease from his sinful thoughts, and all the world will
soften towards him, and be ready to help him; let him put away his
weakly and sickly thoughts, and lo, opportunities will spring up on
every hand to aid his strong resolves; let him encourage good
thoughts, and no hard fate shall bind him down to wretchedness and
shame. The world is your kaleidoscope, and the varying combinations
of colours, which at every succeeding moment it presents to you are
the exquisitely adjusted pictures of your ever-moving thoughts.

  ""So You will be what you will to be;
  Let failure find its false content
  In that poor word, 'environment,'
  But spirit scorns it, and is free.

  ""It masters time, it conquers space;
  It cowes that boastful trickster, Chance,
  And bids the tyrant Circumstance
  Uncrown, and fill a servant's place.

  ""The human Will, that force unseen,
  The offspring of a deathless Soul,
  Can hew a way to any goal,
  Though walls of granite intervene.

  ""Be not impatient in delays
  But wait as one who understands;
  When spirit rises and commands
  The gods are ready to obey.""




EFFECT OF THOUGHT ON HEALTH AND THE BODY


THE body is the servant of the mind. It obeys the operations of the
mind, whether they be deliberately chosen or automatically
expressed. At the bidding of unlawful thoughts the body sinks
rapidly into disease and decay; at the command of glad and beautiful
thoughts it becomes clothed with youthfulness and beauty.

Disease and health, like circumstances, are rooted in thought.
Sickly thoughts will express themselves through a sickly body.
Thoughts of fear have been known to kill a man as speedily as a
bullet, and they are continually killing thousands of people just as
surely though less rapidly. The people who live in fear of disease
are the people who get it. Anxiety quickly demoralizes the whole
body, and lays it open to the entrance of disease",100
3,"; while impure
thoughts, even if not physically indulged, will soon shatter the
nervous system.

Strong, pure, and happy thoughts build up the body in vigour and
grace. The body is a delicate and plastic instrument, which responds
readily to the thoughts by which it is impressed, and habits of
thought will produce their own effects, good or bad, upon it.

Men will continue to have impure and poisoned blood, so long as they
propagate unclean thoughts. Out of a clean heart comes a clean life
and a clean body. Out of a defiled mind proceeds a defiled life and
a corrupt body. Thought is the fount of action, life, and
manifestation; make the fountain pure, and all will be pure.

Change of diet will not help a man who will not change his thoughts.
When a man makes his thoughts pure, he no longer desires impure
food.

Clean thoughts make clean habits. The so-called saint who does not
wash his body is not a saint. He who has strengthened and purified
his thoughts does not need to consider the malevolent microbe.

If you would protect your body, guard your mind. If you would renew
your body, beautify your mind. Thoughts of malice, envy,
disappointment, despondency, rob the body of its health and grace. A
sour face does not come by chance; it is made by sour thoughts.
Wrinkles that mar are drawn by folly, passion, and pride.

I know a woman of ninety-six who has the bright, innocent face of a
girl. I know a man well under middle age whose face is drawn into
inharmonious contours. The one is the result of a sweet and sunny
disposition; the other is the outcome of passion and discontent.

As you cannot have a sweet and wholesome abode unless you admit the
air and sunshine freely into your rooms, so a strong body and a
bright, happy, or serene countenance can only result from the free
admittance into the mind of thoughts of joy and goodwill and
serenity.

On the faces of the aged there are wrinkles made by sympathy, others
by strong and pure thought, and others are carved by passion: who
cannot distinguish them? With those who have lived righteously, age
is calm, peaceful, and softly mellowed, like the setting sun. I have
recently seen a philosopher on his deathbed. He was not old except
in years. He died as sweetly and peacefully as he had lived.

There is no physician like cheerful thought for dissipating the ills
of the body; there is no comforter to compare with goodwill for
dispersing the shadows of grief and sorrow. To live continually in
thoughts of ill will, cynicism, suspicion, and envy, is to be
confined in a self made prison-hole. But to think well of all, to be
cheerful with all, to patiently learn to find the good in all--such
unselfish thoughts are the very portals of heaven; and to dwell day
by day in thoughts of peace toward every creature will bring
abounding peace to their possessor.




THOUGHT AND PURPOSE


UNTIL thought is linked with purpose there is no intelligent
accomplishment. With the majority the bark of thought is allowed to
""drift"" upon the ocean of life. Aimlessness is a vice, and such
drifting must not continue for him who would steer clear of
catastrophe and destruction.

They who have no central purpose in their life fall an easy prey to
petty worries, fears, troubles, and self-pityings, all of which are
indications of weakness, which lead, just as surely as deliberately
planned sins (though by a different route), to failure, unhappiness,
and loss, for weakness cannot persist in a power evolving universe.

A man should conceive of a legitimate purpose in his heart, and set
out to accomplish it. He should make this purpose the centralizing
point of his thoughts. It may take the form of a spiritual ideal, or
it may be a worldly object, according to his nature at the time
being; but whichever it is, he should steadily focus his
thought-forces upon the object, which he has set before him. He
should make this purpose his supreme duty, and should devote himself
to its attainment, not allowing his thoughts to wander away into
ephemeral fancies, longings, and imaginings. This is the royal road
to self-control and true concentration of thought. Even if he fails
again and again to accomplish his purpose (as he necessarily must
until weakness is overcome), the _strength of character gained_ will
be the measure of _his true_ success, and this will form a new
starting-point for future power and triumph.

Those who are not prepared for the apprehension of a _great_ purpose
should fix the thoughts upon the faultless performance of their
duty, no matter how insignificant their task may appear. Only in
this way can the thoughts be gathered and focussed, and resolution
and energy be developed, which being done, there is nothing which
may not be accomplished.

The weakest soul, knowing its own weakness, and believing this truth
_that strength can only be developed by effort and practice,_ will,
thus believing, at once begin to exert itself, and, adding effort to
effort, patience to patience, and strength to strength, will never
cease to develop, and will at last grow divinely strong.

As the physically weak man can make himself strong by careful and
patient training, so the man of weak thoughts can make them strong
by exercising himself in right thinking.

To put away aimlessness and weakness, and to begin to think with
purpose, is to enter the ranks of those strong ones who only
recognize failure as one of the pathways to attainment; who make all
conditions serve them, and who think strongly, attempt fearlessly,
and accomplish masterfully.

Having conceived of his purpose, a man should mentally mark out a
_straight_ pathway to its achievement, looking neither to the right
nor the left. Doubts and fears should be rigorously excluded; they
are disintegrating elements, which break up the straight line of
effort, rendering it crooked, ineffectual, useless. Thoughts of
doubt and fear never accomplished anything, and never can. They
always lead to failure. Purpose, energy, power to do, and all strong
thoughts cease when doubt and fear creep in.

The will to do springs from the knowledge that we _can_ do. Doubt
and fear are the great enemies of knowledge, and he who encourages
them, who does not slay them, thwarts himself at every step.

He who has conquered doubt and fear has conquered failure. His
every thought is allied with power, and all difficulties are
bravely met and wisely overcome. His purposes are seasonably
planted, and they bloom and bring forth fruit, which does not fall
prematurely to the ground.

Thought allied fearlessly to purpose becomes creative force: he who
_knows_ this is ready to become something higher and stronger than a
mere bundle of wavering thoughts and fluctuating sensations; he who
_does_ this has become the conscious and intelligent wielder of his
mental powers.




THE THOUGHT-FACTOR IN ACHIEVEMENT


ALL that a man achieves and all that he fails to achieve is the
direct result of his own thoughts. In a justly ordered universe,
where loss of equipoise would mean total destruction, individual
responsibility must be absolute. A man's weakness and strength,
purity and impurity, are his own, and not another man's; they are
brought about by himself, and not by another; and they can only be
altered by himself, never by another. His condition is also his own,
and not another man's. His suffering and his happiness are evolved
from within. As he thinks, so he is; as he continues to think, so he
remains.

A strong man cannot help a weaker unless that weaker is _willing_ to
be helped, and even",100
4," then the weak man must become strong of himself;
he must, by his own efforts, develop the strength which he admires
in another. None but himself can alter his condition.

It has been usual for men to think and to say, ""Many men are slaves
because one is an oppressor; let us hate the oppressor."" Now,
however, there is amongst an increasing few a tendency to reverse
this judgment, and to say, ""One man is an oppressor because many are
slaves; let us despise the slaves.""

The truth is that oppressor and slave are co-operators in ignorance,
and, while seeming to afflict each other, are in reality afflicting
themselves. A perfect Knowledge perceives the action of law in the
weakness of the oppressed and the misapplied power of the oppressor;
a perfect Love, seeing the suffering, which both states entail,
condemns neither; a perfect Compassion embraces both oppressor and
oppressed.

He who has conquered weakness, and has put away all selfish
thoughts, belongs neither to oppressor nor oppressed. He is free.

A man can only rise, conquer, and achieve by lifting up his
thoughts. He can only remain weak, and abject, and miserable by
refusing to lift up his thoughts.

Before a man can achieve anything, even in worldly things, he must
lift his thoughts above slavish animal indulgence. He may not, in
order to succeed, give up all animality and selfishness, by any
means; but a portion of it must, at least, be sacrificed. A man
whose first thought is bestial indulgence could neither think
clearly nor plan methodically; he could not find and develop his
latent resources, and would fail in any undertaking. Not having
commenced to manfully control his thoughts, he is not in a position
to control affairs and to adopt serious responsibilities. He is not
fit to act independently and stand alone. But he is limited only by
the thoughts, which he chooses.

There can be no progress, no achievement without sacrifice, and a
man's worldly success will be in the measure that he sacrifices his
confused animal thoughts, and fixes his mind on the development of
his plans, and the strengthening of his resolution and self-reliance.
And the higher he lifts his thoughts, the more manly, upright, and
righteous he becomes, the greater will be his success, the more
blessed and enduring will be his achievements.

The universe does not favour the greedy, the dishonest, the vicious,
although on the mere surface it may sometimes appear to do so; it
helps the honest, the magnanimous, the virtuous. All the great
Teachers of the ages have declared this in varying forms, and to
prove and know it a man has but to persist in making himself more
and more virtuous by lifting up his thoughts.

Intellectual achievements are the result of thought consecrated to
the search for knowledge, or for the beautiful and true in life and
nature. Such achievements may be sometimes connected with vanity and
ambition, but they are not the outcome of those characteristics;
they are the natural outgrowth of long and arduous effort, and of
pure and unselfish thoughts.

Spiritual achievements are the consummation of holy aspirations. He
who lives constantly in the conception of noble and lofty thoughts,
who dwells upon all that is pure and unselfish, will, as surely as
the sun reaches its zenith and the moon its full, become wise and
noble in character, and rise into a position of influence and
blessedness.

Achievement, of whatever kind, is the crown of effort, the diadem of
thought. By the aid of self-control, resolution, purity,
righteousness, and well-directed thought a man ascends; by the aid
of animality, indolence, impurity, corruption, and confusion of
thought a man descends.

A man may rise to high success in the world, and even to lofty
altitudes in the spiritual realm, and again descend into weakness
and wretchedness by allowing arrogant, selfish, and corrupt thoughts
to take possession of him.

Victories attained by right thought can only be maintained by
watchfulness. Many give way when success is assured, and rapidly
fall back into failure.

All achievements, whether in the business, intellectual, or
spiritual world, are the result of definitely directed thought, are
governed by the same law and are of the same method; the only
difference lies in _the object of attainment._

He who would accomplish little must sacrifice little; he who would
achieve much must sacrifice much; he who would attain highly must
sacrifice greatly.




VISIONS AND IDEALS


THE dreamers are the saviours of the world. As the visible world is
sustained by the invisible, so men, through all their trials and
sins and sordid vocations, are nourished by the beautiful visions of
their solitary dreamers. Humanity cannot forget its dreamers; it
cannot let their ideals fade and die; it lives in them; it knows
them as the _realities_ which it shall one day see and know.

Composer, sculptor, painter, poet, prophet, sage, these are the
makers of the after-world, the architects of heaven. The world is
beautiful because they have lived; without them, labouring humanity
would perish.

He who cherishes a beautiful vision, a lofty ideal in his heart,
will one day realize it. Columbus cherished a vision of another
world, and he discovered it; Copernicus fostered the vision of a
multiplicity of worlds and a wider universe, and he revealed it;
Buddha beheld the vision of a spiritual world of stainless beauty
and perfect peace, and he entered into it.

Cherish your visions; cherish your ideals; cherish the music that
stirs in your heart, the beauty that forms in your mind, the
loveliness that drapes your purest thoughts, for out of them will
grow all delightful conditions, all, heavenly environment; of these,
if you but remain true to them, your world will at last be built.

To desire is to obtain; to aspire is to, achieve. Shall man's basest
desires receive the fullest measure of gratification, and his purest
aspirations starve for lack of sustenance? Such is not the Law: such
a condition of things can never obtain: ""ask and receive.""

Dream lofty dreams, and as you dream, so shall you become. Your
Vision is the promise of what you shall one day be; your Ideal is
the prophecy of what you shall at last unveil.

The greatest achievement was at first and for a time a dream. The
oak sleeps in the acorn; the bird waits in the egg; and in the
highest vision of the soul a waking angel stirs. Dreams are the
seedlings of realities.

Your circumstances may be uncongenial, but they shall not long
remain so if you but perceive an Ideal and strive to reach it. You
cannot travel _within_ and stand still _without._ Here is a youth
hard pressed by poverty and labour; confined long hours in an
unhealthy workshop; unschooled, and lacking all the arts of
refinement. But he dreams of better things; he thinks of
intelligence, of refinement, of grace and beauty. He conceives of,
mentally builds up, an ideal condition of life; the vision of a
wider liberty and a larger scope takes possession of him; unrest
urges him to action, and he utilizes all his spare time and means,
small though they are, to the development of his latent powers and
resources. Very soon so altered has his mind become that the
workshop can no longer hold him. It has become so out of harmony
with his mentality that it falls out of his life as a garment is
cast aside, and, with the growth of opportunities, which fit the
scope of his expanding powers, he passes out of it forever. Years
later we see this youth as a full-grown man. We find him a master of
certain forces of ",100
5,"the mind, which he wields with worldwide influence
and almost unequalled power. In his hands he holds the cords of
gigantic responsibilities; he speaks, and lo, lives are changed; men
and women hang upon his words and remould their characters, and,
sunlike, he becomes the fixed and luminous centre round which
innumerable destinies revolve. He has realized the Vision of his
youth. He has become one with his Ideal.

And you, too, youthful reader, will realize the Vision (not the idle
wish) of your heart, be it base or beautiful, or a mixture of both,
for you will always gravitate toward that which you, secretly, most
love. Into your hands will be placed the exact results of your own
thoughts; you will receive that which you earn; no more, no less.
Whatever your present environment may be, you will fall, remain, or
rise with your thoughts, your Vision, your Ideal. You will become as
small as your controlling desire; as great as your dominant
aspiration: in the beautiful words of Stanton Kirkham Davis, ""You
may be keeping accounts, and presently you shall walk out of the
door that for so long has seemed to you the barrier of your ideals,
and shall find yourself before an audience--the pen still behind
your ear, the ink stains on your fingers and then and there shall
pour out the torrent of your inspiration. You may be driving sheep,
and you shall wander to the city-bucolic and open-mouthed; shall
wander under the intrepid guidance of the spirit into the studio of
the master, and after a time he shall say, 'I have nothing more to
teach you.' And now you have become the master, who did so recently
dream of great things while driving sheep. You shall lay down the
saw and the plane to take upon yourself the regeneration of the
world.""

The thoughtless, the ignorant, and the indolent, seeing only the
apparent effects of things and not the things themselves, talk of
luck, of fortune, and chance. Seeing a man grow rich, they say, ""How
lucky he is!"" Observing another become intellectual, they exclaim,
""How highly favoured he is!"" And noting the saintly character and
wide influence of another, they remark, ""How chance aids him at
every turn!"" They do not see the trials and failures and struggles
which these men have voluntarily encountered in order to gain their
experience; have no knowledge of the sacrifices they have made, of
the undaunted efforts they have put forth, of the faith they have
exercised, that they might overcome the apparently insurmountable,
and realize the Vision of their heart. They do not know the darkness
and the heartaches; they only see the light and joy, and call it
""luck"". They do not see the long and arduous journey, but only
behold the pleasant goal, and call it ""good fortune,"" do not
understand the process, but only perceive the result, and call it
chance.

In all human affairs there are _efforts,_ and there are _results,_
and the strength of the effort is the measure of the result. Chance
is not. Gifts, powers, material, intellectual, and spiritual
possessions are the fruits of effort; they are thoughts completed,
objects accomplished, visions realized.

The Vision that you glorify in your mind, the Ideal that you
enthrone in your heart--this you will build your life by, this you
will become.

SERENITY

CALMNESS of mind is one of the beautiful jewels of wisdom. It is the
result of long and patient effort in self-control. Its presence is
an indication of ripened experience, and of a more than ordinary
knowledge of the laws and operations of thought.

A man becomes calm in the measure that he understands himself as a
thought evolved being, for such knowledge necessitates the
understanding of others as the result of thought, and as he develops
a right understanding, and sees more and more clearly the internal
relations of things by the action of cause and effect he ceases to
fuss and fume and worry and grieve, and remains poised, steadfast,
serene.

The calm man, having learned how to govern himself, knows how to
adapt himself to others; and they, in turn, reverence his spiritual
strength, and feel that they can learn of him and rely upon him. The
more tranquil a man becomes, the greater is his success, his
influence, his power for good. Even the ordinary trader will find
his business prosperity increase as he develops a greater
self-control and equanimity, for people will always prefer to deal
with a man whose demeanour is strongly equable.

The strong, calm man is always loved and revered. He is like a
shade-giving tree in a thirsty land, or a sheltering rock in a
storm. ""Who does not love a tranquil heart, a sweet-tempered,
balanced life? It does not matter whether it rains or shines, or
what changes come to those possessing these blessings, for they are
always sweet, serene, and calm. That exquisite poise of character,
which we call serenity is the last lesson of culture, the fruitage
of the soul. It is precious as wisdom, more to be desired
than gold--yea, than even fine gold. How insignificant mere money
seeking looks in comparison with a serene life--a life that dwells
in the ocean of Truth, beneath the waves, beyond the reach of
tempests, in the Eternal Calm!

""How many people we know who sour their lives, who ruin all that is
sweet and beautiful by explosive tempers, who destroy their poise of
character, and make bad blood! It is a question whether the great
majority of people do not ruin their lives and mar their happiness
by lack of self-control. How few people we meet in life who are well
balanced, who have that exquisite poise which is characteristic of
the finished character!

Yes, humanity surges with uncontrolled passion, is tumultuous with
ungoverned grief, is blown about by anxiety and doubt only the wise
man, only he whose thoughts are controlled and purified, makes the
winds and the storms of the soul obey him.

Tempest-tossed souls, wherever ye may be, under whatsoever
conditions ye may live, know this in the ocean of life the isles of
Blessedness are smiling, and the sunny shore of your ideal awaits
your coming. Keep your hand firmly upon the helm of thought. In the
bark of your soul reclines the commanding Master; He does but sleep:
wake Him. Self-control is strength; Right Thought is mastery;
Calmness is power. Say unto your heart, ""Peace, be still!""

INTERVIEWER: Hi, I???m the most important person you need to meet right now.ME: Hi, I???m extremely insecure, but I???m going to pretend I???m confident and know things so that you might be fooled and hire me.INTERVIEWER: Great! I???m going to pretend that I don???t know what you???re doing and go along with your guise of being confident. You pretend really well!ME: Thank you so much! I???ve been honing my pretending skills for a while. I???ve had several of these interviews and some of them have even resulted in actual jobs.INTERVIEWER: That???s wonderful, but I don???t actually care. Let???s get started. Tell me about yourself.ME: You know how much I hate that question, but I???m going to give you a fabricated answer based on what you want to hear??? I think?INTERVIEWER: That???s impressive! Now I???m going to ask you some questions that I think will totally fuck you up.ME: I thought you might do that. I???ve prepared a monologue from Hamlet just in case you wanted to hear it. Do you want to hear it?INTERVIEWER: No.ME: Okay. Now, I???m going to ask you how much you???re going to pay me. I???m extremely uncomfortable about this. Can you tell?INTERVIEWER: I can tell and I???m so excited that you feel awkward. It pleases me more than I can express on my face. Can you see",100
6," it through the passive aggressive language I???m using?ME: I can see it yes. Can I ask you how much you will pay me?INTERVIEWER: You can, but I won???t really answer you with a real answer. I???ll tell you that we will pay you based upon how much you KNOW. You do know things right?ME: I know some things, but some of them are not things that help me work in social media. Should I tell you about those things? Animals love me.INTERVIEWER: Let???s focus on your strengths. What would you say are your strongest qualities.ME: Decoding bullshit questions like these?INTERVIEWER: That???s great! Okay, well it???s been great getting to know you. I???m going to pretend like you???ll hear from me, but actually we???re never ever going to call you. Okay?ME: Okay.INTERVIEWER: I just want you to be clear on the fact that you didn???t get this job, but I???m pretending that you got it. You understand?ME: I think so.INTERVIEWER: Don???t ever call us.ME: All right.INTERVIEWER: You are a great person!ME: Um???INTERVIEWER: Wonderful meeting you.ME: Yeah???INTERVIEWER: See you on the street then?ME: Bye.INTERVIEWER: We might call you. Just kidding!ME: That???s not funny.INTERVIEWER: Oh, I think it???s hilarious.Goddamnit. Are you seriously still not in bed? All I ask is just to have this little window of time in my evenings to lay on the couch and idly scroll through whatever catches my interest, which tonight happens to be Badfinger???s Wikipedia page.Oh, you???ve never heard of Badfinger? That???s probably because you???re too busy getting out of the bed I???ve tucked you into five times to know that they were the first band signed by the Beatles label and one of the originators of Power Pop.Did you know that Badfinger released their first album as The Iveys, and Tony Visconti produced several of the tracks? Well, I don???t know it either, because you keep interrupting me every goddamn time I get to that part of the page.I???m not going to pretend what I???m doing is the most important thing in the world. I should probably be reading something from that stack of books over there I???ve never even touched. But the fact is, after an entire day of dealing with you and your brother???s bullshit, my intellectual capacity pretty much tops out at Badfinger???s Wikipedia page.If I???m being perfectly honest with you, my plan when I collapsed onto this couch was to watch three or four episodes of Tiny House Hunters, but the remote is all the way over there on the bookshelf, and so here we are.Yes, I understand you came all the way downstairs to tell me your brother is awake too. Did you know Badfinger came all the way from Wales to make their mark on the London rock scene of the late 1960s? I???m not trying to compare you or say your problems aren???t valid, but only one of you went on to write ???Day After Day.???Oh, you can???t find your blanky? Well, I guess that is a tragedy. Of course, it???s nothing like the tragedy that befell Badfinger, what with the suicides of both Pete Ham and Tom Evans. So, you know, maybe think about that toxic stew of fame and then anonymity, mixed with mental illness and substance abuse, before you go all nuclear about this blanky situation.Fine. I will come upstairs one more time, and I will read you one more book. But when I am done, so help me God, if you come out of that room before I read this section on latter-day reunions and reissues, I am going to lose my shit.1. Briefly2. Faintly3. Infrequently4.

Never-ishQ: You sold meat out of the back of a pickup truck. How did it start?A: I have a younger brother???he???s three years younger???and he stumbled into it and was making good money.I had graduated college and I had a degree in advertising. I was assistant manager at Musicland at the mall.Q: And a Musicland assistant manager didn???t make much money?A: Yeah, I was making minimum wage. And my brother was making good money. Or relatively good money.Q: I have to ask???did you have posters in your room that you got from the record store?A: No, the music selection there was pretty mainstream and I was more into punk and weirder stuff, so I never saw any posters come through that I actually wanted.Q: OK sorry, back to the meat job.A: OK. It was a small company called Texas Pride. It was a small warehouse with some freezers and five to six pickup trucks. There were freezers in the bed of the trucks and they had gas-powered generators to keep it cool, so you could go across the state and be out pretty much all day.You were an independent contractor and you went door-to-door.You have a variety of meats???like eight to 10 cases. There were vacuum-sealed packs of pork chops, strip steaks, Delmonico ribeye, fillet mignon wrapped in bacon, chicken breast, and hamburger patties.Q: Was that the exact list? A: Yes.Q: That???s impressive, since so many years have passed. Did you know what Delmonico ribeye was?A: It???s like a different cut???like a round steak and it has more marbling.Q: Did you know a lot about steak before you took this job?A: You don???t have to know a lot about steak. It was very by the book. Door-to-door hardcore sales tactics. We???d have pep rallies in the morning before we???d head out.We would do this roleplaying thing, like, ???Kevin I want you to walk up to my door and sell me some steak.??? And I???d say ???Hey, I???m with Texas Pride out of Akron??????And here???s the funny thing. The warehouse was a block away from the Frito-Lay distribution center so we were told to say that we were right next door to Frito-Lay. That???s a name that everybody knows and it was supposed to establish credibility with the customer.Q: But you had no association with Frito Lay?A: No.Q: OK so you???re having these pep rallies.A: Yeah. There was one salesman who was like the leader and his name was Johnny Walker, just like the whiskey. He was right out of a movie. He had suspenders, gray hair??? He was a grizzled old chain smoker.They called selling a whole case ???a full banger??? and he would say, ???I don???t care if some old lady has one foot in a grave and the other foot on a banana peel. I want you to sell her as many full bangers as you can!???Q: Wait, why would she have her foot on a banana peel?A: It was his crass way of describing how old she was ???that she could go at any moment.Q: Oh, got it. Geeze. OK, so tell me more about Johnny Walker.A: He was just kind of looked at like the leader. He had sold encyclopedias, vacuum cleaners, he was just a real salesman. He had all the typical objections for door-to-door sales and ways of overcoming those objections.I was no salesman???I certainly wasn???t the type to strike up conversations with strangers. More often than not, when you???d come to someone???s front door offering to sell them meat out of a pickup truck, they would look at you like you???re crazy.I???m 46 now and I???m in advertising and a lot of advertising is sales, so that job was the best training. It was an invaluable experi",100
7,"ence.Q: I have friends who would buy a whole cow and have it in their freezer.A: That was a pretty common objection, like we buy a quarter cow or we buy half a cow, and we???d say, ???Sir, let me tell you! You???re paying for bone and for parts of the cow that you???re not going to eat! We take care of all that extra waste and give you vacuum-sealed packages with just the meat!??? And then we flash it in front of their face and get them licking their chops.Q: And people would buy it?A: Yes.The worst thing I ever did was at an older woman???s house??? I feel terrible telling you this, I would never do this as an adult???She was in her 60s and she probably weighed 300 pounds. She said she didn???t have money on her but that she had money at the bank. She was a shut-in and I told her I could drive her to the bank. I piled her into my pickup truck and I even helped her write the check.It was all above board though; she was there and she agreed to it.I remember I had trouble fitting all the meat into the freezer. But I was able to close the sale.Q: Eek. So you just drove around trying to sell meat.A: Yeah, but we had a buddy system, which was good because there were days you were having a bad run and nobody was biting or you were tapped out and just didn???t feel like selling, so we would just try to entertain ourselves. Especially if somebody was rude to you.We???d say to them, ???Do you like steak and chicken???? And they???d say, ???Well yeah!???And I???d give them a little info but the whole point was to get the meat in front of them to close the sale. When they realized what I was doing they???d say, ???Get off my property!??? And we???d say, ???Well I???ve got a case of crabs???would you like to see that????Sometimes they would get it and sometimes not.Another thing we would do to entertain each other???you had to run back to the truck and hop up on the bed, open the freezer, throw the case of meat over your shoulder, and hop back off again. We would see who could pull off the most ridiculous pratfall coming back off the truck.I would put a case of meat on my shoulder and practically do a cartwheel off the edge of the truck with the case of meat flying everywhere. I would be on the ground, bellowing in pain, pretending that I had twisted my ankle. And I would yell, ???I don???t have insurance and I think I twisted my ankle.??? We were just stupid kids.Q: How long did you do this job?A: I just did it for the summer. It was a very taxing job.The place didn???t exist for more than a few years. I remember driving by one day, a few years afterward, and it was already gone.For a nice long time, we???ve had something to hold onto. And by ???we,??? I mean those of us who take seriously our role as worriers. Sure, we could blithely go about our days. And, yes, it???s true that very little is accomplished vis-??-vis Hillary???s poll numbers by my getting a stress-induced tummy ache.Nevertheless! I absolutely reject the idea that I should be one of those unconcerned souls, like my cousin in-law, who told me, ???Why gnaw your arm off about it???? She said this over a soft-serve outside Dairy Queen, while also bantering with her kid. For shame!To think that she can live her life smiling, never bothered by attacks of crippling anxiety, the tendency to shout and rave at loved ones or the proclivity to hyperventilation. What kind of example is she setting? Is her husband embarrassed? I would be.???Volunteer!??? people say. Do they understand nothing at all? If the American people can???t make the right choice without my help, what???s even the point? Also, I???m not even sure I want Hillary to win. So why would I volunteer? This is about feeling the deep unrest and corruption (yes, corruption) that we as a society are experiencing and transmuting it into a personal and diffuse unease that tags me as someone burdened by the sad knowledge of our collective failing.Worriers know: we must share the most distressing bits of news each day. The world at large needs to understand how shitty it is. We take to Twitter hourly, we???ve posted in-depth discourses on Facebook ??? we???re doing our part.  I even brought up the latest news on bee colony collapse to my barista, who was confused by my order of a sugar-free Italian soda, which is really just a Perrier.Certainly, this election ??? Donald and Hillary, thank you! ??? has been a long, 18-month opportunity to express indignation, to get stress-hives and to be distracted and unproductive at work. Yet it seems most people are hell-bent on living their lives, content to research the candidates in their area and then vote based on their preferences. A real moralist would be anxious about Indiana???s Senate race and a gubernatorial situation in North Carolina. And I am!But when this election is over, where will my sense of greater connection come from? Glad you asked! There are some concerns I???ve put on the back-burner that might soon take a starring role. For example, it???s not often I bite down hard. But, when I really clench my teeth and look in the mirror, my mandible looks a little crooked, like I have a micro-tumor on my jaw-hinge. Cancer? Who knows? Come late November, I will start Web-MDing.However, why should I be so selfish and confine my worries to just my problems? Global warming is something that affects us all. Mass species extinctions, Miami Beach totally underwater, constant hurricanes. Sleepless nights await as I consider whether California is in permanent drought and if increased exposure to UV rays will cause a spike in skin cancer. Who says I don???t think about the community?And, speaking of community, the ash borer is coming to town. That???s something ??? but local officials are already concerned. As any pro knows, it???s harder to get into a good lather when there are reasoned PDFs shared with the public on why we???ll replant with a different, hardier species. That kind of takes the fun out of it.Instead, I could go shut-in style. For three decades, my uncle has been afraid to go out at night for fear he???ll be mugged or murdered. I sometimes get on my high-horse and call him racist (someone has to do it), but I respect the level of fear he harbors. That said, who is he worrying about? Himself. And how is he sharing his worry with the broader community? He???s not. Tsk! He probably just likes watching prime time. And I do think he???s racist. So for my next principal worry, it looks like global warming! A daunting challenge, but a worry I can take on.Or, maybe, just maybe, the election results will be so horrifying that I???ll be able to coast on concern for what our country has come to. What a gift that would be!  (When you???ve had an 18-month worry, it???s hard to let go.) Either way, the brilliance of worrying: you may never know what will come next, but you???re already prepared because you???re already worried.It???s only natural to be unhappy. The human body is just a bunch of easily broken bones, several useless emotions, a dozen or so organs waiting to get cancer, and a single drop of that chemical that makes you feel good but is only released when you die.But just because there is literally no reason to be alive doesn???t mean we can???t all eke out a few seconds of personal contentment in between savage bouts of melancholy. The next time you???re feeling low (which should be right now/all the time if you???re paying any attention), hand yourself one of these awards for succeeding at the little things. No one else is going to give you one:1. For those with realistic fitness goals:2. If you???ve shared something online before confirming it:3. Congrats to all the true artists out there:4. When supporti",100
8,"ng trendy urban farms turns into a hassle:5. For realizing that honesty is actually an awful policy:6. When you???ve made a crucial financial decision:7. And when you need to face a harsh truth:I???m soooo sorry I haven???t been to brunch in a while. I miss you girls!!! With my internship at a boutique start-up during the day and my indoor cycling classes at night, my schedule has been cray. What am I drinking? Oh this, it???s super good. It???s from the Smoothie Believers place around the corner. You girls have to try it. I first stopped by because I was mostly thirsty but also a little hungry. And the Smoothie Believers, they took me in, and we???re a family now.What? Val! It is not a cult! It???s just a super delicious smoothie place! Their berry smoothie is so good, it???s got blueberries, blackberries, raspberries and they mix it with the most delicious almond butter and also we all get new names. You guys know me as ???Kimberly??? but next week I???ll be ???Kale Pear Banana Cashew Butter Splash of Stevia,??? and the crazy thing is it feels like that???s always been my name.So, what have you girls been up to? Beach vacay? Fun! I have been so busy running around, liquidating my assets, and filling up my smoothie punch card. Yeah, you heard me correctly ??? the Smoothie Believers have a PUNCH CARD! Once you buy ten smoothies you get entered into a sweepstakes to go on a cruise!! It???s amazeballs. They put all the winners on a ship and take them out to sea and then you spend the next six years diving for watermelons. The Smoothie Believers know that???s where melons really come from, the water. And the government is trying to cover it up. Think about it, why would they call them watermelons if they didn???t come from water? I can???t wait to go. Everyone who comes back from the cruise looks so healthy and so quiet.Hmmm??? that???s a good question, Val.  That???s definitely something to ask the Smoothie General.  He loves logic puzzles. The Smoothie General? He???s the manager of the store but he also carriers a machete. He???s sooo cute. He was born in a bushel of strawberries and he???s got eight wives, same as the number of grapes you can hold in one hand.  We should stop by there after brunch cuz he???d love to meet you girls! Plus, I bet he???ll give you some free swag. The Smoothie Believers have the best swag. They just got these new tanks that are made of a super light microfiber with the image of a skull and cross bones but it???s super cute because the scull is actually a pineapple and the bone parts are very accurate renderings of human bones.

They say it???s like we???re watching the rise of Hitler or Mussolini, but in our own backyard. I???m sure that one day, when the battle is won, my grandchildren will ask me, ???Grandpa, what did you do to help defeat Donald Trump and fight the rise of fascism in America???? And I know I???ll be able to sit them down and proudly tell them that I wrote some really clever tweets.I took on this hateful movement of racism and xenophobia with multiple social media posts of less than 140 characters. Sometimes, I would even mention Trump directly so he could read them himself. My dozens of followers would stare at their phones with bated breath, waiting for my brilliant commentary that was not only profound, but often quite funny too. I bet I swayed some undecided voters, and I wouldn???t be surprised if a few Trump supporters changed their ways as well.The Greatest Generation stormed the beaches at Normandy, marching into unimaginable violence as they liberated a continent from tyranny. They rationed resources on the home-front to help the war effort. They came together as one, setting aside personal differences to save the world. They gave their lives so others could experience the freedom and liberty we so often take for granted. Just as they sacrificed, I wrote pithy remarks on the internet. I didn???t know if people would agree with me. My opinions were controversial and unfiltered. I could???ve lost friends, or worse: followers. Yet I knew I had to do the right thing and be on the right side of history. In a way, I now understand what those brave men and women went through during World War II. You must answer the call when your country is in need.Perhaps I???m being too modest. I could tell my grandkids that I also wrote some Facebook posts and would Snapchat my friends during the debates with captions like ???LOL Trump what are you smoking?!??? I could tell them about my nightmares, where I???m back on my couch, checking my Twitter notifications only to find that nobody liked my latest tweet. But I will tell them that I was just doing what any good citizen would do, and that a time comes in everyone???s life when they must decide whether to fight back against hatred and persecution or simply put down their iPhones and accept the status quo.When you???re old, you don???t want to look back and wonder, Could I have done more? You don???t want to shamefully tell your grandchildren that you did nothing as the American experiment faltered. If you aren???t doing anything to challenge Trump and his horrible ideas, you need to stop reading this and pick up your phone. Sign in to Twitter and get to work.

That???s my naked three-year-old jumping on the trampoline in your backyard. I just happened to notice last week that he really hit it off with your two daughters and I thought, well, heck, this is it! We???ve arrived! This is the village of 9- and 11-year-old girls it will take to raise my child!When we first moved to this neighborhood I had high hopes. I have always dreamed of finding that spirit of the old African proverb: ???Omwana ni wa bhone,??? which means It takes a village of pretty much anyone other than myself to raise my child, wherever we end up. Before now, I have asked myself countless times over the course of my son???s life, WTF? Where is our village? How will I manage to do this on my own, with only my husband and the nice ladies at the daycare to take care of little Mylo 40 hours per week? And our regular babysitter who comes every Friday and Saturday evening from 6 to 10 so Rick and I can go out for dinner and a movie? And my mother-in-law who comes every Saturday afternoon from 12 to 6 so I can have some me time? And the mother???s helper who comes every Sunday from 12 to 6 to take Mylo outside, away from me, while my husband enjoys his man time? And my sister who brings Mylo food when Rick and I are out of town? And the nice young people who work in the Sm??land at Ikea, where I try to go two evenings per week so I can enjoy the ambience of the furniture displays, a nice plate of meatballs, and a cinnamon roll without having to think so much about the location of my child. ???He is in Sm??land,??? I can whisper to myself periodically, and forget about him until it is time to leave. Except one time I whispered the phrase to myself so many times it lost all meaning and I didn???t actually think about him until I got home and I noticed around bedtime that he wasn???t there, but that???s another story. If I had had the village then that I have now??? ah, well, it doesn???t matter anymore, now, does it? Everyone is together again and that???s what matters.Yes, dear neighbors, I have had no village to help me raise this child, with the occasional exception of the nice people from the DSS. Until now.Do you see how Mylo so joyfully flings his body off the trampoline, and gets right back on it and does it again, and again, and again? This is the synergy of a three year old boy with 9- and 11-year old girls watching over him. It is a thing of beauty. Your daughters react with such concern ??? this is exactly what is needed in today???s world! It really does take a village. And I hope they???ve taken their first aid courses ??? especially the bits about choking and compound fractures. I???ve found those to be the most helpful in my own experience, because as you can see, Mylo loves to jump and eat. Jump and eat, jump and eat. That???s what THAT little villager does. Oh, Mylo!Don???t worry about him peeing on the trampoline as he just did; it will rain soon and everything will wash away. And yes, sometimes he flings his feces but that???s only when you really pressure him to use the toilet. Just don???t pressure him, girls, and everyone and everything will theoretically be clean. But also??? if you could have him completely potty trained in the next two weeks that would be awesome. It really does take a village to potty train a child, don???t you agree?I love to give Mylo as many opportunities as possible to be independent. So don???t be surprised if he shows up at your door in the middle of the night wanting to climb into your beds from time to time. I told him he can???t climb into mine anymore when I???m home but of course he???s always welcome to check with the other villagers, as it were. How???s that for independence? Right? That???s what all that doorbell ringing was about last night. If you would just answer the door straight away, or better yet, leave it unlocked, he could just climb right in and snuggle up with one of the girls, like a wiggly warm animal.  I think of Mylo as a cute little kitten that everyone secretly wishes would visit their homes.Also sometimes Rick has a business/leisure trip that overlaps with my own business/leisure trips so we just remember to put a box of Alphabits out for Mylo and he???s pretty good about entertaining himself for a day or two until one of us gets home. We don???t like to leave him on his own for much longer than that, but sometimes something unexpected comes up and we???re delayed. This did not always go over so well in our old neighborhood, as nobody seemed to understand that it really really does take a village to raise our child except for perhaps the nice, yet grouchy, som",100

If there???s one thing I can say about them, it???s this: they really step up when it???s time to be the village. Surprise!So, neighbor, I???m so grateful for your albeit very small village ??? but a village nonetheless ??? of two nine and eleven-year-old daughters, who will now have the honor of helping me raise this child. I???ll send him over later with a rubber sheet and a box of Alphabits to get you started. Omwana ni wa bhone, amigos!When you see something about the world that you don???t like, and that doesn???t fit with your ideas of justice, it???s important that you take a stand against it.  That???s why, when I looked at stats and read stories about inequality between men and women, about violence against women, and about how even in small, daily encounters, women are treated unfairly, I thought, ???This isn???t right.  I should become a nice guy.???  So that???s what I did.  And a lot has changed for me.My days of hooting at women on the street are over.  My days of hollering at women in hospitals and at church cookouts are long gone.  I now understand that a party might be an appropriate place to strike up a conversation with a woman, but a public bus that has been hijacked and will explode if it goes slower than 55 miles per hour quite simply isn???t.  Even if the police save us, slipping her my phone number while she is talking to reporters and quietly sobbing is inappropriateWhen a woman treats me rudely, I no longer assume it must be because of her hormones.  Instead, I take into account the fact that I am in the middle of an intersection, am dancing a jig, and have been blocking traffic for well over forty-five minutes.  The traffic-blocking jig, though full of masculine, poetic energy, might have something to do with her curt tone.In the workplace, I am trying to be a better listener.  When a woman disagrees with one of my ideas, I no longer think that it must be because she is ugly, lonely, and secretly in love with me.  Instead, I consider the possibility that a competing company already executed the idea I mentioned, it poisoned eighty-nine children, and now that company is banned in twelve states and the E.U.  Often, on days when I listen closely like this, I reward myself with a treat, like takeout from an expensive restaurant.  It isn???t a big deal ??? I have a very large salary.  I???m one of those nice guys.Romance can be a bit confusing for us nice guys.  Sometimes I hear that women like tough, macho men who have a hint of danger about them, and other times I hear women like sensitive, kind, funny guys who would make good long-term partners.  It???s possible to ask a woman on a first date what kind of partner she???s looking for, but women tend to talk for hours nonstop if you let them, so I???ve taken to splitting the difference.  I???ll open the door to a restaurant for a woman, then close it in her face and punch a wall.  I???ll offer to pay for the meal, then when the check comes I???ll light a napkin on fire and disappear out a bathroom window.  Sometimes I???ll text back the next day, other times it will be months and I???ll explain that I???ve changed my name and moved to Argentina.  This system has worked surprisingly well.  I???ve had over twenty-five first dates in the past year.In a certain way, I understand women better than I understand men.Although women are less intelligent than men and have more frivolous interests, a nice guy like me should never point that out.  Take fashion, for instance.  Men know that you should dress in a way that is utilitarian, modestly hip, and inexpensive.  That???s where my sweatpantsuit idea came from.  Women think you should spend every waking hour researching new trends and shopping.  Pinterest!  Websites!  Crazy, I know ??? but I don???t point out that I think it???s crazy because I???m nice.  So when my female neighbor asks me if those are mustard stains on my sweatshirt and if the hole in my seat can perhaps be patched and if this is truly the life I imagined for myself, I don???t get angry or frustrated.  I just feel superior.  I???m a nice guy.When a nice guy like me disagrees with a woman or doesn???t like how he???s being treated, what should he do?  Women like being the center of attention, so if you point out how you feel uncomfortable or disrespected, they???ll likely make the discussion about how they don???t like how they???re being treated ??? and all of a sudden you???re the bad guy.  No, the best tactic is a bit of judo: use their strength???the ability to get people to feel sorry for them ??? against them.  Instead of explaining why you???re upset using reasons and logic, simply start crying.  Silent, slow tears at first, and then big, heaving wails.  Their nurturing instinct will kick in, they will comfort you, and if you mention a memory of your dead father, you just won every argument for the next week.  It doesn???t matter that your father is still alive and is coming to visit for your birthday ??? what matters is that he feels dead in that moment.  See, a nice guy never has to argue to get his way.But that???s not all I have to do as a nice guy.  For instance, I am single, and it is important for me to explain to others that the reason I???m single is not because I am boring, have trouble relating to women, am privately prejudiced, and use niceness as a cover for thoughts that are hyper-sexualized and misogynistic.  No, the reason I???m single is because I am too nice!  It???s counterintuitive, so a nice guy like me needs to explain this to women in a way that is verbose and dumbed down.  Together, we can all make the world a better place for women, and the only thing we have to do is act on generalizations based on myths handed down by sexists who stand to gain economically and politically from systemic and social oppression.- -Chas Gillespie is the personal assistant of Dayn Rond, whose latest romance novel, Mr. Trump Meets Mr. Putin, is available now.1. The first step to speaking Your Truth is to really want Your Truth ??? your raw, pulsing, bona fide truth that has been trapped inside the clam of your body for too long! Let her out, baby! Hunger for Your Truth. Masturbate to Your Truth. Consider this multistep plan an imaginary couples retreat on a luxury Catamaran guaranteed to forever change your relationship with Your Truth or your money back. Imagine yourself on a tandem bicycle with Your Truth at sunrise, with no particular destination in mind, because it doesn???t matter, as long as you are with Your Truth. Dream of yourself sharing ChapStick and drawing circles on Your Truth???s skin because you are that fucking intimate with Your Truth. Soon you will be popping Your Truth???s pimple before it even knows it is there because you just get each other, that???s all2. OK, this luxury Catamaran to destination Speak Your Truth is gliding full speed ahead! Now it???s time for step two of this plan: cut out all the fat of your life (non-truth) to find Your Truth. First, quit your job immediately with no backup plan because you deserve a self-made maternity leave to divinely gestate Your Truth. Then divorce (or murder if more convenient) your husband and the definitely inauthentic life you built together for Your Truth. Next forget to call your mother in law on her birthday but then remember it doesn???t matter because you just divorced/murderer your husband for Your Truth. (See now things are clicking into place, which means you are on the path of Truth.) You???re almost speaking Your Truth! Burn down your house (of lies) because",100
12," Your Truth knows your needs more than you do and move back in with your parents. (If you???ve reached this step, you???re doing really well!) Develop amnesia for the life you lived before Your Truth came along and be grateful for it. Trust me when I say that you will be so much happier after this. Soon you will be vibrating at a frequency that only dogs can see.3. Do you hear that, TruthBoat? It???s the truth knocking. Open the door. Hold it. Put Your Truth in your mouth. Eat it. Feel it rattle in your throat. Feel it beg to come out. Speak it. Yes, speak it. I said speak it. Did you hear me? LET OUT YOUR RAW, DRIPPING, AUTHENTIC, TRANSLUCENT, TRIPLE FACT-CHECKED TRUTH. You???ve followed this multistep plan to a T and it shows because you are speaking Your Truth. Never will a non-truth escape your lips. Soak in Your Truth! Lavish in her. Make a Himalayan salt scrub with her and gift her to your friends when the moment feels true. Fact-check her a fourth time just for fun. Eat her and vomit her and eat her again in an eternal, authentic loop. (Notice that she uses ???she??? pronouns now because she is you and you are her.)  Every time your lips part, you radiate truth onto beings of lower frequencies (all non-dogs). Soon you will rid yourself of this guide and all your clothes because you are so enrobed in Your Truth. Everywhere you go, people will say, ???There goes the woman who speaks her Truth???4. To celebrate speaking Your Truth, force your mom to take a photo of your naked backside draped in sunlight/truth as you blow a bubble into the misty morning air and caption it #speakingmytruth. This photo isn???t for anyone but you and Your Truth and your 839 Instagram followers, who, unlike you and dogs, are living sad, compromised lives in the shadow of their truths.5. If thoughts of your late husband ever surface your mind, just suppress them and keep Speaking Your Truth.I know we have emailed and transferred calls to each other.

Over the past year, I???ve come to recognize the people she calls by their voices and consider them ???friends of a friend.???  And they should receive some sort of courtesy.  Monica???s preferred phone booth is, of course, the handicap stall.  Whether or not we want it, Monica brings everyone into the personal business of her daughter???s daycare schedule, her diabetic cat, and other family issues.  The least Monica could do is allow someone the glorious privilege of access to the most spacious stall.  And refusing to grant that, then maybe she should be a little more wiling to take advice from others during lunch break.  She???s brought a lot of women in on her niece???s behavior problems and the contents of what your tabby hacked-up that morning.  We are women. We like to give our opinion.

There are those who try to make it through the whole day in an attempt to only use their home toilet but just didn???t quite make it and expel an excited ???AAHhhh?????? around 4:42 pm.  And let us not forget the multitude who go to the bathroom merely to stretch their legs and send a few text messages.  I know all of these types.  And I know who falls under which category based on her foot attire??? which has also made me quite aware of who???s phone I should never ever EVER touch, no matter what cute puppy and baby picture is being shared.I once thought the women who freely used the bathroom for all its intended plumbing design were simply the worst.  There was a time I when I was so appalled by how selfish the coworkers with the gluten intolerances took command over the ladies??? bathroom.  They produced sounds like amateur beat-boxers and odors that sent us all jumping off the docks like unsuspecting Parisians who crossed paths with Pepe Le Pew.  This applied to the vegan in IT as well.  Although, I learned my disgust was really just masked jealousy.  While waiting for everyone to leave the bathroom, so my business could commence, I self-reflected.  After all, I???m a multitasker by nature.  It was during a moment of pinching tightly when I came to realize that it wasn???t disgust over those women who could be so free-wheeling in making their waste buckets, but rather envy that I was too ashamed to do the same.  Why didn???t I have the chutzpah to let my freak flag fly?  Throw caution to the wind?  Get on with your bad self!But you, Cindy, have gone much too far.  Yours is a behavior of which I do not encourage nor wish I possessed.  How can you possibly expect me to listen to your report, even though it slightly improves my chance for an additional 1.2% salary increase next quarter?  I???m far too preoccupied by your deviant behavior.  Did you have time to notice what I was doing in the bathroom when we locked eyes?  Was I tidying-up or in the moment of expelling that awful Green Mountain Keurig coffee that we so besmirched earlier that week?  Did you notice my undergarment and silently ridicule it ???or un-silently ridicule it to other employees?  Do I wear the Wild Mountain Blueberry of underwear?  Did you just say ???terrible Keurig coffee??? or am I hearing things?  Wait, what was on that last PowerPoint slide? It was a blueberry, wasn???t it?  Wasn???t it?!?!  Great, the peeing-peeping Tom has made a mockery of me.  This presentation is very good.  But maybe the presentation began behind the closed door to the women???s rest room.  Enjoy your sixteen cent raise.  The victory is yours, Cindy.Hello, distant acquaintances! Have you heard they???re having another election? It???s true! You know I???m a levelheaded fellow without a strong party preference or political ideology, but I pride myself on doing my homework before participating in this sacred institution of American democracy. And by that I mean that I read your Facebook and Twitter posts. The good news is that I???m just now starting to pay attention to this crazy horserace we call an election, and my openness to new points of view is rivaled only by my delicate, morally conventional sense of propr",100
13,"iety, so I sure hope nothing shocking or unconventional has transpired!Have you heard about Donald Trump? From what I???ve gathered, he???s a successful businessman who used to have a popular TV show! What???s next, a Hollywood movie star as president?? Oh wait, I think we already had one ??? so I guess that means Trump is a lot like Reagan, a president who is remembered with universal fondness? I would certainly be taken aback if a prominent family member or former colleague of Reagan???s made a passionate case to the contrary ??? such an unexpected turn of events would cause me to reassess my torpid openness to a Trump presidency!Still, success in the world of real estate sounds like a solid basis for becoming our Commander in Chief, wouldn???t you say? From what I???ve been able to gather from glancing at muted cable news channels while drinking in safari-themed airport bars, Trump fits the bill. I guess the only way so solid a case could be undermined were if a prominent economist or public intellectual published an editorial opposing Trump, or arguing that he hasn???t actually been successful at all, given his privileged background. But what are the odds of that, and even if it had happened, where could I find such editorials? I???m lost!Speaking of editorials, if you???re like me, you allow the people who edit major newspapers to make most of the key decisions in your life. Who knows ??? one of them might be Superman! Imagine if an historically conservative paper, instead of endorsing the Republican candidate as one would almost certainly expect, actually endorsed the Democrat! I would involuntarily spit my milk out on my spouse, who is also on the fence about whom to vote for this year.But if there???s one thing that I won???t compromise on it???s respect for women. Call me old fashioned, but I believe it???s never appropriate to call women fat pigs, make public reference to their menstruations, or unexpectedly grab them by the nethers. And that goes double for former Miss. Universe winners! But I have no reason to think Donald Trump figures into this discussion at all, and frankly I can???t think of anyone in the White House who???d set a better example for women and girls. I wish that I could!Free trade and immigration are also important issues to me, though I couldn???t tell you exactly how or why. I just know something has to be done! But my steadfast moral compass means any instance of bigotry or intolerance are absolute deal-breakers ??? right up there with insulting Vietnam-era POWs, or mocking the disabled. Any idea where I might find information about whether any of the candidates have exhibited such troubling character flaws? It might make the difference in this election were I to see someone post an article about it!I guess staying well-informed is harder than I thought, but with your guys??? help, I???m sure I???ll figure this out eventually. The important thing to remember is that people like me absolutely exist and are in no way a figment of your imagination! So when you???re posting half a dozen Trump articles per day, you and I know it???s because you???re a true patriot, and not just a leech on whatever dwindling pleasure social media brings to your friends??? wretched lives.Sincerely,Undecided (but still thinking Trump is a pretty solid choice ??? prove me wrong!)P.S.

You see, I used to cast my vote for the candidate who seemed like someone I could have a beer with. That was all fine and good back then, but times have changed. I???m now looking for a candidate who tells it like it is.Can you help me?I???m searching for a candidate who uses short sentences with simple words, like maybe one to three words max. Because, hi, regular American people don???t think or talk in paragraphs. Also, none of this long form mumbo jumbo about ???actual policies??? or ???literally just give us even two details about how you???ll achieve any of this tremendous, classy magic you claim you???ll perform on this country??? Show me a candidate who speaks plain ??? and I mean real plain ??? E-N-G-L-I-S-H!Preferably this dream candidate would repeat the most meaningless stock phrases over and over again, to the delight of the Ku Klux Klan and roadside sign makers everywhere. I???d especially feel favorable towards a candidate who doubles down on insults when cornered. Heard of anyone like that?I???m looking for a candidate who can bring sexism and misogyny out of the shadows and into the bright light of day. I???m hoping this candidate will make many, many remarks about women???s bodies and faces and what???s good and not good about them. I know what you???re thinking, you???re probably wondering, ???Wait, aren???t YOU a woman???? and while liberals like to throw around the phrase ???internalized misogyny??? when they meet me, I just tell them that that sounds like something they should have checked out at the clinic. I should know, I was just there. Anyway, if you know of anyone who could put women down in about a hundred different ways and make them feel incredibly unsafe and concerned about the future, sign me up.Related to that, I like a candidate who puts women in their place because I???m a woman and I seriously need someone to tell me what my place is. Is my place here? Is it over there? Someone tell me! I???m also open to suggestions of where I could be grabbed without my consent. I???d personally assume ???arm,??? but I???m ready for a highly immoral and illegal game changer of an answer. To add on to that, I would owe you big time if you could recommend a candidate who has a creepy and public attraction to one of his daughters while publicly shunning his other daughter. That???d just be perfect. Here, write his name down on this Post-it note here.I???m hoping to find a candidate who brings back what used to make America great ??? belittling people. It was funny in 8th grade and it???s funny now! So if you could track down a candidate who likes to insult people when it comes to their gender, race, ethnicity, physical ability, marriage status, eggheadedness and/or even just their imaginary slights, comments, or qualities, I???d really appreciate it. Bonus points if the mood created by those insults also carries with it a halo of future physical harm by this candidate???s supporters. Bring all that great American stuff back and my vote is as good as cast.I???m also in the market for a candidate who lies and I do mean LIES. None of this little white lies business or political ???spin,??? I???m looking for a candidate who really puts his back into it. You know, someone who doesn???t know how to wear pants that aren???t completely engulfed in fire. The kind of candidate who just smirks, tells a lie that quite literally everyone knows is a lie, and then leans back and watches his favorability ratings go up. Know anyone like that? If so, please write his name on this piece of paper and slide it across the table to me like we???re doing some kind of big shot business deal.Additionally, I???d like to find a candidate who will work closely with other governments, say, the Russian government for example. My ideal candidate would find ways to bring people into our political process who have proven capable of reaching across the globe to poison and kill people who have crossed them. If you???ve heard of a candidate who meets these requirements, could you have him call me? I just know it???ll be a him.If you???re familiar with a candidate who could put this country in a more precarious position, both domestically and internationally, that???d be amazing. I???d prefer this candidate to be a loose cannon of the highest order, maybe someone who???d suggest something zany like banning an entire religious group and would send people scurrying to Google as if it???s a crystal ball, furiously tapping away on their keyboards something like, ???Is this how the Holocaust started???? So if you come across someone like that, text me.Oh, I almost forgot, if this candidate could be exceptionally thin-skinned and incapable of counting to ten before responding that would just hit the nail on the head for me. Someone who is highly irrational while also being highly reactionary is, to me, the ideal candidate for the most powerful office in the land. ???Shoot first on 5th Avenue and ask questions later,??? that???s what I always say. If you???ve heard through the grapevine of this kind of elusive and media shy candidate, do tell.Lastly ??? and this is really a deal breaker if it can???t happen ??? I???m especially in the market for a candidate who has the potential to incite so much chaos and global unrest that the Earth will careen off of its axis, get sucked into a death orbit, and be sent hurtling straight into the sun, much to the profound relief of all of its inhabitants.If you???ve got any recommendations along those lines, give me a shout.

I savored not knowing what the word ???escrow??? meant, and spent my evenings drinking wine and perusing esoteric wedding registries. But then, in no particular order, I had a baby and bought a Honda CR-V and started getting drunk on something else: The American Dream.And that???s how I ended up in the drive-through lane at Burger King, whispering the name of their latest portmanteau into the speaker.Do you want the meal or just the Whopperito?I listened for the tone of the employee???s voice coming through. Are we in on this joke together? Is the cruelest part of this market plan the fact that she has to ask these questions? Can she see me?Just the Whopperito.I???m sad enough, thank you.Also, who eats FRIES with a Whopperito?I couldn???t believe how many times we had to utter ???Whopperito??? to one another. I longed for the conversation to be over, but like a Garth Brooks coming-out-of-retirement-concert, it just kept going.Once I was safely at home with the doors locked and blinds drawn, I set my Whopperito on the table and unfolded the tortilla. It dawned on me that the Whopperito is essentially a burrito with pickles. The other ingredients: meat, lettuce, tomato, are fluid food items that can easily wend their way into many of our everyday meals. Was the Whopperito all that different? Was it like when Apple makes the slightest variation on the charger so we all have to go buy a new one?If you haven???t already guessed, I am not what you might call a ???foodie.??? I was raised by my mother, who thinks ice in a glass of water or a sandwich with two kinds of cheese count as ???excessive.??? I am merely a self-labeled, post-modern consumer, savoring all the levels our country has to offer. I have dined at well-to-do establishments, like those McDonald???s that have a chandelier and an upstairs, and the ones that are inside turnpike gas stations. In my eyes, I see little difference, but I guess that???s just the way I was raised.Similar to my MFA in creative writing, however, the Whopperito let me down. Neither Whopper nor burrito, I felt overwhelmed by the inevitable slippery slope I was riding down, but if burgers and burritos can unite in marriage, why can???t the rest of us?On the Burger King website, the Whopperito is listed under the ???chicken & more??? menu category. I actually find this to be the most alarming development of the Whopperito. Talk about a slippery slope, not to mention imprecision. However, I suppose ???chicken & linguistic blends of words,??? illustrates a showy, heightened form of self-awareness Burger King is not ready to embrace.- - -China???s Green Tea Ice Cream OreoSubmitted by Kaya YorkThe most wonderful thing I learned while living in China is of the great diversity of corporate snack flavors around the world. Oreos, for example. There???s a lot of Oreos out there. The Oreo Wikipedia page has a pretty comprehensive and surprisingly well-cited documentation of Oreo variations with comically officious (and borderline Nietzschean) section headings like ???Beyond Sandwich Cookies???.It???s mysterious in what way Oreo flavors are facilitated through the idea of ice cream.  How does ice cream figure in, ontologically speaking? Why not simply a green tea flavored Oreo? Were they afraid we would think it wasn???t sweet? Like that it was gonna be an Oreo that actually tasted like tea? The natural hope is for a brand-crossover ice cream called Green Tea Ice Cream Oreo Ice Cream.But still I get it. Green Tea Ice Cream is delicious. Oreos are delicious. The idea of putting them together does not disgust me like the Double Delight Oreo series that combines orange/mango, raspberry/blueberry, and grape/peach. These taste like toothpaste. A cookie should not be refreshing.I was excited to try the Green Tea Ice Cream Oreo.They were sold to me by the ?????? (jin ??? about a pound) out of a bucket of individually packaged Oreos, which made me feel like I was buying a timeless staple-like grain.I was disappointed.It didn???t taste anything like green tea flavored ice cream. Or green tea. Or ice cream. It tasted a little like mint. Like a parched Girl Scouts Grasshopper cookie. But I checked: it enthusiastically claimed itself to be green tea flavored ice cream flavored.Eat this cookie only if you wish to be reminded of all the things in the world that do not live up to their potential. Or don???t. The orangutans will thank you. But still go to China for the green tea toothpaste. That???s actually very good.- - -Burger King???s Mac n CheetosSubmitted by Stacey GreenbergWhen Taco Bell came out with the Doritos Locos Tacos we were all ecstatic. Taco Bell and Doritos together?  I mean, how could life get any better than that? As a child of the 70s and a mom, I was 100% impressed by their genius marketing team (which probably consisted of people in their 20s). I didn???t even care that the shell wasn???t actually a giant Dorito, just the same old shell with Doritos flavored powder on it.Fast forward a few years and now we have Burger King???s retort, the Mac n Cheetos. What. The. Fuck. How do they get the macaroni to cooperate long enough to be encased in the Cheetos shell? What on earth must go into the Cheetos shell to make it strong enough to contain the macaroni? And is it fried? There are just so many questions I want to remain unanswered.Oddly enough, the Mac n Cheetos hit my radar via a vegan friend on Facebook. She was lamenting the fact that she would never know the pleasure of the Mac n Cheetos. My first thought was, ???Ew is there meat in them too???? Then I remembered that vegans don???t eat cheese. I could see the Mac n Cheetos turning just about anybody off of cheese eternally, assuming it actually contains real cheese, which surely it doesn???t. Ew, maybe there is meat in there too. Or ground up baby cow hoofs. Or that pesky gelatin that ruins so many things for vegans.Because my now fourteen-year-old son only talks to me if it pertains to food (as in me buying him food, prepari",100
17,"ng him food, carrying food to him while he lays in bed watching YouTube), I asked, ???Hey did you see the new Cheetos thing at Burger King????His eyes lit up, and he showed a level of excitement I hadn???t seen since agreeing to buy him four burritos at Chipotle a couple of weeks prior. ???The Mac n Cheetos! Let???s go!??? he said.I???ll be honest. I wanted to go get them not just because I basically will do anything to keep my teenage son from getting hangry, but because I had to see one in person. Then I remembered we had just discussed the fact that he???d eaten a whole bag of pork rinds at his dad???s house the night before and had been suffering some pretty ill effects most of the morning. ???Let???s wait until you can go several hours without using the restroom,??? I suggested.After having a few days to think about my offer of driving to Burger King, making the order for one Mac n Cheetos and paying with money I earned myself, I had second thoughts. Mostly of the fourteen year old becoming addicted to Mac n Cheetos and this being the first of many, many trips, especially since I had officially refused to ever go to Chik fil-A again.We made a deal between the menu board and the pay window. He could have one order, and his little brother and I would each have one bite. The experience would be Snapchatted and then we???d all move on with our lives.In the plus column, they didn???t take extra time to cook like the stoopid Buffalo Chicken Fries. The packaging is attractive. The actual product is quite a sight to behold???a tube with lots of little tubes inside. Totally tubular!In the minus column, they just taste like super soft and cheesy fake cheese wrapped in mildly crunchy even faker cheese. They are truly disgusting and cause you to feel all the shame you knew you would. Unless you are fourteen. And then your eyes roll back into your head and you tell your mom that you???ve achieved nirvana.- - -All-Natural 100% Veggies Sweet Corn Crunch Dried Kernels Sprinkled With Sea SaltSubmitted by Amy BarnesI am a city girl. For a 70s summer, I was a country girl. Back then it was a real farm and not a $4,000-a-week yuppy kid summer camp experience with free-range chickens and sustainable meals prepared by Wolfgang Puck. A tween boy drove my sister and I around a Kansas farm in a truck that was older than his dad. I stepped in pig poop. And horse poop. Dog poop. Chicken poop. Lots and lots of poop. After the requisite feeding of the animals in the poop, we should have all cleaned up before our next farm-related fun: the dry feed corn silo. We did not.The dry feed corn silo was a wonderland. We climbed the long and rusty metal ladder to the top and shimmied in through the equally rusty submarine-style entry at the top. And then we jumped. Like kids into the first uber-cold swimming pool water. Into dry corn. Poop-covered pants, shoes and all. And slid down probably 40 or 50 feet to the bottom. Screaming and giggling. I now know as an adult that was a very, very, very dangerous thing to do. My mother was sitting on the front porch of the farmhouse drinking tea unaware or didn???t care that she might lose both of her daughter???s to dried corn. It was the 70s. The poetic justice of all that farm poop returning to the animals on their feed aside, the three of us could have died. It was far more dangerous than the 11-year-old driving a stick shift truck at 50 miles an hour through the farm. However, there is nothing like the smell and feel of dried corn on a hot Kansas summer afternoon. The corn dust on your clothes. In your hair. The smell of that corn sucks into your lungs (in much the way that a big mouthful of that same corn might also kill you). You are instantly drowning and sliding on the best roller coaster ever. 35 years later, I thought I would never live that experience again. There is no way in hell that I would willingly climb that ladder and take that plunge now.  Get ready all you fellow city slickers. However, farm summers are here again for everyone! I have found the suburb, middle-aged version of the farm silo corn:All-Natural 100% Veggies Sweet Corn Crunch Dried Kernels Sprinkled with Sea Salt.Apparently, the company thinks their product is not good enough on its own and so they include ALL of the following information on the bag:Non-GMO Project, Sensible Foods Crunch Dried Kernels, Corn, sea salt and nothing else (trademark), meets USDA ???Smart Snacks in School??? Guidelines, packed in a facility free from peanuts, gluten, dairy and eggs, vegan, gluten free, non GMO, low fat, no additives, no sugar added, no preservatives, kosher certified, Perfect topping: salads, soups, salsas, excellent addition to stews, casseroles, pizza or tacos, A delicious ingredient for baking or trail mix, tasty snack right out of the bag, satisfy corn cravings 100% sweet corn and nothing else, picked at peak of ripeness, lightly dusted with sea salt, crunch dried, ideal for any eating occasion, re-sealable, perfectly amazing on the go snack anytime, anywhere, Office, enjoy with a movie, or refuel on a hike, Best by 08/03/2017Seriously, just say:Our dried corn is a Kansas farm summer. Minus death by dry-corn-drowning and farm animal poop.This stuff is city-girl nostalgia crack. I do eat it on salads and on-the-go and maybe even on top of my green eggs and ham.  Maybe not on tacos or stews (really stew???what marketing writer adds in stews?) but you have to draw the line somewhere. You have just avoided death by silo and can buy this remarkably simple product at Costco. Costco. Costco! Just take it up the register and pull out your Costco membership card and say,  ???I???d like one bag of summer corn.??? No, don???t say that. They might think you are crazy and might take away your bag of ?? eaten corn. Because now you will have to open the bag in the store and eat it before you pay for it and you will be standing there with a Volkswagen-sized tub of ice cream melting while eating dried corn out of the bag and weeping that you need to have backyard chickens (home chicken coop ??? aisle 6).  Just put the bag-o-corn on the conveyor belt and pray that all the loose corn doesn???t roll back down and drown the toddler perched screaming, covered in poop in the next cart down.Proof positive that you CAN put the country (corn) into a city girl all over again.- - -Trader Joe???s Shooting StarsSubmitted by Ellen RhundyAs a 30-year-old woman who drinks her coffee from a NASA mug (a gift from your parents after a crushing but earthbound layoff), it should come as no surprise that you are drawn to the packaging of Trader Joe???s Shooting Stars cookies. A star-shaped cookie? Drizzled with chocolate? And a drawing of a spaceship? And a drawing of an astronaut? Sold!Alas, these are cookies you should have considered more closely before purchase. Out of the packaging, they are just as they appear on the box, with the added bonus of crumbled graham cracker sprinkled atop the chocolate drizzles. It is 10 AM but work is tough, and a donut is really just a cookie in disguise???so in you go, only to find the cookie exploding against your lip, a piece of graham cracker ricocheting off your desk as you stare in shock at the devil cookie. You cautiously launch its return trip towards your wounded lip, but pause: the cookie is fizzing, crackling, another graham cracker crumb has flung itself free, to be discovered hours later implacably attached to your jeans.In your pure love for the stars, you realize you failed to notice one critical fact: these cookies are covered in fucking pop-rocks. The only appropriate home for Trader Joe???s Shooting Stars is the office kitchen, absent their packaging, where you",100
18," sit giggling nervously every time a coworker is about to be deceived just as you were a few short hours ago. But not again, bucko. Not again.- - -Reynaldo???s Rice PuddingSubmitted by Julia CervantesIt???s 2 PM on a Thursday afternoon, the weekly nadir of my dietary willpower. Each week is a Sisyphean struggle to avoid the snacks at the office marketplace. My inert lifestyle is in league with my pants, and together they refuse to be accommodating of sweets.The marketplace is on the opposite side of the office, roughly 600 steps from my desk. I try to make this journey every two hours (for my cardiovascular health, naturally), and that brings me into contact with temptation approximately 20 times per week. That???s twenty opportunities for me to lose my grip, and the moment I do I feel triumphant in my own defeat. (Did not Sisyphus feel the same surge of wild, pointless joy at his momentary easement?) I paw through the chips, trail mixes, and candy bars with unfettered glee. I shiver mostly from excitement as I peruse the refrigerated section, and then I see it. The ancestors have shown me favor this day in the form of my favorite, but rarely stocked, delicacy???Reynaldo???s Rice Pudding.The logo, a man dark of hair and pale of skin, looks a bit like me that one time I wore a sombrero for Cinco de Mayo and drew a mustache on myself with a sharpie. The label proclaims it to be both Rice Pudding and Arroz con Leche, a duality that I can appreciate. It proclaims, like that government census I filled out, that White and Hispanic can and often do label the same package.That???s all well and good on paper, but if someone in my open-plan office asks what I???m eating???and some nosy desk mate will???I will refer to it strictly as rice pudding. Despite being half Hispanic, I am translucently pale and was raised by white people of European descent. To pepper my speech with Spanish and ineptly roll my r???s would invite only the incredulity of my colleagues. Such is the nature of my own duality.Ethnic anxieties aside, I get down to the best part of my workweek. The lid is a thin, tear-away film, but not one of those membranous manhole covers so fused to the round plastic lip of the container that it precipitates a fierce tooth-and-nail-and-very-often-knife struggle. No. This lamina lifts away with the subtlest allusion to force by my weakened and benumbed carpal-tunnel-stricken hands.The semi-solid top skin of the pudding looks like the cinnamon-flecked, highly folded brain of a deeply intelligent species. As I push the spoon into its depths, I imagine myself in an ancient rain forest eating from the cavity of a small monkey???s skull. The texture of the pudding beneath the surface skin is best described as quantal; the creamy lumpiness is either entirely sublime or utterly revolting, depending on your textural preferences and powers of imagination. As for the taste, there can be nothing in heaven or on earth that is more satisfying than full-fat dairy with sugar and cinnamon.- - -McDonald???s Signature Sriracha Big Mac SauceSubmitted by Thomas CookRight, so the first question you???re asking yourself is the first question I neglected to ask myself: is this a sauce or a sandwich? The answer: it???s a sauce. Maybe if I had paid closer attention to the commercial before putting away the end of a bottle of wine and heading for the drive-thru I would have known this, but instead I steamed into the parking lot and tried to order the ???Sriracha Sandwich.??? No such thing.I should point out that I don???t recommend finishing a bottle of wine and heading for McDonald???s in search of McDonald???s Signature Sriracha Big Mac Sauce in general, necessarily, mainly because of the drinking and driving dimension of the act, but also because research tells me this sauce may be, at least for a time, available in Los Angeles and San Diego only, the former being where I tracked it down.It had been awhile since I???d driven thru a McDonald???s, so it???s probably worth saying also, in case you???re in the same boat as I was, that things have changed. The first thing you should know is that there???s now a Signature Sandwich Menu (at least here in L.A.), and knowing that is key to placing a coherent order, that is if you see a commercial for an addition to the sauce portion of the menu and are compelled at that very movement to pursue the sauce on a sandwich, as I was.For instance, had you known about the menu, you likely would have nodded your head or produced some equivalent gesture of ascent at the news of a spicy addendum to an existing menu of sauces (i.e., Creamy Dijon Mustard, Sweet BBQ Sauce, and Pico de Gallo) that now, at second glance, seemed to have been missing such a thing. Unfortunately for Kareem, the kind gentleman who guided me through the process of ???building my own sandwich??? in the drive-thru, I had no such prior knowledge of the sauce line-up or the menu in general.(I should point out that there is good chance, based on how I likely sounded, coupled with my ignorance of the menu, that Kareem may have regarded me as damaged.)Kareem first led me through the selection of a bun product ??? Artisan Roll, Potato Bun, or Sesame Seed Bun ??? to which I deferred to him. He expressed his preference for the Potato Bun, and I said that if it was good enough for him it was good enough for me.Next, I chose from the options of a 100% Pure Beef Patty, Buttermilk Crispy Chicken or Artisan Grilled Chicken. Here, I did not hesitate. Having seen the sandwich in the commercial advertised with the Signature Sriracha Big Mac Sauce spread over a beef patty, there was only one choice.Eventually, I ended up with a beef patty served on a potato roll with the promised Signature Sriracha Big Mac Sauce, white cheddar, crispy onions, a spinach/kale blend, and a tomato. I began eating as I pulled away from Kareem, thanking him for his help through the ordering process.What I can report, I must admit, could potentially be colored by my previously admitted McDonald???s hiatus: in a nutshell, McDonald???s has done it. This sandwich, at least as constructed with the potato roll and beef patty, is a funhouse of flavor and texture. The crispy onions, though I could have done with more, maintained their crunch while at the same time sinking in to the partially melted slice of white cheddar. I attribute this to the onion-to-cheddar ratio, and so recommend that, if the product makes it out to more markets, the amount of cheese is upped along with the amount of onions.As regards the kale/spinach blend, the raw nature of the leaves was a bit of an issue. As I drove and ate, looking down at the sandwich to gaze upon what I had created, it appeared (and tasted) as though the leaves of kale and spinach simply wilted upon contact with the other hot ingredients, darkening, falling off of the sandwich, sullying my lap. A saut??ed blend might perform better and stay inbounds.The roll ??? Kareem was right ??? I found both sweet and also substantial, absorbing of the access fat and cooking liquid, though not soaking through, the gummy starchiness of the potato shining in its compliment of the beef patty.And then of course the sauce. McDonald???s Signature Sriracha Big Mac Sauce is on the sweeter side of Sriracha. It is, I confirmed, simply Sriracha mixed in with Original Big Mac Sauce, which means it???s really good.- - -Nabisco Oreo Strawberry Shortcake Sandwich CookiesSubmitted by Katie WalshI have been an avid Oreo lover since I was old enough to eat solid food. I have fond memories of deconstructing these sinful sandwiches with my dad and stacking them back together with peanut butter, whipped cream, and other sweet",100
19,"s to make towering, saccharine-filled monstrosities that would make any dentist cringe. (My dad actually is a dentist, making this even more ironic.) Needless to say, when my fianc?? and I saw the Strawberry Shortcake variety at our local Walmart one innocuous Friday afternoon, I nearly trampled some kids in the aisle on the way to grab a bag. (Side note: Walmart is the only, and I mean ONLY, place we have been able to find these fucking things ??? meaning that whenever I get a craving for them, I must first endure horrific parking lots, masses of stupidity, and blinding florescent lights before I can finally tear into the famous blue bag. But that???s an entirely different story.)Over the years, whenever Oreo has released a new flavor, I have always been first in line to try them: lemon, gingerbread, mint, even the various flavors in the super-chocolatey ???Fudge Creme??? line. My favorite has always been the white chocolate-covered Oreos that show up around the holidays ??? until now. These have the golden Oreo cookie with a strawberry cream filling, and are a total game-changer. As soon as we got home we each poured a tall glass of whole milk (fuck that 2% bullshit ??? if I???m going to indulge, I???m committing 100%) and brought the bag into our room, where we closed the curtains, turned on Netflix, and ripped them open.The first thing we noticed was the aroma: In my 33 years on this Earth, I have tried many a ???strawberry-shortcake-flavored??? treat, only to be severely disappointed (and, truthfully, pissed) by the end result. Not with these. Nabisco did it right, my friend. These little sons of bitches tasted like the best strawberry shortcake dessert I could ever imagine. I like to twist, eat one cookie first, lick the cream off the second, and then dip the naked cookie into milk and eat it, while my fianc?? dunks the whole cookie at once and eats it lke that. I recommend eating these fuckers any way you can ??? there is no wrong way. The golden Oreos served as a perfect foil to the strawberry cream ??? the shortcake part of the dessert, if you will. Suffice it to say that we devoured that entire goddamn bag in one sitting, and were only left wanting more. We made three more unnecessary, horrendous, migraine-inducing trips to Walmart that weekend alone, each trip resulting the same way ??? shame ??? eating the entire package by ourselves in the dark.- - -Starbucks ???Pink Drink???Submitted by Ella GonzalezLike most millennials and individuals of the 21st century, I believe that the foods and beverages I consume should be photogenic and contain no less than two whole avocados. They are an extension of my four cavities and counting, a culinary expression of floundering in a deep sea of my own pretension. Each bite and every morsel and crumb is at risk of being photographed, and even when they???re not, the thought of having Instagram-able food is one of the greatest achievements of all. If food has a purpose, it???s to stand (lie in repose?) behind the camera to not be consumed.I tried the new Starbucks ???pink drink??? for a similar reason and ratio of superficiality: 90% because it looks cool; 10% so I could be the first of my friends. If there were a lull in any conversation, my sampling of this trendy beverage would diffuse the tension. ???Have you guys tried the pink drink???? I would ask. The conversation would pick up, coconut milk wins again.Wrong.The ???pink drink??? ??? Starbucks??? strawberry acai refresher with coconut milk instead of water ??? is as disappointing as it is difficult to say.Described as a pink Starburst liquefied, it combines the right amount of disappointment with ???I paid four bucks for this???? It sure tastes like pink Starburst, which is good if you???re eating a pink Starburst, otherwise it???s a beverage committing fraud. Its pink Starburst taste is second to the disappointment that follows an ill ratio of coconut milk to the freeze-dried Lunchable meat powder the strawberry acai sat in for the past decade. Coconut milk, like it???s older sibling and sewer water stunt double, coconut water, is a sorry excuse for a milk replacement. It tasted like a pink Starburst soaked in tepid skim milk with too many ice cubes left overnight in an old bodega.Watery and disappointing like Lunchable meat.But it???s pretty enough to photograph, and there my priorities lay.- -JuXiangYuan Health Food Co. Almond Cookies with Lard Center, China Time-honored BrandSubmitted by Jenn MarThey watch you, the office guinea pig, cross-examining a box of cookies Mei had smuggled 7,019 miles from China, under the most frightening conditions of airplane turbulence in an economy-class toilet stall. Mummified in layers of newspaper, the cookies had spent 12 hours buried at the bottom of Mei???s purse beneath a sweater and complimentary in-flight banana. Leave it to a middle-aged Chinese woman to disguise a restricted agricultural item ??? exported almond cookies ??? as a discrete package resembling stashed cocaine.Staring vacantly at the box, Derrick from I.T. shares his gloomiest expression. On appearance alone, the box ought to be filled with utilitarian items ??? dietary capsules, herbal remedies, gunpowder. Uninspired in design, the striped orange and green box could???ve been lifted straight from the archives of TIME, in a photo of decimated state-run communist markets, during a time of scarcity when shelves were nearly always emptied of food, well, except for the ???JuXiangYuan China Time-honored Brand Almond Cookies with Lard Center.??? At least in your historical reimagining.Beneath the wrapper is a stony disk stamped with a mysterious symbol, like a prop from Indiana Jones, something discovered on an archaeological dig when land winds sweep in and brush off just enough sand grains from the surface to reveal squiggly impressions that most certainly is an ancient code to a forgotten language of the universe. As you slide the disk into your mouth, you gain the seriousness of a man who is about to turn the key to a secret door that guards so much knowledge.The disk cracks in half, then in quarters, and disintegrates into a sand dune that shifts and spreads across the dark holes of your mouth. Every dribble of saliva secreted by your glands is subsumed by the ultra-absorbent sand, a granular sand that pulls in moisture and induces dust storms.Singularly helpless, look into the gentle eyes of Mei and find a way inside yourself, survival mode, to negotiate the tedium of chewing and swallowing a dry, choking cookie. Think about the time-stillness of your life, in an office that has ravaged your youth, your Joey-Chandler-Ross years: how the quotidian can be so fundamentally cruel.Your colleagues ??? Derrick, Mary, and Mei ??? openly stare at you, their warm morning breaths and neutrally scented, perspiring bodies.???How is it???? Mary asks.???Mm,??? you mumble, pointing to your mouth.???He totally hates your cookies.??? Derrick snickers. He is wearing those ridiculous sneakers with his potato-colored slacks.???That???s not something to say,??? Mary says in her sing-song voice. She crosses her arms.Mei stands shyly beside the community table where there is a potted fern and a pile of assorted napkins, brown napkins from the Chipotle, white cafeteria-style napkins from the Thai kiosk downstairs, a roll of paper towels, fluffy picnic napkins with hearts and teddy bears.Mei once called you a friend, whereas your definition of friendship is significantly more narrow in scope???not that you are frugal in your relationships, but this, incidentally, is making you reconsider the terms of your ???friendship??? goals.This is why it would not be good to spit out the coo",100
20,"kie, not even discretely into a paper napkin, although you are staring at the napkins.???Hey.??? Derrick charges at you. He lowers his voice, leaning towards you for a conversation of secrets between men. ???What is it, gross? Should I take one or no????You shrug.Mei sees you shrug. Uh, oh.(Where???d Derrick go?)Mei???s eyes are big and watery, and she forces herself to smile. She had exploded into her soup last month before her trip to China. No one knows why.You want to comfort her but the near-invisible mechanism in your throat, a tiny latch, is being pulled closed, constricting your voice by centimeters as it locks. You can almost visualize how you must look to Mei as you choke, you choke and you smile, eyes watering, like the choking is a joke between two friends, a meta-joke of sorts that acknowledges the polemical minefield you are in.Mary, who gives you this look like you will never be forgiven, has gone on to correct the problem herself. She breaks open a package and shoves the sandy disk into her mouth. Her pleasure is a practiced, lusty chewing that is performed by parents before their children to teach lessons on gratitude.Now cornering Mei, Mary is pressing her to talk about the cultural significance of the cookies, the history of traditional stone-grinding practices of women and children on straw mats beneath sun-baked huts??? is she making this stuff up? She half-listens to Mei while waiting for her tea to nuke in the microwave. She pulls out her giant mug and dunks the dirty teabag inside ??? medicinal roots ??? and drives her fingers into the water, pushing down on the teabag. ???Now, historically, where do they come from, Mei????Mei reveals they were not handmade but gotten from a store. The Duty-Free Shop of the Shanghai Pudong International Airport, T2.Mary???s disappointment can be felt by the room. ???No tradition????Mei shakes her head. They???re just her favorite cookies. Delicious cookies. Mei turns to you. ???Right????Looking at Mei, you feel like you???re caught between two stories, knowing hers is a lie.???They???re alright,??? you say, surprising yourself.Mei, who is somewhat frail but quietly spirited, shrinks back. She claps her neck with her slender fingers, creasing her crisp white Oxford shirt. Her usually cheery voice flies away from her like a runaway balloon.???But I???m sure there are traditions!??? Mary blurts out. Mei on the verge of tears.Glancing at the boxes, her eyes welling, Mei starts on the Cultural Revolution, her mother who had died from health complications, a mysterious cancer, the family suspects, related to her grief of separation from her three children, whom she only saw twice a year when they pressed their young faces against a rusted border fence outlining China and not-China territories of a world young Mei intuited was a place of riches ??? migod! Bell-bottom pants and pop records and Coca-Cola and warehouses full of cooking oil. Back then cooking oil was scarce and pork fat was loaded into anything to address severe winters of side-dashing snow storms that seethed over the countryside and made you want to die a gentle sleep, tin canisters were used to store fat drippings, her grandmother used a spatula to skim off curls of hardened lard and used this to supplement anything eatablThat???s right, playwright!

As a result it is unlikely your production will be reviewed or decently attended.1. The college states that they do not have a race problem.2. The college has a ???Chief Diversity Officer??? and Sensitivity Training??? for engineers who have never heard of micro-aggressions. The college will offer to send slides from the annual afternoon sensitivity training in the form of a PDF file if you cannot make it. Sensitivity Training??? is nothing if not convenient.3. The college loves to use the discourse of microaggressions. ???Microaggressions??? sound better than ???small acts of daily, soul-erasing racism.???4.   The college also loves to use the discourse of sexual misconduct because sexual assault does not sound great. (This is a separate issue. Please see: How to Know if Your College Has a Sexual Assault Problem.)5. The college elects faculty for shared governance. The college happened to put that one Asian-American colleague up against that other Asian-American colleague for committee work, but no, it does not explicitly have anything to do with the fact that they are both Asian American. It is obviously a coincidence. But to be honest, Asians do have better handwriting.6. The college cannot stack one African-American colleague against another African-American colleague for shared committee work because, unfortunately, the college does not yet have two African-American professors employed at the institution.7. The college really wants to hire more diverse candidates, but unfortunately that diversity fund for giving ???extra??? incentive money for such candidates had to be redirected to the college???s Division III athletics budget.

It was J, my closest friend dating back to kindergarten. As only children, we???re more like sisters than friends. She told me her elderly mother had suddenly died, and the funeral was in two days in New York. There was no doubt in my mind ??? I cut my New Orleans trip short, flew home to Oregon, and then headed back to the airport to get a flight to La Guardia. I wrote a eulogy on the plane and took a cab from the airport to the funeral home, arriving shortly before the service started.J???s mother, A, had always been a collector. When I was about 12 years old, A made me promise that when the time came, I would help J go through her apartment, so that none of her collections ??? paperweights, snuffboxes, paintings ??? would be overlooked. As it turned out, A had become a hoarder in her later years. The beautiful paperweights were still arranged just so in the china cupboard, but the apartment on the other side of the glass had descended into chaos. J and I arrived to find rooms crammed with history and junk and art and garbage and collectibles. Treasures were liberally sprinkled amidst the trash, so every item had to be examined. It was a hugely emotional process for us both, reinforcing our sisterhood.In a bedroom drawer, under a sea of stained takeout menus, letters from the 1930s, unopened Con Ed bills, and old photos, I noticed a crinkled silver whistle, something A had picked up years ago during a trip to Mexico. Handmade, with a gold head and an interesting shape, it played a loud, crisp note, and I loved the feel of it in my hand. J offered it to me, and I put it on my key ring.In the four years since then, I have used it many times (once to get the attention of Oregon tourists who were exploring offshore rocks and were oblivious to the incoming tide). My kids think it looks like a ram???s horn, but they are wrong. I know it is a shrimp ??? one of A and J???s favorite foods, and the ghost in New Orleans that allowed the call to come through and said, ???Put down that jambalaya. Your sister needs you back East.???Dear Human Resources Department,I would like to submit my name for consideration for the position of Rent-Seeking Capitalist at your firm. Although this position is not listed on your website, I want to inquire about any openings that may be available in the future. I believe my experience and passion uniquely qualify me for this role.As you can see from my CV, I spent four years in a corporate analyst position at a leading financial services company. In this role, I worked hard to complete the work delegated to me from higher levels of management, maintaining a positive attitude even when confronted with repetitive and boring tasks. Although I am grateful for the learning opportunities and mentorship I received, I am ready to shift direction toward something that will allow me to work less but make more money. Becoming a rent-seeking capitalist at your firm would be a great fit for me at this stage of my career.In fact, I recently took a ???What Career Best Suits You???? quiz on the reputable website Buzzfeed, and the result was unequivocal: I am best suited to own the means of production.The process of commodifying my labor and selling it on the market for a low fixed wage has its appeal, but I believe I will be able to benefit more by exploiting the labor of others. I take my commitment to the bottom line over any and all human concerns seriously, and will work hard to use the fullest extent of the law to minimize my tax burden. The taxpayers of America should be paying me, not the other way around.My passion for this position was inspired by my undergraduate coursework in Marxist theory, particularly the classes I took about the masterwork Das Kapital. The way that Marx describes those do-nothing rent-seeking capitalists struck me at my core: I knew immediately that I wanted to be one of them. The workers of the world will eventually overthrow the capitalist class in a great Proletarian Revolution, but until that day I would definitely like to be on the side of the capitalists.I have heard the claims from other capitalists, especially before political contests, that the capitalist class is being unfairly targeted. I am ready to yell louder and more angrily about the injustice of the capitalist system toward capitalists. We must stay strong, together. If you take a chance on me, I will never let the capitalist class down.If there are still no openings for the position of Rent-Seeking Capitalist, please consider my application for Program Assistant, as listed on your website. I have a lot of bills to pay.Sincerely,Josh FreedmanFuture CapitalistRelaxing on your backyard patio to watch the sunset???Summer Breeze,???

I could barely stand to watch the video. But I did watch it??? about 400 times (So many pre-roll ads for antacid!) getting more and more outraged with each successive viewing.Seriously, how horrible was that thing Donald Trump did? Normal people do not act like this! It???s not cute or funny anymore! He is lowering the bar! He is coarsening the discourse! He???s a fraud! He???s a bigot! He???s a misogynist! Is this the thing he does that finally turns his own party against him? It HAS to be, right? I bet it is! I???m going to engage with a social media platform that mines my personal data (So many banner ads for antidepressants!) to say just that. And??? done! Now my friends know EXACTLY what I think (Even though none of them are planning to vote for Donald Trump, nor have they ever met or seen anyone who is planning to vote for Donald Trump.)Look, say what you will about Mitt Romney, he would not have done that thing that Donald Trump did. Sure, he might have done other, more boring things, but not that thing. No sir. That thing was simply the worst. Simply. The. Worst. Period!HAVE I MENTIONED THAT I AM SICKENED AND ANGERED BY THAT THING THAT DONALD TRUMP DID!??? Sorry, I???m getting so worked up just thinking about it. I need to see how everyone else is reacting to that thing Donald Trump did, so I???m refreshing a popular news site over and over again (So many pop-up ads for Canadian immigration attorneys!)Ah, good! The people I like are shocked and appalled by that thing Donald Trump did. Whew! That???s a relief.  At least there is still some shred of sanity and decency in the ??? wait, the people I don???t like are saying that thing Donald Trump did was??? good?!NO, NO, NO, NO, NO! It wasn???t good! It was heartless and retrograde and grammatically incorrect on countless levels! How can you be so blind? Our republic is fragile and that thing Donald Trump did could be the very thing that destroys it! My heart is racing! I feel sick! I need some antacid! I must immediately check the famous poll aggregator that everyone relies on to stay sane during election years???AAAAGH! WHAT?! The polls are way, way closer than they should be! Analysts are saying the thing could actually help him with certain key demographics! Apparently, elderly voters in rural Ohio LOVE that awful thing Donald Trump did! But, why? WHY?! Maybe if I buy this guy???s book I???ll understand the concept of ???margin of error???! Okay??? done. Should be here in 3-4 business days.While I wait, I have time to reflect again on that thing that Donald Trump did (I hated it.) Truly, the only good that will come from that thing (which was horrible) is that it will be great fodder for my favorite comedian who was given a TV show by a huge multinational media conglomerate hoping to make money. I can???t wait to see my favorite comedian absolutely DESTROY Donald Trump in a LEGENDARY EPIC TAKEDOWN for that crappy thing that he did! Let me just sit through one more pre-roll ad (for relaxed-fit pleated khakis) so I can watch it on the video streaming service owned by the monolithic search engine company???Wow. My favorite comedian really cut to the very heart of that thing Donald Trump did and showed how much it truly sucked ass. That segment was cathartic and satisfying and perhaps the power of laughter can heal our???OH MY GOD, Donald Trump did a new thing! It???s all over the news! HE DID A NEW THING! And by all accounts it is EVEN WORSE than the previous thing. EVEN WORSE THAN THE PREVIOUS THING!!!That???s it. I???m moving to Canada. Probably gonna buy some relaxed-fit pleated khakis first.- -Tom O???Donnell???s new illustrated middle-grade book Hamstersaurus Rexis out now.To: Team@Trump.orgFrom: PR@Trump.orgSubj: [URGENT] Subway Talking PointsTeam,Quick reminder: Under no circumstances can Mr. Trump be seen holding a Subway sandwich. As you may recall from our briefing in July, the standard size of six-inch and footlong Subway sandwiches are damning sources of scale. A photo of our candidate holding one of these sandwiches would provide concrete evidence to the claim his hands resemble those of an eleven year-old boy???s.So far we???ve done a great job of avoiding photo ops involving Subway. We can all recall times Mr. Trump has sent us to order his beloved Italian BMT on Italian Herbs & Cheese Subway sandwich. I don???t need to remind you that photographic proof of our next president holding this sandwich would not only highlight his petite, non-presidential hands, but also his love for ???ethnic??? sandwiches, which wouldn???t sit well with our base.Let???s not rest on our laurels ??? surely, the media will soon connect the dots. Whether they find Trump eating Subway or not, I???m sure they???ll ask for comment. In case Trump???s explicit avoidance of Subway is dredged up by the media, I???ve compiled talking points to deflect any possible questions or critiques we may encounter.1. Subway is just as unhealthy as McDonald???s.In preparation for Trump???s eight-year stay in the White House, he???s been following a healthy diet. One of the best diets. If needed, his doctor will provide a note proving this. This is the reason you won???t find Trump eating Subway. It has nothing to do with the sandwich providing scale and highlighting his less-than-average hand size.If the media suggests this is an invalid claim, as Trump has been photographed eating food even more unhealthy than Subway, refer to Talking Point 2.2. Subway???s bread con",100
23,"tains Azodicarbonamide, the same chemical used to make yoga mats.Donald Trump will not eat anything that is also used to make yoga mats. Trump has never practiced yoga, an Indian ritual, ever in his life. If they want to see a politician get into a pretzel-shape, ask Hillary Clinton about her email! Absolutely no reason that Trump would be scared to hold a Subway sandwich because his hands would look diminutive in comparison.If the media points out Subway???s bread no longer contains Azodicarbonamide, refer to Talking Point 3.3. Mr. Trump prefers to support local businesses.A salt-of-the-Earth man like Trump does not eat at huge corporations like Subway. He eats at the same places Joe Everyman eats. Use this opportunity to plug a local business, claim that Donald loves to eat there. (Note: Cheryl, PLEASE check that the restaurant you plug is not a chain. How have you not heard of Bertucci???s?) This is a more than sufficient reason to avoid Subway ??? it has nothing to do with Trump???s hands looking small while holding a Subway sandwich, and claiming otherwise is simply absurd.If the media identify photos of Donald consuming large corporate fast-food products such as McDonald???s and KFC, refer to Talking Point 4.4. Mr. Trump will not associate with losers like Jared Fogle.Our next president will not be associated with convicted sex offender and former Subway spokesman, Jared Fogle, in any way. Donald Trump is our only presidential candidate of character, and values ??? values that do not align with Jared Fogle. (Do not mention the fact Jared Fogle has endorsed Trump, as this is not a sought-after endorsement.) Trump will not compromise his character for a sandwich ??? a sandwich that may very well be delicious ??? we have no idea. Trump would gladly hold a Subway sandwich in his hands, if he had a good reason to. But he doesn???t. So he won???t. End of story.If the media points out this defense is invalid, and frankly unfair, since Jared Fogle is in no way associated with Subway anymore, refer to Talking Point 5.5. Subway is losing money.By this time, I hope this point is self-explanatory. Follow the game plan. Get on the offensive: Subway has been making very bad deals. Claim you???ve seen their numbers, and they are very bad. Not losing-916-million-dollars-in-one-year bad (by the by, NEVER use the number 916 million ??? no matter what the context) but bad all the same. Do not explain which numbers, or why they???re bad. But confirm, they???re the worst numbers you???ve ever seen. It???s very sad, actually. You think a winner, co-author of The Art of the Deal, would actually eat at Subway? This has nothing to do with hand size. It never did. Trump???s hands are completely normal-sized, and we???ll bring anyone to court who says otherwise.If you???ve exhausted all of these points to no avail, make a remark about Trump???s daughter. Make it unclear if she is an object of Trump???s fatherly affection or something else. While the press look at each other quizzically, tersely conclude the meeting and exit the room. It???s much better to end on these puzzling terms than to expose the truth.Make America Great Again,SteveSoon to be upon us is the fateful day the prophecy has foretold.For it is written: In the tenth month of the sixteenth year of the third millennium, when the wrathful punitive goat-kind have finally forgiven the people of northeastern Illinois their sins, the Chicago Cubs will win the World Series, and thus the divine prophecy shall be fulfilled.The poor and na??ve who fail to heed this warning and observe the signs, contented in their ever-affirmed denial, shall be the first to crumble with the city when the Cubbies take it all.For in the many moons leading up to the day, the bandwagon overfloweth, and the prophecy states that the Cubs??? steadfast supporters, barely subdued for 108 years by perpetual loss, shall rise up in victory to overtake the city when the series is won. Freed at last from their purgatory of unrewarded fandom, they shall unleash upon the city a hell-on-earth yet to be witnessed.And on the day they shall fill the streets, spreading violently from their wretched Wrigleyville epicenter like a thick splotch of red and blue ink oozing across the page, destroying everything in its path. And they shall claim the city.For weeks the unsuspecting metropolis will be ravaged by the thick-necked, soft-handed followers cloaked in their red and vomit-stained royal blue, the streets awash with urine and Natty Light from Rogers Park to Chinatown.Together in arms, these supporters shall make public transportation a thing of the past as thousands of innocents attempt to flee too late. The devastation of any ill-maintained structures in the way of their victorious rampage shall exceed hundreds of landlords??? abilities to get it taken care of.Whispers of 2003 shall be brutally stifled. And it is foretold that TV programming will be hijacked for lands away, and requests for ???Go Cubs Go??? shall drown out all the rest. No visible window shall stand free of a hanging ???W??? pennant, as no ???W??? shall stand for anything but long-awaited victory. Not anything but.And the city shall burn to the ground as a new era is violently ushered in.All this has been foretold. All this is what shall come to pass this tenth month of the sixteenth year of the third millennium.But twenty percent shall be taken off the bill of any soul who displays a Chicago Cubs ticket at participating Chicagoland Red Robins, for the prophecy also states that it is not all bad.This is the Cubbies??? year. So it is written.- -There is nothing funny about writing. Writing is serious business. The most serious of all the businesses. I???m always on call. At any given moment, someone could need some words and you know what I???ll do? I???ll write them some words. You must have all of the best words if you want to be a good writer. It might seem like I???m just lying on the couch, eating string cheese, and watching Dr. Phil with my cat, but in reality every second of my life is spent on high alert, searching for newer and better words. Like boondoggle and yonic and maritime. To be a truly great writer, one must spend every waking (and sleeping, eating, bathing, etc.) moment surrounded by words in hopes of absorbing them through word-osmosis. This makes the lifestyle extremely treacherous. True, my ability to precariously stack books and papers is impressive, but I???m under constant threat of being crushed to death by a periodical avalanche. I could easily become just another writing fatality. What happens if I can???t remember the word ???cloche???? And what if, in my frustration, I gesture so dramatically that suddenly everything is collapsing around me? I???d be found wearing a Snuggie under a pile of thesauri, Mary Roach books, and InTouch magazines with my cat nearby, unfazed and seriously considering eating my toes.1.

But, with the technological landscape being so complex, it can be easy for a woman to get overwhelmed when making decisions about her headphones.Maybe it???s been so long since she???s used headphones with a jack that she???s forgotten how much more reliable the sound quality can be. Or maybe when buying the headphones, she was unaware that corded headphones are still widely available on the market. Whatever her reasons, you want to be sure she sees what she???s missing out on and give her the chance to downgrade. To do this, you will need to overcome a few obstacles.First, because her sense of sound is already occupied, you???ll have to resort to visual means to get her attention. In my experience, the best way to achieve this is to throw something in her line of sight. I tend to rely on whatever???s close at hand, such as a small pebble, a lit cigarette, or some broken glass. It doesn???t really matter, as long as it gives her the opportunity to notice you and your oversized, corded headphones plugged into a jack.Once you have her attention, she is likely to remove her headphones, allowing you a window to begin a conversation with her. A good way to lead is to say, ???Excuse me, are you aware that you???re using wireless headphones? Don???t you miss having a cord???? or ???You seem to have lost the cord to your headphones. Would you like to use my headphones instead???? Make sure as you???re speaking to her that your corded headphones are in plain view so she can see what she???s missing before she answers. She may have left the house that morning convinced that she does not need or want a headphone jack, but with one look at yours, she will probably begin to have second thoughts.If she seems quiet, don???t mistake her shyness for disinterest. Keep the conversation going by suggesting some brands of headphone jacks she might enjoy instead. Offer to help her buy some new headphones, in the event that her dad is too busy to help her.If she still seems steadfast in her loyalty to wireless headphones, point out to her how likely she is to lose one of them, and how hard it will be to find. Just because the wireless headphones are white, doesn???t mean she???ll be able to see them easily. What if she drops them in a snowstorm or on the tile floor of a ladies??? sauna? Boy, will she ever be sorry then.Finally, if she???s still unconvinced by your confidence, ask if she???s prepared to spend the rest of her life locked into corporate technological dependence. Be forewarned, this is the Hail Mary of pickup lines, and very few women will be able resist you at this point. But if she does, you???re probably better off. One of those little AirPods would be a bitch to look for behind your mom???s futon.Dear Sarah Lawrence,On top of a mountain, which I hiked for a science fair project to help cure cancer, I came to one of the largest realizations in my life: I care about other people. My body filled with an overwhelming feeling. From that point forward I knew I had to do good things for other people and not for myself.That???s when I knew you, Sarah Lawrence, were right for me, my darling.Some of my qualifications are: service, leadership, watched kissing videos on Youtube, academics, play cello, older brother who told me what girls like and how to apply deodorant, Spanish, SAT scores, decent text-er, sports, allowance from chores for buying flowers or a little plastic ring, Boy Scout, sportsmanship when playing sports, flexible curfew if chores are done so we can spend time together and maybe go to a movie, teacher who likes me enough to not write bad recommendation, car to drive to you, ACT, and poetry.But, during my life, it is not my many, many accomplishments (all done simultaneously) that have defined my ability to be MERITOUS as your boyfriend. It has been my failures. And the humble way I have learned weighty lessons from them. There are MULTITUDINOUS examples.Firstly, during a summer I went to Mexico with my church group and BEQUEATHED and VOUCHSAFED houses to people there. In the sweaty sun I built not just a house, but a home. Additionally, I built a spot in my heart for people, all over the world, especially those who look different or have less money than myself, like you, baby.I came away with an even larger dedication to hard work, family, and DOGGEDNESS. But, I did fail to save them from poverty. That still gnaws at me. I knew I could do more to make sure I had a concrete success in the wake of failure. So, arriving back in the United States, I decided to fail and then succeed at having a school Saxophone Club.We began small, but now are soaring like a CACOPHONOUS crescendo of notes! I think my own story is like these notes, and ours could be too. In some ways, the crescendo of a saxophone is a metaphor that can carry my entire story: starting low and ending high, beginning from the bottom (my many failures) to my success (Saxophone Club!). The crescendo could be metaphor for us, in my example, too.Therefore, we seem to fit well together well. My dad dated a Sarah Lawrence at his age. As did my aunt. I value this tradition and hope to join it.After receiving a tour (May 12th), I am even more confident I would make a good fit. You showed me around your rec room, which is best suited for ???just, I don???t know, having fun.??? I can do that and often do have fun with such people as Mr. Crosby (whose letter of recommendation you will find enclosed).You mentioned the den where you watch TV and, ???sometimes scary movies, but I need someone to watch them with?????? You then looked at me, for quite some time. This is an example of my failure, a low point. Later I texted you, ???We should watch those scary movies though LOL.??? This is an example of my overcoming a failure, through technology, innovation and ACUMEN. It also fits into the larger notes metaphor, which is a metaphor for my life.It was great at the end of the tour to have a brief address from your father about the overall values of the Lawrences. He mentioned ???feeling at home here??? and that ???the fridge is totally open, all yours.??? I did feel comfortable, and look forward to grabbing opportunities like the open fridge at a future time. Most relationships do not offer an open fridge",100
25," policy, it makes you, my beloved Sarah Lawrence, especially well-suited for someone like me. I eat often.I would also be honored to join other people who have dated you, like Ben, James and Brad, who are all cool and, since graduating, have gone on to opportunities such as sex.You are a STUPENDOUS ABODE of knowledge and I would be honored to love you. I like your many parts, which I have reviewed online and on my tour (May 12th). I hope I could learn much about the world, and myself, through our time together, setting me on a path for a lifetime of success. I know I still have so much to learn, like how to kiss and, with your guidance, even third base.Please consider loving me this upcoming Fall.??? Jacob (from the May 12th tour)I. Dear woman I met, I am clearly overly attached to youA. I want everyone to know thisII. Two things about me thoughA. Not into commitment1. I am inflexible on this pointB. Really into strippers1.

Wait, you???re seeing someone else now?A. This is terribly unfair to meB. Stop seeing this new personWe are not an advertising agency. We are Hoodwink, a collective of artists, dreamers, poets, storytellers, digital wizards, regular old magic wizards, free-thinkers, freeloaders, disrupters, gambling addicts, misfits, misfit toys that have creepily come to life and refuse to die no matter what we do, and one lone gunman.We cultivate. We think-o-vate. We adver-tain. We make up words. We are sad a lot. We weep every single day.We do things our own way. Which you???ll first encounter in our welcoming conference room that contains neither tables nor chairs, but instead houses a giant nest of human hair harvested from each and every one of our thoughtfully curated employees. It???s a metaphor for our process and the way our ideas are hatched off the top of our heads. Aren???t the egg pillows cute? Yes, of course they???re stuffed with hair ??? that???s why they???re so soft.We???re certainly not right for everyone. When you have a business problem, we don???t come back to you with the kind of practical, realistic ???solutions??? you???d expect to see in the played-out agency world. We don???t make print ads, we produce visual anarchy. We don???t write copy, we craft maddening, inescapable verbal labyrinths, creating a sense of wonder that compels your audience to ask ???What does this even mean???? and ???Why do I hate your brand so much now????Our presentations aren???t just your run-of-the-mill, same old same old advertising campaigns. Instead, we invent presentation experiences. Innovative, unconventional juxtapositions of creative content in the form of imagery, feelings, loud noises, unusual smells, a smattering of poorly formatted Adobe Acrobat documents, and several real acrobats dangling from our in-office high wire. You???d better brace yourselves, because you???ve never seen anything quite like it. Also, for safety reasons we recommend bracing yourself against a wall and covering your neck and skull with a hardback book during the performance. Due to the lack of traditional office snacks and lunch breaks, our main acrobat has grown quite thin, and his bony body feels like a bag of knives when it falls on you. Which is both a warning and another unique insight you???ll only get from working with our company.The idea of thinking outside the box and breaking all the rules is so important to us, it even applies to our building. Specifically, California???s earthquake architectural codes as well as most standard asbestos regulations are the rules that we break. Pregnant women are advised to avoid coming within 500 yards of our office, which is fine with us, since we don???t really buy into such an expected procreation method. Our company prefers more modern, innovative reproductive concepts like asexual budding, ripping off an arm and hoping it will grow a new person, and however marsupials do it.Admittedly, we are still working out a few kinks in the loose, unregulated way we structure things around here. None of our employees have ever been paid real money, and the hair nest has recently developed a bad case of lice. Also, there is an actual killer roaming our office. Remember the lone gunman from our introduction? That wasn???t a joke. He is a very real and present danger. Why did we even hire that guy? It???s not like it was some kind of secret. In his interview he was very upfront about the whole murder thing. He has designed some of our most successful coupons, though.We???ve been trying to spin these horrible problems into some kind of benefit for our clients, but the only thing we???ve come up with so far is the idea that you should ???do something that scares you every day,??? which is very easy to do here. We live in constant fear of being buried alive beneath a pile of asbestos-laden rubble, and all of the rats in our building are covered in bulbous tumors. Maybe one of them will inspire the shape of your new logo?But as an advertising agency that???s not an advertising agency, but has instead transcended definition, these are just some of the challenges we face here at Hoodwink. Some may call us renegades. Others may call us innovators. And a select few health inspection authorities will call us exactly what we are ??? a huge pile of dirty hair littered with cancer-ridden vermin and human rights violations. But one thing is clear: The work we do here is impossible to copy. One of the tumor rats has gotten trapped inside the copy machine, so now it just spits out gross inky blobs.Dear Mr. Guest:Thank you for your recent submission, ???What I Talk About When I Talk About Paying Off My Student Loan Debt,??? to Navient???s Loan Repayment Success Story Quarterly. We read it with great interest! We are excited to present it to our student loan borrowers! We know it will encourage the many thousands of borrowers to give us the money they owe in a more timely manner!As you know, repaying your Student Loan Debt is an achievement worth sharing! This past month we received 233 submissions of success stories just like yours. We accepted all of them. Your understanding of irony was the strongest aspect of your submission. It shows us you paid attention while getting your Masters in Fine Arts in Creative Writing fifteen years ago! Another strength in this submission was the intended audience; 91% of our borrowers have an English/Arts degree of some kind.However, we were unable to overlook a few glaring shortcomings. Surely you had a writing instructor at some level who told you that one ???fuck??? is enough in a short story. Two on rare occasions. Three is egregious. Were you aware that you used the phrase ???Fuck you, Navient and your refusal to cancel my automatic monthly withdrawal option??? more than 523 times, Mr. Guest?We also expect a bit of creative license with each submission. But who will believe you worked at The Gap following matriculation from such a prestigious graduate program ??? albeit a low-residency program. Incidentally, were you aware that a traditional-residency MFA graduate receives a two-book deal and tenure track job? There???s a success story we???d love to publish! Furthermore, we feel our borrowers would not benefit from reading six chapters about the ???mind-numbing skull-fuckery??? that consumed you each time a manager asked you to refold a pair of slim-fit low-rise jeans because you???d forgotten to ???tuck the crotch.??? And regarding the footnotes detailing the exact budget you lived on at each given moment: a bit much. (Also, like your story titl",100
26,"e, it was derivative.)Honestly, Mr. Guest, if it hadn???t been for that final chapter on how you overcame bronchitis without antibiotics so that you could donate plasma in order to meet the final payoff amount so as not to incur a hefty financial penalty per the agreement you signed with us when you first took out the loan as an aspiring writer fifteen years ago, the essay would have left us quite depressed. What an exciting ending! We only wish for the same conclusions for the other three undergraduate student loans you have with Navient because you failed to consolidate them at a lower interest rate.That is why we are willing to consolidate your 43,000 words into ???Live On a Budget For As Long As It Takes!??? and include it in our ???Tips For Borrowers??? section at the end of the Quarterly. Again, as stated in the clause in the box you checked before submitting, Navient has been granted the ???the right to edit the submission before it is used in publicity, promotions and advertising.???

Therefore, we encourage it.EgoismIf it???s in your self-interest to return, go ahead.HobbesianismA very powerful monarch will decide whether your return is allowed. We all agreed to this, so it???s fair.KantianismYou may return only those items that you would wish everyone else to also return.SkepticismWe do not know whether there are any returns, and neither do you.FunctionalismWe don???t care what you return, as long as you return it correctly.StoicismIt is best that you suffer the fleeting hardship of your bad purchase, and learn from your error of judgment, smiling all the while.Speech Acts TheoryTo return an item, you must state that you are returning it. If you do, we will state that we accept it. That is what a return is, essentially.Logical PositivismAs long as we can verify your return using physics or chemistry, we???re fine with it.PresentismNo past or future returns, only present ones.ReductionismA return is nothing over and above the item being returned, the persons involved, and the act of giving back the merchandise. What else would a return be? Some special fairy dust? Nonsense.Non-CognitivismWhen you return something, what you are really doing is just making an emotional ejaculation to effect that you do not like what you purchased. Knock yourself out.RelativismAt some of our branches, returns are accepted within 90 days. At other stores, 14 days with a receipt. At one of our stores, if you try to return anything, they???ll just beat the shit out of you. (Don???t bother blaming them, though, that???s just how they are.) There???s not really one big overarching policy.DialetheismThere are many, many problems and paradoxes when it comes to returning things. So, here???s what we???ve come up with. You may return. Also, you may not return. As far as we can tell, this takes care of everything, and if it hurts your puny brain that???s not our problem.RawlsianismTo determine whether it would be OK to allow a return, we must place ourselves behind a veil of ignorance where we know nothing about the item purchased, the purchaser, our own store, or anything circumstantial like that. From this vantage point ??? the original shopping position, as it were ??? we may determine fair return policies that help even the least gifted shoppers.Modal RealismIn some possible world, you (not literally you but your counterpart) return a pair of jeans successfully for cash.

Molemen!Approximately Five Billion Years LaterThe sun will expand into a red giant, erasing Earth from existence.Kurt texted to say my red 2016 Ferrari 488GTB was ready for pick up. I took a shower, rubbing some pink fancy soap into my breasts, which I use even when I don???t have guests. I moaned in pleasure, making that sound that a cat makes when it hasn???t been neutered. My breasts are a foot above my vagina, which I use for both urination and sex. They craved the passionate embrace of a buff dude. Was Kurt that buff dude? I was about to find out.I threw on my cheerleader???s outfit, because I had practice later that day, and drove my other red Ferrari to the shop, a 2016 F12berlinetta fully loaded with a 730-hp 6.3-liter V-12 engine.Kurt was bent over the car, squeezing oil all over the engine. He had really big muscles, which hot chicks like me are super into.???Your car is ready to go,??? Kurt said. ???Sweet ride.???He had such huge pecs they looked almost like breasts.???Thanks, dude. How much do I owe you????He pulled out a whole bunch of complicated papers. ???Eleven thousand dollars.??????Oh, shit,??? I said, when I reached for my wallet. ???I grabbed the wrong bag.??? I pulled out a half ounce of medical-grade marijuana.???Blaze some of that Chiesel with me and we???ll call it even,??? Kurt said. ???Let???s go check out my room.???I followed him upstairs. The hallway was papered with all my favorite movies, like Bring It On, Reservoir Dogs, and Maze Runner: Scorch Trials.We sat on his awesome bed and rolled a fat J that Kurt lit with his blue flame Zippo, which is $35 bucks on Amazon. We played Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain on his PlayStation 4 and I got really horny.Then Kurt slowly unbuttoned my dress. My breasts felt like they were going to explode in anticipation of his hot kisses. He put his hand between my legs. It felt amazing, even though I didn???t have a penis.???Whoa,??? I said, when Kurt took off his pants. ???You???ve got the biggest, grossest dick ever.??? I was so turned on. ???Let???s order a pizza.??????No. Let???s order a pizza and Wendy???s,??? Kurt said.???But they don???t deliver.??????I have a buddy who works there and can totally hook us up.???Kurt went down on me, spelling the lyrics to ???Purple Haze??? by Jimi Hendrix with his tongue.???Awesome song,??? I said.When he put his penis inside of me it was like sitting on a warm, wet flagpole. I watched myself in the mirror as he screwed me. I looked super hot because I was naked. My giant breasts slapped together in rhythm to Jimi, and Kurt promised to teach me the lead riff later. He made me feel safe. Chicks like me love getting high and then having sex. I couldn???t see Kurt very well because there was a bedpost in the way.We did it doggy-style for over an hour, while we played multiplayer Halo 5: Guardians on his Xbox One, stopping every now and then to kiss and hug, or to eat our pizza and burgers off each other???s bodies.???I love you differently than I love my mom and dad,??? Kurt said. That made my vagina feel hotter than the bonfire I accidentally fell into at camp. I had to go to the emergency room, which sucked.Kurt cried out in a really high-pitched voice, ???I???m doing it!??? He exploded. It felt like someone was peeing Pop Rocks into me. His jizz went all the way up to the back of my throat. It tasted like the Vanilla Silk my mom drinks. Not bad on cereal if there???s no milk around.Milk shot out of my breasts onto the black bedspread as I screamed in pleasure.???Don???t worry about that,??? Kurt said. ???I make enough money that I can hire my mom. She comes every day to clean when I???m not around or when she???s not too much of a bitch.???Afterwards we ate spicy chicken nuggets and smoked more weed. Kurt put his clothes on but I stayed naked so he could play with my breasts whenever he wanted. We kissed a lot. I???m a really good kisser, even when I???m crying, which I wasn???t.???Would you mind driving my second Ferrari back to my place for me???? I asked when it was all over.???Sure, dude,??? Kurt said. ???I???d kind of like to meet your mom anyway. Not that I???m weird or anything. But if your mom knows me and likes me, it will just be easier for us to have a totally awesome summer hanging out and getting high.???I, Kim, take you, Diane, to be my casually wedded work wife.When I met you in new hire orientation, I remember thinking: That necklace is a fun pop of color she???s added to her business casual neutrals. You also had a really cool planner and I just had to ask where you got it (Erin Condren!). My world changed from that moment forward. You put my name in your phone (KIM WORK) and I put yours in mine (DIANE ACCOUNTING) and I haven???t looked back since.Diane, you are a hot cup of joe on a Monday morning and a canceled meeting on a Friday afternoon. You???re the first person I think about when CC???ing an email, and the last person I think about when I shut down my computer at the end of the day. Through everything, I choose you. Through office birthdays where Dave brings the wrong kind of cake, and Mondays when the coffee maker is broken, I choose you. Through days when the AC is at exactly the right temperature, and days when that food truck parks in front of the office, I choose you.Diane, I promise to always email you funny memes about accounting and to Gchat ???lol thank god!??? when you send me an article about how drinking wine is good for you. Just as you talk me up to my office crush, I will tell Tim about your adult dodgeball team so he thinks you???r",100

Dave, driving a Bimmer does not entitle you to take up two spots! I promise to never collect on the IOUs you???ve written me for the quarters I???ve given you for the vending machine ??? you deserve all the Diet Coke you can drink.I look forward to work wife wedded bliss with you. Together we will rejoice and share some Dove chocolate over victories like that dickweed Dave being fired or our boss being out sick for the day. Side by side, we will convince our boss to let us have Pizza Wednesdays at least once a month and everyone will think, Kim and Diane are so fun! I know I can count on you to get me novelty shot glasses from your vacation destinations because you know you can count on me to get you fun keychains.I vow to make half plans to hang out outside of work but to never follow up on them because we have our own lives and I get that. When one of us is inevitably promoted or moves to a different company, I will lament our lack of closeness and our loss of intimacy. We???ll still Gchat for a little bit and try to finally get those drinks we???ve always talked about, but we never will. I???ll look sadly at the succulent you got for my desk and wonder if you???re still using the plaque I got for you that says BOSS BITCH.With this sassy mug, I thee wed.1. When he and his family were living in Rome for a year, Cheever wrote, ???A reception in a palazzo, the quintessence of Roman dreariness. Rooms that were meant to be lit by candles or maybe torches do not seem to lend themselves happily to the kind of indirect lighting that latter-day Romans go for. The upshot is a dimness or dinginess that has an appreciable effect on my spirits. My feet ache from standing, but if I sit down I may get trapped. Butlers pass trays of bad brandy and bonbons.???You obviously never had to put an Ikea bed together by yourself.2.  ???The loud night sounds on the empty terrace outside make me uneasy. But what can I be doing that would trouble the unquiet dead? I sleep and wake at dawn-partly my bladder, partly the vigorous noise of nest-building going on among the birds. They can be heard dragging sticks over the tin gutters. They are all singing loudly.???I can???t say I???ve been woken up by nest building but I have experienced a blonde homeless meth-head in the alley below my bedroom window moaning up at me, ???Mom? Mom is that you? Mom????3. ???Skating on the K???s pond last night after eating too much ham. Eight-thirty. Many stars. No moon.??? I would have skated on the pond, too, and eaten ham, you bet your ass I would have but I had to go to Target at 9 pm and buy my child an athletic supporter, which by the way now involves a pair of lycra shorts and a molded plastic cup that goes in the shorts. John Cheever, you never had to go to Target.4. ???I walk and walk. I say a prayer on Fifty-third street. I have lunch and see the ballgame.

I drink Scotch at ten, two Martinis before lunch, and go off to the shrink.???Chekov of the suburbs, let me ask you this: If someone had a pistol to your head, could you make breakfast and lunch at the same time?6. ???Tonight, dirty movies at the firehouse.???Let???s stop you right there, you mean to tell me you go the local firehouse to watch porn with brawny, helpful firefighters?

In my world I call getting tricked into the former being a ???playdate bottom??? and should it get around that you are a ???playdate bottom??? you can kiss your weekends goodbye.8. ???

When he contemplates getting divorced, he wrote, ???I am afraid of living in hotels and eating in cafeterias, and this seems to reflect on my courage.

Because if you can???t live without the smell of peonies in the stairwell, you will not make it as a single mom.Dear AMQR Subscriber,First off, we apologize. We promised that if you signed up for a one-year subscription to the Arthur Miller Quarterly Review you???d be given access to exclusive, never-before-seen photos of acclaimed American playwright Arthur Miller in the nude ??? photos that have yet to be delivered. By now you may believe such photos do not exist. Perhaps you think we invented them as a cheap marketing ploy to give our niche literary journal???s subscription numbers a boost.Nothing could be further from the truth.It???s true that AMQR???s sponsoring institution is slashing our operating budget by seventy percent. We acknowledge that in times like these, a journal might be forced to consider guerrilla tactics. But the fact is, we do have nude photos of Arthur Miller ??? clear, high-resolution images that convey a sense of Miller???s sensuality and playfulness, his cool urban intellect and sensitive bedroom eyes.Trust us when we say these nude pics are amazing.Our nude photos of Arthur Miller light up the room; they make the celestial bodies of the heavens look like cheap orbs of space crap. Our nude photos of Arthur Miller are lush and radiant ??? at turns artful and pornographic, candid yet preternaturally self-aware.???My God,??? said our managing editor when she first saw the pictures. ???Call my family. Tell them I???ll be home late.??? She didn???t leave her office for three whole days.These photos of Arthur Miller, lithe and garmentless ??? how shall we describe them? We already did on AMQR???s Facebook page, which has since been suspended, so we???ll repeat our claims here:Our stunning, high-quality images of Miller wearing nothing but his trademark tortoiseshell glasses will Simply. Take. Your breath away. These photos ??? which we promise will be 100% nude, 100% of the time ??? feature the National Medal of Arts recipient in tasteful but provocative poses: strolling through the pines at his Roxbury, CT estate; shaking hands with Elia Kazan on the set of Dea",100
29,"th of a Salesman; kicking over a garbage can in a fit of righteous temper following a testimony before the House Committee on Un-American Activities. For years, it???s been a well-kept secret among literary elite that Miller enjoyed most of his waking hours naked. We intend to bring you the very best of those hours, and so for a limited-time only we are offering a flipbook of select, nude photos of Arthur Miller along with the purchase of a one-year subscription to the magazine Publisher???s Weekly described as ???one of the top ten journals dedicated to Arthur Miller in southeast Michigan.???To see Miller???s work performed in the theatre is a revelatory moral experience. To read his words on the page is equally thrilling. But what better way to round out one???s knowledge of Miller???s career than to gaze upon his lean feet slapping the tile of his sister Jean Copeland???s Manhattan apartment? Why not appreciate the long curve of thigh angling into the petite buttock of the man the New York Times called ???one of the great American playwrights, whose work exposed the flaws in the fabric of the American dream????Dear AMQR subscriber, did you know?That Arthur Miller, winner of the Pulitzer Prize for Drama, commissioned a lower back tattoo of a bucking mustang while filming The Misfits in the sweltering desert badlands of Nevada?That Arthur Miller, author of All My Sons and The Crucible, went eighty-nine years without a single tan line?That Arthur Miller, colossus of American arts and letters, recipient of honorary degrees from Oxford and Harvard, benefitted from the extra vigor of a supernumerary testicle?Our collection of nude ??? shall we call them urgent? ??? photos of Miller shrugging off the shackles of modern dress are not merely a groundbreaking cultural artifact, they???re what you might call ??? especially for a university-affiliated magazine with unstable funding ??? a game-changer. As the old saying goes, ???He who holds the nude photos of Arthur Miller holds the power, and he who holds the power can tell the Board of Trustees to suck it.???Given all this, why are we coming before you today without any nude photos of Arthur Miller to share?Truth be told, we were a bit hasty in determining the value of our collection. Distributing never-before-seen shots of Miller going full monty for the mere cost of a one-year subscription was irresponsible, if not insulting to the legend himself. That???s why now, for a limited-time only, AMQR is offering customers the chance to see the Kennedy Center Honoree in a series of demure, inviting poses: swatting a locust while climbing the heights of a sturdy sugar maple; climbing out of a taxi at 20th Century Fox; and riding a bicycle through the crowded streets of Beijing.These photos and more ??? did we mention Miller???s nude game of six-wicket with Alexander Calder? ??? can be yours with the purchase of a five-year subscription to the journal Poets & Writers once bet ???would never make it through the Great Recession.??? And just look at us now.Order now, and please enjoy the view!Sincerely,The Editors of Arthur Miller Quarterly ReviewDELEGATE MARSHALL: In the wake of our night at Barney???s Beanery, we must confront the owed sum of $145.87.  So, in the interest of maintaining the balance of power, I propose an equal five-way split.  All in favor?DELEGATE ETHAN: While that sounds good on paper, I did not eat any of the sweet potato fries and therefore cannot be expected to cover that expense and will not agree to this proposal with the terms as written.DELEGATE CHARLOTTE: Similarly, as the designated driver I did not drink anything alcoholic and thusly should be exempt from having to chip in for the bar tab.  Particularly when some parties, whom I will not mention by name, had upwards of four drinks.DELEGATE TARA: Yes, however Charlotte did eat the buffalo chicken pizza and those Shirley Temples cost $2 a pop.  So she was not entirely neutral in this conflict and needs to pay her share.DELEGATE CHARLOTTE: Let it be known that I will be paying under protest.DELEGATE MARSHALL: In which case, it would be more agreeable if we all did our own independent calculations of what we personally owe.  We???ll write those amounts on the check along with each of our credit card numbers.  If there???s a balance left over at the end, I???ll cover that.DELEGATE ETHAN: Oh no.  You???re going to hold that over us as leverage in a future negotiation.DELEGATE MARSHALL: All right.  If there???s anything left over, we divide that balance by five and add it to everyone???s estimated total.  Shall we put it to a vote?DELEGATE JACOB: Don???t have my credit card with me so I???m paying cash.  Only have a twenty so I???m going to be short.DELEGATE CHARLOTTE: And yet you drank four Jack and Cokes?  How were you going to pay for that?DELEGATE JACOB: If I recall correctly, Tara is indebted to me from a previous meal.DELEGATE TARA: You???re calling in that old favor?  That was a 2 AM Fatburger.  Doesn???t come close to covering what you drank tonight.  I will not be bailing you out.MARSHALL: Fine.  We???ll take Jacob???s $20 off the top of the bill.  As future reparations, he promises to pay us back by covering a larger share of the next two tabs.ETHAN: If I might offer a counter proposal.  Say we create two separate bills: one strictly for food and the other for alcohol.  We split those up according to how many people partook of either category.JACOB: That???s not a terrible idea.ETHAN: Perfect.  I owe $15 for my drinks.  And you know what?  I might have that much cash on me.CHARLOTTE: Wait.  I???m placing a moratorium on debate for the time being.  We haven???t factored in the tip.  We need to make sure that our waitress is fairly compensated.ETHAN: Are we tipping off the whole check or just the amount that we pay?MARSHALL: Let???s just make the bill $160 for the sake of easy math.CHARLOTTE: $180 sounds fair.TARA: Oh no.  That means she???s getting almost a 20% tip and she didn???t remotely warrant that from me.  Kind of a weak pour on my Negroni.ETHAN: We???re still on board for the Two Checks Solution, right?  Show of hands?TARA: But with that method I would either be throwing down my credit card for two different bills or adding together two separate totals.  Seems too confusing.JACOB: Although if the waitress does end up having to run 10 different credit cards, then maybe she deserves that 20% tip.CHARLOTTE: After a closed-door sidebar, I have been reminded that I owe Tara for my movie ticket last week at the Arclight.  Therefore, the Charlotte/Tara coalition agrees to cover the entirety of the pizza and wings just so long as someone else pays for the pitchers of beer and cocktails.  In addition, we ask for stricter sanctions to be placed on Jacob for his continued mooching.ETHAN: I agree to these items, considering that it takes the food off the table.  However, I will not be paying for the pitchers of beer that I did not think we needed to begin with.TARA: But you will be covering the tip.  Seeing as you were the one who spilled your drink and she had to mop it up.ETHAN: Fine!  Pile that on top of me too.MARSHALL:  Okay.  I think we???re close to an agreement.  Jacob is paying with cash and an IOU.  Ethan is paying for his own drinks as well as handling the tip.  Charlotte is throwing in for both herself and Tara, covering the pizza and wings.  I will be paying for the first pitcher and the sweet potato fries.[He calculates on his phone.]MARSHALL: ??? And that only brings us to $97.JACOB: We forgot about tax, didn???t we?TARA: And this is exactly why we should have done separate checks to begin with!CHARLOTTE: But we???re friends!  If we do ",100
30,"separate checks, we might as well be eating by ourselves.MARSHALL: Fine!  If it makes everything easier and allows us to bounce the hell out of here and get to the Escape Room on time, I will put down my credit card and cover the entire bill.  Throw me some cash if you feel like it.  Okay?ETHAN: A super power coming in to save the day!  How convenient.  And now we???re all indebted to you!MARSHALL: Do you have a better plan?!?![All delegates remain silent.]MARSHALL: Just VenMo me what you think you owe.TARA: I don???t have VenMo.MARSHALL: It???s a free app. Download it now.TARA: Not without Wi-Fi!  I???m on my parents??? data plan and I???m almost over the limit for the month.- - -???In witness thereof, we the undersigned have agreed to the present articles and have put an end to our conflict.???The bill is paid.???Illustrations by Kelly Bjork- -The night of the Twilight Exit shooting, my friend and coworker Joselynn was across town at a tattoo parlor, getting a pair of commemorative stars inked onto the back of her neck. ???Each star is drawn as an outline, and then there???s like a cloud, with wisps of twilight color coming down, and swoopy Asian-style swirls,??? she said. ???Today I have a few more stars, as I???ve lost more and more loved ones, but I started with my friends Drew and Joe. It was January 27, which is Drew???s birthday. Joe???s is on the 26th. That???s a part of the memorial tattoo???it???s getting the star on their birthday. During the tattoo, I kind of talk about their life and who they were as a person and what they meant to me,??? she said.Joselynn met the guys years earlier through a local circus company. ???I was doing some clowning and stilting and character work. Drew was a sword swallower, and he???d put nails and forks in his nose and things like that. He and Joe were best friends, and they were musicians with the circus band. It was called God???s Favorite Beefcake,??? she said. ???Getting tattooed was a very emotional experience because they both died in such a violent way. They were murdered at the Cafe Racer shooting the May before,??? she said. Soon after Joselynn and the tattoo artist finished at the shop, ???I got in my car to go home, and I turned on the radio. It was set to NPR like always, and they were doing a news announcement. That???s how I learned about the shooting at the Twilight Exit. It happened in real time when I was getting tattooed. I remember bursting into tears and being like, ???Are you fucking kidding me???? It occurred to me that you go there on Sundays for karaoke. I went into a panic. It was just this really familiar feeling.???Meanwhile that night, back at the Twilight Exit, medics carted gunshot victim Greg to an emergency room. ???The staff were on top of me instantly,??? said Greg. ???I???d forced myself to stay conscious the whole night, so when they gassed me up on the operating table, it was kind of a relief. I was like, ???Alright, this is out of my hands now. We???ll see what happens. Either I???m gonna wake up, or I???m not.??? I???m one of the lucky ones, I guess,??? said Greg. When he awoke after surgery, ???it was like, ???Holy shit. I???m alive!??? I was very satisfied with that. I was heavily sedated. They???d put me on morphine. They said they didn???t know what the extent of my recovery was gonna be, but lucky for me, I wasn???t really freaking out about any mobility concerns at the time. When you???re faced with the option of death, it???s like you???re willing to make some trades to stay alive.???In the following days, Greg???s path became increasingly difficult. ???Few people have an actual concept of how much damage one single bullet can do,??? he said. ???My femoral artery had been severed. The bullet threaded the needle through the hole in my pelvic bone,??? said Greg, referring to his obturator foramen. ???The artery snapped. It was like a rubber band that retracted. They had to fish it out of my leg and reattach it. The first surgery took five hours. They put my leg on ice because it was technically dead. Whenever your tissue has no blood in it, it begins rotting almost immediately. They???d used ice to keep my leg preserved, and they pumped it full of blood afterwards to revive the flesh. Because my leg had gone so long without blood, we were worried about clots. If you have one clot, it???ll kill you. It???ll clog your artery, or it???ll slide its way into your brain. That was a very real concern. So I had to have a second surgery two days after the first one. The doctors went into my calf, and they separated my muscles, pulling them apart???that was a huge trauma???and they literally vacuumed up any clotted blood that had formed,??? he said.Photo courtesy of the Seattle Police DepartmentChutzpah DayBecause we had it.

Why not give those kids a break?In the entire history of Denny???s Kid???s Menu, we have never taken sides in the presidential race. Instead, we???ve focused on letting great American kids like you, who have a variety of awesome tastes and values, decide between a number of delicious choices, whether that be dinosaur-shaped chicken nuggets or a Build Your Own Jr. Sundae??. We???ve never seen reason to alter our approach. Until now.Here???s the thing, kids: This year, we???re not being asked to choose between chowing down on some tasty Mac & Cheese or mixing it up with some Chocolate Chip Pancakes. (Breakfast for dinner? Yum!) This year, we???re being asked to choose a Head of State, Head of Government, and Commander-in-Chief for the whole United States. And one of the candidates ??? Republican nominee Donald Trump ??? is, by unanimous consensus of the Denny???s Kid???s Menu Editorial Board, unfit for the presidency.We???ve been highly critical of the GOP nominee in a number of previous Cool Kids Crosswords and Wacky Word Searches that you find along the sides of your Denny???s Kid???s Menus. But with early voting already underway in several states, we???ve decided it???s time we ???get real??? with you and spell out the reasons we think Trump should not be president:He is a bad promise man",100
31,"Trump has been on so many sides of so many issues, it???s like he just wants to be cool but then is a big liar face. He???s the type who tells you that you can have a Jr. Strawberry Banana Bliss Smoothie?? for your drink, but then when grandma shakes her head and makes that tsk-tsk sound, changes his mind and says you should just have water. That???s mean!He???s lame at warTrump sounds like a tough guy when he says you should throw your Sweet Petite Corn?? at those teens at the next table who look like bullies. But Robert Gates, the highly respected former Defense secretary who served presidents of both parties over a half-century, points out that the waitress would totally know it was you who started it, and wouldn???t care if those bullies then lit your table on fire with their cigarette lighters. And then your table is on fire, and where is Trump?He traffics in prejudiceWe???re not going to scare you too much with details here, but basically Trump is saying that only muggles have the capacity to Build Your Own Grand Slam??, and the Chili???s Pepper Pals are trying to take away your Slams.He would bankrupt your favorite Denny???s in a weekTrump has built his candidacy on his achievements as a super-smart business man. Yes, we know your dad is a business man too, and he is super-smart. Your mom is super-smart at business too. But they make stuff and then use what they earn to buy you Apple Dunkers with Caramel Sauce?? because you did extra good at your piano recital. Trump just buys the Denny???s in your town and tells his buddies in the city that they should give him $5 to run it, then closes it and keeps the $5. And then you get no Apple Dunkers.His pants are on fireTrump runs around saying that since he owns all the Denny???s in America, you should let him run your Boy Scouts Popcorn Drive, but when you ask him to show you his incorporation papers because Seth is also pretty good at selling stuff, and you worry about not being Top Pack again this year if you don???t let Seth lead the drive, he says that he can???t because all the Denny???s are being sued by big meanies who are jealous of his great success. And even when you say that???s OK, you still want to see the papers, he tells you to shut your stupid popcorn hole.He says bad wordsTrump was quoted as saying that any pig-face c-words that don???t let their kids get extra bacon with their Jr. Cinnamon Pancake Breakfast?? can go f themselves in the a-hole. While we at Denny???s appreciate the up-sell on the bacon, we could never condone such discourse in a family-friendly restaurant.We on the Denny???s Kid???s Menu Editorial Board are not unmindful of some of the realities behind issues that Trump???s campaign has exploited: the disappearance of working-class jobs; excessive nutritional correctness; the rise of the Islamic State; and the influence of Shake-N-Steakian interests. All are legitimate sources of concern for us.Nor does this express support for Hillary Clinton, who has her own flaws. (We once saw her eat a cantaloupe for breakfast, for the love of God.)But kids, here???s the bottom line: Stay true to your convictions. That might mean a vote for Cantaloupe Clinton. Or it might mean a third-party candidate.Whatever you do, however, resist the siren song of a dangerous doody-face. Tell your parents to vote, just not for Donald Trump.And remember to constantly remind your parents that Kids Eat Free Pancakes Every Day from 4-10PM! (For a limited time only.)Whether you are conservative or liberal, establishment or populist, pundits agree that this is an election year. There is no evidence of a single pundit who asserts that the election is next year, but PolitiFact has yet to issue a true/false rating on the matter.That said, many political journalists, including FiveThirtyEight???s Nate Silver, have compared this election to other things. It???s not surprising then that party insiders across the ideological spectrum, from Glenn Beck to former president Jimmy Carter, agree with Nate Silver that this election can be compared to other things that are not this election. These are almost all metaphors or similes. I made a simile once in 2004. I said to my fiance??e, ???This gumbo is heaven.???It may have been a metaphor.But either way, political theorists this year have conducted significant numbers of analyses on the effect of social media. The consensus is that people like social media, and they use it a bunch. I like it just OK. One example of this is Pinterest.My fiance??e created a Pinterest account and used it for two weeks.To date this year, both Quinnipiac University and Rasmussen Reports, each considered among the gold standard of polls, have only questioned likely voters from this election cycle. No surveys taken this year (from any pollster!) have polled likely voters from previous elections. On the other hand, nearly 100% of 2012 polls polled people in 2012, but not a single poll taken this election cycle has yet to do so.Some people refer to people from Poland as ???Poles.???That said, Politico staff writer Ben Schreckinger wrote, ???As secretary of state, she appointed an ???innovation adviser??? and created an ???innovation award for the empowerment of women and girls,?????? and I???m pretty sure he was talking about Hillary Clinton.I went to college with Ben Schreckinger, and he seemed like a bright guy then, so I trust him now.But no matter who you trust, cable news anchors this year have devoted uncountable minutes of coverage to racism allegations against Mr. Trump. While on the other hand, there is almost no coverage of racism allegations against me. This makes me feel good, because my fiance??e doesn???t like racism. She says it???s bad.I???m pretty sure she is Korean-American.Now, it???s not uncommon for pundits to reference another election cycle, such as 2004, when George W. Bush won a majority of delegates in an uncontested GOP primary. However, this election cycle is the first since 2004 in which I have a fiance??e, Korean-American or not (Nate Silver???s Polls-Plus model has yet to account for her race).Notably, Republican financier Karl Rove has remained silent on the topic. And despite ???GOP Primary??? trending on Twitter for 23+ weeks this cycle, no pundit has accounted for how my fiance??-or-not status could affect the GOP outcome in 2004 or in this year 2016.But in 2012, Obama won the presidency.On the Democratic side, YouGov???s primary polling results remain inconclusive, but market analysts agree that Mr. Trump???s ex-campaign manager Paul Manafort has demonstrated a clear and consistent bias towards Mr. Trump.I???d guess that is because Paul is a former employee of Mr. Trump, but also because Paul believes in Mr. Trump. I think that???s nice, to believe in someone else. I often wish Paul Manafort would believe in me. Maybe he???ll read this and let me know he believes in me. I hope he does.He sure looks like my dad.Sometimes at night when there isn???t a lot of air pollution, I drive out into the Finger Lakes National Forest and look up at the stars, and tell myself that somewhere somehow, Paul Manafort is looking up at the same stars. But SurveyMonkey polling results are also inconclusive on the matter.Rick Santorum has not responded to numerous inquires on the matter. And I understand why. It has nothing to do with him.So despite the near endless comparisons, analyses, and data collected on this election, all evidence points to the fact that the election remains this year in 2016.And I???m pretty sure Trump is racist.""1.

Not another country but our country. Our country is called the United States of America and that???s just something we all know, all of us who support Gary Johnson.But maybe you???re one of those people planning to move to another country if Donald Trump is elected. If so, I???ll be curious to see which country you choose. Maybe you???ll move to that big one north of us that has maple syrup, or to the one that the Mexicans come from that I can???t recall the name of right now, but I do know that free trade with that country is a disaster and it???s also a disaster with the country that has maple syrup and those police who ride on horses.You could also move across one of the oceans, I suppose, the one on the right, I think that ocean is smaller than the one on the left but I do know it???s big, I do know that, the oceans are very big, they contain most of the world???s fresh water, in fact, and most of its fish, which is not widely known, and on the other side of the ocean on the right you can live in a country in Asia or Europe or whichever, one of those land masses that starts with a ???C.???Are they incontinence? I believe they are. What are we calling those now? Africa is incontinence and I believe Arctica is as well. I believe that???s what they???re called, I believe that???s right, and in any case that doesn???t matter, does it? What matters is that this election is not a binary. We have a chance to take a deep breath and choose a third way, choose entrepreneurs and choose the light of freedom, choose a different color than the two primary colors you???re being offered by the media and our corrupt party system, which I think are green and green but, again, that doesn???t matter so much even though green is the color of a lot of things, both bad things and very very good things.But most of all this election is about limiting government. That???s what Gary Johnson believes. It???s about putting money back in the hands of our citizens so it???s not wasted on big government programs and corporate welfare and public schools with their geography classes and their history classes and their civics classes and so it???s not wasted on things like wars with countries like ISIS and terrorist organizations like Aleppo.Prove that there is a tangible reason that you are single in order to help distant relatives who think you are objectively smart and strangers who think you are objectively attractive make sense of our chaotic existence that allows someone like you to be alone using mathematical induction.1. The Nora Ephron Theorem of Soulmates:Where (x, y) = (you, your soulmate), and t = timeLet us solve for y???In which the square root of one lifetime without you is a complex number of y paired with an imaginary unit, i.Through this theorem, x will spend her lifetime alone because y is an imaginary expectation of perfection and absolute satisfaction embodied in a human as demonstrated by the CW network and it will never exist, let alone come to New York to save x from herself.2. Theory of ProbabilityWhere t = time (in years) and sm = [social interaction]maleAs t and sm increase, x remains the same, thus increasing the probability of that equation resulting in y, or your soulmate.In this case, 24x is divided by the number of males that x has encountered within the age span, keeping in mind the exception to this rule, The Billy Loomis factor.Following the logical schematic exclusions of social interaction with males who plot to murder x in a Freudian revenge model (like Billy Loomis in Scream), we must subtract the sum total of the Billy Loomis Factor from overall male-interactions, i.e. boys who cheat on x, boys who use x as a soundboard to talk about their own accomplishments, boys who tell x that they usually date Victoria-Secret-types but x is a re",100

As evidenced by the graph, x is approaching her limit.4. Parallel Dating Theorem: If Tinder???s Used, What Else Is Used?This theorem can be employed if and only if the limit of the Stress-Suffering-Sorrow Congruence limit is adjusted for a higher volume of s3, and, as evidenced by Fig. 1, x has just about had it up to here with all of that s3 shit.5.

Because I???m pressured to see as many patients as possible in as little time as possible, I???m often not able to spend as much time with each patient as I would like. Believe me: I wish I had more than eight minutes with a patient to show him I could care less if he lives or dies.Like my patients, I, too, miss when physicians had personal, one-on-one relationships with everyone they saw. Gone are the days when I had time to build a rapport with a patient so I could break it to him slowly and surely that I had no regard for his pathetic excuse of a life. I used to have entire conversations with my patients about how little I cared about them, and even though I like that I no longer have to let my patients finish their sentences, eight minutes is never enough time for patients to pick up on how little their health or even their actual presence in my office matters to me.Eight minutes per visit is barely enough time to identify a patient???s ???chief complaint??? let alone to dismiss it outright and offhand. Only sometimes do I have enough time to show the proper amount of disdain when someone describes the sound that his joint makes when he walks up a flight of stairs. But never do I have the time to reassure a patient who lives in a state of constant pain that I???m actually thinking about my upcoming trip to Greece instead of how to treat his ailment. Sometimes I???m so pressed for time that my only recourse is to bring a medical student in the room so the patient can have two people not care about him at the same time.The truth is that most of the time I don???t have the answers for my patients, anyway. Seriously, I have a buttload of schooling and I???m expert and everything, but the human body is massively, insanely, practically-inhumanely complex. If I had more time for my patients??? visits and it was more acceptable for a doctor to acknowledge the limits of medicine, I might explain that honestly sometimes we doctors are just as flummoxed as our patients are. But then again, that???s a conversation I might be willing to have if I was willing to care about my patients in the first place. In the meantime, I???ll just keep emailing their prescriptions to them while they???re still in my office ??? because my time at my computer counts against their eight allotted minutes.Speaking of which, I hate it when a patient comes in with his own possible diagnosis, or information about his health that he???s researched for himself. Listen, I am the doctor here; let me do the Googling. Sure, I might not be able to find anything that you haven???t already read, but you can always just bring the same complaint back to me at your next appointment, nine months after this one when my office can finally squeeze you in.Driver: J.R.R.

The girls arrived at the ball to find in Mr. Bingley all that was promising: a handsome and amiable man, with happy manners and an engaging countenance. His friend Mr. Darcy was handsomer still, and the room soon filled with half-whispered conversation of his person and its ten thousand a year. Another man, evidently from Town, was talking to them rather loudly. Mr. Trump???s countenance was orange, his manner coarse, accent harsh, and wig ginger. No one could ascertain his income, as the number kept changing at his own report. But the company soon decided that he was the handsomest, upon finding that he possessed several estates, all of them furnished entirely of gold.Such merit must speak for itself, but it did not speak long. Mr. Trump???s reputation soon suffered even more materially than that of Mr. Darcy, who was merely found proud, taciturn, and unpleasant. Trump???s errors were of a far graver sort. He strolled about the room complimenting no one but himself, was angry with his dance partners when he trod on their feet, and he ate all the little cakes made particularly for the refreshment of the ladies.Mrs. Bennet soon became as virulent in her dislike of him as she had been in urging her daughters to marry him, Trump having insulted her second eldest daughter, Elizabeth. The number of ladies unfortunately exceeding the number of gentlemen, Elizabeth had sat down without a partner for the third dance.On seeing her, Trump said, for any one to hear, ???You know, ladies love me. They love me. I am ???uge with women, let me tell you. I am good. They all wanna dance with me and I say, no, not good, stupid. You???re a loser. I???m a winner. I win, it???s what I do. I see a lady sitting down with no partner, like this Elizabeth Bennet, and I say not good, she???s a loser. She???s got blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her everywhere. It???s disgusting. Women, disgusting, losers, believe me.??????What???? said Darcy.- - -For Mrs. Bennet the remedy for such dislike was easy. Trump had only to show a decided interest in one of her daughters.Elfrida was not the most handsome Bennet sister, but she was by far the most devot",100
34,"ed Tory. And, against all his public declarations of his refusal to settle with any but a most exotic beauty, Trump seemed in a fair way towards falling violently in love with her. All that remained to seal their union, at least to Mrs. Bennet???s mind, was to invite him to a family dinner.Accordingly, a date was set, and Trump arrived in state, opening the evening with his compliments to Elfrida???s bosom, and then settling unhappily on the subject of politics.???The Irish question. You know, it???s not really a question. We govern them, right? And some of them want independence, but some of them come over here and work in our mills. They eat our food. They bring their crime. There???s criminals, rapists, drunks they bring over here,??? said Trump.???Yes!??? Elfrida cried, her eyes quite wild, her complexion flushed and feverish. ???The Irish are criminals and blackguards! Exactly so?????????Elfrida,??? Elizabeth interrupted, ???will you please pass the potatoes???????And it???s an easy solution,??? continued Trump, ???But you got this crooked, phony William Pitt for Prime Minister. And he???s not doing anything about it, and actually he started it. I???d fix it easy. I???d put up a wall, between England and Ireland, keep out the criminals and the losers.??????Oh yes, quite so! Keep out the losers, keep in the winners. Then we???ll only have winners! How clever you are,??? gasped Elfrida, eyes glowing with admiration.Elizabeth raised her brow archly. ???Is not the Irish Sea some impediment to this plan, sir???? she inquired.???That???s a loser idea, believe me,??? he replied. ???The wall would be no problem, I can do it. I get things done. I???m a winner, understand? You know, Napoleon, here???s a guy who???s a great leader for his country. He???s a great leader. And French trade is very attracted to me. Let me tell you, Napoleon could build a wall. There???s two guys who could do it: Napoleon and me. But I???ll do it better and it???ll have forty-foot letters on it. The Trump name. In gold. I???m that good.??????What???? said Mr. Bennet.- - -It was all as Mrs. Bennet hoped: in three weeks, Trump and Elfrida were married. Everything at the ceremony was draped in gold, from the ornate carriage Trump had commissioned to the elaborate cravat that adorned his person.Though the wedding ended in a hail of tiny gold figurines in the groom???s likeness, Trump and his bride left the neighbourhood with considerable debts. The workmen, tailor, vicar, and cook for the wedding were left unpaid. It was much to the detriment of his purse, but Mr. Bennet laughed, ???He???s a capital man ??? he will best them all in swaggering falsehoods and gold lace cravats. I challenge any of my neighbours to find such an admirable turnip for a son-in-law. Do you know, I think he took all the children???s bon bons!???- - -Some years later, Elizabeth and her husband received word that a most surprising candidate was making a bid for parliament. The man was none other than Trump. He ran on a platform to build a wall in the middle of the Irish Sea, and praised Napoleon???s attempts to spy on his Whig competition for the seat.???What the fuck???? cried Elizabeth.???Quite,??? said Darcy.DISCLAIMER: I feel I should list Lin-Manuel Miranda as co-author of this piece, because it is littered with Hamilton  lyrics. I can???t help it; it???s just how my brain works now. My thanks and deepest respect to Mr. Miranda.- -Elizabeth (???Eliza???) Schuyler Hamilton (1757-1854) was not like most of us. She???s not pissed about things that would upset regular people. For example, she???s not mad that there is an entire hit musical, no, phenomenon, no, something so big there isn???t even a word for it yet, about her husband.Hamilton: An American Musical does not piss Eliza Hamilton off, though others have complained that Eliza does not get the attention in the show that she deserves. In fact, I think Eliza would be thrilled with the way that Lin-Manuel Miranda has finally brought Alexander Hamilton the acclaim that Eliza always felt her husband deserved. Whether the show makes you think that Hamilton was a genius or a pain in the ass (both are true), once you???ve seen it or listened to the music you at least know who he was and some of what he did.And a lot of the credit for that, by the way, goes to Eliza. She lived fifty years longer than Alexander, but she never remarried, and spent most of her time preserving his legacy. If Alexander was a bit manic, Eliza was a steady force, pushing past people who tried to dismiss or ignore Alexander???s accomplishments.My favorite is the story of former president James Monroe visiting Eliza to make amends for his role in revealing Alexander???s sex scandal, and she had no time for it. She asked him to leave. A former president and his intimidating security detail came to her home with a peace offering and she told him off, you guys. Eliza Hamilton would not be intimidated or appeased. (See Ron Chernow???s book, Alexander Hamilton, for details of this juicy story.)Some call Eliza weak for defending her husband even after his death when, of all people in the world, she had greatest cause to be angry beyond repair. But defending Alexander and being deeply angry with or hurt by him were not mutually exclusive for Eliza.In my mind, her grudge against Monroe highlights her strength. Of course she was shattered by Alexander???s infidelity. Of course it damaged their marriage. But she made a decision to stick with him and whatever you think of that, you have to admire the fact that her support for Alexander didn???t waver. In fact, it seemed to grow. (You thought I was going to say ???burn,??? didn???t you?)Eliza was too busy to deal with former presidents, anyway. She raised funds to build the Washington Monument, she interviewed soldiers who???d fought with her husband, she collected Alexander???s writings for a biography she never got to see published, she sent necessities to refugee families, she fought for the army pay that Alexander had himself refused, and she opened and helped run an orphanage.Oh, and let???s not forget those eight kids she was raising. Her youngest was only two years old when Alexander died.All of this leads me to a question that I???ve heard people ask. Was Eliza too good?For religious and societal reasons, it was important to Eliza to be good, but she was not content to be ignored. She could insert herself into situations because she sought recognition not for herself, but for her late husband. That is bad ass, people. You want to ignore me? Okay. You want to require women to be labeled either sluts or angels? That???s fine. My papers are orderly. Now watch me raise a man from attempted obscurity and basically run the world at the same time.You heard me. Eliza???s soundtrack includes Beyonc??, and that should not surprise anyone. Miranda gave Eliza an entire song called ???Helpless,??? perhaps to illustrate that in most ways she was far from it. Nicely played, Irony.A better question than ???Was Eliza too good???? is, ???Does the same thing happen to men???? Women are often dismissed for being ???too good,??? which usually means chaste, submissive, and largely silent. Don???t call attention to yourself. Don???t interrupt. Don???t assert your presence or authority. While these adages are finally (and ever so slowly) changing, they are still more true for women than they are for men.But it???s a paradox, isn???t it? Women are expected to be good, shamed for being anything less, but also disregarded for it because being good is simply the expectation. I think Eliza would be pissed about that. But again, she was probably too busy and eventually, too heartb",100
35,"roken, to worry about it.Eliza was pregnant nine times between 1781 and 1802, and lost one child to miscarriage. She was 3 months pregnant as she laid next to her nineteen-year-old firstborn son, Philip, and watched him die of a gunshot wound.Try to take that in and imagine what it would be like.You know she was pissed off about that.Eliza weathered Alexander???s infidelity and the shockingly public scandal surrounding it. She survived a miscarriage, her daughter???s mental health issues, and, within four years, the deaths of her son, husband, sister, mother, and father. Two of those deaths could have been quite easily avoided if the male culture had been less prone to duels.???Can we agree that duels are dumb and immature???????Sure. But your man has to answer for his words.???Alexander Hamilton was in general against revenge and bad blood, and yet he not only counseled his nineteen-year-old son before Philip died in a duel, but was of course himself killed in one of the most famous duels in American history, just two years after (and in the same place) his son died.See how that happens? This piece took a quick turn and began to focus on Alexander. It???s a trick of history, focusing on white men as though they???re the only ones in the room where it happens. Eliza played that trick against itself, making sure that history had its eyes on her husband, but at the same time establishing herself as the core of that history.Who, after all, would Alexander Hamilton have been, how would he be remembered, without Eliza?They had it all???A sunny spot in the living room and the complete absence of love.Several sofas, a nap shelf, dinners in which the food would be left untouched.Nine-bedroom home in the suburbs, scratching post castle, out of control spending.A litter box with a roof, a single ball of aluminum foil, and a staring contest that lasted for years.A house full of mice, lots of really dangerous group sex.Wall-to-wall carpeting, unlimited kitty treats, and a casual indifference to life and everything that existed outside of the self, which I found refreshing.Leaky faucets for sipping, a gullible teenage son I was able to convince to murder his parents.Laps.   The two major presidential candidates have been running neck-and-neck until today, one leading in the polls one moment, the other inching ahead the next. But now, in the last five minutes, this latest outrageous racist comment / email revelation / report of business ties to a hostile country / fainting spell / literal pressure cooker on 27th Street / tacit acknowledgement that federal taxes are for suckers, has changed everything. We have crossed the rubicon. It???s clear who will win now.In retrospect, we should have known that this would swing the election. The pay-for-play corruption / tendency to hunker down when feeling threatened / predilection for pissing off Colin Powell / BMI index indicating obesity / adamant refusal of any living being to ever call Sean Hannity, was always there, a snake lurking in the grass ready to strike and sway America towards crucial decision.The poignant message of a grieving father / Matt Lauer???s fact-checking deficiencies / ill-timed usage of the word ???deplorables???, will always be remembered as the moment when ???45??? came alive. In a sense, the rebounding economy / but not for everyone / 6-foot-tall portrait purchased with charitable donations, symbolizes everything that???s right / wrong / batshit crazy about America.This trip to Mexico / post convention bounce / unexpected if tepid endorsement / inability to distinguish between a refugee and a confectionery / spectacular popularity of Michelle Obama / description of the NRA as ???very, very good people,??? may also have helped to convince voters to leave their fence-sitting days behind them. What is certain is that there???s no going back to a tight race now that everyone knows about the retired military officials??? letter / behind-the-scenes Russian interference / existence of the word ???braggadocious??? /  tantalizing prospect of ubiquitous taco trucks.The Aleppo confusion / Bernie Bro factor / POTUS stump speech / Breitbart scare tactics, means that many of us will probably not bother voting at all, now that the matter of the conspiracy theory / foundation ties / casino debt / FBI investigation / penis size has been put to rest. Particularly as both candidates have struggled to win our trust / made more money in a day than most Americans make in a year / put forward no plan whatsoever to address the $14 trillion national debt, it appears that scores of Americans will likely use November 8th as a day to catch up on their errands, since we know who will win.Though many of us will never quite understand how Ted Cruz didn???t seem to care about the Kennedy assassination being linked to his father / 18-24 year olds didn???t seem to care about Roe vs Wade being overturned / Jimmy Fallon didn???t seem to care about his Gramercy Park neighbors snubbing him in the elevator, some Americans did appear to concede that the Common Core curriculum /  Macy???s / TSA / Debbie Wassermann Schultz / Major League Baseball / Jeb Bush / Charles Koch / Morning Joe / The United States / George Will / Mitt Romney / Megyn Kelly / Rand Paul / ISIS / the mainstream media / The Commission on Presidential Debates / The Republican Party / New Jersey, was a disaster / laughable / kooky / rigged / low energy / hard to watch / a psycho / a total loser / a dummie / pathetic / sad / boring / ridiculous / irrelevant / truly weird / all talk and no action / unacceptable / underachieving / drooling / dopey / sleepy / not looking smart / deeply troubled / divided / incompetent / neurotic / no longer credible / a joke.As news of the game-changing health crisis / revealed tax returns / failure to smile broke, ten million Americans / residents of Flint, Michigan / 400-pound DNC hacker sitting on a bed / the cast of Broad City / some guy with a bumper sticker that says DON???T JUDGE MY PIT BULL AND I WON???T JUDGE YOUR KIDS applied for Canadian citizenship / immediately started googling ???how to impeach the president??? / broke down and cried.Just days ago, it seemed as if by mentioning or not mentioning poverty / tax cuts / the NRA / Delaware / the Mar-a-Lago wedding / Mike Pence / Meatloaf, that the election would come down to the wire. Pollsters / data scientists / geek forecasters illustrating margins of victory with confusing real-time red and blue graphics, were predicting that we???d enter November filled with uncertainty / dread / apocalyptic prophecies, because the polls were too close to call / inexplicably disparate / driving everyone bananas.But those moments of ambiguity are no longer, and it???s all because of cyberattacks / Paul Ryan / a crying baby / the lawsuit / white males / what happened at that rally / Mormon indifference / a bad hair day / Snifflegate / Rosie O???Donnell / Florida.While the gender divide / minority vote / silent majority / ex-wives club proved much more critical in this election than anyone could have anticipated, it was always going to be a matter of who could beat the odds / miss the 45-yard field goal / score in sudden death overtime / meld enough cards to beat their canasta opponent. But absolutely no one predicted that in the end he really just couldn???t keep his mouth shut / journalists would start taking their job seriously / she genuinely believed in Jesus.1.  Anetheron2.

36,"ever meant so much outside of mathematics and Yelp ratings. On the morning of September 11th, 2001, four attacks were committed by the Islamic terrorist group al-Qaeda, causing the collapse of the Twin Towers in New York City, damaging the Pentagon in Washington, D.C., and scuffing up the ground in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.At least that???s what is commonly accepted to have occurred. However, the only thing conspiracy theorists commonly accept is that anything that is commonly accepted is completely wrong. And if you try to tell them that isn???t logical, they???ll tell you, ???Logic Isn???t Logical,??? and they???ll hand you a shirt with that printed on the front, and you???ll wear it often, because, hey, free shirt.Did the events of 9/11 happen the way the government claims? Was 9/11 actually an Inside Job despite the fact that it clearly took place outside? Who was ultimately responsible for the horrifying loss of life and increased sales of tiny American flags? Osama bin Laden? President Bush? Are they the same person? I???ve never seen them in the same room and I???m always looking.In this article, I???ll examine claims of conspiracy theorists, debunkers, and then rebunk them both using all the words I know how to spell correctly, some I don???t know how to spell correctly, and some nobody knows how to spell correctly.Can I find some truth in the world of Truthers? Most would say, ???No,??? but in German, ???No??? is nein, the eleventh most useful word in the language. Coincidence? I think not.Like my other free shirt says: COINCIDENCES DON???T EXIST.- -Conspiracy Claim: Jet fuel can???t melt steel beams, which proves that it was actually strategically placed controlled demolitions that brought down the Twin Towers.Debunking Claim: The National Institute of Standards and Technology concluded that the burning jet fuel didn???t need to melt the steel beams in the towers, only to weaken them enough to bring about the collapse.Rebunking Claim: The heinous attacks on the World Trade Center were perpetrated for one purpose: to educate people on whether or not jet fuel can melt steel beams. Think about it. Before 9/11, maybe a handful of jet fuel experts were aware that burning jet fuel would be unable to melt steel beams. Nowadays, it???s a commonly recited fact, like 2+2=4 or that George Washington was the first President not to walk on the moon. So who planned the attacks in order to get this knowledge out into the world? Think of the smartest person you know. It was probably that person. Blame them for 9/11 the next time you see them.- -Conspiracy Claim: Bush did 9/11. The President of the United States needed a reason to attack and invade Iraq and Afghanistan, so he arranged the September 11th attacks to justify his actions. It was an inside job.Debunking Claim: The 9/11 Commission Report, requested by President Bush and Congress, found absolutely no evidence or support to this claim or any claim attributing the attacks to high-ranking government officials. It was not an inside job.Rebunking Claim:  The 9/11 Commission Report should be titled the 9/11 Omission Report, because it didn???t include the only fact that matters: Bush didn???t do 9/11 ??? Lee Greenwood did 9/11. ???Who???s Lee Greenwood???? you ask, like an uncultured idiot. He???s the writer and singer of ???God Bless The USA,??? the ???I???m proud to be an American??? song that rose up the music charts as the towers fell, and twice as fast. The song, off of Greenwood???s famously underrated Youve Got a Good Loving Comin??? album, was originally released in 1984, and after 17 years of almost no radio play, Greenwood knew he needed to do something to get the song some traction. What better way to get a patriotic song some airplay than by planning one of the most devastating attacks on America in all of history? Who were those hijackers then, if not al-Qaeda members? This picture might shine a light on that.- -Conspiracy Claim: While not directly responsible, the government knew about the attacks and allowed them to happen, much like the attack on Pearl Harbor, to propel the country into war.Debunking Claim: At most, the government had memos stating that Osama bin Laden desired to make an attack on US soil, but assuredly didn???t have intel regarding the 9/11 attacks. Even if a war was desired by the Bush administration, it could???ve been achieved much easier and without allowing the loss of so many American lives.Rebunking Claim: It is very astute to compare 9/11 to Pearl Harbor, because the government was most certainly aware of both attacks and let them happen for the very same reason: to invigorate the film industry. Both ???surprise??? attacks gave Hollywood???s writers easy screenplay ideas, bringing about such great-ish films as Pearl Harbor, Tora! Tora! Tora!, United 93, World Trade Center, and Loose Change. Genius ideas for movies just don???t happen, you have to let them happen, and that involves accepting that thousands of people will die and massive wars will start. You wouldn???t even believe me if I told you what atrocities were allowed to occur for Shrek to come about. Here???s a hint: it involves Bosnia.- -Conspiracy Claim: The ???planes??? that hit the Twin Towers and the Pentagon were missiles surrounded by holograms that were made to appear as planes.Debunking Claim: Not only is this supposition well beyond current hologram technology, it cannot account for the missing planes, passengers, and hijackers. This claim is as incorrect as it is absurd.Rebunking Claim: The old ???the planes were holograms??? claim is just a hologram of what really happened. Of course there were planes! However, there were no towers. And no Pentagon. And no field in Pennsylvania. Those were all holograms. Always have been and always will be. The Twin Towers were a symbol of business and commerce. They didn???t need to be real. The Pentagon is a symbol of defense and military might. It doesn???t need be tangible. The field in Pennsylvania is a symbol of grass and dirt. It works just as well as a projection as a reality. So if the planes were real, but the things they crashed into were holograms, why???d the planes explode? Airline food, obviously.- - Conspiracy Claim: Insider trading involving United Airlines and American Airlines, the airlines involved in the attacks, and certain defense contractors proves that there was extensive foreknowledge regarding the attacks.Debunking Claim: The trading irregularities leading up to 9/11 have been explained as unrelated to the terrorist attacks. The only proven foreknowledge of the events has been linked to al-Qaeda and those responsible for the attacks.Rebunking Claim: We didn???t have foreknowledge, but with our current postknowledge, we can always pull a Back to the Future and make it so it never happened.The key to asking a successful question to a literary festival panel is preparation. You???ll want to have every detail of the preface to your question prepared, such as your name, age, and entire medical history. Don???t worry about the actual question; you can make that up as you go along.Once you finally find the microphone after several doomed attempts to follow the clear directions of the host, you???re going to want to cut short your unprompted analysis of how your eczema has influenced your approach to creative nonfiction to ask an important question:Can the sound guy give you some more foldback, please? You really need some more foldback for when you ask your actual question.O.K., so the audience is starting to get a bit restless during your back and forth with the sound guy, and a few people are throwing moleskines at your head. Give them some time. Ev",100
37,"entually they???ll understand that this event is actually all about you.Wow, someone just got you pretty good in the kidney with a hardcover Sylvia Plath anthology. But don???t doubt your approach now, you???re really getting into some interesting territory here with this weeping-into-the-microphone-and-explaining-that-you???re-trying-a-lot-harder-to-be-present-at-the-moment schtick. Take time to remind yourself that those aren???t necessarily boos you???re hearing; it???s most likely just your imposter syndrome playing up again.So, security says one more attempt to guilt-trip the panel into doing a table read of your one-act play and you???re going to be escorted out. I guess you???re going to have to ask a question. Just make sure you don???t fall into the all too common trap of asking about the work of one of the panelists. Writers hate nothing more than reflecting on their work in a way that illuminates both the audience and themselves not just about their own writing, but the very nature of writing itself. Yawn.No, what the panel really wants to do is give you very specific career advice that???s only applicable to your very specific situation.You???ve got to be kidding. This panel of Dante Alighieri scholars say they have no words of wisdom about getting a foot in the door of the fiercely competitive erotic thriller e-book market? Well, guess you better ask a question about their work. Just try to make it as protracted and impenetrable as possible. Here???s a fail-safe option if you???re really stuck:???In 1977, the Voyager spacecraft launched, taking with it phonograph records of sounds and images that could show extraterrestrial lifeforms what life is like on planet Earth. Firstly, why were none of the panelists??? audiobooks on the Voyager? And follow up question, does this demonstrate a failure of the audiobook industry, the Voyager, or the ability of your prose to translate into the audio form? And follow up follow up question, if you could invite three guests, living or dead, to a dinner party, would you invite Carl Sagan? And if not, would that be because he was in charge of compiling the phonograph records that were on the Voyager spacecraft? Because if so, that???s totally understandable, I???d be annoyed too.???Ouch, does the security guard really have to grab your neck so tight while dragging you out? Does he not care at all about the welfare of your snood? It???s O.K., pain is temporary, but those confused looks you received from the panelists will last forever.As you stand outside, you might think your interaction with the panel is over. Wrong. Pick up where you left off by live-tweeting your medical history using the literary festival???s hashtag. As this hashtag belongs to a literary festival, you will be the only person using it, and your tweets will automatically appear on the giant screen behind the panel. Don???t be put off tweeting by the piercing screams of audience members. What these people don???t understand is that, through your actions today, you have actually asked them all an important question.Is it ever worth sticking around to hear the audience Q&A at a literary festival panel?Here???s a list of Jill Stein canvassers I met in the past four months ??? on the third weeks of the past four months to be exact. They would not buy me tampons.1. BrianBrian is an independent filmmaker I met via a casting call for a woman who is ethereal but down to Earth, quirky but conventional, self deprecating but confident, who doesn???t work out but has perfect measurements. Brian???s film is about a young man struggling to step out of the shadows of his controlling dad while still spending all his dad???s money. Brian says he???s voting for Jill Stein because Hillary???s not far left enough, but he???s really doing it so he can feel edgy while still using his parents??? money to fund his film. Brian will sacrifice his sheets and your PJs in order to not think about what his old school dad would say if he purchased tampons in public.2. FarleyI met Farley at a friend???s D&D party during which he???d point out historical inaccuracies (but he didn???t seem to have a problem with there being a three headed dragon in the game.) Farley has a degree in anthropology. Good god, Farley, please stop talking about anthropology. Farley likes to chronologically date layers of sediment FOR FUN. He???s voting for Jill Stein because she has a degree in anthropology. He will not buy tampons because he wants to see how menstrual blood ages over time in order to better understand his Victorian panty artifacts. Don???t date this guy. He has a collection of Victorian panty artifacts.3. GregGreg lives with his mom in a cabin in Tahoe. I met him on Tinder. What Greg did NOT mention on Tinder is that his mom would accompany us on our date and comment on my narrow birthing hips. Greg is very enthusiastic about Jill Stein. I happened to notice Greg???s mom looks a lot like Hillary Clinton. Greg wouldn???t go out and buy me tampons because it reminded him of when his mom made him go out and buy her tampons.4. SkyeSkye hasn???t read anything that isn???t on Tumblr. I met her on Tumblr. I don???t think she???s ever been off of Tumblr. Skye refuses to take a photo of her face for Tumblr because she???s afraid of radiation. Yeah, I tried to tell her, but she just FEELS like there???s face seeking radiation in the camera. Skye is voting for Jill Stein because, while she says she???s not an anti-vaxxer, she likes the idea of having a regulatory board to take a ???serious look at??? vaccines. I tried to tell her this already exists, but she just FEELS like the FDA aren???t doing their job. She won???t buy anyone tampons but she will buy you an organic plant based version of a Diva Cup that does not work.[Part I, Part II, Part III, Part IV, Part V, Part VI, Part VII, Part VIII, Part IX, Part X, Part XI, Part XII, Part XIII, Part XIV, Part XV, Part XVI, Part XVII,Part XVIII, and Part XIX"".]- - -Part XX: In Which King Gylfi of Sweden Learns about the Fimbulwinter- -So like I ???as telling yah, Thor???s been passed out, yah know, just sleepin??? it off undah some wicked deep pile???ah snow on the side???ah the road ovah by Haymahket since fuckin???

She smiles, pats the coffee maker and jumps up to grab that sweet sweet Java from the counter. As she stands, TAYLOR looms behind her, sweaty, besweatered and covered in gore.

Then, instead of heading directly to urgent care, convince yourself you can fight it off by drinking cranberry juice. When the bacteria travel to your kidneys, fever and uncontrollable shaking will compel your spouse to assume all parenting duties. Two days recuperating beneath an electric blanket will provide you with the time and space to re-imagine the structure of your novel. Additional perks: fever dreams, seven-day supply of Zithromax.Night at The Purple House: A ResidencyThe Purple House is the size of an elf???s garden shed, dusted with a fine patina of sand, and strewn with toy saucepans and plastic food. To gain admittance to this creative retreat, bribe your preschooler with four chocolate chips. While your family sleeps, tiptoe into the backyard and duck through the Purple House???s door frame. Balance a notebook on your kneecaps and scrawl the lines of dialog exchanged by rapping marzipan trout from your fever dream. Pro tip: When raccoons forage through the nearby compost bin, resist the urge to confront them. Armed though you may be with your daughter???s plastic sword and shield, you must recognize the raccoons for what they are: a distraction.The Early Bird FellowshipThis fellowship is available only to writers who also serve as adjunct English instructors. To apply, simply schedule your office hours at 6:00 am on a Friday morning. Voila! You???ve just won a disruption-free block of writing time. Early Bird Fellows enjoy use of a dusty basement office with a vintage green-screen computer that rumbles plaintively through its forty-five minute start-up time. The office will be inexplicably filled with crushed leaves and boxes of books belonging to an adjunct instructor who died five years ago.

It took all night and the following day. In the case file, a detective described the bar???s interior, with its hardwood floors and ???lilac-purple painted walls,??? she noted. ???Although multiple hanging ceiling lamps were in use, the lighting was fairly dim. There was an open area, presumably used as a performance space for karaoke. A television displaying ???Sing like a pro??? was hung from a wall above a fake fireplace.??? The lounge and dining areas ???were in a state of disarray. Tables and chairs were turned over. Laptop computers, cell phones, clothing, and other personal property had been left behind throughout. Half-eaten food and beverages remained on the tables and bar.??? Later, when the Twilight???s long-time manager Shira entered the space, ???it felt like everything was frozen in time,??? she told me. ???At one table, it was obvious that someone???s birthday party had been interrupted. That made me so sad.??????CSI left a mess,??? said the Twilight???s owner Stephan in a separate interview. ???They???d moved everything that wasn???t bolted to the floor. They dug into the walls. They wanted to be sure they found all the bullets and the casings. They left flags and sticks and measuring-tape stickers over every bullet hole,??? he said. In the lounge, authorities recovered bullet fragments from approximately a half-dozen strays. One bullet chipped the tile floor, others left holes in the wood-paneled walls. One shattered a stack of glasses. Another entered the ceiling, nicked an electrical wire, and somehow yanked out a portion of its copper. ???Bullets do weird things to stuff,??? said Stephan. ???The damage was incredible.???Shira and I skip back to the moments as she was first entering the bar. ???There were a couple investigators, and I think there were one or two uniforms, but people were mostly wrapping up, grabbing their stuff, and heading out,??? she said. Shira mentioned she???d previously gone to school for forensic science and criminal justice, and ???one of my classes was taught by the head CSI guy for Seattle. His name is Brian. I walk into the bar and there he is. He was like, ???Hey! What are you doing here???? We had a little conversation, just shooting the shit for a second.??? Shira asked Brian about the puddles of blood in the lounge. ???I was like, ???Hey, can we clean this up???? and he???s like, ???No. You have to get somebody professional to do it.??? For the disposal or whatever,??? said Shira. ???The blood and dead stuff doesn???t really bother me. I would???ve rather just done it myself, but I did find a guy like we were supposed to. We googled him. He showed up, he wasn???t wearing an official hazmat suit. It was one of those white painter ones you zip up and buy at Lowe???s. He didn???t even have any shoe coverings. Just his regular shoes. Of course he just mops it up and puts some bleach down. That???s just like what I would???ve done! I wanna say it was around $200 to $250 because I remember haggling with him about the prices, saying you know, it???s really not that much to clean up.???Before the clean-up guy arrived, Lexi and I stopped into the bar. Apart from Stephan and Shira, the place was empty. Stephan immediately asked if we were going to sue him, and we said we weren???t. (???I didn???t know him, and I wasn???t even thinking about that,??? said Lexi.) We???d come to retrieve our jackets and purses. We???d abandoned them when we fled the building the night before. Having no keys, cellphones and money brought obstacles to our following day. In the lounge, I saw the blood on the tile floor where James had fallen. Someone had placed a folded-open newspaper over the pool. These were likely the same pages Lexi had been flipping through as she sat at the counter, just before the shooting began. I hadn???t slept the night before, and everything was strange. When Lexi got her credit card and receipt from the bar, she saw she???d been charged a gratuity for leaving her card overnight. (This was an accident, Stephan later said.) Lexi also grabbed the boots she???d left behind. She???d slid them off beneath Whitney???s body as Lexi was struggling to get away. They were soaked in blood. (???We called them the Sticky Boots. I picked ???em up, and Shira took a rag to them,??? said Stephan.) Lexi went sock-footed the night before, and all day she???d made due wearing cheap footwear a friend bought for her. ???They were fuzzy indoor slippers, and they were soaking wet because it was drizzling all day. I was basically walking around in these blue square sponges,??? she said.Throughout our interactions that evening, Shira seemed remarkably grounded. When I asked her where it came from, she attributed a previous job in a funeral home. ???I was helping with the services,??? she said. ???I???d set up or take anything down. I???d help the grieving family, or I???d drive them somewhere if they needed. Things like that. I was in the process of getting my funeral director???s license, but there was this one instance where I decided I just couldn???t do it anymore. This old woman was saying goodbye to her husband. I was standing right next to the casket. She walked up to him, and she said, ???I???ll see you soon,?????? said Shira. ???On the job, you can???t cry, and you can???t show emotion, but that just crushed me. It reminded me how my parents were with each other. Both are deceased. After my mom died, my dad died like a year later,??? she said, then continued. ???There???s a human connection that we can???t see or measure or anything like that, but it???s there, and there are very few instances you can actually see it, but when do, you???re just in awe. I was like, that???s true love, oh my god. It totally creeped me out, and I loved it, but also that???s when I knew it was time for me to go,??? she said. ???I decided to go into bartending instead.???We return to the bar the evening after the shooting. After Lexi and I gathered our things and went away, Shira eventually called in another employee, and the two went to work. ???I just wanted to hurry up and get done,??? said Shira. ???We moved all the tables and chairs and mopped and cleaned. We took all the liquor down and gutted behind the bar. We went over everything with brushes and damp rags. We had to be really thorough. We made sure there was nothing to see and nothing to talk about. We wanted to get it back to the same old Twilight,??? she said.Switching gears, I bring up Whitney and James. Shira recognized them as regulars. ???They???d been coming in a good while. They always argued. All the time. It???s really sad how things turned out. Obviously he had troubles, and she really knew how to push his buttons,??? said Shira. ???They???d come in separately. Normally she???d come in first, and then he???d come in after. They never sat together. They???d be silently arguing. They???d be glaring at each other, and no words were being spoken, and then he would leave, or she would leave. And then one would come back. It was like this revolving door of them coming in and out. It was stupid and weird,??? said Shira. ???But yet they would always take care of each other. If she ended up leaving, he???d pay her tab. Or vice versa,??? she said. When the two were ready to make up, ???they???d go outside and have a ciga",100
41,"rette and talk quietly. Or they???d sit together in Lovers??? Corner,??? she said ??? referring to a counter for two in the lounge.As Shira remembered James???s interactions at the Twilight, ???he was never rude to any of the employees,??? she said. Often he???d mention his father???s sports bar. ???It???d be like an ??? ???I see you. We should be nice to each other. I???m in the industry too. Let???s hang out??? ??? kind of thing.??? Weeks after the shooting, Shira ran into Whitney at a grocery store. She was by herself, said Shira, and ???she was moving slow, but she was walking.??? They greeted each other briefly, and Whitney described a bag she might???ve left on the scene. That was the last they spoke. According to rumor, Whitney later attempted to patronize the bar, but she was asked by staff to leave.Stephan???s impressions of James and Whitney were similar to Shira???s. ???They???d always be arguing, but I???d never seen them yell at each other. They???d do the silent treatment. They were the quietest fighters ever. I???ve seen her storm out. The first few visits I saw them, I didn???t realize they were together,??? he said. Whitney was ???really pretty. Really cute. She???d come in in her scrubs and do homework,??? he said. James ???always wore a gray beanie. I never once saw him without it on. Even when he was working out. I???d see him at the Y, and he???d be wearing the beanie,??? Stephan said. ???He???d always want to tell me about his problems. ???My dad???s bar isn???t doing that well,??? or ???My sister sucks,?????? he said. ???Once, I saw him getting arrested out front. His car was parked by the bus stop. I guess he came in, trying to get his girlfriend to go home or something. He had his kid in the car out there with nothing but a onesie, and this was January.??? (According to the police report filed in municipal court, ???there was no child restraint used,??? and ???the child was lying free in the seat,??? and the child was ???not dressed for cold weather.??? As Stephan remembers, James claimed he hadn???t left his child alone and asked Stephan to procure footage as proof, but the bar???s security cameras were broken, and no film existed.)The last time Stephan saw James, it was the afternoon just before the shooting. ???It was cold but sunny that day. I was hanging out with my son. As we were packing up the stroller to leave, James arrived with his kid. Whitney was already here at the bar. It was probably five or six. I think that???s when all the problems started. They were doing the pouty thing,??? he said. ???James gave me a bad vibe, but I never thought he would???ve come in here and done that,??? he said. Several hours later, police stationed Stephan outside the bar as they processed the crime scene, and he observed authorities transporting James???s body from the building. Stephan???s response was unemotional. ???I think they used a white bag, and that kind of surprised me,??? he said, when I asked what details stood out. ???I???d always thought body bags were black.???The shooting impacted Stephan in other distinct ways. ???My lawyer heard about it and called me immediately. He told me, ???Don???t talk to anyone. You don???t want to give anyone ammunition to sue you.??? We went through a lot of red tape, with L&I and with the insurance companies. They acted like we???d contributed to what happened, but this could???ve happened anywhere. It was a random occurrence, and it was something I didn???t want people to associate with the bar. Once we heard Greg was going to be OK and all that, we just wanted to make everything go away as soon as possible. When my lawyer said I should stay closed for a week out of consideration, I thought: consideration for who. We opened up right when we could,??? said Stephan. ???This was a really expensive event for me. The repairs were close to a thousand dollars. We weren???t open that Sunday and the next couple days, so we lost revenue. Plus my insurance went up. They cancelled my liability. They cancelled everything. I had to pay a lot more to get it renewed. We had a benefit for Greg, and I gave him all the profits for the night. All in all, we???re looking at twelve to fourteen thousand. That???s not nothing. I would???ve had fourteen thousand in my pockets that has now vanished.???- -Photo Credits: Seattle Police Department.[Originally published October 20, 2009.]- - -I don???t know about you, but I can???t wait to get my hands on some fucking gourds and arrange them in a horn-shaped basket on my dining room table. That shit is going to look so seasonal. I???m about to head up to the attic right now to find that wicker fucker, dust it off, and jam it with an insanely ornate assortment of shellacked vegetables. When my guests come over it???s gonna be like, BLAMMO! Check out my shellacked decorative vegetables, assholes. Guess what season it is???fucking fall. There???s a nip in the air and my house is full of mutant fucking squash.I may even throw some multi-colored leaves into the mix, all haphazard like a crisp October breeze just blew through and fucked that shit up. Then I???m going to get to work on making a beautiful fucking gourd necklace for myself. People are going to be like, ???Aren???t those gourds straining your neck???? And I???m just going to thread another gourd onto my necklace without breaking their gaze and quietly reply, ???It???s fall, fuckfaces. You???re either ready to reap this freaky-assed harvest or you???re not.???Carving orange pumpkins sounds like a pretty fitting way to ring in the season. You know what else does? Performing an all-gourd reenactment of an episode of Diff???rent Strokes???specifically the one when Arnold and Dudley experience a disturbing brush with sexual molestation. Well, this shit just got real, didn???t it? Felonies and gourds have one very important commonality: they???re both extremely fucking real. Sorry if that???s upsetting, but I???m not doing you any favors by shielding you from this anymore.The next thing I???m going to do is carve one of the longer gourds into a perfect replica of the Mayflower as a shout-out to our Pilgrim forefathers. Then I???m going to do lines of blow off its hull with a hooker. Why? Because it???s not summer, it???s not winter, and it???s not spring. Grab a calendar and pull your fucking heads out of your asses; it???s fall, fuckers.Have you ever been in an Italian deli with salamis hanging from their ceiling? Well then you???re going to fucking love my house. Just look where you???re walking or you???ll get KO???d by the gauntlet of misshapen, zucchini-descendant bastards swinging from above. And when you do, you???re going to hear a very loud, very stereotypical Italian laugh coming from me. Consider yourself warned.For now, all I plan to do is to throw on a flannel shirt, some tattered overalls, and a floppy fucking hat and stand in the middle of a cornfield for a few days. The first crow that tries to land on me is going to get his avian ass bitch-slapped all the way back to summer.Welcome to autumn, fuckheads!- - - -Available in print withThe Best of McSweeney???s Internet TendencyIf you???re anything like me, you probably take a lot of medication.This might be because you???re tired, bored, have too many children, or have run out of coffee. But for some, the changing of summer into fall, also known as the ???Cornucopia of Sadness,??? is a time of year that calls for an aggressive chemical lobotomy.At the onset of fall you may notice a shifting of vegetation from vibrant green to yellow and brown hues before shriveling up in pain and falling to the ground. That is the effect of the cooler climate creating an environm",100
42,"ent so unsuitable for foliage that it slowly ceases to live and withers before your eyes, perishing over the course of a few weeks.As our hemisphere turns away from the Sun, the air takes on a chill, and we begin to get a small taste of what life would be like if Earth rotated so far away that it spun aimlessly out into space, hurling through the dark and cold, without light or warmth, forever. Some cultures have theorized that this is nature???s way of reminding us, annually, that we are always on the precipice of utter emptiness and obliteration. Just something to ponder as you drive home from work in the dark.With our furtherance from the Sun also come shorter days. A day still lasts twenty-four hours, but we spend more of those hours in total darkness. Want to use the extra darkness to sleep more? Too bad. You still have to continue to function as if the world isn???t ending. This will mean using a flashlight to walk to the bathroom in the morning and watching the sunset from your office window soon after you???ve had lunch.In Europe, the word for fall is autumn, because it sounds fancier and is more likely to lead to sex. Autumn comes from the Latin autom, literally translated as, ???all the nice things are dying all around you.??? In ancient Greece, Atto was known as the god of waning pleasure and was responsible for summer???s end. In modern culture, the name Atto is still evoked in the face of poor weather, evasive orgasms, and that thing of when a restaurant is really great and then it changes management and the service starts to go downhill. By the sickle of Atto!!At the end of the 18th century, some menfolk who wanted more time to play golf implemented the practice of Daylight Savings Time from spring until fall. This could have been adopted as a year round practice, but wasn???t, because our society is amused by the discomfort of those who require a certain amount of sunlight to want to continue to live. Also, extra daylight between Halloween and Easter is useless when you???re a simple hemp farmer. With slaves. I digress.Many of us employ certain methods for dealing with this change.Some turn to sports this time of year. Not the playing of sports- the watching of other people playing sports, whilst yelling and occasionally leaking the salty bodily fluid known as tears.Parents send their children to school come fall because they???re too sad and tired to continue to look at their filthy faces all day while inventing forced craft projects.Countless others wipe the dust off their slow cookers, unearth the goat intestines they have buried in the back yard, and get to work on a four day stew.And still some find solace in maxing out their credit cards on yoga pants from Patagonia, which they will wear while grocery shopping and waiting in line at the DMV.Another coping mechanism that we???ve readily embraced is the flavoring of many unrelated food items with the member of the gourd family commonly called ???the pumpkin.??? The pumpkin has become a symbol of fall because of its prominence in the annual Pagan celebration of Reese???s Peanut Butter Cups and also because of Charlie Brown.But pumpkin flavored food is not, in fact, pumpkin flavored. It is actually pumpkin-pie flavored. Pumpkin pie is a common delicacy served at the second fall holiday, Where We Eat Starch and Ponder our Debt and Fight Day, also known as ???Thanksgiving.???For many Americans, the requirement of all things to taste like a specific type of pie made of a pur??ed gourd and sugar is a successful defense tactic against circadian disorientation. Why is there no Peach Spice Latt??? Because when peaches are in season you can see your hand in front of your face at three in the afternoon.If you are lucky enough to have natural immunity to the Cornucopia of Sadness, take it upon yourself to look out for your fellow tribe members straggling behind the pack. They can often be found napping in parked cars, alone at the movies on a Monday, or gently weeping in the Target bathroom.If you come across one of these people, take them out for a taco supper. They probably need the protein. Then, when they get up to empty their bladder of the fourth margarita you???ve ordered them, drop ten milligrams of Lexapro in their drink (or Welbutrin or Zoloft- all of these drugs have the exact same effect on everyone). You will need to do this every day around the same time for about two weeks for it to really take effect.When you confess your scheme to them two weeks later, their seratonin re-uptakers will be so well calibrated they won???t even be mad. They will probably thank you and offer to reimburse you for all the Lexapro, which will be good because it???s extremely expensive out-of-pocket due to unfettered capitalism.HAPPY FALL, EVERYBODY!The way the crisp, cool air caresses my face while I am walking my rescue dog in the athletic field opposite my home.The way the behemoth SUVs lining my bucolic and exceptionally narrow street gleam in the  afternoon sunlight.When my rescue dog is barking and the Pee Wee Football parents who frequent the athletic field opposite my home shout for her to shut up, opening my window to let in the crisp, cool air and also to yell  ???No, you shut up, she lives here and she???s a rescue, you heartless motherfuckers.???Roasting pumpkin seeds while listening to the faint sound of a kid named Jackson or possibly Braxton or maybe Jaden crying and saying that he ???doesn???t want to do this anymore, Daddy.???Sitting on my porch in a cable-knit sweater while sipping mulled cider and engaging in spirited discussion about special topics in the neurosciences, such as concussions.Admiring the foliage as I illegally dispose of household trash in the dumpster provided for the refuse of the Pee Wee Football games that occur opposite my home BECAUSE SWEET LORD GOD THAT IS THE RENT THE ATHLETIC FIELD PAYS ME FOR LIVING OPPOSITE IT.Strolling down cobblestone sidewalks in the crisp, cool air with my rescue dog, en route to the quaint little coffee shop on Main Street, where I will treat myself to an artisanal soy approximation of a Pumpkin Spice Latt??, steamed to 200 degrees.Letting the warm cup toast my chilly fingers while kicking through fallen leaves en route to the athletic field opposite my home.Removing the lid from my beverage and watching the steam dance in the crisp, cool air.Allowing myself to be overtaken by nature???s gifts, so much so that my seasonal beverage makes contact with Jackson or possibly Braxton or maybe Jaden???s father???s arm, causing a second or possibly third-degree burn, maybe requiring amputation.Apple Picking.Last year, my wife Diane and I decided to take an inventory of our lives, relationship, and future. At the time we were both living comfortably, with over $100K in annual earnings to show for it, but there was something missing. It wasn???t kids, pets, or lavish trips, no. We needed an injection of passion and excitement into a life that had grown stale over the better part of a decade. That???s when we decided to make a drastic change. We decided to cut the proverbial fat and went all-in on a cozy 174-square foot tiny home, and, I???ve got to say, it has completely revolutionized how my wife and I fight.Just twelve months ago, Diane and I were living in a cumbersome four-bedroom, three-bathroom residence, free from any drama, and now we engage in all-night shouting matches on whether or not we should throw out the slow cooker because it???s taking up too much counter space.  That???s the kind of fire we???ve long been lacking in our relationship.  The almost-nonexistent storage space has forced us to only rely on the essentials. Early in our relationsh",100
43,"ip you would never think that we would get into vicious knock-em-down, drag-em-out altercations about water usage in a home that fits comfortably on a truck bed, but we dared to dream. Many coworkers and friends ask me, ???why would you want to live like that???? and I always answer with an exhausted, ???why not???? Who needs space, time and hobbies, independent from their beloved, when the enraged bellows of marital misery can easily echo through our tiny bungalow, igniting years of loveless complacency.What else has changed, you ask? For one, Diane and I do more sleeping on the pull-out couch and sleep loft, respectively. The limited space has all but eliminated chances of having much-needed friends over for soirees, which is good because it now allows more time for deep-thinking about the choices we???ve made, and where it all went so wrong. The decision to downsize also saved us an immense amount of money. The cost for construction and building materials were a mere $56,000, leaving us more than enough money to fund consultations with divorce attorneys and intensive couples counseling sessions.Sure, from an outside perspective it may seem like I???m miserable, but do you understand the rush of adrenaline that comes from screaming into the throw pillows that were, ???non-negotiable,??? after an evening-long quarrel about solar panels to make our little place of love more eco-friendly?Some say happiness has completely left me. Not at all, my wife and I are extremely happy at our jobs because they are a welcome respite from countless hours of verbal spars about compost piles and de-clutter.  We???ve been able to gain lasting friendships with our respective bartenders for fear of coming home to the other and getting into it for a sixth consecutive night.If you would have told me seven years ago, when I first met Diane, that we would be screaming at the top of our lungs about why we only have two sets of silverware and have to empty our latrine in a KOA campground like we live in some post-apocalyptic, Mad Max-esque hellscape, I would???ve said you were out of your mind. But, now that I am in the thick of it, I wouldn???t have it any other way. My blood is constantly boiling, and she gets the opportunity to walk on eggshells IN HER VERY OWN TINY HOME. The anger that wells up in us every time my wife and I dodge glances, is only matched by the good our extreme efficiency is doing for the environment. And that???s the greatest gift of all.So is it worth all the money you saved? Well, let me put it this way??? when I look into the eyes of my spouse as she does dishes in our bathroom-kitchen hybrid and I see the eternal look of resentment on her face, well, you can???t put a price tag on that.Thanks for taking the time to meet with me today. As you know, I???ve been working here for nine years now. I work long hours, weekends, and even cover for others when they fail to get the job done. I???ve been a model employee for all nine of these years without so much as a thank you to show for it, much less any significant raise or promotion. So I just wanted to let you know, that in ten years or so, I???m getting the fuck out of here.I know this might come as a shock, but every man has to have his breaking point, and at some point in the distant future, I may just reach mine. When I took this job after college, I just thought it would be a temporary thing to support my new family while I found what my true passion is, and I think ten or fifteen years from now, I???ll finally realize what exactly that career would be, and depending on if it provides the same life style my family and I have grown accustomed to, I just may go for it.Look, this isn???t personal, but these long hours and weekends are keeping me away from my son and daughter. I need to spend more time with them. They???re getting older and just starting to get into sports and dance. By walking away from this eventually, I can awkwardly try to form a relationship with them after they???ve moved away for college. No parent should be denied the chance to go from stranger to acquaintance in their adult children???s lives.And don???t get me STARTED on how this is affecting my relationship with my wife! I???m constantly missing dinners by staying at the office late, and our weekend plans are constantly up in the air. Just last week I told her we???d go up to the lake house and I had to cancel it at the last minute because Campbell didn???t finish the Smith Contract on time. Instead of spending time with my wife, I was cleaning up the mess of your terrible managerial skills. We had a huge fight and she???s sick of it. Frankly, I???m pretty sick of it too. We???re hanging on by a thread and if something doesn???t change, our relationship will probably only last another twenty to twenty-five more years.I cannot continue to let you people walk all over me for the rest of my life. One day, I???m going to have too much pride to let that happen, and if that day comes, you, or the person in my department who gets promoted over me to take your job after you???ve retired, can take this job, and shove it. I couldn???t be happier to get out of here in ten years. Or fifteen if my kids need to stay on my insurance.Thanks again for your time. If you need me, I???ll be at my desk.???Honky-Tonk Individual??????Harper Valley Performing Arts Charter School P.T.A.??????Mentally Ill??????Wide Open Safe Spaces??????Cowboy, Accompany Me Away??????Mamas, Don???t Let Your Babies Grow Up to Be Factory-Farm Cowboys??????Folsom Prison-Industrial Complex Blues??????Did I Shave My Legs for This?

Why should your pants imply anything else?The way your eyes ??? you tell people they???re russet ??? gaze out the train window, distant as if searching for something other than the darkness behind false plexiglass. Perhaps you???re debating whether dialect is productive or, as your PC gut can???t help but suspect, insulting. That???s hot.I see the way your glasses, with familiar frames built by tiny hands bearing Chinese blood and hipster purposes sit atop a nose you once had broken for you because you were a weak child with hopes of A Better Tomorrow. Of course, you don???t approve of the lenses??? origins, but how else would I, a stranger, know to check the title of the book you???re holding or discern that you???re a sensitive feminist-thinking type who laughs and cries at the absurdity of Janie riding a cow in a flood who didn???t understand what was happening the first time you read the book ???

Or are you just holding Their Eyes Were Watching God?- -I grew up in Fernie, British Columbia, a small town in the Canadian Rockies. In my youth it was an industrial town ??? lumber and, especially, coal, with all the associated rough-and-readiness, but surrounded by beautiful forested mountains.My father took a job with a mining company and moved us to this region when I was very young. I grew up trying very hard to get away from mining but kept going back and getting summer or full-time jobs to tide me over until my next big thing. After coming back to Fernie following university, and in the dying months of my first marriage, I got a job at one of the area???s five coal mines. It was a low-stress, high-paying job that allowed me to buy a house, read as many books as I could afford, and eventually remarry and start a family. I continue to work for that company today.Since my return, the town has evolved into a skiing and mountain biking mecca, with all the funky shops, pubs, and cafes that come with that. There is still an uneasy tension between the community???s past and present, but mostly it has de-escalated to drive-by shoutings rather than the random beatings of outsiders.The town???s past and present are both represented on my key ring. First there???s the brass ???30??? lamp tag. When a miner went down into the mine, he handed over his identifying tag and was issued a flame safety lamp with the same number. The tag was typically put on a peg with all the other miners??? tags from that shift. When a miner ended his shift, he handed in the lamp and got his tag back. If there was a tag left on the board, that meant a miner was unaccounted for and a search typically commenced. The underground mine closed in the late 1950s, so I never worked there myself (I started as an equipment operator in an open pit, which is a different kind of mining), but I found a bunch of the tags when I worked in a warehouse later on and kept one for my key ring.The black and gold discs on my key ring are mountain bike lock-on grip end caps, which are ubiquitous on the town???s biking trails. When I was growing up here, you only rode a bicycle if you were younger than 10 or if you???d lost your license for driving drunk, but now the town is a haven for mountain bikers. In the last 10 years I???ve become an avid mountain biker myself, so my key chain nicely captures the evolution of my town, and of my own evolution within it.1.     ???Down Escalator (Intro)???2.     ???Make America Skate Again???3.     ???California Mini-Phallus???4.    ???A League of Her Own (Rosie???s Song)???5.     ???To Russia, With Shove???6.    ???The Song Where Each Verse is a Surprisingly Well-Reasoned Lesson the American Electorate Should???ve Learned From the Brexit Vote (But the Choruses Are About Drinking)???7.     ???The Star-Spangled Scammer???8.     ???Statue of Synergy (Hillary???s Song)???9.    ???Let???s Talk About Black Lives Matter (For a Minute and 45 Seconds)???10. ???Who Killed the Zodiac Killer????11. ???The Shining City???s Off the Pill???12. ???$27.00 (Bernie???s Song)???13. ???The Song Where We Make It Clear That We???re All Feminists???14. ???Seriously, It???s Important to Us That You Know That???15. ???We???re Feminists???16. ???No Really, Check It Out: This Song???s Acoustic and Clumsily About Women???s Issues (And the Music Video is Gonna Be a Slideshow of Our Moms)???17. ???Now That We???ve Irrefutably Established the Fact That We???re Feminists, Here???s a Song That???ll Tacitly Encourage Men to Get Overly Aggressive at Our Shows???18.  ???Depth From Above (The Drone???s Song)""19. ???Battle Hymn of the Weed-Public???20. ???Retweet the Nuclear Codes (Oi, Oi, Oi)???21. ???Wiki-Media???22. ???I, Woke (feat.

I have happily drained all of my money, along with my parents??? savings account into said college with one goal in mind: to work for you for free. Though I have spent the last half decade, and $80,000 learning about a single topic, I assure you that I know only enough to not run your company into the ground, but not quite enough to get paid. I would relish the opportunity to not be noticed in your office building for a few months, so one day I can ask another company to pay me.The only thing I ask in return for my free labor is some ???insight into the industry.??? Which is to say, I???ll run out the clock bringing you coffee while you get my name slightly wrong every time we interact. This internship will allow me to put your company name on my r??sum??, so that one day the manager of the restaurant I wind up working at can know what my dreams once were.I hope the calculated and evenhanded wording of this letter gives you a professional image of me. At the very least, I hope it cancels out the actual images you might???ve seen of me on Facebook, wielding an array of glow sticks and a quart of vodka. I also hope that this saccharinely optimistic tone I???ve been using properly masks the growing desperation I feel when I think of my future.I can prove myself an asset to your company; having ???invested in myself,??? I will cling onto anything resembling a job with a death grip.In closing, I am so very glad that the cover letter, something that was once a nice personal touch, has become another hoop to jump through in the application process. I???ve spent the last quarter of my life ??? along with every dollar to my name ??? on an education; something hailed by high school teachers everywhere as ???the key to my future.??? And it is comforting to know that the success of all this effort hinges on a 500-word document. It seems mutually beneficial that you as an employer have to re-read a hyperbolized version of my r??sum?? in paragraph form, and that I have to write something unique and personal, while using the cadence of an office memo.Thanks for your consideration,A future overqualified bartender???You can???t tame this shrew!??????I???ve got two houses, both alike in dignity: one here, and one in Aspen.??????I???ve come to bury these bitches, not to praise them.??????Queen bee or not queen bee?

45,"??d) forwarded me your latest soft/hard bounce rate report this morning. I must admit, in my seven years of marketing I have never encountered a set of data such as this. The tenderness and raw emotion you convey in such a simple medium touched my soul. My heart, which I thought had hardened in the face of so many soulless depictions of keyword optimization results and B2C market segments, ached from the sheer beauty. On this grey workday I wept at my desk.I was immediately struck by your choice of font. Letters sans serif shows your desire to cast off the fetters of movable type. We have entered into a world no longer reliant on crude slugs of metal smashed against paper. Without these physical bonds, our SQL queries can transcend the world and rise to their rightful place in heaven. It???s the data-driven equivalent of Rembrandt???s The Ascension. To be in the presence of such beauty in no way makes me regret my degree in art history.And don???t think the significance of Tahoma, a standard font in the initial release of Windows 95, escapes me. Using a twenty-one-year-old font, one at the beginning of adulthood, is a statement that your artistic childhood is over. Your work has matured since your 2015 SEO Keyword Preliminary A/B Testing Results. It???s ready to make a name for itself ??? to excel, if you will ??? on the world stage.Oh, but the colors! Most traditional report builders bold the top row but you do away with such tradition, choosing instead to change the cell???s fill color to #BFD2E2 and leave the font untouched. Clearly, this is an allusion to the struggle between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat as described by Marx. Instead of superficially bold leadership, separate from and superior to the other cells, we have a ruling class that is identical to the true heroes, the workhorses that convey the bounce rate data we need.???But we bring order to the data. Without us it is meaningless!??? the imperialistic column headers bawl, secure in their high towers. But behind the pale blue curtain, they are no different from the working-class. Deep down we are all 11-point. It???s a sly wink to the marketing assistants who will be forwarding this report to other marketing assistants around the globe in the service of middle management.But yours is not an idealistic representation of the labor struggle. You chose to include the campaign ???End Date??? column, even though it???s well known that our recent upgrade to Cognos 8 is unable to access this specific row in the database (to the great frustration of our IT department). The result is a conspicuous white line of empty cells in an otherwise rich tapestry of data ??? an obvious memento mori. We all have an end date, your work declares, but ???we know neither the day nor the hour.??? Every row in the cosmic spreadsheet of the universe ends in a question mark that not even our modern-day soothsayers, the business analysts on floor 7, can answer until it has already come to pass.When faced with such perfection I admit I was eager to find some fault. My gaze came to rest on the first column, ???Item id.??? Surely, I thought, David knows our internal style guide requires all abbreviations include a period. How could he make such a glaring error? Then it occurred to me: this is no abbreviation of ???item identifier???! It???s a reference to the primacy of the id, Freud???s concept of humanity???s basic, instinctual drives. To have this in the first column and the first row, cell A1 ??? Adam, the first man ??? indicates that no matter the rigidity of the framework, this piece of art, and by extension all of man???s creative endeavors, are subordinate to our baser desires. I have yet to discover your allusions to the ego and superego in the spreadsheet, but I am certain they are there.From the moment IT hired you after 18 months of temping, I knew you were something special. But I could never have imagined you would reach such enormous heights with your work. You have created art that transcends time and space; a perfect entity that no doubt will change humanity for the better.Mary brings up a good point, however. It???s still defaulting to paged format when you export it to Excel 2007, which is a huge pain to sort. Can you fix that in the next iteration? It???ll have to be before Thursday. Russell thinks we???ll increase our conversion rate by starting the campaign before the holiday weekend.Thanks!??? KevinI have to participate in a never-ending charade for the sake of my college roommates, a charade in which I never make any dark political jokes but always make the bed, with the fitted sheets actually fitted and the comforter pulled back just right in a way that undermines the fundamentals of my personality. I look at my roommates??? carefully arranged spaces with bewilderment ??? where do they think we are living? An IKEA catalog? A YouTube guru???s beauty tutorial? Did they go to college to continue their educations or to display their assortment of cutesy pillows, each of which comes in a different style, color, and size, but still manages to accentuate the others perfectly?More updates: I sometimes forget how to open my dorm room door. I have no money and no marketable skills. My roommates are the first strangers in years to see my hair sans headscarf. (Yes, Muslim girls take their scarves off at home. When we pull them off, our heads do not fall off, and no we do not shower with them. You???re welcome.)Long before the drama surrounding my headscarf, there was the drama surrounding my hair. There were elementary school classmates, sticking their fingers into it and pulling like cotton candy at a street fair. There were endless cosmetic solutions tasked with fixing the testy problem of my heritage: keratin treatments, odd smelling serums, heat-based procedures that burnt my nine/ten/eleven year old ears. There was the one light-skinned aunt who suggested that if I exfoliated hard enough, my extra melanin would fade away, I would come to resemble her more, and all world conflict would immediately cease.But my darkness is not the kind you can wash down the drain. Moroccan hamams, Turkish spas, American showers, and 18 years later: still nothing. My hijab has made my once-distressing hair completely irrelevant to the public ??? until now, that is ??? but the ???problem??? of my skin remains. I look too ???black??? to be properly Arab/North African, and the insecurities I have developed after years of familial scrutiny cannot be covered by any amount of cloth.Whenever I visit Morocco and find myself both blessed and overwhelmed with the aforementioned relatives at all times, skin deep concerns seemed to replace others. After all, in the country where I???m from, wearing the headscarf is not particularly noteworthy. But at the end of every beach day, my complexion would be ??? and at least one relative would make sure I knew it. They would say: kha???aliti ??? ???you???ve blackened.??? From their tones it became clear that this fact was a bad thing, a laughable thing. My mom might ask me if I wore sun protection or worry that my sunblock actually seemed to encourage tanning. An uncle might point out that I looked neither Moroccan nor American, and by the way did I exercise enough back in New York?American racism is expected, trademark, foundational ??? the type of thing I write a good slam poem about once in a while and kind of almost learn to live with. But Moroccan racism (that is, the racism I have observed in certain Moroccan relatives) is more complex. I cannot use the excuse of being an outsider when I stake my complaints and write my poetry. ???Morocco??? is the word I???m supposed to write about in conju",100
46,"nction with words like ???homeland,??? ???diaspora,??? ???ancestral.??? Morocco is to blame for this skin, but refuses to take the credit, distances itself from the consequences, ignores me in my moments of self-destruction.The betrayal feels worse when I consider the fact that Morocco is a Muslim nation and that its people own a wide variety of skin tones. (Of course, Muslim nations generally follow whichever distorted version of Islam proves most convenient, but my indignation is not a force that can ever be reasoned with.) The prophet Mohammed (pbuh) once said: ???There is no virtue of an Arab over a foreigner nor a foreigner over an Arab, and neither white skin over black skin nor black skin over white skin, except by righteousness. Have I not delivered the message????Nope, apparently not.On a good day and in the right outfit ??? especially if I have my jet-black eyeliner on ??? I feel cocky in my appearance, mysterious in my ethnic ambiguity, powerful against the perceptions of others. I admire how rose gold looks on my wrist, how brick red blooms on my full lips and accentuates my brown skin. (I do so in my roommates??? mirrors when they are gone, because I have yet to invest in my own.)But there was a time when I refused to leave the house during the heat (light?) of a summer day. I remember hiding in the shade of a building while I waited for the street light to change, so that I could cross the sunny expanse as quickly as possible. Whenever I noticed the color gradient on my forearms, the strips where my sandals once crisscrossed and my rings once rested ??? a kaleidoscope of damning evidence ??? I couldn???t shake the feeling that I had lost something irretrievable.It???s easy enough to applaud Christian Louboutin for designing nude heels for dark women. To idolize Lupita Nyong???o and to criticize Azalea Banks and Lil Kim for lightening their skin. To curate your Facebook feed so that it exclusively swarms you with articles titled: Brown Women Goddesses Slay in Latest Ad Campaign/Olympic Sporting Event/Political Endeavor.But am I really comfortable with my own blackness? Are we as a nation comfortable with the physical appearance of blackness? The blackness that goes beyond Kylie Jenner???s appropriated braids, Nicki Minaj???s rear end, and Beyonce???s latest album? Are our childhood lessons and internalized biases as easy to unlearn as a #blacklivesmatter retweet?I don???t think so.I can???t pretend to be some sort of social justice warrior for the Black Lives Matter movement, or any similar movement in another country, when I still struggle with my own exterior. To be skin sure, to acknowledge the lessons I have internalized (wider noses = ugly, darker skin = ugly, blacker = ugly) and work to reverse them, will prove more powerful than using an empowering hashtag.  That is something I think I will focus on this year: completely accepting the basic, superficial, literally skin-deep reality of my mixed appearance.My roommates will probably not be bothered about what my skin or hair looks like, whether I look more ???black??? or ???Arab??? and where that puts me in terms of traditional beauty standards. In their positions, I know that I wouldn???t: I seem to wield all disturbing critiques of the physical variety against myself.The chemical treatments that my relatives forced upon my hair when I was a young girl ultimately destroyed it. Years later it grew back jagged and angry, broke off in little pieces when touched: no longer cotton candy but salt, or snow. But the fact that it is slowly healing is undeniable.1. The US Constitution specifies that Representative seats should be apportioned among the states based on the results of the decennial Census, but says no thing about how states should draw district boundaries for their Representatives.   How do you think states should draw these boundaries?2. Political competition, like market competition, is supposed to yield efficiency. In hotly-contested  districts, politicians competing to win the support of various constituent groups have to be highly  responsive to those groups. In safe districts, well-entrenched legislators, like  monopolists, can afford to be lazy. Do you think legislators in more gerrymandered districts are in fact less ???efficient??? than other legislators in capturing federal appropriations for their home districts?3. US courts have generally been reluctant to intervene in these processes unless they involve overt civil rights issues, and in some cases have actually encouraged creative mappings that promote representation of racial minorities.   To what do you attribute this reluctance?4. Gerrymandering depends on a heterogeneous geographic distribution of political interests, and only occurs in elections by district rather than at-large.  If the region is split into compact east and west sections of equal proportions, each party wins one seat. But if regional majority Party B controls the redistricting process, and splits the region into less compact north and south sections of equal proportions, it can win both seats and Party A is effectively unrepresented.  Does this make you sad?5. Do you believe the answer to gerrymandering is more political or more judicial?  Please support your answer.6. In considering the best method in redistricting procedures, Almost any criterion may be used either as a constraint or as an optimizer, but some function better as constraints and some function better as optimizers. Which do you feel is more effective?7. Population equality can function as a constraint by the device of requiring that all districts fall within a stated deviation. It could be used as an optimizer by requiring that, of plans meeting all constraints, the one with the smallest deviation from the ratio of representation be chosen. Since the courts have already ruled that population variances be held below various minima, it does not seem wise to employ population equality as a criterion where, under certain conditions, its optimum value may be outside court ??? established limits. Do you agree with us, then, that it should be employed as a constraint?  Why or why not????Go home! We don???t want you here!???The sneer comes from a scruffy individual in his early 20s sporting a short-sleeved blue flannel shirt and a press lanyard from a site called WonkCrush.ed.???We don???t need another person writing this article.???His immediate disdain for me strikes a familiar chord here at the press tent outside the Pensacola Bay Center. The Trump rally is jam-packed with jaded writers from all corners of the Internet ??? PolitiWord, MindLeashUntruthed, The Honeydew, VERY BEST TEACHER SHARES, the Paypal Blog ??? each hoping to wring some traffic out of yet another ???inside Trump rallies??? article.Desperation is a common theme here. For many writers, paid opportunities simply don???t exist anymore, and on some level, their collective, swelling frustration is understandable.???I already have a thumbnail picked out,??? one writer declares, showing me a screenshot on his phone of Trump mid-speech with his eyes slightly closed, possibly while saying something goofy. ???Just need some racist quotes and this baby???s GTG.??? The image is a bit blurry and will end up costing him clicks, but I know better than to rile these people.???Trump just has such huge BALLS??? yells another man to my right, filming an on-location character bit with his sketch group. He???s clad in a SHILLARY SHNEVER T-shirt showing a crude pic of Hillary in an old timey jailbird outfit holding a serial number that says EMAILS and chained to a metal ball that says BENGHAZI with a cap that also says EMAILS. The entire event is f",100
47,"ull of similarly boorish, vulgar T-shirts ??? a far cry from those excellent T-shirts you see all the time.At this point I realize I should probably throw in a tactile detail. I look around perceptively and notice a hot dog cart with a yellow and blue umbrella. It says either SCHILLMAN???S or SKILLMAN???S or something, but the details don???t matter to these people; rally goers line up, undeterred by such vagaries and motivated probably by the bad parts of religion, eager to scarf down their ready-made hot dogs and bottles of lukewarm water.???I???m working the ???we don???t trust journalists??? angle,??? another attendee offers unprovoked, showing me her outline so far. ???But if I snag some F-words I might lead with that.??? The vulgarity of the crowd is indeed striking; they???re likely sick of the constant condescension they receive from every writer but me.More yelling and more chants erupt in pockets throughout the growing crowd. I initially came here to write a story about people yelling at Trump rallies, but this? This was not at all what I expected.???Sorry, I don???t have you on the list????I???m snapped out of my ruminations. These thunderous words from the organizer at the press tent flawlessly underscore an evening of burgeoning divisiveness. I explain to her that I haven???t called ahead for credentials, but that I just plan on quietly standing with the press corps, jotting down ridiculous things I see and maybe firing off some incredulous low-quality pics on Twitter. I even show her my awesome shareable article title with swear words in it (our site can do that), but she remains predictably unconcerned.I???ve been deported from the Trump rally. The irony is so thick, I???ll probably make it the Facebook share description.???Lock her up!??????She???s a Satan Woman!??????Emails? SHE-FAILS!???These are three things people are conceivably shouting inside the arena, I imagine, as I stride poetically away from the now-filtering-in crowd.On my way out, I stop for a hot dog. I bite into the mustardy flesh, hungry for instant gratification but knowing, deep down, that there???s nothing of substance to this meal. I finish the last bite, stride past the rows of metal crowd control barriers, and head off towards a third taut metaphor.July 24, 2016Patient ???Ash Ketchum??? came into my office for the first time today since our phone consultation. His primary problem, in his words, is that he wants ???to be the very best, like no one ever was.??? A telltale perfectionist. He seems to be highly dependent on his own evaluations of himself, trapped beneath self-imposed standards of excellence. He continues his fruitless desire to ???be the very best??? despite the risks it puts on his life. I explained to Mr. Ketchum that success is both relative and highly subjective, but he found it difficult to accept. He insisted that ???to catch them is [his] real test, to train them is [his] cause.??? It is my professional opinion that Mr. Ketchum defines his self-worth solely by his ability to capture and train Pok??mon and that re-examining this drive through cognitive behavioral therapy will lead him to a happier and more fulfilling life.August 7, 2016Mr. Ketchum insists on bi-weekly sessions, rather than weekly, in order to accommodate his busy training schedule. I pointed out to him that dedicating so much time to catching Pok??mon is what???s causing him the mental distress in the first place, but travel seems to be a substantial part of his regimen. ???I will travel across the land, searching far and wide,??? he told me. ???Each Pok??mon to understand the power that???s inside.??? This emotional relationship is unhealthy. The patient seems to think that without him, the Pok??mon will be unable to achieve their true potential, even though he previously showed me that his own self-worth is defined by his ability to train Pok??mon. Could this toxic co-dependence be the root of his anxieties?August 21, 2016Today???s session was a troubling one. After a grueling multi-week trek to the gym in Saffron City, Mr. Ketchum returned to Pallet Town, defeated. Under his breath, he muttered with eyes glazed over, ???gotta catch ???em all.??? It seems his need to catch all of them is a compulsion, fueled by his obsession with destiny; although he cannot control the uncertainties of his own life, he can control the number of Pok??mon he captures.September 4, 2016He seemed tearful today. At one point he told me I was his best friend in a world he believes we must defend together. He is unsure of what we are defending the world against; his anxiety is vague in that way, but he believes both of us have the courage to take on this monumental task. However, this ???us vs. them??? thinking indicates that perhaps Mr. Ketchum has a black and white view of the world. I briefly wondered if perhaps I were breaching some kind of professional boundary by entertaining his delusions of grandeur, but it worked in the interests of the patient.September 8, 2016Mr. Ketchum stopped by my office without an appointment today. I chose to accommodate him as I had a gap in my schedule and he seemed quite nerve-wracked. He paced around my office and demanded he teach me and I teach him about Pok??mon. I suggested we try something new: an exposure treatment. If Mr. Ketchum???s greatest fear is being unable to capture Pok??mon, why not emulate that fear in a safe, controlled environment? I started by showing the patient pictures of empty Pok??balls and rare candies long forgotten, laying stale in the back of the freezer, but the exposure was overwhelming for Mr. Ketchum. He kept repeating to me, over and over, ???Gotta catch ???em all.??? I am unable to get through to him and undo his negative patterns of thought using traditional psychotherapeutic methods, so the next course of action will be to start Mr. Ketchum off on 20mg daily Clonazepam and monitor his condition. Perhaps the pills will help him understand the power that???s inside of him and will remain there regardless of how many Pokemon he gotta catch.1. The people on Friends were real human beings, but they were actors who had been hired to read from scripts and pretend to be characters with names like ???Ross,??? ???Rachel,??? and ???Man at Coffee Shop.??? They performed in front of cameras on soundstages and their backstories were elaborate fictions.2. Friends was on NBC, the same TV network that broadcast The Tonight Show With Johnny Carson and Caroline in the City.3. In order to pay for the production of Friends, which was beamed to homes throughout the United States at no charge via radio waves, NBC aired commercial messages from various sponsors in between scenes. The scheme was so successful they actually turned a profit despite paying the actors (see above).4. There is a park in New York City named ???Central Park,??? which is almost the same name as the coffee shop ???Central Perk.??? However, the shop has very little in common with the park, which has many trees and hardly any coffee unless people bring it in with them.5. The theme song to Friends was played on the radio. The band that performed the song, the Rembrandts, receives royalties every time the song is played on TV or the radio, but not when you think about it in your mind.6. Webster???s dictionary defines ???friends.???7. In order to pull off the famous ???Rachel??? hairstyle, barbers needed to use scissors to reduce the length of customers??? hair.8. Each letter in the title of Friends is different. There are no repeats. The seven letters represent more than 25% of the Roman alphabet.9. Friends ran for ten seasons.10. Ross and Rachel, the characters, were in an on-again, off-again",100
48," relationship, and the characters were sort of selfish about it.11. The weird one was named Phoebe and the sarcastic one was named Chandler.1. NightOn the terrible shore of loneliness and LaCroix, she pressed her thumb to the red flame on her rectangle phone and watched the screen glow to life, a lighthouse in a sea of despair meant to lure her to sinewy safety or a savage and charmless rock.From her living room, four stories above the cantankerous city that honked and swore its way into her very ribcage, Violet stretched her kind and smart legs across the coffee table and sighed in the way that only an exhausted and jaded single-lite could ??? routinely.She swiped thoughtfully at first and with intent, letting the poorly-lit selfies and romantic slurs (Be as pretty as you are smart, Impress me and Satisfaction is death) dent the surface of her brain.Swiping with fever and fervor through a sea of endless faces, she knew he was there, the one, trapped in this dumb, dumb, stupid, dumb rectangle phone. Her thumb and forefinger traced miles to find him, and then, like winter melting into spring, there he was: Mikael. A vegetarian veterinarian who likes to travel and claims he???s funny and sarcastic but not everyone gets him ??? 6???4?????? because that seems to be important.Right she swiped and the screen went black, bonked their heads together to signal that yes, they???d chosen each other. Mikael, she thought. Mikael.She composed a message, carefully considering his pictures ??? him holding a labradoodle, flanked by friends shouting at sports, wearing Patagonia beside a tree ??? and tried to knit her heart together with his through a single message when his arrived.With expectations ballooning, Violet read her soon-to-be love???s words or, rather, his word: ???Hey.???A needle, sharp to her hope yet pointless beyond its width. Immediately she withdrew to the kitchen and ate a steak she grilled her goddamn self.2. DayThe train platform smelled of grease and sun, the summer day collapsing around the city like a wet paper bag. All around her were men and women, women and men, and dogs barking for more mail in the distance.???I???m sorry,??? a man-voice said, a hand touching her elbow. ???But do I know you? You look so familiar.???Violet turned to take in the man???s full posture, noticing the gray of his suit pants and jacket and thinking how hot he must be, boiling in this vengeful sun with his arms and legs covered evenly and doubly in some places.She brought her pale wrist to her brow for shade, imagining the word lady as she did so and took her deliberate time to reply. ???Unlike friends or acquaintances we have not met,??? she said. ???But I understand why you would believe you had seen my face and the reason is you have, and I???ve seen yours, and we chose not to choose each other.???He turned his noble head to the side and laughed. ???Ha! Of course. So many faces that slide by my eyes each day, the ghosts of almost lovers, the coffees and ice creams and drink-grabbings that never were ??? don???t you find it exhausting, terrifying even, the endlessness of it???????Of course,??? she said, shifting from foot to foot and her handbag too, lady, lady. ???But what else are we to do???????Well, we are conversing now,??? he said. ???Perhaps this is how it should be done, in person on a train platform, rather than through rectangle phones where our skins grow as thin as the glass screens upon which we type.??????Yes, but the only reason this conversation was struck was for recognition of my face and, without that, would we even be talking????His laughter swept both their minds to one side and then the other. ???True, true ??? when you???re not wrong, you???re right.??? He appeared sad to her, his face no longer the shine of a peach but of a rotting clam that has learned its life was fished for naught.3. MorningThe date began simply enough, with her arriving on time and him too, she was impressed to see, for this was not always the case. In fact, a rare and special treat, like breakfast for dinner or a goldfish that lives to see a year.Speaking of breakfast, that wasn???t quite what they were having on Halsted but almost ??? a cousin of breakfast, so brunch.???Hello,??? he said as he stood over the table pointing to a chair. ???That for me? LOL.??? Out loud he said it, the word LOL, not a word at all but an acronym lying about being a word.Was this a joke, she wondered, this saying of LOL and perhaps he knew it was a joke and that she would get it, for jokes are meant to be that way ??? shared and gotten.???Ha!??? she said, ???Ha, ha! That???s funny, you???re funny,??? she assured him, and cleared her throat, standing to deliver a quick hug. She always did this, no matter whom the he was because the premise here was that they would determine if their souls were meant to be together, and where better to start than with a hug?What she hoped to feel: something, anything that made her realize this was the hug that would hold her always. A hug that meant summer barbecues, friends??? weddings, days in dog parks, and an emergency contact number that belonged not to her parents.What she felt: nothing, and as he spoke more nothing perched, nested, laid eggs, and caught the avian flu inside her. She smiled to the beat of his drum because he was a musician and had brought his drum, and she listened as oblivion and awful rhythm rained down upon him.Thank heavens for pancakes and frittatas, so the drum could be retired beneath the table. ???I???ve long known I was special,??? he said, stupidly. ???People have always told me how special I was and they continue to do so now and I???m sure they will do so always because I am special and great ??? the greatest, in fact!???Milky egg wobbled on the edge of his fork as he directed praise toward himself. Jump, she thought at the egg. Save yourself from his tireless jowls. He smiled at the special words he spoke, quite pleased while looking at Violet. ???What do you think of me???? he asked, the answer he would hear already etched into his middle ear.Feeling parched and nauseous, she sipped her water and thought about canaries. She wished she had one now so she could place it on the table and see how long it took for the canary to die inside, allowing Violet to just barely save herself. How selfish and terrible, she thought, yet still found the idea appealing.With ashen breath, she responded that she felt as ill as his drum skills, which he took as a compliment and promptly left her with the check because, he said, he dealt in talents and not dollar bills and had already contributed much too much.4. BathroomShe has considered more faces of men while on the toilet than upon, at, or in any other location, swiping left, right, left again. Can one be both flusher and flushed? she wondered. The truth is that this happens every time one says no to another and another says no to the one, but no one ??? neither the one nor the another ??? ever knows. Flush, flush.With grate of metal lock and creak of fatigued hinge, she strode from stall to sink and began to wash her hands. Wringing water and viruses from her wrists, her rectangle phone buzzed on the counter, a bumblebee gathering pollen and hinting at the potential of something sweet, filling, nourishing, absolute.It was a match with a man named Kevin ??? a man named Kevin who could perhaps help her survive the long, long winters accustomed to which she???d grown but would grow accustomed to no more, for sometimes shrinking is the greatest growth one can gift to oneself.A second buzz announced the arrival of Kevin???s message, landing graceful and prompt, the words she???d been waiting for, a vacuum",100
49," sweeper to extract the loneliness from within ??? speak now, sweet Kevin, and remove all clouds of doubt.???Big tits????A tender message to serve as both beginning and end.The off-campus Starbucks where I sometimes hold office hours has recently insisted that the tables are for paying customers only and that the free grande cup of water I normally order doesn???t actually make me a paying customer.The lawn outside of the engineering building on which I sometimes hold office hours has recently been the site of several unfortunate flash mobs hell-bent on my participation in the Macarena.The bench outside of the student center on which I sometimes hold office hours has been repurposed as an official ???safe space??? for students struggling with pornography addiction.My union rep has assured me that adjuncts are not required to hold office hours no matter what that prissy jerk Samantha says.I???m in the midst of a lawsuit after several people on a campus tour tripped over me on the stairs where I sometimes sit and hold office hours.Students have requested that I stop holding office hours on the quad outside of the library after several reports of heat rash and one complaint about a particularly aggressive pollen allergy.I???m spying on Samantha today to see if she does, in fact, hold office hours.The library staff has requested that I stop holding office hours in the library after claiming that I made four students cry. Though the matter is still under investigation, I am certain that three out of the four of these alleged students are not actually in any of my six classes.I, too, find myself sometimes crying in the library while holding office hours. My roommate has noted that this could explain why office hour attendance has steadily declined over the last several weeks.I don???t have an office.- -Good news, everyone! Animation is magic. When I wake up a chipmunk brushes my teeth while three raccoons dress me in the usual???hilarious graphic tee; open long-sleeved button-down to keep it profesh; cargo shorts filled with stolen work pens, loose change, and bunny stamps I told my wife were for work things. You???re probably thinking, ???Why the chipmunk and raccoons???? Because the higher ups get the blue birds and fawns, but that doesn???t make it any less magical. Water cooler gossip is limited, though, since nobody wants to talk about their families thanks to the unusually high number of orphans in the building. I usually spend the morning playing with laser pointers and discussing character design and performance (today???s focus is butts). A mustachioed toymaker leads a parade of confetti-throwing marionettes to signal the start of the mandatory daily foosball meeting (though the marionettes have been sort of downtrodden since one of the vending machine possums ate their bug friend). Lunch is usually served by some other animals???talking ones, wearing shirts and shoes, but not pants for whatever reason. This has prompted food safety concerns, but the 8-foot tall bipedal dog wears a chef hat so it???s probably fine. Yesterday I filmed myself twirling while wearing a tiara and impractical shoes to channel my inner princess until I fell down and ripped my shirt. On the way out the door every evening a floating child (who may or may not be in charge of a bunch of other smaller children) throws a handful of glitter in our faces.Bleary-eyed at three in the morning, I submitted the personal essay I???d spent months crafting. When I woke up, an email was awaiting me with the subject THIS ESSAY IS EVERYTHING!???Ur writing is srsly #OnFleek!??? wrote the editor. ???I need 2 tweak a little and then we can publish it on the site. Nothing cray-cray ??? just some bling 4 more eyeballs/shares/RTs.???Publish? I shakily set down my cup of coffee, my body buzzing with adrenaline and caffeine.The essay was titled ???The November of Her Years: My Mother???s Final Thanksgiving at Her Brother???s House.??????Love the stuff about ur mom??? it gives me ~ all ~ of the feels,??? my editor later wrote via Instant Messenger (???my editor??? ??? just thinking about her like that gave me goosebumps). ???Quick fact-check: what does ur uncle do 4 CA$$$H???????Tim???s a retired nurse, but he???s gotten into computers and now does volunteer work with hospitals up in Maine to improve their databases and keep down costs ??? the state has hit a rough financial patch.??????BROGRAMMER ahahahahaha??? ur next-level HILARIOUS??? u do u,??? she wrote. ???You mentioned ur mom and uncle were ???.??????Yes, they were lapsed Catholics, but they found some comfort in religion at the end of my mother???s life.??????So Tim didn???t invite any1 Jewish to the dinner smh???????Anyone Jewish? Technically speaking, no ??? we were keeping it to just our immediate family, because Mom was so sick. But he wasn???t intentionally trying to?????????Lolwut!??? she wrote. ???It???ll be up super-1st thing tomorrow.??????Wait ??? don???t you want to give me a chance to look over your edits???????Kthxbai!??? came on-screen before she logged off.The next morning the essay was the lead feature on the site. The headline was ???I Can???t, I Just Can???t: My Coder Uncle, Who???s THE WORST, Had an Epic Anti-Semitic Meltdown at Thanksgiving.??? Here was the beginning:???I???m chowing down on stuffing gravy turkey (om nom nom) while trying to tune out my Silicon Valley creeptastic uncle as he victim-blames the economy on the Jews.??????That moment when you???re at my family???s literally insane Thanksgiving. HOLIDAY FAIL.??????Thanks for running the piece,??? I emailed my editor. ???However, I notice you attributed various remarks to my uncle that weren???t in the original essay and removed all the references to my mother and her passing away the next week.??????U mad???? she wrote. ???Tbh, those parts of the essay were kinda ??\(???)/??, because death.???Then the comments section began filling up.???Wow??? just wow,??? was the first. ???Essaysplaining clickbait by a caged-poultry-eating Zionist.??????Great job, you technophobe who clearly has a bias against parents??? male siblings,??? said another that went on for three paragraphs before concluding, ???No words.???Interview requests and violent emails flooded my inbox. I was fired from my job without severance for violating a morality clause. My landlord evicted me.???The piece won teh Interwebz!??? my editor wrote on IM. ???Since we own all the media rights in perpetuity, we optioned the movie, video game, and action-figure (!!!) adaptations 2 Michael Bay. WHAT. IS. EVEN. HAPPENING?!?!??????My family has disowned me,??? I told her. ???My uncle filed a libel lawsuit against me.??????Awkwaaaaard AF.??????I???m getting death threats.??????#HatersGonnaHate amirite???? she replied.???I don???t think you understand,??? I typed. ???I???m very scared for my safety and my life is in tatters.???There was a long pause before she wrote again.???But dat Michael Bay tho.???Fast-forward to six months later. After numerous emails to my editor, then someone in accounting named Shelly, then someone in HR named Dennis, then Shelly again, I finally receive a check in the mail. It???s for $50 and is accompanied by a handwritten Post-it.???Oh hai! It???d be totes amazeballs 2 publish u again,??? my editor had scribbled. ???I can haz more essays????I crumple it up, but before I throw it out, I realize I need the money desperately, and, perhaps more important, that although I???m battered and scarred, distrustful of people and cynical about the art of memoir in the digital-media landscape, not to mention living in a different city under a new name at a YMCA, the traumatic experience has forged me, for ",100

Considering I have a lifespan of 365 days, which I typically spend buried in the cold recesses of your purse (praying for shellfish to get mixed up in your fricassee), it does feel nice to be noticed. But like I said, at my core I???m still the same old emergency anti-allergen I???ve always been.And yes, I can see the young child going into anaphylactic shock across the room, thanks for pointing him out.

Goddamn peanut allergy kids sucking down legumes, messing up my train of thought.That???s right, same old EpiPen. Saving lives, basking in the limelight, and not getting out of bed for less than half a G. Don???t like it? You???ll get no apologies from me. I???m literally pure adrenaline.

51," the doorman. The bouncer is part of a security staff. That???s a vast difference. My goal is always to deescalate the situation,??? says Joe. ???I would rather nip something in the bud. Believe me, I???ve upset people before by telling them it???s time to go. ???What did we do wrong???? ???Nothing. You did everything right. But now you???re at a point where we cannot serve you anymore and we cannot have you anymore.??? You have to be cool and regal and righteous about it. That???s what I???ve learned over time. I???ve been at the door on and off for 20 years, and the fact that I???m still doing it said a lot,??? he said. ???I???m a lot older. I just turned 52 last month. I just like being in charge. I???m not gonna say I like being in control, but I guess that???s part of it as well. I???m twenty years older than the average person I card. Sometimes they just want to be told what to do. They want to be guided, whether they know it or not.???Joe exudes a studied tranquility. We???re seated in a particularly dark corner of a windowless basement bar. It isn???t hard to keep him talking. ???Being a door guy is a huge thing. I???m protecting the business. I???m looking out for the staff and for everybody,??? he says. ???I???ve worked hard in my life, and I???ve made my living because of my diplomacy and because of my professionalism. Not trying to brag, but that???s what it is. I???m being compensated very well and respected very well. My coworkers trust every decision I make. They see me as a leader. They???re like, ???Oh yeah. Joe knows what the fuck???s going on.??? Even the door guys at other places are like, ???Joe???s pretty bad-ass.?????????It???s like I???m on camera???my demeanor at the door. These people crack up because of my comic timing. You can make somebody really happy on their way in, and they???re gonna have a good time, and they???re gonna tip well, and it???s gonna be awesome. Or you can intimidate the fuck out of somebody, and they???re not gonna give a shit, and they???re not gonna tip well, and you???re just a big asshole,??? Joe says, and he describes the many intricate components to the job. ???When you ask for someone???s ID, you???re not just checking their age, you???re checking their movements, you???re checking their demeanor. Door people judge the book by its cover. We get to do that. We have to do that,??? he says. ???I???m not six feet tall or anything, but I know when to turn the intimidation on. I???ve had it work for me before. I keep my hands up like this. It???s a self-defense move, because you can block and you can protect. It???s like this force field. I???ve taken this pose to people when they were coming up on me. They???re like, ???Look man, easy.??? I???m like, ???You???re the one that???s instigating this, man.?????? He goes on. ???I???ve slugged people. I???ve drawn blood, and I???ve had my blood drawn. There???s only so much diplomacy you can do. If they???re not gonna leave you can???t always wait for the cops to show up. Sometimes you just have to take action. I???ve socked a few people really good. They deserved it. They had plenty of warnings.??????I???ve made wrong calls here and there, sure. Maybe cutting somebody off too early or misjudging a situation. But better safe than sorry. This is just an illustration, totally off the point. There???s a group of blind people that came in. It happened a couple days ago. They???re not a 100% blind, but they???re challenged. They have canes and glasses, but they can see a little bit I think, because they???re walking to the bar and ordering drinks and pulling out their money. Apparently, they party like there???s no fucking tomorrow. They???re nuts. I remember the first time they came in. It was, like, ???Holy hell.??? One of them ends up barfing in like four different places. Of course I had to tactfully tell them it???s time to close out. ???You guys gotta go. It???s time to go.??? They???d been there for like four hours. They???re not shy. I saw them again, and I decided I???m gonna say something. I didn???t kick ???em out, I didn???t cut ???em off, I just gave ???em a warning. I said, ???I don???t want it to get to that point again.??? I might???ve made an error on this side of correctness, but nobody was telling me I was wrong, because I wasn???t wrong.???Before Joe???s door-guy career, ???I was doing the roadie thing for 15 years. I started in Los Angeles with a band called Mary???s Danish,??? he said. (They did ???Don???t Crash the Car Tonight.???) ???I worked for tons of different bands. The Posies mainly, and that led to so many other things. It???s why I came to Seattle. I kind of became a bigger fish in a smaller pond out here. I wasn???t really living anywhere, I was just gonna couch-surf around. I couldn???t go more than a month without getting a tour. We worked for Hole for a while and lots of international bands. It was 1993, and it was the crest of the grunge wave,??? he said. Eventually, Joe found an apartment and began assembling a collection of front-door positions in various bars. He???s been at the Twilight Exit a decade now. ???I anchored down. I love it there. People know me. I???m a fixture of the place. It means a lot to me. I get dinner, I get paid, I get tip-outs as well. On Sundays, I get to sing karaoke, and I get to sing the first song.??? (His usual pick is Morrissey???s ???Heaven Knows I???m Miserable Now.???) ???That Sunday night takes care of my mom for me,??? he adds. ???She???s saving for retirement. I???ve been sending her $125 a month. My brothers and I have been chipping in.??? Joe pulls up a picture of a woman surrounded by her six adult sons, all of them neatly posed and wearing business-casual attire. The background contains a white gate, a cobblestone wall, a wooded meadow. The photograph is several years old, and Joe points himself out.We return to the Twilight Exit, going back to the months before the shooting. When Joe was working, he???d see James and Whitney now and again. ???I knew that couple. He was a striking dude. The first time I saw him, I never forgot him. He was half black. He had that thin little beard and thin pencil moustache. And then she was like this really strikingly amazingly beautiful woman, where you???re almost like, ???Woah. Wow. What???s going on!??? But then I???d talked to her, and I don???t think there was a lot going on upstairs. I don???t know what she even did for a living or if she ever had a job. I hate to be an ass, I don???t know, but I think she skated through her life on her good looks. I literally just do,??? he said.???They were this couple that was always really wasted when I???d get to work. I???m showing up at eight. If you???re already that far, and you???ve been here for a couple three hours and you???re drunk, then I???m not gonna let it go any further. I said to the bartender, ???Look, let???s blow this tab up.??? And then I???d said to them, ???It???s time for you to go. You know, you???ve been here the whole afternoon, and that???s totally fine, but it???s just been a little too long now.??? I didn???t want to deal with them in the next hour, and we were totally within our rights to refuse service. We didn???t have to explain why. Even if the sign isn???t posted, it???s a given,??? Joe said. ???I definitely remember James and Whitney. The fact of the matter is, over time, I???d made them leave. It happened at least twice, and they were always cool with it. They weren???t horrible. They???d be like, ???Oh. OK.??????As Joe understood from the night of the shooting, they???d been arguing in the lounge in the moments before James returned with a gun. ???It was a huge flare up, and [the doo",100
52,"rman] Greg did the right thing. He made James leave, and he kept Whitney inside to wait for her taxi. That was the perfect textbook thing to do. I???ve trained a lot of door people. I???ve gone to bars, and I???ve consulted, and I???ve taught classes. It???s one of the things I preach. You never just kick them both out at the same time,??? said Joe. ???But then again, who knows what would???ve happened. Maybe James would???ve just shot her at home, and we would???ve never heard anything about it.??????I thought long and hard about what I would???ve done that night,??? said Joe. He???d originally been scheduled to work. ???The Sunday before, I asked Greg to fill in, but he had a date, so he said, ???I got you next week,??? and that???s when it happened,??? Joe said. ???I didn???t have anything going on. I just wanted to stay home and have a simple night off. Up to that point, I???d been working at the Twilight 90% of the Sundays for the past six or seven years. I wanted to cook some food, take a bath, have a shave???I only shave once or twice a week. I always have a bath before I shave. It opens up the pores,??? he said. ???I???m just gonna watch TV, watch a little Downton Abbey. I???m gonna chill, and just kick it, and not have to worry about anything.??????I had a little bit of survivor???s guilt. I really did feel bad for a long time. It???s the single worst doorman experience that I know of. It happened at the Twilight Exit. I was like, ???That was my shift. I should???ve been there for that.??? And also the fact that something like that fully went down. A gun at the door. I???d envisioned that in my head so many times. Going over, like???how am I gonna react, what am I gonna do. That was a once-in-a-lifetime thing that will never ever happen again. I wasn???t there for it,??? said Joe. ???It made me think, ???OK. Well, I still gotta be vigilant. I have to be ready for whatever???s gonna come up next.??? I ramped up my diligence. I don???t care how much of an asshole you think I???m being to you right now. I???m a doorman, and I???m here for a reason, and I???m doing my job. If you need examples of how things could go wrong, I???ve got a few of them. Otherwise, this is just how it works,??? he said. ???It makes everything even more important for me, really. The odds of something like this happening again are so small, but that???s not to say that it won???t. If it does, I want to be the one that makes or breaks a situation. I feel like I???d be able to handle it.???We back up, returning to the night of the shooting. As Joe was in his apartment, preparing for a languid night in, ""Steve-O stopped over. The connection is super huge. We???d worked together for a bit, and we got to be super bros, super homies. He was kinda going through a rough patch. He???d just got a new job, and he wanted to borrow some money so he could get through the next week until his paycheck. He wasn???t destitute or anything. He was living with his wife. He just wanted some pocket money. I???m like, yeah sure we???re brothers, we???re friends. So he comes over, and I lend him some money, and we talk.??? Steve split shortly after, heading to the Twilight by scooter. Steve arrived just as James shot Greg in the alleyway outside the bar. ???Greg???s femoral artery was severed, but Steve-O did the right thing. He just reefed down on that wound and stemmed the bleeding enough before the paramedics got there,??? said Joe. ???One of the things that freaks me out is: I would???ve died. If I was shot in the same spot, I would???ve bled out in a matter of minutes. I don???t know how much pressure could???ve saved me. It???s all been going through my head for a long time. I???m on a blood-thinning medicine. I???ve had blood clots in my body before, so now I???m like an induced hemophiliac. There would???ve been no stopping the tide.???We back up again, returning to Joe???s apartment in the moments just after Steve headed out from his visit. ???Here I am, laying in the bathtub. Just soaking. Going, ???OK. Cool man. I???ve got nothing tonight.??? Then I get a text from Steve-O. I???m like whatever, you know. I???m having a bath. And then the phone rings. Oh my god. I get a text from Ezra. He???s like, ???What???s going on at the Twilight???? I???m like, ???I???m off tonight, call Greg. Leave me alone.??? But then it???s just texts and phone calls. I got a phone call from a girl that I hadn???t seen in over a year because she???d heard something just went down. Jimmy all of a sudden is right there. I???m like literally standing on my living room floor with a towel wrapped around me. Jimmy???s there, and he???s like, ???Let???s go man. We gotta go.??? I???ll never forget it. Obviously you can???t forget something like that. We were really freaked out,?????? he said. News of the night spread quickly. Someone designated a gathering spot at a different bar, and dozens of people with strong ties to the Twilight eventually showed up to give their respects. ???We had one of the most epic, debaucherous, out-of-control after-hours parties that has ever happened there. It really was. One of our good friends almost is dead. We didn???t even know what was up with Greg at the time. We were, like, shirtless, dancing on the bar. Cranking music. Getting shit-housed. We just like hit it even harder. We were like celebrating the fact that we were all still living.???1.     Saucerful of Secrets2.     Basket of Deplorables3.     Wave of Mutilation4.

I am a former professional literary agent, which on a good day is a pretty small thing to be, and these days feels rather microscopic. Before I was a professional literary agent, I thought it would be a good idea to be a teacher of fiction in a college MFA program because it is easy and you are adored all the time and of course it pays a lot of money.I used to have a lot of bright ideas.I even had two lessons planned out, which by all accounts from MFA programs that I???ve heard, is one more than you need. The first would address the comfort of storytelling. I would explain to my adoring students that stories hold power because they convey the illusion that life has purpose and direction. Where God is absent from the lives of all but the most blessed, the writer, of all people, replaces that ordering principle. Stories make sense when so much around us is senseless, and perhaps w",100
53,"hat makes them most comforting is that while life goes on and pain goes on, stories do us the favor of ending.Not a very original idea, but one that seemed more or less reasonable before something happened that showed us how perversely powerful stories can be when told into the ears of desperate and evil men, and showed as well how sadly challenged stories are in providing comfort now. What happened on Tuesday was enormous, sublime in the darkest sense of the word, so large as to overwhelm our ability to describe it, to sense it except in parts, and certainly to order it and make it make sense. In the immediate aftermath, we have only our very personal flash memories, but personalizing an event that has touched so many and so cruelly, announcing by byline our own survival, feels shamefully self-involved. To convert this experience into metaphor, into symbolic gesture feels almost offensive when we are still pressed by such an urgent reality that is ongoing and uncontainable by words.I have heard a lot recently about the role of writing, song, music, painting, in the tragic blank space in our souls that this event has left behind. Of course, this preoccupation is largely a result of an unconscious bias of the media. If pig farmers had as much currency with NPR as literary novelists, we would be hearing just as much about the healing power of bacon. And knowing that power well, I can say that it is certainly comparable to the reading of a sensitive short story as far as comfort goes; and yet both fall far below the direct aid that is being passed from person to person, below Chambers Street, in our homes, on the phone with strangers, with a actual touch, in the actual, non-symbolic, un-annotated world of grief in which we live. The great temptation is to be silent, forever, in sympathy.The second lesson plan that I had in those days was a very lazy assessment of storytelling???s function, beginning in the oral tradition, when it served a civic purpose aside from getting you invited to cocktail parties. As I would explain to my adoring students, storytelling served initially in every culture three purposes: to inform, as in relay news and record history, to instruct, as in pass down a set of moral guidelines, and to entertain. We are, as regards this event and its unfolding, all too well informed. And as for entertainment: when I thought this was a bright idea, it was when I was younger and war seemed so far away. But I realize now that those in history whose lives were short and mean and threatened by sword and disease gathered and told stories not as leisure, but as desperately needed distraction, and reassurance that they were not alone.So if art cannot contain or describe this event, and if for now the suffering is too keen to be alleviated by parable??? if stories are for the moment not as critically needed, as courage, as medicine, as blood, as bacon, they can at least revert to this social function. As time goes on, this will all pass away into memory, into a story with a beginning and a middle and finally an end. And that transition from the real into fable will bring its own kind of comfort and pain. Now, though, we may gather and distract one another, take comfort in our proximity, and know that we are, at this moment, safe.Not many of my ideas seem bright anymore, and I am not a teacher. I am only humbled: to be here, to be alive.That is all.Congratulations! You???ve been selected to be a contestant on Extreme Vetting, where contestants compete against 63,000 other would-be immigrants in grueling battles of merit, skill, and proficiency! This season, you will compete in challenges that will test your physical and mental strength, as well as your willingness to assimilate into and embrace American pop culture!In the Binge-or-Die Challenge, the goal is to beat other boat people at one of America???s favorite pastimes: binge-watching. From La-Z-Boy recliners, you will race to be the first to conquer Seasons 1-5 of Keeping Up with the Kardashians without getting up to pee or suffering from epileptic seizures. Contestants will be allowed two chances to hit up our Extreme Kitchen and make a gluten-free snack. But beware! That???s a time setback that could cost you a spot in the final round.The second challenge starts after an Uber drops you off at Battery Park. From there you???ll be given a MetroCard with $1.83 in credit and a copy of the Enquirer. You???ll then have 30 minutes to beat the other contestants to the George Washington Bridge. Yes, we???ve heard complaints that this challenge sounds rigged, but we assure you that success is possible if you pull yourself up by your tattered bootstraps and get on with it. So, stop complaining! GET ON WITH IT!???Challenge three is called ???If You Build It, They Will Come,??? where you???ll have 18 minutes to assemble an IKEA Vonswertzerwogen desk and chair. This contest adds an unexpected twist because only the winner of the previous round will have directions that are dry. The other contestants will receive soggy instructions sheets from spilled Starbucks Mocha Caramel Acai Berry Latte.The next event will test your social media savvy. The contestant with the most followers and likes after live-tweeting during a broadcast of America???s Got Talent, wins the round. Please note, that if you are a contestant whose hands were chopped off by militants before you escaped your country by swimming across shark-infested bodies of water, we will fit you with a prosthetic thumb that will allow you to tweet almost just as quickly. The engineers of the thumb ??? winners of the Thomas Edison Elementary Sixth Grade Science Fair ??? will be on hand to take pictures with you and your thumb after the show. Also, the refs are actually plain clothes police officers, ready to taser any one of you that speaks your native language in a loud, harsh manner, scaring members of our live studio audience.The final round this season is a doozy. You will be sequestered in Governor Mike Pence???s Indiana basement for a ???Pray the Gay Away??? weekend retreat catered by Chick-fil-A. It???s a three day test of spiritual endurance that begins with memorizing and reciting the book of Revelations in English and Latin. Then you???ll watch the movie Left Behind and have to upload a Snapchat that explains how you???d feel if you were stuck on earth with Donald Trump after the rapture. Only the strongest refugee will survive this weekend cognitively unscathed, ready to receive permanent asylum seeker status and all the American rights therein to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.Throughout the show you will be pushed to the border of your own sanity ??? but at least it???s a border you can cross legally, right?! The winner ??? and there will only be one (who wants a taco or falafel truck on every corner anyway?) ??? will have the right to pay taxes in the GREATEST COUNTRY IN THE WORLD. USA! USA! USA!But enough talk??? LET???S! GET! ON! WITH! IT!??? It???s vetting time!Son, I???ve attempted to impart many lessons to you over the years, everything from the benefits of flossing to writing thank-you notes.But I want to tell you something more important than any of that, here and now, before we enter the stadium: Don???t make any weird faces at this sporting event we???re about to attend, or you???ll probably become an internet meme.Do you understand? Do you get what I???m saying? Nod if you???re on the same page as me. I need to see you nod, son.OK. Good. That???s some vigorous nodding. Don???t nod like that in the stadium, though. It???s a bit too eager. People might notice. And then suddenly you???re Overly Nodding Guy.Because once we???re inside ",100
54,"that stadium, full of television cameras and photographers and fifteen-thousand smartphones, all bets are off. You may think that you???re simply watching the game and reacting to it, appropriately, but everybody will be hyperaware of each other. We are all on display. We are all targets. And if you shriek or cheer too much or frown or cackle or bare your teeth or leave your mouth open or stick your tongue out or look surprised or scared or angry or joyous??? or if you cry or dance or yawn or squint or shudder or flap your arms or trip or fall over, your face could be everywhere, instantaneously, even before we exit the venue, whether you like it or not.I won???t be able to stop it.They will win before you know you???ve lost.Who???s ???they???? Everybody. How do they win? Through sheer volume. And hashtags. And animated GIFs.The people on the internet will say it???s all in good fun, when they Photoshop a beak on your mouth, or put your head on a chihuahua, or they turn your weeping eyes into planets, or they create thousands of cloned images of your frightened face, plummeting from a raincloud.See, taking you out of context and making you into a fixed image, oftentimes with a pithy slogan underneath, will become a shared experience for millions of willing participants sitting at home tonight and tomorrow and beyond. It happens so quickly! Just ask Crying Piccolo Girl. And Weeping Bernie Supporter. And Hipster Barista. And Overly Attached Girlfriend. And Sheltering Suburban Mom. And Lazy College Senior. And Intense Marching Band Student. And let???s not forget about Lightsaber Teen. And Alex from Target. And Evil Toddler. And Sad Keanu. And Scumbag Steve. And Angry Michael Phelps. These are all real things. Real memes. Look them up, son.And while you???re at it, don???t forget what happened to Michael Jordan, who shed a few tears while giving an emotional speech, which was enough fuel for years worth of entertainment.Crying Michael Jordan has become more famous than regular Michael Jordan.These images last forever. I???m not kidding. And I don???t want you going off to college in a decade, only to be greeted by a chorus of, ???Hey, look! It???s Shrieking Stadium Kid!??? Or, ???Isn???t that Fist-Pumping Cheeto-Lips??????? or whatever.And that???s why you, my boy, need to remain neutral at all times. Say it with me: ???I will remain neutral at all times.??? Say it again: ???I will remain neutral at all times.??? Let that phrase continue to repeat on a loop in your head, let it sync up with the beating of your heart, inhale and exhale that phrase, son. Otherwise, there???ll be a digital mob after you, distorting your image, writing slogans on ??? or about ??? you, even if they never know your name. Your name doesn???t matter. You become a character. And that???s just the beginning.Now, as soon as we head into that stadium over there, it???s time to appear nondescript, straight-faced, deadpan and hard-to-read. Don???t stick out. Never be extraordinary in any way. I don???t want to see a twitch out of you. There???s no more room for mistakes. I want you to be as middle-of-the-road as it gets. A five-out-of-ten. Blend in. Try not to move very often.Hmm. Then again??? don???t be too robotic, or people will create a GIF and call it Robot Boy and then it???ll ruin your life. You also don???t want to be Jaded Arena Kid or Bored Brian or Smug Little Jerk. Got it?I don???t think it???s fair for your generation to always have to be on guard like this, son. You should be able to mess up and not have your mistakes turn into a permanent record. But it???s too late for that now. Everything is a permanent record! We???ve done this to ourselves. Once we leave the house, our identities belong to those who are watching, the unseen masses, huddled over their laptops, waiting to share and share and share us into unwanted fame and unnecessary ruin.So all I can say is, please, please don???t make any weird faces tonight, son. And, for your sake, I promise I won???t, either. The last thing you need is to appear in a painfully embarrassing father-son meme.Do you understand all of this? Nod if you do. Good. Stop nodding. Now, let???s go try to have a moderate amount of fun at this nightmare of an event in this insane world we???ve created.College professors are completely surrounded by but also excluded from the drinking-est demographic there is, college students. Professors see students with hangovers every day, or they see the empty seats that represent hangovers. There are students who will attend class after a long night of drinking, the worst versions of themselves: dazed, apathetic, out of touch, or after a few minutes of trying to hold it together, dozing off. In a college town there are discount liquor stores and drink specials. There???s tailgating and the hazing of Greek pledges. There are cliques of underage dormers who wander the sidewalks at night in search of a kegger. A professor can remain young in spirit by working with students, but the body ages, and once the professor is more than twice their age, the students become harder to relate to and they need something the professor may have run out of. Then the teacher lacks definition, in a daily limbo that includes night drinking, and the teacher is mentally exhausted though they maintain the charade perfectly, hoping to go to bed early for a change, but staying up for a nightcap. At a bar near campus several of the teacher???s students are getting wasted, and the teacher has no thought of them. The teacher falls asleep on the couch, drink in hand. This is not the existence the teacher had sought.I taught for a year at a high school in rural Mississippi. I needed a job, I was fresh out of graduate school, and they were hiring. I was one of two Ph.Ds. at the high school, the other a divorced father and retired NASA scientist whose son attended a nearby school for the blind. The retired NASA scientist took the job for the insurance benefits that would cover his son. As new hires and as outsiders, there was a kinship between us. One morning, when I???d woken up with a broken blood vessel in my eye, I dreaded going to the school because I looked like I???d been in a fight and I was going to have to answer to nosy students. When the retired NASA scientist asked what had happened, I said I didn???t know. I woke up with my eye that way. Could that happen? He said it couldn???t and he asked if I???d been drinking. I said I hadn???t, which I really believed, but then as I remembered better, I had been. And so I said, ???Yes, come to think of it, yes.??? But what did that have to do with anything?He said, ???Did you bump into something????And that was it. That was exactly it. I didn???t remember drinking because I???d been drinking every night. It was so ordinary I didn???t think about it. And in the fog of alcohol, I must have, probably did, bump into something. Mystery solved, and as mundane and pathetic as it was, I probably did deserve to face the next few days with a red eye.Teachers drink. The daily psychological pressure of having to perform for young people can be released with a couple of beers, or a tall glass of wine. There???s untold monotony in going over the same lessons, of grading the same papers (sometimes literally; thank you, plagiarism!) and of dealing with the needs of each new set of students, caught at the same age and social development as the class before. And then in the summer there???s near-absolute freedom, with no responsibilities, so that every day is like the weekend, and teachers can slip into an accelerated haze of drinking. We drink because we have too much to do, we are sick of ourselves, and too many",100
55," people depend on us. Then, with the grades handed in, we drink because we have too little to do and hardly anyone depends on us.What the retired NASA scientist recognized in me, and what I???d hardly come to terms with yet, was that I was a functioning alcoholic, no longer a teacher who drank, but a drinker who taught. You might expect this all to spiral down into sick days, assignments ungraded, or napping in the teacher???s lounge during the prep period, but as a grad student I???d been drinking through an impossible schedule for quite a while. It was a matter of knowing what tasks could be put off, what could be accomplished while drinking, and when necessary, putting off the drinking until the work was done, then hitting the bottle hard for what remained of the night to make up for it. I had the ability to wake up early in the morning pretty much no matter what. On top of that, because I had to be at the school every weekday and had to grade and work on lesson plans every weeknight, I wasn???t doing any writing, which was hard to face since it was the reason I???d endured the impossible schedule of graduate school in the first place. It wasn???t the drinking that nixed my writing, by the way, but the daily routine. There was no time to write in the morning, I was too exhausted to write at night, and I needed weekends to rest and recharge. Teaching took my writing from me and drinking kept me from thinking too much about it. I didn???t go to bars. I didn???t go anywhere. I would have a drink with my spouse at dinner and then drink in front of the TV. I didn???t particularly want to watch TV, or to drink, but I did this pretty much every night and when I did I felt most at ease. Teachers are solitary in this way, even the majority who aren???t drinkers, but the need to unwind can easily transition into this habit.That was seventeen years ago and I???m not going to say I???m sober, or that I condemn drinking. I still have days that lead to nights of drinking and watching TV. I teach at a college now, for the time being anyway. I???m on a temporary contract that will end this semester. I???ve applied for writing instructor jobs at several universities, but these jobs are so competitive I feel like hiring committees will see right through me. I will look suspicious, since I???m too old not to have landed a permanent position, though there are far more of us teaching at colleges who don???t have job security than those who do. Each night as I think about my impending unemployment I can???t help but feel cheated. I???ve worked very hard and have given a lot of myself, with very little to show for it. Who will want to hire an ex-teacher pushing fifty when there are so many other energetic multi-faceted worker bees? Writing and teaching are skills we laud but that corporate America isn???t really willing to pay for. As universities become more like corporations, that???s doubly true.Evening passes into night, a beer to calm the nerves. I relax on the couch with nowhere to go, browsing TV channels, a glass of whiskey, a plate of crackers to buffer the stomach, no particular show worth watching. There have been so many nights spent reading, so many mornings spent at the computer clacking out sentences. I???ve never been able to write while drinking, the activities mutually exclusive for me. Drinking was for when the mind needed to go quiet. Writing required concentration: one had to listen to whatever was inside and find a rhythm to set it to, the nearly imperceptible prosody of the everyday. I imagine it must be easier to go about life without the desire to do that, and then at night drinking would only be drinking, not the conscious effort to extinguish intellect.My love life has been one big disappointment lately. It seems like every time I meet a great guy, either the chemistry isn???t right, or he immediately proposes to me but has this female best friend he swears he just doesn???t think of like that, and then on the eve of our hot air balloon-themed wedding, he gets stuck in a hot air balloon with her because of a misunderstanding over tethering etiquette and realizes that he???s loved her all along. I know I???m not the first to say it, but dating in this city is a real slog when you???re over 30 and you are a plot device.Dating was so much easier in my 20s. Everyone was more carefree and open, and no one ever realized that his best friend???s habit of nervously reciting obscure Korean War trivia was the very thing he loved most about her. My therapist has suggested that by continuing to accept proposals from men with improbably-hot-if-clumsy best friends and suggesting that those best friends would be indispensable in helping to plan our hot air balloon-themed nuptials, I am, in a way, recreating old patterns. Maybe she???s right. But in my defense, a surprising number of those women had connections in the ballooning industry. And besides, the men couldn???t have been more different from each other. Sure, they were all architects, but any architect will tell you that there???s a world of difference between commercial and residential projects.And Daniel???s best friend was only clumsy when she was on a deadline for her job as a wedding journalist. And that was just because of how much she hated weddings. You know, because of her past.Look, I have my own baggage, too. I leave dishes in the sink, I can be overly emotional, and of course I was kidnapped a lot as a teenager, forcing my father to choose between rescuing me and disarming the nuclear warheads. If there???s one thing I learned from Evgeni, it???s that you can take a man???s daughter and his house and his former partner Jeffrey and his other daughter and his lucky coin and his ear, but you can???t take his love of the U.S.A. I???m also kind of a grumblepuss in the morning! But somehow none of that seemed to matter as much when I was in my 20s.Now that I???m in my 30s, I???d really like to meet a nice guy and settle down. I???d like to have a few kids???twin daughters but one is a secret, or a son who I can trust to leave home alone for the weekend, despite what happened last time. And then, when the kids are grown and my husband???s dead from that scarab amulet I gave him for his birthday, I???d like to go to the same restaurant every day to drink coffee and chat with a waitress whose dreams are bigger than this tiny town. And when I die and surprise her by leaving her all my money, I hope she founds that scarf startup, like she???s always dreamed.I guess I just have to keep putting myself out there, like I did when I was in my 20s. Sure, there have been some disappointments along the way, but for now there???s nothing to do but hold out hope that the right guy will come along. I don???t care about his looks or his bank account, just as long as he makes me laugh, and has at least a working knowledge of knots. Because Brian tied me to these train tracks like twelve hours ago, and I don???t think he???s coming back.""1.

Silly apes! What have you done with all of your dominion?""Hi, there! I have a VERY serious mental health problem, one that cannot be helped with medicine or therapy. However, I can make great strides by finding fulfillment through dance, meeting a good friend who???s going through some shit of his own right now, or getting into a romantic relationship and then seeing that relationship temporarily hit a snag but then work out after we make up at a bus depot.When I???m a woman I am mainly concerned with how my illness affects the emotional arc of some guy. When I???m a man it???s more likely that my illness manifests itself in me being really good at math. And yelling. If I am a male mentally ill person I do lots of yelling. As a woman my mental illness cannot be allowed to preclude my fuckability, so I do less yelling.Sometimes my illness seems all encompassing and inescapable; sometimes it goes away for all of act II. It varies depending on my mood, whether my relationship with Bradley Cooper is going well, and the tempo of the Shins song in the background.What exactly is my illness? Unclear. My symptoms shift from scene to scene. Sometimes I???m OCD in all the visible quirky ways of OCD, sometimes I???m bipolar, sometimes I have multiple personalities, sometimes I hear voices, sometimes I am a sloppy pastiche of various earlier cinematic characters with mental illnesses. Often I???m sad in a way that could be clinical depression but is probably just the sort of sadness that afflicts a 43-year-old screenwriter who feels unfulfilled professionally. You know, the kind that magically lifts if you sell a script or meet an attractive woman twenty years your junior who is willing to have sex with you.How do people respond to my illness? Well, the parts that are commonly recognized symptoms of a diagnosed condition are somehow incredibly hard to grasp. WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS? My family rudely asks about behavior that in real life would have been explained to them by my childhood psychologist. I DON???T UNDERSTAND YOU! Screams my girlfriend who has been with me for years but somehow never figured out that I probably go to a doctor twice a week and take prescription medicine for a reason.Meanwhile, the parts of my behavior that cannot be found in the DSM, the parts that aren???t a medical thing but are just a not-that-endearing quirky thing, everyone accepts without batting an eyelash. I only wear mismatched socks and encourage other people to do likewise? Sure, seems normal enough and is kind of cute because it???s original and fun and not something that would never fly in a reality where I don???t look like Natalie Portman. I always want to go skinny-dipping, I fear zucchini, I call sex ???twinkly fun time,??? I???m basically a seven-year-old in an adult???s body? All great, all totally cool, all reasons to want to befriend/date/watch me in a rom-com and not reasons to run far away and stop responding to the postcards I adorably mail you even though phones exist.My illness is a curse, obviously, hence all the yelling, but in some ways it is also a blessing. After all, without it I would not be so good at art and/or game theory and/or ping-pong. It is the source of all my abilities even the ones that are normally the result of hard work and intellect rather than of a debilitating medical condition. My mental instability may also give me wisdom and insight unavailable to healthier minds. I may hear voices but those voices speak truth.By the end of 108 minutes, will I be cured? That depends. Is this the sort of film that comes out in summer and is basically a bog-standard romantic comedy with the fun twist that one of the characters is ostensibly schizophrenic? Then sure! Love conquers all, even if all includes a chemical imbalance in someone???s brain. But is this the sort of film that comes out in the fall and has aspirations of winning shiny statues? Because then it seems more likely that I will be inexplicably better for part of the movie but then fall back into old patterns and return to being sad/confused/very interested in ritualized hand washing. This will demonstrate that my life is a Serious Important Story and, as such, a good Friday night outing for America???s aunts.A green and yellow parrot, which hung in a cage outside the door, kept repeating over and over: ???Je ne peux pas respirer!  I can???t breathe!???Mr. Pontellier, unable to watch Fox News with any degree of comfort, arose with an exclamation of disgust.  What an annoyance the bird was.  Did it not know that all lives mattered????Eric Garner!  Trayvon Martin!  Sandra Bland!  Say their names!??? the bird shouted.Mr. Pontellier looked out toward the beach.  His two sturdy sons and their nurse were approaching, followed by his wife and young Robert Lebrun.???You are burnt beyond recognition,??? he said, looking at his wife as one looks at a valuable piece of property which has suffered some damage.  ???You are quite as dark as the quadroon nurse.??????Mr. Pontellier,??? the nurse said stiffly, ???I have asked you repeatedly not to use that word or any other hate speech.  My name is Denise, and I demand respect.  And please tell your children not to touch my hair.???Edna Pontellier nibbled a bonbon and looked thoughtful.- -Robert Lebrun plucked an orange from the low-hanging branch of a tree and offered it to her.  ???I am very surprised you have not seen the video already,??? he told her.  ???It has been all over social media.??????Oh,??? she said, ???I am not very political.??????But how can you not be political when we live in the midst of systemic social injustice?  We must hold the police accountable!  We must bear witness!  Here, sit by me; Madame Antoine left us a meal of locally sourced, farm-to-table foods before she joined the LGBTQIA pride parade. ",100
57," How lucky we are not to live in a food desert! ??? which of course are most often found in low-income urban communities inhabited by people of color.  Here, we can watch the video on my phone while we eat.  Trigger warning, darling.???Edna reluctantly seated herself beside him on the chaise while Robert opened the YouTube app.  Soon the sounds of shouts and gunfire could be heard.???You see????  Robert asked, leaning close and breathing softly into her ear.  ???This is just one example of the racially motivated violence endemic to our patriarchal society and the gun culture.  And how do you like the kale?  I massaged it myself.???- -Mrs. Pontellier and Madame Ratignolle seated themselves in the shade of the porch and fanned themselves.  Madame Ratignolle produced a diminutive roll of needlework, some little garment she was making for one of her children.  Edna rested her eyes upon the sea.???Of what are you thinking, my dear???? asked Madame Ratignolle of her companion, whose countenance she had been watching with amused attention.???I was thinking about white privilege and intersectionality,??? said Edna, ???and how it seems to me that these things do, in fact, shape our perceptions and our lives in ways of which we are blissfully unaware.  I was thinking of systemic gendered double standards, how L??once went to dinner and billiards at Klein???s as if it were the most natural thing in the world, yet I am scolded like a child if I choose to go walking than sit at home to receive social calls.  I was thinking of the shocking income inequality in this country, and how the middle class is being squeezed out of existence while the one percent continue to amass great wealth.  I was thinking that perhaps my servants do not entirely enjoy being my servants.???Mrs. Ratignolle frowned.  ???My dear, I do not think this hot sun is good for you.  Perhaps you should consider having another baby.???- -When Mr. Pontellier came home at last, he discovered his wife lying in the hammock.  ???Edna!  What folly is this?  You will take cold; come in.??????I am not cold; I have my shawl.??????The mosquitoes will devour you.  I can???t permit you to stay out there all night.??????There are no mosquitoes, and that is a microagression.  Please respect my autonomous personhood.  This is a safe space.???L??once lit a cigar.  His wife was clearly ill or insane, perhaps both.  He would contact his friend in the city, Doctor Mandelet.  Together the two wealthy white men would decide how best to legislate his wife???s body.- -Edna found Madame Ratignolle in the salon, her face drawn and pinched, her blue eyes haggard.  ???Where is the doctor???? she cried.???Do you mean that you do not have a doula???? Edna asked.  ???Did you not read the articles I sent you about low-intervention birth plans, African birthing swings, or dolphin-assisted births?  Did you read the articles about the dangers of vaccination and the benefits of co-sleeping?  My dear Ad??le, do you even have a birth plan???????I am in a great deal of pain,??? Madame Ratignolle gasped.???Ah, it is just as I feared!??? Edna cried.  ???I said as much to Alc??e Arobin in bed last night, just after we brought each other to consensual mutual orgasm.???Madame Ratignolle swooned, and the baby plopped onto the floor from beneath her skirts. Edna bent gracefully and gathered the placenta.  She would leave a restorative placenta smoothie recipe with the cook, a woman who earned shockingly little compared to a man doing equal work.- -The waters of the Gulf stretched out before her.  Edna sighed; it was no use.  Robert had proven himself to be a manspreader, a mansplainer, a product of rape culture.  Arobin???s dreadlocks were an unforgivable appropriation of black culture, and L??once???s new profile pic showed him sporting a BLUE LIVES MATTER pin at a Trump rally.  Ad??le chattered only about her baby and the return of pumpkin spice latte season. There was no possibility, Edna thought, of her continuing in this life now that she was truly woke.She cast off her garments, oppressive and hyper-sexualized items produced by abused and exploited workers, and for the first time in her life stood naked and un-body-shamed in the open air.She walked into the sea.  ???Be the change you wish to see in the world,??? she sighed as she swam out, farther and farther, until exhaustion overpowered her.Two strong women of color watched from the shore.???Wow, talk about white privilege,??? Denise said.???I heard that,??? replied her trans Latina friend Mariequita.  ???And you know Ghandi never actually said that.???Denise shook her head.  ???She probably learned it from a fucking bumper sticker.???If you???re reading this, congratulations!

Sometimes we feel bad because Sammy is deaf in his left ear, so we???re careful about mocking him for reasons that are specifically not ear-related, like his broken childhood and his three-legged dog. We laugh. We tease. We speak to the left of him so he can???t hear us.JakeJake has been to jail three times. I don???t actually know what his area of expertise is, but he???s powerful and terrifying and I???m scared of angering him. He has a back tattoo that says A BEAR, BUT LIKE A MEAN ONE, because his tattoo artist thought he meant the entire phrase. Everyone reads it and feigns terror because they???re too afraid to admit the truth, so Jake still believes there???s a menacing image on his back. I need to have Jake on my team.EliI meant to ask Eli on a date but I got nervous and accidentally asked that he join the team instead. He???s a computer scientist, which is irrelevant because pub quiz",100
58,"zes concern real facts, and computers are just a fad???they???re getting so small that they???ll soon disappear. Anyway, Sammy knows more about coding, but I guess Eli could correct his mistakes. Ha, what am I saying? Sammy doesn???t make errors. He???s such a geek, with bad hearing. (But that ability ??? or lack thereof ??? does not reflect his character. I want to be clear about this: Sammy would be just as irritating with two good ears, which he absolutely does not have.) Eli has beautiful, symmetrical ears.RachelRachel is a genius. I could easily win with just Rachel on my team, but I think she finds me annoying so I always pad our social interactions with cooler people. I couldn???t actually find any, but the other members will at least be distracting.Rachel is so smart that she once conducted diabetes research in a hospital where nobody had diabetes. She wrote a paper titled, ???You Can Have a Broken Leg Without Having Diabetes.??? Sammy apparently wrote his PhD dissertation on the very disease, but it took him 142 pages to only cover Type 1. Rachel defined both types and broken bones in just 4 pages.Her ears are okay.DanielDaniel is the only one over 21 and can get us into the pub. He feels like our cool older brother who also goes to the bathroom every half-hour due to his microbladder. He also shaved his facial hair in vertical strips so that there???s a functioning barcode on his face. When you scan it, it says he???s priceless. (Unless he???s sweaty, in which case it scans for $1.99.)To be honest, Daniel could easily be the person we ridicule instead of Sammy, but again, Daniel???s our ticket into the pub because he???s over 21. Daniel is 72 years old.KarenThat???s me! I???m on the team because I went through the trouble of observing and evaluating my peers. Reading timed essays is hard, especially when Jake???s are just drawings of skulls. Also, I have a weird habit of spouting facts when I???m nervous ??? the first time I met Eli I frantically listed the US presidents who were in office during the Vietnam War. It was in response to his question: ???What did you study in college???? I studied Communications. My nervousness actually makes me adept at answering trivia questions, just the wrong ones at the wrong times.- -In 1998, as a high school student, I took a job with an auction company that had been hired to sell off the contents of the General Hospital in Calgary, Alberta. The work was grueling, unsanitary, and something of an eye-opener for someone who had never experienced manual labor, but it did give me a remarkable insight into the background workings of a large institution. The General Hospital was a mainstay in Calgary for generations, with the original facility built in 1910. By the time it closed, the campus included seven buildings spread over more than 20 acres. Many native Calgarians were born there, including my parents, my husband, and myself.We had to go through the entire facility and determine what was worth auctioning off and what could be left for the demolition. Most of the valuable medical equipment had been removed and either sold off or transferred to other local medical centers, but there was still a lot for us to assess, running the gamut from bedpans, wheelchairs, and office furniture to file cabinets, institutional dishes, and all of the kitchen equipment from the hospital???s cafeteria.Before the auction, every item had to be reviewed and gathered into a central location for pricing and inventory. This meant we had to go in and out of every possible space in the facility. At one point I was going through a janitor???s office, which was filled with what you???d expect ??? cleaning fluids, woodworking tools, well-thumbed copies of Hustler. In addition, I found a little key used to turn on institutional banks of overhead lights. (These lights don???t have a conventional on/off toggle switch. Instead, you insert the key into a slot move it up or down.) I dropped it into my pocket on a whim.That fall, the building was imploded, and it felt like the whole city came out to watch. Those who didn???t attend the auction but still wanted a souvenir dug through the debris and came away with scraps, like a piece of a brick. But I didn???t need to gather anything. I already had my key, securely attached to my key ring.I???m now an assistant principal at a high school and often use the key to turn on overhead lights in the gymnasium or library. So this artifact is both sentimental and functional. Nobody would ever guess its history or meaning to me.Dear Class of 2020 Student,Congratulations on your acceptance to our prestigious university! We???re delighted you chose us, and we couldn???t be more thrilled that you???ll be part of this academic community united by rigorous scholarship and steadfast devotion to freedom of expression. But if you???re some namby-pamby millennial crybaby who thinks we???re going to cave to your valid concerns and cancel the college-sponsored Ku Klux Klan rally we???ve scheduled for homecoming week, you???ve got another think coming.You see, we here at this heralded institution don???t believe in quote-unquote ???safe spaces??? and ???trigger warnings.??? We prefer our spaces to be dangerous, intellectually no less than physically. That???s why our Klan rally???brought to you by the Department of Student Life and set to feature antagonistic speeches by members of what the PC Southern Poverty Law Center has called ???the most infamous and oldest of American hate groups??????will also double as an open-carry demonstration.In an ironic twist, our lawyers have informed us that we are legally obligated to warn you that at this event there will be literal triggers within reach of the itchy fingers of ideologically entrenched white men, but don???t get used to this kind of courteous heads up. Except in such cases where we have to cover our own asses to avoid lawsuits, you should expect no coddling from us.Now, if you???re the sensitive, entitled brat this needlessly confrontational welcome letter assumes you are, you might be wondering why we???ve scheduled a KKK march on the quad when we could???ve just as easily booked any number of organizations working to advance society and enrich culture rather than set the clock back to Jim Crow. Well, if there???s ever been a question more indicative of the anti-intellectualism of this helicopter-parented generation, I???ve not seen it!I suppose next you???re going to ask how this university can justify using your student activity fees to cover the Grand Dragon???s speaking honorarium and the material cost of gasoline and a few crosses?Look, I realize you???ve grown accustomed to being sheltered at every step along the way of your precious little life, but that ends now. This is college, and we???re open to all viewpoints here???whether those of forward-thinking intellectuals or raging, hooded ideologues. If you can???t tolerate the opinions  of white supremacists hell-bent on preserving the legacy of a domestic terrorist organization, then perhaps you shouldn???t be in college, should you?As an incoming student and soon-to-be scholar at this university, it is absolutely vital that you learn to consider and respect opposing perspectives. That???s what the college experience is all about! For example, if you???re a traditionalist, you should learn to consider and respect the views of post-modernists. If you???re a liberal, you should learn to consider and respect the views of conservatives. And if you???re not white, you should learn to consider and respect the views of seething  racists who fervidly reject your basic humanity and wish to strip away your civil rights???an ",100
59,"apt description, incidentally, of members of the local Klavern who will be joining us for homecoming week festivities.After all, we???d be doing you a disservice if we didn???t condition you on a semester-by-semester basis to passively accept backwards, untenable views as being just as lucid as your own.  You never know, maybe you could go on to internalize and even adopt some of the oppressive ideologies we open your mind to over these next four years!You are of course free to sit the Klan rally out, but if you do, you do so to the detriment of your education. There is so much more to gain from the college experience than what you can get from a textbook or lecture hall, such as the opportunity to be called an array of racial epithets at a school-sponsored extracurricular event.If you do attend the institutionally approved and funded KKK rally, please arrive with an open mind, an intellectual inquisitiveness, and???because we don???t condone ???safe spaces??? here???an emergency rucksack packed with a first aid kit, potable water, pepper spray, and signal flares. We also recommend a gas mask and bulletproof vest.If you forgot to bring a bulletproof vest from home in the craziness of move-in weekend, you can pick one up from the campus bookstore on your way to the demonstration. I think you???ll be pleased with the sleek, stylish vest???complete with university colors and monogram???that the bookstore has in stock. While there, don???t forget to pick up a candy bar and soda to keep you fueled for a late night of studying and civil unrest!You???ll only take from your education what you put into it, so I would encourage you to attend, provided you do so with close-toed shoes. You may find your initial discomfort at the prospect of joining a KKK rally was based on an inadequate understanding of Klankraft and various obscure Klan rituals that extend well beyond the cross-burning scheduled to take place at halftime of the homecoming football game.If the privileged and bizarrely aggressive tone of my letter hasn???t gotten through to you, well then, by all means, keep being the easily offended, delicate snowflake you are. For my  part, I intend to go on acting as though the free speech I so staunchly uphold doesn???t include your right to speak back.Again, I welcome you to our university and extend my hearty congratulations on your acceptance! Please don???t hesitate to reach out to me should you ever need anything, provided it???s not to whine about being called a racial slur by someone holding a torch and a differing perspective than your own.Sincerely,RichRichard Head, PhDDean of Student AffairsMansfield State UniversityI have no business writing about math. I shouldn???t even be writing about people writing about math. The fact that I???m doing exactly that is probably the first thing that Ada Lovelace should be pretty pissed off about.Ada Lovelace (1815-1852) has been called a genius, a mathematician, a writer, and the world???s first computer programmer. She was all of those things, more or less, and she lived her life both thanks to and in spite of her famous father.So???the juicy details. (And trust me, the details are juicier than I have time to explain here.)Ada was the daughter of Anne Isabella Milbanke Byron and the illustrious Romantic poet, Lord Byron. Their marriage was short, ending when Lady Anne left in the middle of the night with her one-month-old baby bundled in her arms.We don???t really know exactly why Ada???s mother left Byron, but since he was both wildly famous (imagine Johnny Depp times 1,000) and wildly promiscuous, it???s easy to imagine that he wasn???t the stay-at-home-and-rub-my-wife???s-aching-feet husband that Lady Anne might have preferred. It???s also easy to imagine that her parents??? separation was the first thing that pissed Ada off.Oh, and Lord Byron was likely bisexual.And he probably slept with his half-sister.There???s some evidence that he fathered a child with that same half-sister.But other than that, husband and father of the year.Raising Ada on her own, Anne may???ve gone a bit overboard in her anti-Byron campaign. She emphasized math in her daughter???s education in hopes of training Ada???s brain to be unpoetic and un-spontaneous; in other words, as un-Byron-like as possible.But really, Ada owes her father a great debt.If Byron hadn???t slept with anyone and everyone who was willing (an exaggeration I feel he would appreciate), and been in general a pretty crappy husband and father, you might not be reading this article today. Not only because Byron???s happy home life would be far less interesting to be pissed off about, but because Anne wouldn???t have overreacted and steeped Ada in math, from which she developed the mind that (arguably) created the world???s first computer program, after which someone created the internet and voila!, here you are at McSweeney???s Internet Tendency.That???s the official historic sequence, by the way: Ada Lovelace, then the internet, and then McSweeney???s Internet Tendency. All of the important milestones accounted for.It???s hard not to focus on Byron, and this was society???s problem in his lifetime, too. His presence eclipsed everything around him. Ada never saw him after her first month of life, but she certainly knew of him and absorbed every detail about him covered in the press (and there were many???he was like the first Kardashian, but with actual talent). Ada certainly must???ve been pissed off when he died fighting for Greece when he was only 36 years old, eliminating any chance she might have had to know him.Ada also died when she was 36 years old, and, like her father, she did not receive the acclaim her accomplishments deserved until fairly recently.Young Ada was precocious and operated in pretty swanky circles. At age 12 she designed a flying machine. One of her tutors was William Frend, who had a brief affair with Mary Hays, who was good friends with Mary Wollstonecraft, whose daughter was Mary Shelley, whose step-sister was Claire Clairmont, who had a baby with Byron.And you thought your world was small.Ada was also friends with Charles Dickens and Sir Walter Scott. In 1837, author and future Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli wrote a novel titled Venetia, loosely based on Ada. But Ada disregarded fame, fashion, and beauty (things women were, and still are, stereotypically obsessed with) in pursuit of her passion.Another of Ada???s tutors was Mary Somerville, one of the greatest mathematicians in the world. Somerville Hall (now Somerville College), one of the first women???s colleges in Oxford, was named for her. Ada???s mother was not messing around when it came to teaching her daughter anything but poetry.On June 5, 1833, Ada met Charles Babbage, a cranky genius who was working on the Difference Engine, which was a fully automated ???thinking machine,??? able to make calculations after someone input the numbers. London was simply in awe, but Ada understood how it worked. Babbage and Ada worked together on an advanced version called the Analytical Engine.But first, Ada married, had three kids in three years, kept up three homes (hey, I never said she wasn???t loaded), and learned that her husband, William, Lord King (no kidding, that???s his name) was a bit listless.No matter. Ada kept busy. She translated Luigi Federico Menabrea???s paper on the Analytical Engine. Menabrea???s paper was about 8,000 words. Ada added 20,000 words in her appended notes. Babbage probably didn???t even understand Ada???s notes, but they are widely regarded as the first computer program ever. This, by the way, is another debt Ada owed her father: though she???d be trained largely in mathe",100
60,"matics, she possessed a creative and literary mind that enabled her to both analyze and translate what she read. It???s like the liberal arts were determined to shine through Ada Lovelace!To put this in some perspective, keep in mind that Ada lived in a time when the word ???computer??? referred to a person who computes.Still, rather than recognizing Ada???s genius, some still dismiss her as mad, a word that was also applied to her father, and an accusation that kept him from being lauded, as well. It would no doubt piss Ada off to know that women in many scientific fields are still harassed and held back, but I hope those women take heart in knowing they had a phenomenal predecessor.- -Books you should find and read about Ada Lovelace:Ada???s Algorithm by James EssingerThe Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage: The (Mostly) True Story of the First Computer by Sydney Padua1. 6 INFLATED TIRES, 1 EMPTY LIFE2.

The case???s discovery file contains photos of her injuries. He hit her twice. The bullets entered the knee area of each leg, then they traveled through the limbs and left wounds upon their exit. One exit wound carved a path into her mid-upper leg. The other is a tender red circle, resting in the center of her inner thigh. A long shot shows Whitney reclining in a hospital bed. Her shoulders and legs are bare, and her torso is draped in a white blanket. The room seems too bright. She looks exhausted.The bulk of what I know about Whitney comes from the case???s discovery file. I haven???t been able to talk to her, despite multiple attempts and the help of a professional researcher.

Standing before the gray backdrop, Whitney wears her hair in a high ponytail, and her face is make-up free???except her eyebrows, which are so evenly black and perfectly shaped they might???ve been stenciled on. The year before, Whitney was charged with a Driving Under the Influence (Excessive), which designates a blood-alcohol level of .2 or higher. Her eyes are glassy, and she smiles directly into the camera. A state-records search reveals she???s not new to the system. Over the years, she???s acquired more than a dozen charges for various misdemeanors and infractions. Some cases got dismissed, including a 2007 charge for battery. Other cases were upheld, such as a 2010 charge for failing to properly secure a infant passenger in a vehicle. Whitney???s rap sheet began at age 16, when she was sentenced for driving on the wrong side of the highway. Soon after, throughout her teens, she was detained as a runaway again and again and again.Let???s get back to the case file. One section contains information about Whitney???s purse, a maroon Coach handbag with chevron pleats and gold buckles. As authorities discovered the purse on the scene, it was zipped open and positioned on its side, on the floor, in the lounge, close to Whitney???s body.Photo Credits: Seattle Police DepartmentThe authorities obtained the purse and documented its contents as evidence. Whitney carried Washington and Idaho ID cards, a state-issued food-assistance card, a credit card, and a crumpled social security card. A rubbery gold cosmetics bag stored her liquid eyeliner, her pencil eyeliner, her pencil-eyeliner sharpener, her scented lotion, her makeup brush, her containers of fancy powder, and her leopard-print tube of drugstore mascara. Many items are of neutral consequence, such as the pen, the pencil, the hard pack of Marlboro lights, the parking receipt, the lightly used napkin, and the miscellaneous change sprinkled with residue from a broken cigarette. There???s also a set of blue scrubs and a packet of schoolwork, titled with the name of a nearby vocational college where Whitney had apparently been studying to become a medical assistant. One page is a fill-in-the-blank quiz on the human cardiovascular system she???d taken a couple days before. Whitney???s handwriting is feminine, the letters bubble prettily. Another page is a handout titled Blood Focus Sheet she received in her Anatomy Physiology and Pathophysiology II class. Whitney seems to have paid attention during lectures. As the page shows, she took notes, and marked many phrases with arrows, stars, and underlines. The paper???s center crease and bottom edge are smudged with blood from the crime scene.Another portion of the case file contains a transcribed interview with Whitney, which Detective Frank conducted as Whitney lay in her hospital bed the day after the shooting. Around the same period, Officer Karla conducted multiple interviews with Whitney and summarized her findings in an additional report. To both authorities, Whitney identified James as her boyfriend. They???d been dating a little under two years, she said, and James was the father of her nine-month-old boy. Whitney stated she didn???t have a permanent residence and usually stayed with friends, family, or James. At the time of the incident, she and James had been living together two weeks. ???Is he aware that you have a no-contact order???? asked Detective Frank.???Yeah,??? said Whitney.???Yet you still live with him???? asked the detective.???Well, I was just around him for a little while and then this ended up bad,??? she said.???Just kind of starting from the beginning, can you tell us what happened???? said Detective Frank.???Earlier that day he had come home after getting his taxes done,??? she said. ???He told me he was only gonna give me like seven hundred dollars, and I got upset.??? According to Whitney, this wasn???t the amount she wanted, and they began to argue. ???I just said, you know, ???I???m gonna go down to the bar down the street to order some lunch,??? you know, and I said, ???Do you want anything? I???ll be right back,?????? said Whitney. ???He didn???t say anything so I just left, and I had a drink, and then I called him about thirty minutes later and said, ???Hey,??????you know??????come on down here. The owner???s here with his kids and there???s some kids in here. Let???s just order some food and get over it.??????James showed up at the Twilight Exit, and the pair was joined by James???s cousin, who lived nearby, and the cousin???s girlfriend. (Neither responded to my requests for interviews.) As Whitney described this afternoon visit, things seemed fine. ???We???re all eating and talking and hanging out,??? she said. James might???ve had a few drinks, ???probably like five or six shots or something, but they were like double,??? said Whitney. (James???s multiple bar purchases might explain the origin of an item listed in the evidence file. Later that night, when authorities would examine James???s body, they noted ???a green bar swizzle stick in the shape of a small sword was attached to his sweatshirt near the collar.???) Whitney told the detective, she wasn???t sure how the alcohol affected James. ???It???s a tough one because even if he???s drunk, you can???t tell that he???s drunk at all. He???s one of those people that are always the same. Always mellow.??? She said she wouldn???t consider James a chronic drinker, ???but when he drinks, you know, he???s gonna have some drinks.??? When the detective asked directly, Whitney mentioned James sometimes used cocaine, but they didn???t discuss the frequency. She said she didn???t know whether James had done any that day.Whitney???s group left the bar after a while, and the four walked to James and Whitney???s place. Soon after, James took off without saying goodbye to anyone. Once Whitney realized he was gone, ???I was like ok, well, I need to figure out where he???s at. I need to go and find him. He was at a friend???s, down the street. He finally picked up my phone call. I said, ???Man, what are you doing???? He said, ???I just went down here. [We???re] not doing anything. I???m on my way home.??? So he gets home and right away he left again. And it was just so quick. I was like, ???Where are you going, what are you doing???? And he said, ???I???ll be back,??? and he???s like, ???I???m just gonna go meet up with a friend.??? And I was like, ???No. We???re here. You???re not doing anything,?????? said Whitney. James took off anyway.Twenty or thirty minutes passed, and when James didn???t return, ???I???m like, ???I need to get him. He needs to come home.??? I told the cousin, ???Come on, let???s walk to the guy???s house and get him.??? We get there, and he???s not even there. They have no idea where he went. I???m calling him, calling him, calling him,??? she said, but James wouldn???t answer. The cousin went away soon after, but Whitney stuck around, waiting for James to arrive. ???I???m just there with someone that lives there. And James had walked in the house and he said, ???Why is it just you two???? and the guy was like, ???Man, cause everyone left.??????James turned to Whitney. ???He was like, ???Well, what are you doing here???? I was like, ???I was waiting for you.??? I was like, ???Where have you been???? And he was like, ???I???m gonna kill both of you guys.??? I was just like, ???For what? What???d we d",100
62,"o???? He???s like, ???Well, you???re here alone with a man.??? And I was like, ???There???s woman upstairs. There???s two other guys in this house. Nothing???s going on.??? And he got really crazy, and he came up and tried to choke me. And I kicked him away from me. The guy said, ???You guys have to leave now. Get out of my house.??? I said, ???But if I leave, he???s gonna kill me.??? He said, ???I don???t know what you???re gonna do, but you can???t stay here. I???m sorry. You have to go,?????? said Whitney.???I walked down the steps with James. He was trying to get me to get in the car, but I ran over to the neighbor???s house??????which is where the cousin and the girlfriend lived??????I said, ???You guys, James is going crazy. He just showed up with a gun. I can???t go with him. He???ll kill me, you guys. I gotta go to the house and get my kid and go.??? When the detective asked about the gun, Whitney said James had been carrying it in his waistband. She???d seen the gun many times, she said, and this wasn???t the first time he???d used it to threaten her. She said James had physically assaulted her many times in the past. He???d punched her before, she said.Whitney detailed another part of her story to Officer Karla. At one point, perhaps earlier, when Whitney was by herself and looking for James, she???d make a stop to her home. She discovered James had left the residence, leaving their baby alone and locked inside. Whitney said she???d told the cousin that if James didn???t get home soon, she would have to break in. When Whitney spoke with Detective Frank, she didn???t mention the baby in these moments. ???[I] go into the house, the door is locked, [I] don???t have my key, so I break open the windows. I get really upset, and I broke his TV and his Play Station 3. I went upstairs, and there was all these weed plants. So I took them and I threw them outside. I called him probably twenty times. I said, ???All you care about is making money and your weed plants. I destroyed them. You only care about that kind of stuff. I???m tired of you.??? He said, ???Oh, you did that? Where you at???? I said, ???I???m not gonna stay at that house. You???re gonna kill me.??? So I told him, ???I???m down at the restaurant, and I???m charging my phone.??? He said, ???Ok, I???ll see you there.??? And he was like, ???I???m going to kill you tonight.??????Whitney headed to the Twilight Exit, leaving the baby home alone. She needed to make arrangements for someone to pick them up, and she knew she couldn???t take the boy into the bar with her, she said. I was seated in the lounge when Whitney arrived. Her beauty stood out to me. I remember her as a light-skinned African American of average height, with a slim figure, and long wavy hair. According to the evidence list, she wore a black cardigan with a cigarette lighter in the pocket, a black tank top, black socks, and black tennis shoes with hot-pink and neon-green accents. Whitney sat on a stool near the far corner of the horseshoe bar. As nearby witnesses recall, she ordered a pint of beer and plugged in her phone. While she waited for it to charge, she spoke quietly into a phone she???d borrowed from the bartender Natalie. According to Whitney, James showed up after she???d been there about ten minutes. ???He just went running in my face and screaming and the bouncer and the other people got him off of me. They said, ???Leave her alone. Leave her alone,?????? said Whitney. She said the bouncer approached and asked Whitney if James was bothering her. Whitney said he was, and she requested the bouncer make James leave and asked that he call the police. The bouncer escorted James from the building. He was gone ???probably a minute or two. Next thing I know, he came back in and started shooting. He shot the bouncer to get back inside,??? said Whitney.When the shots sounded, Whitney moved to the floor and crouched into a dead end. (She and I shared this tiny space, along with customers Lexi and Arielle and one other woman.) ???I just remember someone was screaming, ???Get down, get down, get down,?????? said Whitney. Suddenly, ???James came around the corner. He said, ???I???m gonna kill you. This is all your fault. You made me do this.??? He shot me in my legs. He said, ???boom boom boom boom boom boom.?????????Do you think he was intentionally shooting at your legs???? the detective asked.???Yeah,??? said Whitney. (I???m not as sure. James was only a couple feet from his target, so I???d initially assumed his aim was intentional. Later, a police officer told me it???s very common for untrained shooters to miss their targets at close range. Improper body posture, gun position, or trigger-finger placement can easily ruin one???s accuracy, he said.)As Whitney crouched on the floor, ???I just remember saying, ???James. Just don???t, don???t, don???t do anything else.?????? That???s when James addressed the witnesses surrounding her, said Whitney. As she recalls, he told them, ???You guys, get up and go. I???m not wanting to hurt any of you guys.??? Officer Karla???s statement offers an alternate version of the same exchange: ???You all need to leave. I don???t want to kill you. I just want to kill her.??? As Whitney remembered, ???everyone in front of me left and ran out. Next thing I know, the police showed up, and he started walking around, and then I heard shot shot, and I heard him go down,??? she said. Whitney wasn???t sure whether James fired at the police. ???I was behind the bar, so I couldn???t see anything over there, and I wasn???t getting up. I didn???t look up until they said, ???He???s down. Is there anyone in here? Is there anyone in here???? And I rose my hand up. I said ???Help me, help.??????Officer Karla was on-scene and described what happened next. ???I contacted a female who???d been shot and was hiding behind the bar. The victim was seated on the floor with her back up against the wall of the bar,??? she wrote. Sometime as Karla was helping transport Whitney to the hospital, Whitney told the officer her baby was home alone. Officer Karla immediately advised radio and requested units respond. Officer Daniel???s report brings more details: ???I received information that before the shooting began the suspect yelled that he had ???killed the dog and the baby,?????? he wrote. Daniel and another officer arrived at James and Whitney???s place. ???As we walked up to the home we could see that one of the front windows was smashed out. We announced, ???Seattle Police!?????? When no one answered, ???we forced entry by kicking the door in. The home was in great disarray. Broken glass covered the floor and the flat-screen TV above the fireplace was smashed. Marijuana plants were strewn about and food littered the kitchen floor.??? The second officer located a Smith and Wesson 9MM gun case, which was empty, blue, and labeled with James???s name. As Officer Daniel noted, ???clothes and blankets were piled high on a bed in the back bedroom. Lying on top of the blankets was a small infant. The infant was soaked in urine but was otherwise unhurt.???Let???s go back to Whitney???s hospital room. When Officer Karla finished her interview, she gave Whitney a business card and case number. Then ???I asked [Whitney] for an alternate phone number since her purse and cellphone were at the scene. She informed me she did not have one,??? wrote Karla in the closing paragraph. ???When I asked for an alternate address that she will be staying at, she informed me she did not know where she would end up.???Oh, boy. So, right off the bat: I???m sorry about this. If I could go back in time 59 days and say, Peter, don???t begin your Kickstarter tod",100
63,"ay, I would. But I had no idea that my campaign would end on a day of national tragedy. Of course, if I had access to a time machine, I???d also go back 24 hours and warn everyone in Sunny Valley, Kansas. (#PrayForSunnyValley). But, I can???t do that either. So, I???m asking you to please consider giving any amount that you can to the Kickstarter to fund my animated short Fart Toads.We???re 90% of the way there. I mean, it???s not just me that???s in on this, if you think that???s the case. Bob, Teena, and Raul are helping to bring Fart Toads to life. I know all three of them have changed their profile pictures to those giant ???SV???s with black ribbons on them and I haven???t yet, but I promise I will, tomorrow. Right now, I have to keep it as Atlas, the main character of Fart Toads (the strongest toad), holding a massive burrito.I???m so close to making this happen. It???s just totally stalled since around 10:15 this morning, when CNN announced the Sunny Valley Mall was going into lockdown.See, the thing with Fart Toads is that at its core it???s a tale of acceptance and tolerance. A lot of people suffer from gastrointestinal issues. So, I???m adding another reward level of $40 today. Anyone that pledges $40 will get a Fart Toads decal for his or her car with Adonis (the vain toad) farting out ???coexist??? made out of all those different religious symbols. There isn???t an image of it yet, but I promise we???ll make it.I hope everyone is seeing this. I keep bumping my notices up on Facebook, but people changing their profile pictures are continuously pushing my posts down. Not to mention everyone that???s expressing their rage at the shooting, and our government???s inability to do anything about gun violence time and time again. And, yeah, all that sucks, it???s just that, last night when I went to bed, it looked like a sure thing that come September we???d be deep into animating the way Artemis (the girl toad) is able to gain super-jumps when she farts.Look, I started drawing Fart Toads when I was in seventh grade and I have eight hours left to get the word out to make it to my goal and??? Oh, no. Every major city is going to have a public moment of silence in three hours. Okay, that???s fine. Silence is good. You don???t have to speak to click on the ???Donate??? button. Hell, use your phone as a light instead of a candle for the prayer ceremony. I didn???t even mention the Fart Toads iPhone case is available as a premium for a $50 pledge!In six months, no one is going to remember that Fart Toads was fully funded on this terrible day. Hell, in six months people won???t even remember what day the ???Slaughter in Sunny Valley??? happened, but they will be looking forward to us posting our first episode on www.animatedfarttoads.com. That is, if we can raise another 10%. Have you looked at our teaser trailer lately? It???s gotten a lot of hits on YouTube ??? we just need to convert those views to investors!You might think I???m selfish, but I???m honestly only trying to think of the 3,583 people that have already donated. They all saw the animated gif of the evil Dr. Gusto Testinal in his Battle Armor shitting himself and thought this was a worthy investment; they???re all counting on you. That???s another 3,583 people that you???d be letting down on top of me if this doesn???t go through. That???s like, twenty times more people than were shot today! Oh god. I???m sorry. I???m sorry.

A three-year-old boy fell into a gorilla enclosure at the Cincinnati Zoo and a 17-year-old Western lowland gorilla named Harambe was shot and killed. Zoo officials claim Harambe was sniped like Kennedy in order to protect the boy, but many conspiracy theorists claim monkey business is afoot. So much monkey business that it???s gorilla business.Was Harambe???s murder warranted? Was he truly a threat to the child or did Harambe just want to form a gorilla-human friendship that would be so heartwarming that even the folks at Pixar would be like, ???Jeez, cut it out,??? before cashing their billion dollar weekly paychecks? What???s that three-year-old up to now? What will it be like when he finds out he basically killed a beloved gorilla? Probably bad, right? Glad I???m not that kid. Nobody???s gonna go to prom with a gorilla killer. Well, I did, but that was different. I was desperate.By examining the claims of conspiracy theorists, debunkers, and then rebunking with Harambe???s own thoughts by allowing him to use me as a writing vessel, we???ll see if we can???t get to the bottom of this sticky situation. Sticky like glue. Gorilla Glue. Only $5.47 a bottle at Home Depot.But forget Home Depot. Time to go to Harambe Depot. Where truth is always on sale and everyone gets shot.- -Conspiracy Claim: Harambe???s murder was brought about by a foreign government to stir up controversy during the already tumultuous 2016 Presidential Election. The foreign power, probably China or a country other than China, figured the death of a prized gorilla would lead to revolts and riots that would bring about the end of the United States.Debunking Claim: No. Harambe was put down to protect the safety of the young child that fell into the gorilla enclosure. That is all.Rebunking Claim: If you don???t think Harambe???s death was political, I???d like some of the drugs you???re taking. Actually, whatever your thoughts on Harambe???s death may be, I???d like some of your drugs. I run an understocked pharmacy. Regardless, it wasn???t a foreign power that brought about Harambe???s shooting. An American orchestrated the whole ordeal. An American who had the most to gain from glorifying a zookeeper???s rifle saving a child???s life: Donald Trump. The crack of that rifle stirred Americans??? belief in their Second Amendment rights and gave a surge of approval for the Republican Presidential candidate. Of course, Trump just had to take it one step farther???- -Conspiracy Claim: Harambe???s death was just a means for publicizing the struggling Cincinnati Zoo. The media storm surrounding the story has provided amazing advertising and brought the Zoo millions of dollars.Debunking Claim: No. The main focus of zoos is to take care of their animals and educate the public, not to make money. A zoo would never cause one of its animals harm to increase its income.Rebunking Claim: Harambe???s death was certainly a publicity move, but not for the ever-successful Cincinnati Zoo. Unbeknownst to most, Harambe was part of an ensemble cast for a new Harambe-based Baywatch reboot for NBC, Harambewatch. After middling reviews from test audiences, the network knew that unless they could stir up some buzz for show, it was doomed to suffer the same fate of the cancelled Seinfeld spinoff, Newman???s Own: Mailman Detective. After multiple failed attempts at killing David Hasselhoff, NBC determined killing a gorilla would be easier. So they hired a very talented three-year-old child actor to ???fall??? into the enclosure, and now have the publicity only killing a gorilla can get you. Check out Harambewatch on NBC every Thursday night at 9:00 PM EST/8:00 PM CST.- -Conspiracy Claim: The Biblical Book of Revelation details the end of the world involving seven spiritual figures. One of these is a ???dragon,??? a term used in Biblical times to describe various unknown creatures, the noble gorilla being one of them. Thus, Harambe is one of the seven spiritual figures spoken of in the Book of Revelation. The fact that H-A-R-A-M-B-E is also seven letters long proves that the Apocalypse is near.Debunking Claim: No. That is utter nonsense based on not a single fact other than Harambe???s name is seven letters long, which is inexplicably true.Rebunking Claim: The Book of Revelation is a Biblical red herring when dealing with Harambe. What one must realize is that HARAMBE is an anagram for ABREHAM, the true spelling of Abraham, the Biblical figure who was willing to sacrifice his son Isaac to show his faith in God. Harambe was Abraham reincarnated in gorilla form, proving that all-important people from the Bible come back in some form as a gorilla. Abraham was Harambe, Goliath was King Kong, and Jesus is Koko, the gorilla that uses sign language in order to make sure it doesn???t get crucified again.- -Conspiracy Claim: There never was a Harambe. The Cincinnati Zoo used the money they were supposed to buy a gorilla with to purchase a chocolate fountain for their employee ",100
65,"break room. The special branch of the IRS in charge of making sure zoos have all the animals they claim to have and don???t have any chocolate fountains they claim not to have was about to visit the zoo, so the whole ???Harambe got shot??? story was fabricated and ???witnesses??? and ???footage??? were manufactured.Debunking Claim: No. No zoo would go to those lengths just for a chocolate fountain. Two chocolate fountains, maybe.Rebunking Claim: Harambe was real. And he really was in the Cincinnati Zoo. He also really didn???t want to be in the Cincinnati Zoo. Not because he was locked in a zoo, because he was locked in a zoo in Cincinnati, Ohio, a city consistently ranked as the Most Least Ranked City in Ohio, the Most Least Ranked State in America. That???s why Harambe faked his own death: to get the hell out of Ohio. The small child and the zookeeper who fired the ???bullet??? were old pals of Harambe who wanted him to do what they never could, get out of the Buckeye State and make something of himself. So where did Harambe go? The place least like Ohio: the next state over, Pennsylvania. He???s in a zoo there under a fake name that has everyone fooled.- -Conspiracy Claim: Harambe didn???t actually die and will soon exact his revenge on the world that wanted him gone.Debunking Claim: No.Rebunking Claim: Yes.Shure SE215 Sound Isolating Earphones $100 (Shure.com)On the day we met, and a few times following, my guy yanked my ear buds out of my ear holes so he could tell me me to how beautiful I am.

We hope to catch a hawk with this glove and meat on a chain, so the bird can screech at me just as my love screeches at me.Margaritaville Tahiti Frozen Concoction Maker $499.99 (Target)If there???s one parrot-head I know, it???s my guy.

Making breakfast smoothies and juices in our pulverizing blender will remind me the fateful morning we met (I had a smoothie which he swatted out of my hand to get my attention). This is also another item that will make loud, screamy noises at me when words fail him.Plane Tickets for Our Honeymoon (Any airline, any amount, anywhere)The more he says it the more I find it to be true: My ass won???t quit and my legs go on for days. They are exhausted and totally deserve a vacation. Our honeymoon will be the perfect chance for my legs, butt, and the lower half of my body in general to get some R&R.Hi, Mike. I think you know why we???ve called you here to this conference room at the Holiday Inn Express. It???s because you have a problem, Mike. Also, they have a really great continental breakfast ??? scrambled eggs and everything.No, don???t speak yet; you???ll get your turn after we???ve said our piece. You can either accept the help we???re offering or you can walk away. It???s up to you. But look around, Mike. There are a lot of people here that love you like crazy, and they???re sick and tired of watching you continue down this path of destruction.You???re a Black man, Mike. I think you know that. And I think it???s time you realize that if you don???t stop being one, it???s going to get you killed.That???s right. We???re not going to let you live this way anymore. It???s too dangerous. Standing in front of stores while Black, walking in your own neighborhood while Black??? Hell, I???ve even seen you drive while Black, which, quite frankly, puts everyone else in the car in danger.Fine, go ahead, leave if you want. But first, take a good long look in the mirror. It???s 8 AM and you???re already Black. Doesn???t that scare you? It sure scares us. Kathy is gripping her purse so tightly I???m afraid she???ll hurt herself. That???s on you, Mike ??? that???s on you.Know this: If you don???t get the help you need, we aren???t going to be seen with you anymore. We???ve had enough. This hurts us just as much (if not more!) as it does you, Mike, but you???re putting us at too much of a risk. I mean, what if we???re hanging out, smoking weed or whatever ??? while you???re doing absolutely nothing illegal at all ??? and the police wind up arresting you instead? Or what if we???re walking down the street after pub quiz night and an officer drives up on the curb, wrestles you to the ground, and questions you because you vaguely match the description of a possible suspect for a crime that was committed miles away? You see how traumatizing that would be for us, don???t you, Mike? You see that, right?Our lives matter, Mike.Or say you???re pulled over on a routine traffic stop, and you reach for your wallet. Think about the police officer you might make shoot round after round of bullets at you. Do you really want to be responsible for his PTSD?His life matters, Mike.It???s clear you???re exhausted by this life you???re leading. I can see it in your face. Exhausted by the constant judgement. The constant fear. The constant persecution. So now ??? right now, Mike ??? is when you can make a choice.A van is waiting outside to take you to the airport.And we desperately hope you???ll accept this offer of help. Because maybe you don???t think you can kick this thing. Maybe you don???t think you???re worth it. But we think you are! Because all lives matter, Mike. All. Lives. Matter.  We have a wonderful treatment center set up for you in South Carolina. It???s called Kristopher Kares Kompletely. They think you can be great again. We think you can be great again.So what do you say, Mike? Will you get on the plane? Are you ready to have a life that matters?Physiological NeedsNYC apartment co-signed by parentsTinderJames Beard awarded brunch place in alley behind Brooklyn dumpsterfrayed iPhone chargerNetflix accountArtisanal butterSafety NeedsParent???s credit cardInstagram privacy settingsFarmer???s marketNut milk optionsWorking from homeArtisanal fire woodLove and BelongingSnapchat storiesMore nut milkKale smoothiesThe Bachelorette/Game of ThronesClever hashtag w/ duck faceEsteem NeedsVocal about politics/allergic to ",100

That???s time we could have spent doing other things that need work on the farm, such as updating our website, developing new apps, pitching to venture capitalists???oh, I guess I should explain: we???ve taken over this farm to incubate a tech startup, and the farmers left a horse here that, as part of the lease, we???re legally required to take care of. We thought it would be cool at first, but it actually sucks???his food and water need to be constantly replenished, and when we don???t pay attention to him we feel guilty that we???re neglecting him. Anyway, like I said, don???t shut the barn door, it just creates more work for us when we???re already overburdened.Go ahead and choose whichever bed you want ??? Edwin needs to sleep in this adult-sized baby swing we had constructed for him. Just keep it on the lowest setting playing ???Hush little baby, don???t say a word?????? on repeat throughout the night. The timer runs out every 60 minutes so you???ll need to wake up every hour to press the button. Or maybe you could modify it to go all night ??? you???re an Engineering major, right?Also, we are very concerned about plagiocephaly, so make sure he has a soft pillow and re-position his head from one side to the other every two hours throughout the night. And if he is really having trouble settling down you might need to wrap him tightly in a swaddle and give him his binky. Just be sure his arms are swaddled too ??? leaving them out only wakes him! If that doesn???t work, a shot of J??ger might do the trick.Edwin is very particular about his food. We???ve tried a lot of different things to break him out of his picky eating habits, and found what works bests is if each of his meals are constructed from edible items shaped into famous world monuments (for example, an Eiffel Tower made from bacon). I???m guessing this won???t be hard for you ??? an architecture class or two is always part of the core curriculum, right? If he seems uninterested in eating your food creation, try making up a different name for it: ???Edwin, don???t you want some of this tasty meat tower???? Or you can just airplane zoom it into his mouth. Also, it???s essential that you make sure there isn???t any sauce touching the monument when you serve it.He is really doing pretty good with the potty, but be sure to always ask him if he has to go before you go out, especially if you are leaving a kegger or something. I put his little Elmo potty next to his shower caddy in the shared bathroom down the hall. If he doesn???t want to go, you can always bribe him with brownies. There are probably some special brownies college kids like these days, right? Or maybe you can try out the latest behavioral research from your psychology classes on him. To be honest with you, we are kind of out of ideas.I see that you are starting to look a little concerned now, but it really shouldn???t be hard to be his roommate. He is also lots of fun! He likes doing things like building pillow forts and method acting the role of a puppy. Which reminds me, leaving a bowl of food inside a pillow fort might be another good way to get him to eat his dinner.Well I think that???s it ??? if you have other questions you should be able to reach us at our hotel in Switzerland. We plan to sleep 12-15 hours a day and spend the rest of the time going to movies in the theater and eating at restaurants that don???t have slides inside them. But we will turn our cell phone on from time to time. Have a great semester!""Researching this series has led to many disconcerting discoveries ??? that the firearms industry sells ammunition branded for ???the Zombie apocalypse???; that the best-known identity theft company in the country isn???t accredited by the Better Business Bureau ??? really, it pains me to think what I???ve had to leave out of these columns. There is so much more I???d like to share, if only to confirm that I???m not hallucinating.Earlier this year, while I was engrossed in a semi-formal study of ???self-defense??? books like War Machine: How to Transform Yourself Into A Vicious And Deadly Street Fighter and Unleash Hell: A Step-by-Step Guide to Devastating Widow Maker Combinations, I stumbled upon an endorsement by conservative radio host and self-proclaimed crazy person Glenn Beck, for a personal protection method called ???Target Focus Training??? Target Focus Training, according to its founder Tim Larkin, is ???the only program in existence that  covers the entire self-protection spectrum. . . including knowing how to kill your attacker.???Now, some of the sectors of Fear, Inc. I???ve explored in these columns were new to me, but self-defense training is squarely in my wheelhouse. So I can say with some confidence that Target Focus Training, far from being unique, is no different from the War Machine method, or the Widow Maker technique, or any of a hundred other histrionic approaches to self-defense being hawked online. Its appeal rests on the premise that we live in the most perilous of environments, and that instant, violent action is a perfectly appropriate way to address everyday safety challenges. ???How do you handle that angry kid who suddenly sticks a knife to your throat while at a concert with your wife???? Larkin asks. ???What???s your response to the cold steel of a gun barrel buried into your skull when it???s late at night and you???re standing in a dark parking lot fumbling for your car keys????Though Larkin sounds a bit like a troop leader quizzing Boy Scouts ahead of their survival merit badge test, the violence he describes is not, in fact, something we all must Be Prepared for. It???s pretty uncommon, and the FBI says it???s growing rarer every year. Glenn Beck, however, believes heart and soul in the mounting dangers of modern life. In his pitch for Target Focus Training, he explains how ???a horrifying evening??? in New York City???s Bryant Park awakened him to the dystopia we inhabit, and showed him the necessity of Target Focus Training???s approach. ???We all must accept that today it???s not enough to just survive,??? he intones. ???We must be committed to WIN??? against even the most vicious predator imaginable.???I know what you???re thinking: What the hell is going on in Bryant Park these days? Free movies, that???s what. A few summers ago, Beck took his family to see The 39 Steps and someone spilled a glass of wine on his wife. According to Beck, this amounted to a near-death experience at the hands of an angry mob, a mob he would have confronted at gunpoint had he been allowed to carry a firearm in Bryant Park. In his Target Force Training endorsement, Beck describes park patrons snapping photos of him as a threat on par with ???the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt.??? He gibbers about ???the physical and emotional repercussions of some deranged thug???s fantasy joy-ride.??? He asks, ???Are YOU prepared to handle an unavoidable life-or-death threat????To Beck???s credit, there aren???t many people who would so willingly, publicly piss their pants in order to earn a few bucks. But Be",100
67,"ck???s really good at this crybaby hustle. He???s a pro at weeping. He???s an old hand at Doomsday predictions. He has a flair for bad math. Beck is so good at selling fear that he???s laid up earthly riches worth somewhere around $90 million; peddling Target Focus Training videos is a walk in the park for him ??? a hysterical, panic-filled, wine-drenched walk.Glenn Beck is a perfect example of what the Apostle Paul warned us about.I began this series with a quote from Paul???s second letter to Timothy: For God hath not given us a spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind. It???s a reminder, as I said in that first column, that fear is foreign to our nature; that we have a right, even an obligation, to reject it.As a temporary emotional state, fear has its uses. But as a constant mindset, as an emotional home, fear is inimical to the human spirit. Fear is a dark room we can go into when we need to block out, briefly, our higher cognitive functions, like reason and curiosity, so they don???t interfere with our immediate need for survival. Fear heightens our animal senses and quickens our reactions. It reduces distraction. It provides a sometimes welcome moral blindness: under its cover of darkness, we can commit atrocious acts and not feel ashamed.The risk is this: If we spend all our lives in a dark room, we lose our sight.I???m usually the last person to spout Bible quotes. Still, I want to end this series with another of Paul???s admonitions to Timothy, this one from his first pastoral letter. It???s a quote many people are familiar with: For the love of money is the root of all evil, and some people in their desire for it have strayed from the faith and have pierced themselves with many sorrows.Some of the tycoons of Fear, Inc. may honestly believe that what they???re selling keeps people safer. But my forays into each sector of the marketplace of fear have consistently uncovered bad faith ??? claims that ignore or run counter to fact; unapologetic appeals to racism and sexism; casual assumptions about the virtue and utility of violence. These are excellent strategies if you love money and lack scruples. They work. To paraphrase the science fiction writer Frank Herbert, fear is the wallet-emptier. The American security industry ??? manufacturers and vendors, service providers, dealers, distributors, installers, and others ??? is a $350 billion market.But the rest of us, far from being enriched by the propaganda of Fear, Inc., are devastated by its effects; pierced with many sorrows. It???s not just the money we waste on products that don???t work or aren???t needed. It???s the 30,000 firearms deaths occurring annually. The 400,000 non-criminal immigrants detained by our government each year, at a cost of $2 billion. The ???Stand Your Ground??? laws that legalize murder, and the biased juries endorsing racially motivated violence. It???s the continual, hypnotizing message that all of this is normal and we just have to accept it.This is not the way things should be in the home of the brave. And it???s a sad and shameful testament to the truth of Saint Paul???s words: This is not what humans were created to bring about. To put it in words other than Paul???s: folks, this is bullshit. We can do better. It???s hard to see how we could do worse.In the first column of this series, I posed the question, ???How much would you pay to feel truly safe???? As we???ve seen, Americans pay a great deal to capture the illusion of safety; we have, in fact, surrendered our birthright. But we can reclaim it. We???re still entitled to a spirit of power, love, and a sound mind. Here are a few ways we can recover that spirit, and stop supporting the merchants of fear:1.	Follow the money. Always. Every time safety is raised as a justification for a law, a policy, or a purchase, ask, ???Who benefits from this???? Don???t stop with the superficial answers. Very little gets done in America without a profit being generated for someone.2.	Don???t take advice from people who invoke fear and danger as reasons to do something you wouldn???t otherwise do. In the first place, if someone is truly scared, their advice is probably not well-considered. If they???re pretending to be scared in order to persuade you, they aren???t trustworthy. And if they feel the need to bring a gun to Bryant Park to watch a movie, they need qualified medical help.3.	Examine your own biases and hold yourself accountable for them. Who do you fear, really? What do they look like? Where do they live? How much of your fear is due to objective evidence and experience, as opposed to media hype? Bonus benefit: When you begin to detect your own bias, you???ll be surprised how obvious other people???s is too.4.	Be curious. Ask questions. Look stuff up. The customer reviews for a security service may paint a very different picture than the company???s ads do. That pepper spray might not work quite the way you thought it would. The jury selection process in your state may shock you. Explore reality first-hand, and you???ll be better able to tell when someone is simply fantasizing about violence.5.	Reconcile with the concept of risk. It???s a normal part of life. Sometimes, our choices about safety are driven by a desire not merely to avoid risk, but to avoid even thinking about it. We pay our money so we can pretend we take no chances. But invulnerability is a luxury money cannot buy. If anyone tells you otherwise, see Suggestion Number One, above.6.	Get mad. We???d be a much safer nation if we had better information about risks like gun violence, and if we required our elected representatives to pass laws that conform to the reality reflected in reliable research. We???re not stupid, but we???re being forced to live as if we are. That???s insulting and dangerous and it has to change.In a nation where unfettered capitalism is celebrated as the highest virtue (despite abundant evidence to the contrary), dismantling the fear economy won???t be easy. It requires renouncing our faith in easy answers. It will mean fighting against powerful moneyed interests. We will have to acknowledge the uncomfortable truth that we are all, to some extent, vulnerable.We can do all those things, if our spirit is willing.""Revitalizing Seaweed Cream, $47Locally sourced seaweed from the Gulf of Tonkin.

The apple tree was loaded with fresh fruit, so we picked plenty, and even have a few to take home. Our days were spent at the beach, evenings were spent in the sauna looking out at the sea and the full moon. I had a bit of insomnia, so the night descended on me like a sky full of angry ravens and specters full of fury. A black aurora borealis, the ghosts of ex friends, lovers, and drinking buddies, all screaming down from the inky abyss, a collective earthbound howl. The voices count off the years, demanding answers, presenting me with a full accounting of time, dead end self-involved precocious ambitions, things I thought I wanted and found out differently, and plans that never came to fruition. The moon became an interrogation light, blinding me on the patio of your fairytale cottage. A voice from behind the light demands I reconcile its ledgers of this life; square up the shortfalls, explain the overages. I run off of the patio and out to the apple tree between your Fairytale Cottage and Seaside Main House. The fucking apple tree. Where I stood only nine hours ago, picking fruit, making jokes, laughing, smiling. So normal did all of this seem, sweaters were worn, photographs taken with telephones and posted up into an ether of mostly strangers so that they might admire, and like, and approve. I stared at the photos too, convinced I look good on the surface, calm in the face of time and life doing what they do. Does the cottage, in fact, have a history rich with golden era Hollywood icons staying here while looking to escape the scandal and countless little deaths that came with celebrity and outsized success, even back then? Tonight, having headed down the slippery slope of comparing myself to the curated lives depicted in the guestbook entries of previous travelers, I envy anyone whose life was torn asunder, destroyed, and re-ordered by fame???s sweet venom and hurricane momentum. In the previous entry, just one week before my arrival, I see that Steven proposed to his girlfriend Melissa on the deck overlooking the bay. Congratulations to Steven ??? only God and the Devil know why I???ve struggled to accept all of the love that has come my way in this life. I see in an even more recent entry that just two days prior to my arrival, Mike and Stephanie from North Carolina sat at the very table I write at now, serene, having a glass of wine, and recalling their stay. I agree with Mike and Stephanie???s estimation that no other place on Earth is quite as magical as your little cottage here, but Mike and Stephanie need to learn that magic, like reality, has a light and dark side. What Mike and Stephanie don???t seem to understand that life is a cobra in a terrarium, cornered by invisible walls, confined by boundaries it cannot see. It is beautiful, but also savage by nature, impartial to what it strikes, fucks, eats, in order to carry forth with its biological imperative. I wonder if Mike and Stephanie have ever consider that. Maybe it is incumbent upon other guests to stay awake nights in your delightful cottage, trying to make sure the metaphorical cobra of life is warm. Maybe it???s up to an unfortunate few itinerant weirdos to feed the cobra of life, all the while hoping it does not strike at the wrist and paralyze the heart. My girlfriend is calling for me to return to bed now; a kind and comical small whisper of a whistle that she does, a playful pulling me back as the sun comes up now and ends what feels like my funeral, trial, and spectrum of maladies. In closing, we enjoyed riding the bikes to the farmer???s market on Saturday for fresh cinnamon buns, sitting in the sun, cooking on the outdoor grill, and sitting by the fire at night??? the dark, dark, night, in which so many questions seem to arise.Dan KennedyNew York, New YorkP.S.

Much of the cosmic year passes before we actually reach the formation of Earth and appearance of the oldest known rocks within the first cosmic week of September, or 4 billion years ago. In contrast, the earliest hominids (10-12 million years ago) did not appear until the early afternoon of December 31st. Domestication of fire (400,000 years ago) about 15 cosmic minutes ago, and all of modern civilization (within 500 years) is compressed within the last second.The Cosmic Calendar is a useful tool, because it is really, really difficult to comprehend what a billion years means. By looking at the calendar, we realize that from a chronological aspect, human civilization has been incredibly insignificant. Looking at it a different way, we see that we are here because a combination and sequence of physical, chemical, and biological changes has allowed for ???us??? to happen.Let???s look at early Earth, about 3.5 billion years ago. The atmosphere consisted mainly of carbon dioxide (CO2), ammonia (NH3), and methane (CH4), with just a trace amount of oxygen. A Google Image search of the phrase ???Early Earth??? shows artist renditions featuring plenty of volcanoes and lightning. This is no place for humans, much less plants, reptiles, fish, or the nuclear fallout-surviving cockroach.It is in this environment that the first biomolecules appeared. There are a few different theories as to what drove their formation (Lightning! Heat? meteorite impact??) but either way, the first, simple bacterial cells probably formed about this time.Now, one of the major themes in ecology is the ???ecological niche,??? which is defined as a specific, specialized role that an organism has in its habitat. No two species can occupy the same niche; one will almost always outcompete the other.As early Earth had abundant carbon dioxide, a life form appeared to occupy this niche, taking the abundant CO2 out of the air, and converting it to sugar and free oxygen.Sound familiar? This is photosynthesis.These life forms, called cyanobacteria, or photosynthetic bacteria, were literal catalysts for atmospheric and oceanic change on Earth.1 The abundant amount of sunlight and carbon dioxide allowed for a massive increase and diversification of cyanobacteria, continuously taking up CO2, releasing oxygen, and being buried in sediment. At first, this increase in free oxygen had little effect on the composition of the atmosphere, due to the presence of compounds that can take up oxygen (oxygen sinks) such as hydrogen sulfide, or iron (converted to iron oxide). After about 1.5 billion years, these sinks began to fill up, resulting in the increasing accumulation of free oxygen in the atmosphere.2This massive change in the composition of the atmosphere is known as the Great Oxygenation Event. It has also been called the Oxygen Catastrophe, Oxygen Crisis, even Oxygen Holocaust.If these names sound a bit dramatic, it???s because it was an extremely dramatic event. As humans, we see the Oxygenation Event as a positive thing, as it made possible the development of higher plants and animals. However, oxygen was highly toxic to the abundant anaerobic bacteria living at this time, causing a massive die-off and retreat to oxygen-poor environments.There was another consequence of the ???rapid??? (remember, we are still on the scale of millions of years) and overwhelming change of the composition of Earth???s atmosphere. It is well-known that CO2 and methane traps sunlight in the atmosphere to maintain a warm temperature, much like a greenhouse. Removal of carbon dioxide and oxidation of methane from the atmosphere took away the greenhouse effect, which resulted in a massive drop in temperature around 2.3 billion years ago, ushering in a complete snowball Earth-type ice age that lasted for several million years.Whoops. The exact dates and duration of these events is disputed,2 for example, opinions differ on the rates and oxygen concentrations, the major driving forces that resulted in the saturation of oxygen sinks, and the number of Snowball Earth events that occurred.There are a few takeaways here.1)	We commonly hear the phrase ???Greenhouse Effect??? in a negative connotation. We do need some greenhouse gases to trap enough heat in the atmosphere so that Earth does not freeze over. But, please note that by the time humans came around, we likely had a sufficient greenhouse effect for our survival, so please do not use this as an argument for burning more fossil fuels.2)	The molecules that make up terrafirma, the ocean, and atmosphere are continuously interacting and reacting with one another. The fact that a buildup of free oxygen in the atmosphere caused a domino effect that resulted in Earth being a snowball for millions of years has suggested that we not underestimate the effect of even a small change in atmospheric composition. No matter what your elected officials tell you, CO2 is not just a ???harmless plant food.???33)	If we look at the current state of affairs,  we are literally reversing the Great Oxygenation Event. By burning fossil fuels, we are taking carbon from the ground, and releasing massive amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. While some greenhouse effect is necessary, too much is what is causing the rising global temperatures that are wreaking havoc on our polar ice caps, and this leads to many, many things which threaten our livelihoods.I still maintain that the rise of cyanobacteria and the resulting changes that occurred were a good thing, since the most recent result was the development of human civilization. On the other hand, the Great Oxygenation Event did cause a mass extinction, killing off multitudes of critters that could not tolerate oxygen.Mass extinctions are a common, regular occurrence throughout Earth???s history. The GOE was probably the earliest known mass extinction. There was a particularly devastating extinction at the end of the Permian Era (252 million years ago), which was also called the Great Dying. By the start of the subsequent Triassic period, about 96% of sea critters had died out, along with 70% of terrestrial critters.4 Probably the most famous mass extinction occurred at the Triassic-Jurassic period, which we know as that time in which all the dinosaurs died.We are currently in another mass extinction, which is being ",100
70,"called the Holocene. There is overwhelming evidence that it is human-made, although for some reason politicians want to argue over that.A rather Circle-of-Life way of looking at Earth is the Gaia Hypothesis, which states that Earth is comprised of synergistic, self-regulating components that work as a whole to maintain life on the planet. It???s a pretty neat way of looking at things. Simply put, all of the organisms, whether it be plants, animals, microbes, and fungi require the action of each other for the maintenance of optimal conditions.Along these lines, there is a second hypothesis that takes into account all of these mass extinctions, called the Medea Hypothesis. Medea was a figure in Greek mythology who killed her own children to get back at her unfaithful husband. I???m not quite sure who is the unfaithful husband in this scenario, but the hypothesis states that Earth will every so often rid itself of higher forms of life, and return to a state where only single-celled organisms exist.5That brings us to our final takeaway:4)	 By figuring out what has happened in Earth???s history, particularly what has shaped the planet for colonization by humans, we can develop strategies to either maintain control of these optimal ???Earth??? conditions, or use this knowledge to Terraform (make Earth-like) other planets. We will need this knowledge if in case we do end up mucking up Earth for human survival, or, that one day about 5 billion years down the road in which the sun will burn out, swell up, and engulf Mercury, Venus, and Earth. Mars will probably get away, the lucky bastard.On a last note, the answer to removal of excess CO2 and methane is not to introduce massive quantities of cyanobacteria into the environment. Cyanobacteria are quite toxic, and tend to spoil important ecosystems. 6 Don???t do that.- -1  Water: The Vital Fluid"""":http://eesc.columbia.edu/courses/ees/lithosphere/hays_tutorial_3/atm.htm2 Holland, HD. 2006.

I would rather take my car to the dealership and buy the dealer-specific replacement rear wiper blade that I have been putting off buying for approximately 18 months, even though the blade that is currently on my car is dull and useless and hanging onto the mechanism by one lone corner while the rest of it flails against the window. I would rather try to buy coffee at the campus coffee shop at 9 AM on the first day of classes. Rather than write the Syllabus for your class, I would go through all the boxes in my basement that are still unopened from when we moved in three years ago and sort their contents into piles of keep and donate and sell and then organize a yard sale for my entire block.I would rather spend all morning talking to a salesman named Chris or Joe or John about upgrading my smartphone and new contract options and service plans and how my monthly bill will now cost as much as a car payment.I would rather sit through 15 hours of returning faculty orientation. And take notes.I would rather schedule an appointment to speak with my department???s assigned contact in Human Resources about the changes in benefits to my University-sponsored health insurance plan and the sudden need for additional documentation to prove that my dependents are really my dependents when my only dependent is the child whose birth was paid for by said University???s benefits plan in the first place.I would rather go shopping for jeans or foundational undergarments or practical-yet-cute footwear than write this damn Syllabus because I do not know what I will want you to read on November 22.By November 22, we will be wearing sweaters and scarves and jackets and possibly those fingerless gloves that famous authors who wrote in unheated garrets wore, except for all the women on campus, who will instead be dressed like Han Solo in their vests and their knee high leather boots pulled over their very tight pants, and all of the corporate coffee shops will be transitioning their seasonal menus from Pumpkin Spice Everything to Peppermint Everything, which will only add to the buzz of stress and excitement surrounding the quickening approach of the semester???s end. I have no idea what I will want you to read while you sit there in my class on November 22 wearing your boots and jeans and sipping your PSL because it is August and I am wearing flip flops and a sundress and sipping a Hemingway daiquiri and even if I did feel like assigning something for you to read, it would probably be the recipe section of Coastal Living or the latest edition of People magazine or maybe even that new Harry Potter book that J.K. Rowling said she would never write but did anyway because IT???S STILL SUMMER AND THAT???S THE KIND OF SHIT YOU READ IN SUMMER.Asking me to generate a lesson plan for November 22 when it???s August is like asking me to plan a dinner menu three months ahead of time, which you might do for, say, a wedding, but I am not getting married on November 22. I have been married for over a decade and even then I did not plan a dinner menu because we eloped, unless you count ordering entirely too many celebratory margaritas at the Tex Mex place we went to afterwards as planning, and anyway no one is planning anything for November 22, celebratory or otherwise, because it is a Tuesday. A Tuesday! How can anyone expect anyone to plan anything for a Tuesday three months from now? What if I planned to have steak for dinner but instead felt like Chinese takeout? Or pizza? Or blowing off dinner altogether in favor of going to the early movie and just eating my way through an entire tub of popcorn, because god knows we all do that from time to time, especially in October, when we are barely halfway through the semester and Christmas is everywhere even though Halloween hasn???t yet happened, or in November, when we have been driven to desperation by the incessant onslaught of Pumpkin Spice Everything and women dressing like Han Solo?What if I am a vegetarian three months from now?What if you are a vegetarian three months from now?What if your entire class has become vegetarian and on November 22, I have assigned an essay about searching for the best cabrito in Mexico when in reality, a better choice for my audience would probably be pretty much any recipe ever off the Thug Kitchen website? And what if I change the reading to ???accommodate the needs of the class,??? as my Syllabus says, because ???the professor reserves the right to make changes to this document???? Isn???t that just false advertising? Won???t such a sudden, dramatic shift in curriculum planning frustrate the Han Solo pants off that one student who always follows the schedule???the one who has diligently copied ",100
71,"every date into her perfectly maintained planner? The one who is visibly stressing about the seasonal transition to Peppermint?I don???t want to be responsible for inflicting that level of instability on her life. On your life. On anyone???s life.I don???t want to make promises I can???t keep.I hear that Juneau is lovely this time of year. If I???m going to make that ride, though, I really should get that dealer-specific replacement rear wiper blade. And upgrade my smartphone.1. Cut off the bottom of an empty, clean sunscreen bottle.

To assist you in becoming acclimated to the subtleties of submarine life, you are assigned a more senior submarine-qualified sailor, forever referred to as your Sea Daddy. The Sea Daddy???s job is to make sure you???re where you???re supposed to be, when you???re supposed to be there. He makes sure you pack enough skivvies for your first underway. He ensures you know how to flush the toilet, smash trash, fight fires, and stop flooding. And, if he???s doing it right, he makes sure you don???t embarrass him when you???re finally ready for your submarine qualification board test.Upon successful completion of your qualification board, you earn your Submarine Warfare insignia ??? commonly known as dolphins ??? which are pinned to your chest by the Skipper. After a day or so of qualified shipmates checking to make your dolphins are on straight, your Sea Daddy presents you with a small chain lanyard with a metal piece at the end. This is an emergency air breathing (EAB) manifold dust cover.The dust cover is a fitting that can be found on several stored-air manifolds located throughout the submarine. If there???s an accident requiring the crew to breathe stored air, sailors don special EAB masks, remove the dust cover from the nearest manifold, and then plug the mask???s attached hose into the manifold. When (and sometimes if) your Sea Daddy presents you with a ???spare??? dust cover, it signifies that you are no longer a NUB.My Sea Daddy presented this one to me on May 3, 1988. Today, after 20 years of active duty and over 30 involved with submarines, there???s still no forgetting that first boat. I keep the dust cover with me as a reminder of those early years, and a signifier to those who recognize it that they???re dealing with a proud bubblehead. From the relationships formed to the personality of the boat itself, shipmates will agree ??? that first one is special.I???ve done a lot of soul searching in the past few weeks. Like many Americans, the upcoming election has forced me to deeply examine my own opinions about the future of our country. That is why, after careful consideration, I have decided that I cannot in good conscience vote for any candidate who shares my beliefs.In turbulent times such as these, it???s more important than ever to elect politicians who can make the right decisions for the future of this country. I have come to believe that any candidate who agrees with someone like me on a majority of the important issues facing our country is unqualified to do so.Foreign policy, the economy, climate change???any politician who is as uninformed and misguided as I am about these issues has no business occupying our nation???s highest office. Our country deserves better than someone who shares my garbage beliefs.Even if a politician disagrees with me on 90% of the issues, it may not be enough. Even one of my dangerous, shortsighted, truly awful ideas could be catastrophic if enacted as policy on a national level. The stakes are simply too high for anyone in a position of power to agree with me.I???m willing to hold out hope that at some point in the next few months, a candidate will emerge who has the vision and wisdom necessary to ignore everything I say we should do. But if we can somehow find someone who fundamentally disagrees with me about the state of our country and what should be done about it, then, and only then, can I feel confident that we have found someone capable of running our country.Which liberal arts degree are you throwing out?What job did that very bright Lizzie Weinhardt have lined up by January of senior year?What is the title of the last New York Times ???Careers??? article I texted, emailed, and called you about?What is the date of the last time you tried to get away with using my Amazon Prime two-day free shipping?What is the form of manual labor your immigrant grandfather toiled in to afford you the kind of opportunities you are squandering?What was the date on which you placed three separate Seamless orders, which I know about because your bank statements are still mailed to me?What is the discipline of graduate school I continually recommend as my eleventh-hour reckoning with your nearly two decades of now underutilized education?What was your critical reading score on the SATs and why did I let that indicate to me you would make better choices?Read Part 1- -By the time I was ten I had grown into an overweight, quivering mass of protoplasmic fear. In the real world, that unrelieved terror had been triggered by a report on the six o???clock news about an unsuspecting pedestrian, jaunty-jollying his way through the streets of Goyville, who had been conked on the noggin and killed by the calved cornice of a decaying skyscraper.Perhaps if my name had been Rusty and not Rob-it, and I had possessed the po-mo superpower to hurl myself into my DuMont console and insinuate myself into the nest of one of the typical, two-dimensional Amurrican families that resided there, and had been able to engage the best-knowing father in a Socratic dialogue on the nature of chance, fate, and luck, then perhaps I might have learned that no matter what you do, say, or believe, there would come a time when, through no fault of your own, you???d find yourself in the wrong place at the wrongest of times and suffer death by falling debris. But I didn???t and therefore couldn???t. The religious indoctrination that I had been subjected to since a peanut in utero was still firmly anchored in the bedrock of my brain: I had no doubt that this anonymous dead guy had done something really bad, something that???in the eyes of the angry, jealous volcano deity my forebears had drafted to be the one and only???warranted death by crumbling concrete.This was a bell that tolled for me, one that could not be unrung, clang, clang, clang.It should come as no surprise that from then on, anytime I worked up the courage to take a weekend walkabout through the deserted canyons of midtown, I did so knowing  that it was only a matter of time, and perhaps the breaking of a few",100
72," additional thou-shalt-nots, before a moldering piece of architecture would loose itself from the decaying corner of a high-rise and, laser-guided by Himself on high, come crashing down on my wretched melon???a deific nullification.??????At a certain point the sheer terror of being outside became unbearable and so, after a spirited back-and-forth between me and myself, we concluded that the best strategy to keep me breathing despite falling skies was to hide myself behind the double-locked door of Fortress Schneider. I was wrong. Fear and Trembling found easy entry into my keep; F & T simply beamed themselves in through the cathode ray tube. By the simple act of turning on the TV, I had become the agent of my own undoing.They set me up by infesting my mind with a swarm of colossal-insect flicks. Giant ants (Them), their mandibles dripping with deadly formic acid, roamed the sewers of Los Angeles; giant locusts portended the Beginning of the End as they crawled up the skyscrapers of Chicago, while their lethal enemy (and our potential instrument of annihilation), The Deadly Mantis, stood momentarily triumphant atop the Washington Monument before meeting its end in Hollywoodland???s fictive Manhattan Tunnel; an outsized African wasp-beetle became the Monster from Green Hell; and hideous insects from outer space were grandiosely dubbed Cosmic Monsters, as if they were sci-fi objective correlatives (or the band name) of Jehovah and His Archangels. The Black Scorpion menaced Mexico; a titanic Tarantula locomoted through the Sonoran desert; a jumbo SFX spider threatened The Incredible Shrinking Man, who battled it to the death using a sewing needle as his spear.But these B-movie body blows to kishka and breadbasket were mere prelude. The main feature in F & T???s double bill of dread, the haymaker that landed squarely al punto de mi mandibula,1  was a Sherlock Holmes mystery flicker, Spider Woman, which I arrogantly sat down to watch because, I assumed, it would be a goofy, time-killing Brit procedural. It quickly devolved into an experiment in terror I couldn???t tear my eyes from.The movie begins with a string of suicides, pyjamaed men defenestrating willy-nilly, prompting Holmes to fake suicide in order to go undercover???as a dusky-skinned ??migr?? from the Raj, fallen on hard times???in order to catch the band of cutthroats only he knows is behind what only he knows to be murders, a gang led by a female Moriarty, the flick???s  eponymous Spider Woman (Gale Sondegaard), who seeks out guys short on bread and long on bills, convinces them to pawn their life insurance policies for a bowl of porridge, then dispatches a trusted pygmy to sneak a venomous spider, the Lycosa carnivora,2  into the fool???s bed, where it bites the mark, causing him such great pain that he can do naught but Geronimo himself through the nearest window. If this large octoped were not enough to leave me with a lifelong case of the creepy-crawly heebie-jeebies, what followed most certainly was. Holmes seeks out the counsel of a noted entomologist, but the Spider Woman has had an underling grease the arachno-expert and take his place so???s he can snuff Holmes and Watson too. Holmes picks the wannabe assassin???s pocket, lifts his gun, hands it to Watson; the confused weasel wants to know how he was made, and Holmes obliges in an ostentatious soliloquy of deduction:3 You called these glass cases cages; any scientist would call them terrariums. You said the poison of the Lycosa carnivora was valuable to doctors; any scientist would say the virus is valuable to toxicologists. You said you were told that black widows eat their mates; any scientist would know it. Watson is so entranced by Holmes???s spot-on, Aspergian powers of reason, he loses his mind for what he is doing; the hitman knocks the gun out of Doc W???s hand, smashes one of the terrariums, and makes good his getaway. Out of the shards of glass comes an efflux of teensy spiders scrabbling across the floor and all over the gun; as Watson is about to pick the pistol up, Holmes warns him off with the big voice: Look out, Watson, those insects are deadly!I now knew with unsettling certainty that even the smallest of eight-legged creatures was capable of sending me on the long goodbye. And they could be anywhere. A clutter of deadly arachnids might be lying in wait in webs woven behind my toilet so that they might bite me on the butt when next I sat down to attempt peristaltic eviction of the shit squatting painfully in my lower intestine; they could be catching zzz???s in my sultry, smelly, orthopedic shoes, nesting inside my feathery pillow, or taking up residence in the crotch of one of my scratchy woolen sabbath-go-to-meeting suits. In light of this imagined octopoidal swarm, I realized I had to be on high alert both inside and out of mi casa.For a short time I chased the chimera of parental protection from both hella lethal flora and fauna of the natural world and death from above the urban environment. But that spring, on the first night of Passover, the delusive hope of safety within the nest was shattered.The gansa mishpuchah was expected, to partake in both a group ponderation on the question Why is this night different from all other nights? and an unleavened grande bouffe. The long aluminum table was set, the food was on the fire, the Manischevitz Malaga4  ready to be poured. The doorbell would ring at any moment, so what could be more appropriate in advance of an influx of family than to watch Invaders from Mars on the The Early Show?Young David wakes up in the middle of the night in time to see a spaceship burrow beneath the ground in his spooky backyard. Hysteria rockets him into Mom and Dad???s room. He reports, they patronize, he???s sent back to bed. Curious, Dad reconnoiters; the earth swallows him up. Morning, no Pops in sight, Mom calls the cops. Dad returns???disheveled, snarly, dressed in black. David remarks on the pin sticking out of Pop???s neck; a smacking and grounding follow. Alone in his room, our hero watches the earth open and swallow little Kathy Wilson, so he goes to the cops, only the Chief of Police sports the same staple as Dad. David, now in a cell, is visited by a hotsy-totsy internist. She doesn???t know what to make of David???s story until she meets his womb,5 who???s radiating subzero severity. David???s definitely not making shit up. A working hypothesis takes shape???the Martians, feeling threatened by the space gun David???s dad has been working on (the utility of which presaged Ray-Gun???s Star Wars defense fantasy), have come to Earth to destroy it. Bodies start dropping: the pin in the back of the head can be remotely detonated to cause a fatal cerebral hemorrhage. Beneath the earth David leads a host into battle. Through a maze of alien-made tunnels, they square off against a horde of galumphing gorks telepathically commanded from a glass-enclosed macrocephalic bronze brain sporting a pair of fiercely bloodshot eyes and several sets of T Rex-like atrophied arms???a stoned, alien-invader avatar of the Hindu god Krishna. After he saves the world, David wakes up, checks in with the folks, and, assured that the whole adventure was naught but a nightmare, heads back to his room, where, in a Mobius-strip climax intended to leave the tykes in the audience in a loopy state of anticipatory dread, he sees through his window a flying saucer burrowing its way into the sand pit behind his house.Mission accomplished.As the credits rolled, the buzzer began to ring. Aunts, uncles, cousins started trooping in. As soon as I saw the rheumy, hive-mind stare aimed my way, I knew the answer to that first of the four q",100
73,"uestions. Why was this night was going to be different from all others?  Because on this night the whole sick crew had been stapled and enthralled, and I was alone, and doomed.??????Yet life went on. Clearly, my spellbound parentals were playing the long game. In mid-June, when I had almost forgotten what grave peril I was in, they snipped the gossamer string to my personal Sword of Damocles and dropped it on my conk (cascading concrete of the mind). They sentenced me to three weeks in ortho-sleepaway camp, in the woods, in Jersey!The camp was made up of twelve outsized wooden shacks forming a U, framing a quad of mangy grass???a mess hall, an admin building, a rec room/theater that doubled as a house of prayer, and eight dorms, two for each age group, two troops (as they were dubbed) to each bungalow, a counselor (to be addressed as Uncle) for each troop. The twelfth structure was the shower shack, to which every Thursday, smelling like ass after a week of poor personal hygiene and plenty of shvitzing in the blazing Jersey sun, we would be marched to be hosed down.Once we were herded off the buses, the selection was made, first by age, then by size. We were marched to our gulags and given bunk assignments. My prize for being the tallest, huskiest dork was the last bed, the one with closest proximity to a parliament of pissoirs, a shrewdness of shit stalls, a watch of wash basins, clocal hell; to make matters worse, my cubbyhole was affixed to the partition wall between us and the excretorium, the stink from which wafted through the wall, into my cubby, and settled there, the noxious vapors leaving a subtle, shit-ammoniac scent on all that I had crammed into it.After settling in, we went to dinner???a kosher meat and three (starches), intestinal spackle to further clog sluggish entrails. Then it was back to the bunk for the alpha boychik ritual establishing-of-the-pecking-order, a lost cause for me because the moment I???d dreaded since first I heard my parents pronounce sentence was now at hand???the nighttime toilette. I now had to don my external, must-be-worn-whilst-in-the-arms-of-Morpheus, orthodontic headgear???a banded elastic chapeau, a cross between a helmet liner and a jockstrap, with a chromium face bow that threaded through elongated eyelets on my braces, nightly joined to my dontic truss by means of rubber bands.I put it on and was mortified, both because I was self-conscious enough to know how ridiculous I looked and because my empathy-free peers reacted with waves of laughter and a surge of cruel tauntation. All that laughing was clearly muy sedating, as shortly, guffaws gave way to peaceful breathing as all the boys departed for Slumberland.All, that is, but me, for whom rapturous sleep was not a viable form of escape. My insomnia was overdetermined: my stomach ached because dinner was stuck somewhere between duodenum and jejunum; the humiliation I had just experienced from morphing into The Hapless Helmet-Monster from Orthodontia Hell was washing over me in waves of almost unbearable angst; a scourge of mosquitos was buzzing round my ear, drilling for my blood; and, if that weren???t enough, I anticipated an attack of tiny yet deadly arachnids the moment I dozed off.Rosy-fingered dawn at last clawed its way through the grime-caked screens, followed in rapid succession by reveille (this was the height of the Cold War and we were all programmed to keep watching the skies), breakfast, and our first contact with the pool. After being warned not to swim within an hour of eating (we had just had breakfast!), and to buddy up so that even if we do cramp, maybe we won???t drown, the Uncle in Chief let it be known that pissing in the pool would not be tolerated and that the pool had been treated with a chemical that, when it came in contact with the skin of a little pischer perp, would cause said skin to break out in a deep-red rash???the scarlet letter P.Since poor impulse control was yet another of my characterological deficits, I immediately drained my bladder into the pool.That night dread floated over me???just as the special effects Angel of Death in The Ten Commandments floated over biblical Cairo on his way to plague the Egyptians??? firstborn???as I anticipated the rash expos?? that would pin me for the little pisspot that I was.The rash never appeared.We had been lied to. I applied my considerable Talmudic candlepower to this observation and quickly understood that the lie was intended to scare us, frightened kids being much easier to control than carefree ones. A further splitting of hairs made me sure of something I had long suspected: adults were neither reliable nor trustworthy and the only person I could truly count on to figure shit out was me. The dawning of this new, unsettling normal sent my world spinning off its axis like an entropic top wobbling to a sad, sad stasis.And in this way three weeks passed with stuperous Rob-it in a metaphysical tailspin, eating crap, barely crapping, sleeping just about not at all.??????On my the ride home from Camp Gehenna I dream-listened as a couple of alpha boys dissertated about the lore and ordnance of juvenile delinquents. One fascinating reveal was that the two-word initialism DTK LAMF, graffiti???d on what seemed like every poster in the subway, stood for down to kill, like a motherfucker, while other factoids, further advancing my budding worldview that life kills, concerned the tools used by these MFs when they got DTK. Push-button knives were as ubiquitous as they were illegal, and gravity knives were only proscribed if the length of the blade was longer than the distance from pinkie to index finger, the urban-legendary four-finger rule; deadly, jury-rigged zip guns were being assembled in machine shops in high schools throughout the city, and were responsible for hundreds of deaths of kids just like me; most disturbing of all, every JD gang had as part of its arsenal homemade mortars fashioned out of tin cans, capped with magically fabricated silencers, their deadly projectiles made from four repurposed M-80s, the equivalent of a stick of dynamite.6All during the voyage through the dusky Lincoln Tunnel I imagined the day I might trespass on a spit of disputed territory and instigate a Turf warrior to respond without warning by firing a silent but deadly round of M-80-x-four my way via his homemade tube of death that had once been four or five cans of yummy Niblets innocence.Based on this reporting, which I had no reason to believe was mere confabulation, it seemed clear that anytime I might set foot out of doors, I would have to dodge a daily double of death: even if I miraculously managed to sidestep that chunk o??? rock racing toward me at 32 feet per second per second, it was unlikely I could also outrun a missile fired from a homemade mortar cooked up somewhere in the bowels of Hell???s Kitchen.This panic-driven pens??e led me to definitively conclude that no matter the indoor dangers posed by insect fauna and the father-mother, they were far more manageable than the threats to life and limb risked by an alfresco ramble.??????After three weeks of enforced interaction with camp???s cruel kids, being home alone was a paradise. I reveled in my solitude. I could eat food anytime, day or night, and follow it up with a leisurely, if irregular, crap, as long as I remembered to check behind and beneath the bowl to make certain no venomous arachnids were lurking about.On my third day home, bowing to parental pressure, I decided to wash off the dirt of the road. I drew a lukewarm bath and luxuriated in it, delighted to see my fart bubbles float to the surface to release an odor only I could love, whi",100
74,"le at the same time making waves that rocked my mighty navy, comprising a hair brush (my destroyer) and an empty can of talc (my aircraft carrier), until my fingers got pruney and the once-clear water grew turbid. Then I rose out of the tub roaring, Gojira emerging from Tokyo Bay.After toweling off, I unleashed a storm of Ammens Medicated Powder upon my person and, saving the best for last, gently blanketed my scrotum. That???s when I first felt it, a hard, small, scab-like something growing on my silky smooth nutsack.A chill ran up my spine.What the hell could that be?I lifted my leg, craned my head as if I were about to kiss my own ass, and saw a tiny, swollen creature, its head buried in my balls. I counted. It had eight legs. My stomach tightened. My scrotum shrank. I didn???t know what to do, who to turn to.Oh, yes I did. The Womb!Because the phones in the apartment above and the dry goods store below were extensions, the shtetl-family Schneider had their personal walkie-talkie system. If the parentals wanted to speak to me, they would bang the ceiling with a broom handle. If I needed to communicate with them, I would stomp on the floor.I ran to the phone, stomped hard as I could. The Womb picked up, annoyed.What, Rob-it? What do you want?Come up here. Right away. It???s an emergency.Rob-it, we???re busy.Come up here right now! I need help!I went back to the bathroom, sat on the toilet.I heard the downstairs door slam, heard footfalls on the treads, heard the front door open, heard her yell, Rob-it, where are you? even before she was through it.Bathroom, was all I could manage.She entered, eyes crossed with anxiety, looked at me; when she saw me still naked, she understood the seriousness of the sitch, started peppering me with questions.Why aren???t you dressed?What???s the matter with you?Why did you get me up here in the middle of the afternoon rush?I was too angst-ridden to answer.When I finally tried to talk, only a choked Mom-m-m squeaked out.Rob-it, tell me what???s the matter, right now!It was awkward, embarrassing, but it had to be done.I stood, cupped my privates in my hands, began bouncing from foot to foot, before finally blurting out: I was taking a bath and then, when I was drying myself off and putting powder on my??? I felt this thing???That???s all she needed to hear. She ripped my hands away from my nethers, grabbed my scrotum, inspected. I knew precisely when she saw it because she gave out a scream that could be heard across the river in Hoboken.I started crying. She vanished. Before I could even begin to formulate a theory of what she might be doing, she was back, a pair of cuticle scissors locked and loaded in her quivering fingers.What???s she gonna do with those scissors? I wondered.It didn???t take long to find out.Don???t worry, Rob-it, Mommy is going to take care of everything.I started screaming, No Mommy, don???t do that! and watched in a swoony horror as she grabbed that arachnid on my balls by its eight little legs, placed the cuticle scissors on the spot on my scrotum where it had bored its way in, and with a decisive snip, cut off the little fucker???s head, nipping off a skoche of scrotum skin in the process. Then she flushed it down the toilet. Her vigilante surgery successfully completed, she turned to me, a demented smile on her face, and said, Everything is going to be all right.I don???t think so, Mom, I really don???t, I thought as she hugged me and told me to get dressed.After you get dressed, Rob-it, she added as an afterthought, toast yourself an English muffin. I made chopped liver this morning.??????After Mom exited triumphant, I stood frozen in place. I couldn???t move but I could still think. As recent paralyzing events looped past my mind???s eye, I began to fully comprehend the serious error in judgment that had led me to deduce that in was safer than out. This eureka moment startled me back from the outer limits just as the last drops of dingy water were circling the drain. In that moment, if I knew one thing, it was that I needed to get as far away from the scene of the crime as fast as my orthopedic shoes would carry me.I suited up, scooted down the stairs, and was out the door.I wandered in a dissociative fog, trying to recover from the trauma of a second bris. As present reality began to filter back into focus, I found myself deeply engrossed in an ontological meditation, so engrossed that I nearly forgot the dangers posed by falling bricks and flying artisanal mortar shells. Here was the issue that I had circled for a number of years but had never had the courage to get down and dirty with. Now, thanks to Wacky Womb???s scrote snipping, I had no choice but to face it head-on: How could God and my mother exist in the same universe?I had only to relive the moment of the scissored incision to know that my mother existed. That left the question of God???s existence.Having just recently learned that the scientific method was a real thing, I decided to apply it here in order to prove one way or the other whether God existed.I settled on pork to test my hypothesis, since God had been very clear on the subject: The swine, though it divides the hoof ??? does not chew the cud, is unclean to you.  [Its] flesh you shall not eat, and [its] carcass you shall not touch.I returned home, grabbed fifty cents from the silver butter dish I used to stash my cash money, then walked three and a half blocks south until I stood before Manganaro???s, home of the six-foot hero.I crossed the threshold in the name of science.The gruff guy behind the counter began our interaction, Whatchu want?Salami and cheese.What kinda salami?I was stumped already.Genoa, Sicilian, Casalingo, Calabrese, Milano, Super-sot?The last one. It just sounded so good.Kinda cheese?Off another blank look, Swiss, provolone, fresh muzzarell-l-l-l.Swiss. They were neutral in the war.Half or whole?This was a completely new language for ordering food. Each question felt like a test. I must answer correctly. Half.Anything to drink?Dr. Brown???s Black Cherry.Tony, we carry Dr. Brown???s?From the back came an emphatic no.My first real blunder. Pepsi. I???ll take a Pepsi.He sliced the salami and cheese at the speed of light, layering the slices atop the hero bread as he went, slathered on mustard, wrapped the whole thing in wax paper, put it in a kraft bag along with napkins and the Pepsi, the opened cap popped back on, then handed it to me. It happened so fast, was done with such grace, that I wanted to applaud.Fifty cents.I handed him the two quarters. Giddy with transgression, I left the store and just about ran to Bryant Park over by Sixth Avenue and Fortieth Street, in the shadow of the great library, home to the helpless and the homeless. I sat on a deserted bench and pulled out my fragrant, enticing ontological experiment.I stood my Pepsi up beside me, unwrapped the sandwich, and breathed in its ravishing aroma. I then opened the sandwich and pulled out a piece of the super-sot; I licked it clean of mustard and studied it.The first thing that struck me was the color???a deep, complex red. The grains of fat weren???t uniform or evenly distributed like in kosher salami. They were random and distinct, little islands of fat floating in an ocean of aromatic pork.The time had come.I placed the slice back in the sandwich, took a big bite, closed my eyes, and slowly chewed. What I tasted was a revelation???it was indescribably, ineffably, impossibly delicious! The sweet nuttiness of the Swiss cheese served as perfect complement to the sharp, salty, metallic taste of the meat. I took another big bite and washed it down with sweet, fizzy cola.I then sat on the bench waiti",100
75,"ng, perhaps even hoping for God???s wrath. I closed my eyes, scrunched my face, held my breath, jammed my jaws till my teeth ached. Any nano I expected the cranky volcano god to potch me upside my head and send me hurtling headlong into hell.I waited and waited. Then I cracked one eye open, panned around, scoped out the scene. No avenging angels armed with burning scythes under orders from the almighty to smite the transgressor, just the usual suspects, homeless guys and gals. There was only but one conclusion to be drawn???there was no almighty to give the smite order, nor were there angels to carry out his wishes.At the precise moment I had definitively determined God did not exist, a Bag Lady chose to rest her weary bones at the other end of the bench.  She placed her overstuffed bag between herself and me???the Great Wall of Garbage???reached deep into the bag, pulled out a loaf of Wonder Bread along with what the cops would call a blunt object???a stick with a metal head on it in the shape of a tear.Soon there was a kit of pigeons cooing, feasting on the crumbs.Before you could say what the fuck she had a pigeon sitting on her lap, being hand-fed by her.After a couple minutes she began to alternately pet the pigeon and lightly bash it on the head with her blunt instrument. Stroke, bash. Stroke, bash. Stroke, bash. I felt the same admixture of fascination and terror I had felt watching Spider Woman, and as with the movie, I couldn???t tear my eyes away.Bag Lady, sensing an audience, swiveled her head my way after each stroke, bash.The poor pigeon tried to flap its wings and fly but couldn???t???Bag Lady held it in an iron grip. Stroke, bash, swivel. The pigeon???s eyes were filled with terror. Stroke, bash, swivel.It took a long time to die. But die it finally did with a climactic stroke, bash, and rapturous swivel; the serene, mysterious smile on Bag Lady???s face gave her the appearance of a demented La Gioconda.I got up slowly so as to not spook the murderous Bag Lady and began the long trudge homeward, the terror I usually felt during a walk in the world now all but forgotten. With madness and metaphysical truth burned into my cerebral cortex. I pondered the fact that I had, through the action of an overheated metaphysical idea pump, exchanged the imagined terror of falling skies and lethal insects for the true horror of a godless world in which mad men and women wandered the mean streets looking for defenseless pigeons to victimize.When I finally dragged ass home, I walked straight to my room and went full ostrich, stuffing my head beneath a pillow, and lay there, yearning for a simpler, safer time, when the only things that menaced me were all in my mind.- -1    In the eighties, long about a Saturday night, My Friend the Psychologist and I would tune in to channel 47, a Spanish-speaking UHF station, to watch Boxeo Desde Mexico, because we loved the blood, guts, and action of Mexican boxers going mano a mano. When a boxer was knocked down or out by a punch to the jaw, it would send the fans (as well as my friend and I) into a frenzy, during which the announcer would excitedly detail each and every punch in the finishing flurry and always end by saying of the right cross de gr??ce that it caught the victim en el punto de la mandibula (square on the jawbone).2 Which, Holmes explains to the credulous Watson, is the deadliest insect known to science, its native habitat being the upper reaches of the Obungo River, and its venom, once injected into the bloodstream, causes such excruciating agony the victom is driven to self-destruction.3 Holmes prefaces his deduction with this hilarious observation, which didn???t fit my tendential purposes but I needed to share with you anyway: Mendax flagrante is Latin for flagrant liar. When you told me you could get me one, I knew you for what you were, a flagrant liar.4 The Manischewitz catalog describes Extra Heavy Malaga as a specially sweetened fruity wine with a generous mouth feel [&] the distinct aroma and flavor of fresh Concord grapes??? Before god unleashed the tenth plague on Egypt he gave Moses marching orders???have my chosen people splash lambs blood on the right, outer frame of their doorways (from which act is derived Die Mezuzah), so that the Angel of Death would pass over them and only slaughter the first born of their masters???the freeing of slaves is always a bloody affair. Four questions asked at the beginning of the seder are answered as the evening progresses, each answer along the way fortified by a cup of wine. Back on the shtetl, where sourgrass broth (schav) was the soup du jour, wine was a hard-to-come-by luxury. The most common wine drunk during the emancipation celebration in the Pale was ersatz and nonalcoholic, made from boiling down raisins in water until what was left was a sweet and syrupy glop that had the benefit of being kosher for Passover because it avoided fermentation, which the Ashkenazi mistakenly conflated with leavening, and that in Amurrica was favored not only for its faux kashruth cred, but also because, since not actually being hooch, it was exempt from excise tax. In Amurrica the Ashkenaz discovered the Concord grape and, along with their Italian neighbors on the Lower East Side, began to distill wine???in the land of Good & Plenty they could afford alcohol???from the deep purple berries sold by the box out of pushcarts. The Italians made a dry wine known in the nabe as dago red, while the yids added mucho sugar to amp up the cloying factor that invoked memories of the un-booze they had quaffed in the old country. This New World alcoholic wine was exempt from Prohibition as savvy producers of the sweet elixir justified its sale citing the Section 6 exclusion of sacramental wines. Sam Schapiro even went as far as to change the name of his kosher restaurant???it became Schapiro???s House of Kosher and Sacramental Wines. (A friend of mine tried the same thing with pot by creating a religion, the Roster of the Fourth Way, proclaiming weed its herbal sacrament. Didn???t take.) In my yoot, Jewish households (the ones I was acquainted with, at least) got their syrupy vino from a limited group of producers, from Kedem, Hersh???s, Mogen David, Schapiro???s (the slogan for which was Wine so thick you can almost cut it with a knife), and, of course, the Schneider family fave, Manischewitz.5 See Who Dat Who Say Who Dat When I Say Who Dat fn 5.6 Only recently, by perusing the virtual pages of Wikipedia, did I learn that ???contrary to urban legend,??? an M-80 is not equivalent to a quarter-stick of dynamite.

With improved technology, Tesla and hybrid cars are now showing how electric vehicles can succeed.Rebunking Claim: It???s true electric cars were more prominent in the distant past, Ben Franklin drove a kite-and-lightning powered carriage around Philadelphia so often that people figured there was no need to mention it in the history books, but gas and oil firms aren???t to blame for pulling the plug on the car that needs a plug to work.

Typical incandescent light bulbs last around 1,000 hours when they could last well over 150,000 hours.Debunking Claim: Longer lasting bulbs require more electricity, which ends up costing the consumer far more money than simply buying bulbs that are made cheaper and burn out more quickly. There isn???t a conspiracy. It???s just economics.Rebunking Claim: 150,000 hours is over 17 years. If you owned a light bulb that lived for over 17 years, you???d become too attached to it. You???d name it, buy it clothes, and expect it to go to college. This is why the shadowy field of higher education has suppressed light bulb lifespans. Colleges don???t want to go through the hassle of reading application essays written by a bunch of light bulbs. Sure, they don???t want to go through the hassle of reading essays written by humans either, but until they learn to limit human lifespans to 17 years, this is the next best thing.- -Conspiracy Claim: Free energy sources such as perpetual motion machines and cold fusion generators have been stifled by special interest groups, mainly the fossil fuel and nuclear power industries. Without that interference, we could have pollution-free, no-cost energy sources.Debunking Claim: Free energy sources go against the laws of physics, specifically the conservation of energy. Energy cannot simply be created from nothing. Fossil fuel and nuclear energy industries aren???t suppressing free energy, the laws of physics are.Rebunking Claim: While they are currently preventing perpetual motion machines and other free energy sources from working, the laws of physics are simply waiting to receive a large enough bribe to allow them exist. Leave a large enough bag of cash outside of a particle accelerator and the impossible will become possible. Humans will be able to do whatever we want, including bringing Einstein and Newton back to life and making fun of them for being stupid and not thinking with their wallets.- -Conspiracy Claim: Hemp, a natural resource that could replace plastic, oil, cotton, fossil fuels, and building materials, and the technology that would utilize it, has been suppressed by those very same industries. The government and those private industries conspired to use hemp???s connection with marijuana to severely limit its ability to be used in industrial settings.Debunking Claim: While hemp certainly has many industrial uses, there exists no proof that the government or private enterprises have been suppressing its success as a crop.Rebunking Claim: All drugs could be used to create super-products that would revolutionize the world, but, like hemp???s ties to marijuana, the social stigma prevents this from happening. Did you know cocaine makes the best and fastest computers? Or that hats made out of heroin look nicer and make you more popular than regular hats?

The idea of a military-grade Roomba is absurd and the fact that everybody that???s gone searching for it has died and their corpses have been remarkably dirt and dust free is merely a coincidence.Rebunking Claim: You didn???t hear it from me, but the photographs don???t lie.When I became a first grade teacher I knew that it wouldn???t be an easy job. But what I never imagined was that these kids would end up teaching me more than I could ever teach them. And it???s good that I never imagined that, because it hasn???t happened at all.That???s not to say that these kids haven???t taught me anything. For instance, one of my students used to have trouble getting all the way across the monkey bars on the jungle gym. But she kept trying every day, even when the other kids laughed at her, and finally she made it. I consider that to be a poignant lesson about perseverance and never giving up on your dreams.Now here is a very partial list of things that I have taught her: addition, subtraction, what a square is, what a triangle is, what a rectangle is, all five of the senses, the importance of sharing, basic units of measurement, how to make a Venn diagram, the names and characteristics of over thirty different types of animals, how to read a clock, and???oh, yeah???how to read.As you can see, it???s not even close.I don???t mean to disparage these kids. The fact of the matter is that I come to school every day with the sole objective of teaching them, while they, conversely, only come to school because their parents forced them to. I plan out my lessons in detail, strategize about how to hold their attention, and reinforce what they have learned using activities and exercises. I am an unstoppable teaching machine, whereas my students are like a different kind of machine that just happens to do a little bit teaching inadvertently. Like a laptop that you can cook eggs on because it gets so overheated or something.And yes, sometimes it does go both ways. Did I overcome my fear of rejection and sign up for online dating apps because these kids taught me how to be confident in my own skin? Sure. But one could argue that they did that unintentionally and that it actually took quite a bit of conjecture on my part to draw that lesson out of their general behavior. You would be hard pressed to say that when they wrote ???Mr. Budin U are our faverit [sic]??? in crayon on a piece of construction paper their intention was for me to take out my phone and start messaging single women aged 27-33 in a five mile radius. So, really, that was more of a lesson that I taught myself, with an assist from these kids.Should people really get credit for teaching things by accident? It???s not for me to say. I don???t make the rules, I???m just a teacher.Although now that I think about it, the very idea that these kids could teach me more than I can teach them gets me a little hot under the collar. I went through four years of college and two years of graduate school and took on a mountain of debt to become a teacher, and if any one of those little snots thinks that he is going to teach me half as much as I teach him, he???s got another thing coming. If that ever happened I???d quit out of embarrassment and then nobody would be teaching anybody anything.The other day a kid asked me, ???Why isn???t birds my friends???? Was that supposed to be some kind of half-assed lesson? What the hell does it even mean? He???s going to have to try a lot harder than that if he wants to teach me something. And for the record, that same kid couldn???t name a single one of the days of the week before this school year started. Now he knows all seven of them. I???m pretty sure that if I wante",100
78,"d to I could count each of those days as a separate thing I taught him. Me: seven. Kid: zero.To that point, by my rough calculations I have taught these kids a total of 4,268 things, which averages out to 304.86 things per student, while they have taught me approximately 4.5 things total, and that???s if I???m being generous. The entire school year has been a blowout of epic proportions, as I jumped out to a huge lead on the very first day of class and never looked back. By every conceivable measure, I out-taught these kids.And if you ask me, there is nothing more rewarding than that.Portrait of James by Kelly Bjork- -???James was my youngest son. I loved him so much. The police killed him. It???s just been bothering me the way they killed him. They didn???t know how many bullets was in him, they shot him so many times. At the funeral they couldn???t even show one side of his face because they shot it off. They said it was one policeman. The police must???ve just went crazy,??? said Dave as we spoke on the phone. The sentences kept pouring out of him. ???I???m just so sad. He was only 32 years old. He was smart too. He wasn???t a bad kid. He was a good kid. He wasn???t a perfect kid. None of us are perfect people. But he was a good kid, and in fact, he was studying while he was working. He thought about becoming a policeman himself. Until this happened. He was working out at the gym. He???d got buffed up. Big arms and stuff. The way they killed him, it was so dirty.??????I???ve been having dreams. Stress from that. The way they killed him. If a person is not surrendering, why can???t they shoot them in the leg to bring them down or something,??? said Dave. ???I???ve always respected the law. Whatever the law is, that???s what I???m gonna do. But some of these cops. Most black people are afraid to call the cops. They just kill, kill, kill, you know. You hear about all this stuff on TV about them shooting people. Maybe there???s a few that deserve it, but most of the time the cops don???t have to kill people like that. They could use beams or something in their guns to bring people down. I don???t know. I asked the policeman that. I was so confused. He said when they???re training at the police academy, they teach them to shoot for the largest part of the body. The head, the chest, the stomach. In other words, not to wound people, but to kill people, period. I don???t think it???s right,??? said Dave. ???My son probably would???ve done some time. This would???ve been his first offense. At least I would???ve had my son alive.??????My son didn???t have no violent record or anything. He did have parking tickets. He liked fast cars, the same as me when I was young. He was so much like me, you wouldn???t believe. We had so much we was gonna do in the future. He was a carpenter, and I???m a retired electrician. We were gonna buy some bank-repo houses, and fix them, and sell them, and make some money,??? he said, then continued. ???I know you don???t have to have a bad record to commit a crime. But I know my son. You know your kids. I know my son wasn???t violent. He must???ve been having a nervous breakdown. He wasn???t himself. I just wish he???d called me. I would???ve begged the cops, please let me go in. I would???ve reached over there so fast. I would???ve took the gun away from him. Don???t do this. Don???t let the girl drive you crazy. She was the one that drove him crazy. I???ve heard so many stories. I don???t know what to believe. One person said James was asking Whitney, ???Why, why, why are you doing this to me???? That???s when he shot her in the knee or something. Shot her again in the other knee, from what I heard.??????I don???t know how the police could think he was shooting people when he was letting people out the door. He told everybody when he walked in that everybody who wants to leave can leave, that he???s not here to hurt anybody. From what I hear. When the police came, James had the gun up in the air with both hands, like he was surrendering it. Like I said, I???ve heard so many stories. I don???t know what to believe,??? said Dave. ???I don???t have peace of mind.???I tell Dave what I???d read in the case???s discovery file. Inside the Twilight Exit, authorities found three empty shell casings along the back bar, which they determined consistent with James shooting at Whitney twice and the officers once. Yet investigators never found the bullet James was said to have fired at the officers. A search along the alley wall turned up nothing, but as a detective offered in court, evidence often gets shuffled or lost altogether in chaotic circumstances. Perhaps the fired bullet was kicked away by the multiple witnesses, cops, and medics who???d been sprinting about, or maybe the bullet struck an item that was later removed from the scene, the detective said. As far as the exchange between James and the cops, I told Dave that no civilian witnesses had been in a position to watch it. Also, according to the Twilight???s owner, no video of the incident existed, due to a broken DVD player.Returning to his son, said Dave, ???he wanted a family so bad. He wanted to have a good wife. I told him, ???You guys gotta get some counseling. You both gotta work on it. It???s possible for people to change, it???s possible for her to change.??? I told them, ???God is good, God can heal you if you???re doing good. Go to church.??? They did go, and it was happy for a while. That didn???t last long,??? Dave said. As time passed, the relationship worsened. ???Had they not had the baby, they would???ve broken up. He used to call me when he had problems. He???d say, ???This girl is driving me crazy, Dad.??? I said, ???Get away from her. You don???t need her.??? She was messing around with all kinds of guys. I wouldn???t have thought. She was really cute, she was quiet. How could anybody that cute be this way. At least I thought she was quiet. James would say, ???Dad, you just don???t know,?????? said Dave.???He didn???t understand Whitney. He would buy her everything she wanted. He had her so spoiled. I told him, ???James, sometimes that???s not good enough. Material things are only a temporary thing. They get used to that, and they want something even bigger and bigger. Material things don???t make you happy.??? They didn???t make Whitney happy.??? Dave mentioned his former business, a restaurant and sports bar in the suburbs. ???It was doing pretty well up until this happened, and Whitney and James started having problems, really serious problems. The money wasn???t right. I knew Whitney was stealing. She had a cocaine habit, real bad. I???d never known James to be on drugs, but you know, you never know. I know he loved his weed though,??? said Dave.The assistant medical examiner had gone over James???s toxicology results during the court inquest, I tell Dave. The night of the shooting, James???s blood-alcohol level was about .15, or twice the legal limit. Every individual is different, said the examiner, but the effects might include slurred speech, impaired judgement, and some motor instability. No drugs were detected in James???s system.???I???m old fashioned. I???m against everything. I remember back in the hippie days, they???d all be smoking weed. I knew a couple guys that did cocaine. My Vietnam friend. He got messed up over there. Not using it as an excuse, but he did. I was always his designated driver. Anytime we had to go out I would have to drive, see, because I didn???t do none of that stuff,??? said Dave, and then for a while we skipped around in his past. I asked whether he too had served in the war. ???My right foot was messed up. For that reason, they woul",100
79,"dn???t accept me. It was nobody???s fault but mine. When I was a kid, I had these Space Adams shoes, and I wore ???em. We was so poor. We???d got to the dollar store and get shoes for three dollars. I wore these shoes even though it was hurting my foot. It made my big toe grow on top of my second toe. My foot had growed that way. It???s still that way. If you got into that situation where you had to run or whatever you wouldn???t be able to keep up,??? he said.Dave grew up in Arkansas. He remembers being in the fields when he was three or four years old. ???We did everything. Raised corn, beans, potatoes. People lived off the land then. We worked about twelve hours a day, for three dollars a day. We picked cotton. Most black people are ashamed to tell you that. But old guys like me, we tell you the truth,??? he said. ???I lived in those times. When we went anywhere, we always had to go around to the back door. At the movies, we always gotta sit way, way back and up high. I don???t know, that was years and years ago. When I came here, I found out I could be treated like a human instead of treated like a slave. I decided I just wanted to be treated ok, so I came here,??? he said.Dave moved to Washington in 1966 and got a job at Boeing a week later. ???I was operating a hammer machine. These big hammers go down and come up and they make big parts for the airplane. I was always working, always staying busy,??? he said. Later, and for nearly a decade, Dave did electrical maintenance for the shipping cranes parked along the waterfront. His first marriage lasted ten years, brought two daughters, and ended in divorce. Dave had two sons, including James, with his second wife. ???She was a caucasian lady. She worked for an insurance agency. We were married about 15 years. She passed away in 2010. She had diabetes. She had a weight problem you know. I always liked big women. I accept a person for what they are as long as they got a good heart and are very honest. She was a beautiful wife. I lost my wife. That was a big strain too,??? he said. ???Sometimes you think life is unfair because you don???t understand it, because God???s saying when it???s time. I got on my knees and prayed to God, please don???t take my wife, but he did anyway. I guess it was just meant to be. Two years later my son was gone. I thought, God, what???s gonna happen next. I thought, what is this world coming to. It???s probably good in a way that his mom passed because she wouldn???t have been able to take this, the way they killed him.??????I think I think I think I really believe that the policeman that shot him, I think he came out to my restaurant. I???m not 100% sure. I think. I had James???s picture there, and James was holding his baby. I got a feeling. I don???t even know what the cop looked like. I really don???t wanna know what he looked like,??? said Dave, and then he returned again to Whitney. ???At one point James said he was leaving her, and they broke up for a while. He was gonna go back where his friend was in Idaho. His grandma???s got a farm out there not too far from the university. Him and the baby were gonna move out there. I was so happy, I was so happy. Anything to get away from Whitney and meet a nice girl. Not somebody that???s gonna cheat, cheat, cheat on him. Then Whitney popped back up at the house. She???s trouble, she???s trouble, she???s trouble, I said. She???s gonna get you to jail or she???s gonna get you killed. Sure enough, that happened,??? he said. ???I don???t want to talk to her ever. I don???t hate anybody, but I just don???t want to talk to her. My daughter is contact with her. My daughter is raising James???s son. He???s so bright, he???s so smart. He???s part of a big family now. Seven kids. They???re a very religious family. A muslim family. Very strict. Very private and strict.???Dave said he???d owned the place James had been sharing with Whitney. It was located about two blocks from the Twilight. ???James had a German Shepherd, and it was very protective of the house. It was a big one. A guard dog. I don???t remember its name. It was probably six feet tall on two foot. It was huge. James had the dog for protection for Whitney and the baby. I was kind of afraid of the dog. I didn???t go there that regular. I knew James and Whitney was having problems. I didn???t like to interfere with my kids. As long as they???re not hurting each other,??? he said. In the days following the shooting, Dave returned to his property and let himself inside. ???My house was destroyed. Everything was broken. The TV James had on the wall was broken. All his computers was broken. He had a bunch of cds, they was all broken. It was just a mess. It was really a mess,??? he said. ???I sold the house. I almost gave it away. So much damage. They tore it up,??? he said. ???We thought Whitney did all that damage. She led people in there, people that she knew. I think it was a number of people that did it. James had a medical card for marijuana. I think he had fourteen plants downstairs. Somebody broke into that house and went in there and robbed him. They busted a door to get in. They busted out my window. When James came home he was just pissed. She knew that James would go looking for her. I think Whitney set him up. I think she set him up for the cops to kill him. I really do,??? said Dave.I asked Dave if he???d discovered the German Shepherd???s body in the wreckage, since multiple witnesses heard James claiming his dog had been killed. As it turned out, that???s not what happened. ???Maybe the dog had gotten out for a while, but he came back. I had to go feed him and give him water and all that. He wasn???t used to me. He acted like he wanted to attack me. He was mean. He was growling at me. I put some food down, and I opened the back door. I finally got him outside. I sure didn???t want to let him come in again. I had to call the Humane Society. I still feel guilty about that. I didn???t know what else to do. They had a helluva time trying to pick him up, from what the neighbors said. That dog was huge. He got bloody around his mouth. Wherever they were taking him, he didn???t want to go.???Dave backs up to the night of the shooting. In the hours just after, ???I remember going down to the hospital. The police come out. We didn???t know who was dead at that time. All they???d said was there were three people involved. We was hoping it wasn???t James. Two policeman said it was. My daughters freaked out. I said, ???Babe, you know what you was taught when you was young. Never show emotion.??? I had a stroke not long after that, and I think that???s why. It???s because I don???t let things out. All this stuff has been in me for years,??? he said. ???I???m sorry he shot Whitney. Even if she was running him around. He didn???t need to shoot her. I???m sorry he shot the security man too.???Watching this year???s Summer Olympics has been inspiring, particularly because I will have some time on my hands when the next Olympics roll around in 2020.  My kids will have graduated from college.  My mortgage will be mostly paid.  My home-stay probation will be over.  My alcohol ankle monitor will be off.  And the Olympics could be just the ticket to keep me active as I enter retirement.Picking the right sport is the challenge.  Swimming is interesting.  To swim at the Olympics, I???d have to solve a series of problems.  In no particular order, do the swimmers have to take a shower before they enter the pool?  I don???t like getting wet before I get wet.  Besides, it feels insulting to assume that I am so infected with bacteria that chlorine cannot grind it off.  Also, do those Olympic pools use ",100
80,"that chemical stuff to spotlight where I have soiled myself?  Let???s just say my bladder and prostate are not 100% reliable ??? particularly when I???ve been drinking gin all day. I don???t want to be one of those guys on the victory stand with my bathing suit drenched in telltale dye.  Even a sprinkle could hurt my endorsement opportunities.  (The good folks at Xellent Swiss Edweiss Gin, are you listening?)Bathing suits are another issue.   All my suits are loose fit, baggy Tommy Bahamas.  My favorite is about five years old.   The internal netting keeps getting tangled up with my private parts, but I suspect my wife can re-sew it after her release from incarceration.  Those trunks sort of disguise my beer belly and make me feel confident.  Also that suit doesn???t rub my crotch region in a way that leaves painful red rashes that can turn bloody after itching.  It???s better than wearing one of those euro-speedos where everybody talks behind your back about the lack of heft in your package.I???m good at strategies and I think swimming lends itself to that.  For instance, I noticed when Katie Ledecky swims, she keeps pace with that yellow world record bar thingy on the TV screen.  And then she wins.  Very smart.  I would do the same.  One of my biggest decisions will be whether to swim forward or backward.  For practical purposes, it feels more appropriate to swim forward.   I will concentrate on swimming forward, when I finally learn how to swim.Practicality is important and underrated. If I???m going to commit several weeks to perfecting my sport, it would be good to do something with real-world value.  That is why I???m so attracted to synchronized diving.  But even that has obstacles.  Watching the men synchronized divers, they tend to look like identical twins or cute gay couples.  In my case, I would need a partner that looks like Jonah Hill, during one of his heavy phases.  Perhaps we will be cuter after we groom our back hair.In my mind???s eye, I see us jumping off the 10-meter platform into a fully synchronized Triple Inward Reverse Semi-Rotational Tuckahoe while tapping tambourines.  The degree of difficulty would be off the charts, especially if we are wearing shoes.  Did I mention because I am afraid of heights that I???ll have to do this blindfolded?  I???m thinking it???s this event or synchronized dressage (also blindfolded; I???m terrified of horses.)I appreciate there could be some skepticism about my ability to compete with younger athletes.  In fact one of my biggest concerns is how I will get along with my competitors in the Athletes??? Village.  Will anybody eat with me at the early bird special?  Will anybody watch Antique Roadshow with me?  Will anybody help me with my emphysema or my colostomy bag?  I???m sure everybody will be filled with similar fears ??? it???s just part of the growth experience.  I do hope our RA is nice and I get a super cool roommate like Katrina Witt.Full confession, I do not know where the 2020 Olympics will be.  But it might be best to keep my focus on perfecting my event, for now.  If I knew where the Olympics were, I might end up spending too much time mastering the language of the host country.  Eventually I???ll need to be fluent, so I can impress the locals during victory speeches.  I???m pulling for Kyrgyzstan because I already know a little Spanish and I don???t think Interpol has jurisdiction there.So it is with this mix of fears and excitement that I begin my preparation.  I just need to keep a focus on my competitive advantage ??? Jonah Hill.  Also, I have a hard-earned world savvy that will serve me well at the 2020 Olympics.   You simply cannot substitute sixty-odd years of hard drinking for a few years of intense physical preparation by young world-class athletes.  They know nothing!Can anyone put me in touch with Jonah Hill????Please support this blog, I???m living off instant noodles in my car.??????The inspirational post about travel did not mention that there would be so many men who think I???m a prostitute.??????I want to go back home but my mother will say that it???s typical of me to quit everything I???ve ever done, so I???m stuck on this godforsaken trip.??????I quit my job because I wasn???t being challenged so I decided to just not have a job instead of finding a career I am challenged by.??????Despite the nice layout of this blog page, I haven???t showered in two weeks.??????I caught the travel bug but I also got malaria.??????I didn???t understand that selling all of my stuff to live minimally would mean I would essentially be homeless.??????I was pretty sure that all of my problems were from my job but it turns out all of my problems are from my mother???s criticism so they???ve just followed me around the world.??????I was an American White girl in college who studied abroad in a trendy European country and I really thought this trip was going to be like that.

Whenever you tell someone you???re a duck boat driver, their response is always, ???Oh man, that must be so much fun!??? It???s not. It???s not fun at all. Do you even know what a duck boat is? It???s what happens when some asshole decides you can make busses cool by putting them in the water. Does anyone like riding the bus? Do you ever wake up thinking, ???You know what? I???m really craving a bus ride to nowhere with the added risk of drowning.??? True, mashups are popular, but, unsurprisingly, the love child of a bus and a boat is stupid. You know what???s a great mashup? Nacho lasagna, which is fucking delicious. I???m basically a tour bus driver and nobody is jealous if you say you drive a bus. And do you know what shit I???m forced to listen to all day? Wacky Quackers. The worst part is I???m the one who has to hand them out, like it???s not bad enough that I have to listen to them. So every day I have to give the same spiel, pointing out local landmarks that nobody gives a shit about all while everyone ignores me to quack nonstop, and then drive the whole damn thing into the harbor like that makes any sense.Before you roll your eyes any harder, know that I???ve taken careful notes since our last Mother-Daughter Talk, when your father left the house for half an hour to buy a whole suckling piglet. This year???s Talk, though, is special. Because you???re turning thirty-something soon, I figured it was high time we had it. You???ll remember our first Talk, which took place on the sidewalk outside a Home Depot while your father was buying a lathe. I told you about periods, and you kept asking me about cooties, and I threw up my arms and screamed, ???I give up! Go ask your father.???But back to this year???s Talk. There???s a reason I called my 30s ???Thuberty??? or ???Puber-two.??? Your body???s going through many, many changes, and I want to be able to say ???I told you so!??? when it all happens to you. So put down that cup of Strawberry Activia Yogurt and give a listen???Remember acne? Remember how it wasn???t a thing, and then, suddenly, it was, on your forehead and nose and cheeks and chin? Well, that???s wrinkles. You???ll notice them in the throes of strong emotion, when you???re laughing or crying or glaring at somebody the way you are right now. My advice: don???t emote. Also, wear sunscreen when you???re out, and don???t drop a hundred dollars on an anti-wrinkle cream. I did, and look what it did for me (according to your father: nothing)! Wrinkles are acne for adults. Only, they???re not going away. Ever.Hey, don???t mope. You???ll wrinkle. Think of it this way: every moment???s a bit more wrinkle-free than the next, and the next, and the next.I???m telling you all this because I love you.Honey, remember when you subsisted on pints of Cherry Garcia for two weeks in college with no consequence? Well, don???t forget. If genetics do their duty (between the two of us: just look at your father!), you???ll eat a French fry a few years from now and swear that it regenerated itself in your thighs. It???s your body???s way of saying, ???That was the fried potato-straw that broke your metabolism???s back, so it???s all downhill from here, jerkface.??? Accountability, darling. Get used it.And remember hormones? They made you feel a certain way. Turning forty will make you feel a certain way, too. If my own experience is any indication, you???ll suddenly decide to decorate your kitchen ?? la farmhouse and your bathroom ?? la beach. You???ll buy Skinny Girl cocktails and read books because Oprah told you to.??? ???What about menopause??? you ask? Whoa, that???s diving deep. Let???s not be overeager. That deserves its own ???Talk??? entirely. Next year, maybe? We can make it a Facebook event.Anyway. Take it from me, sweetheart, half the battle will be in your head. When Ben Franklin hit 70, he started subtracting a year from his age at each birthday, and by the time he died he thought he was 56. Now, I???m not telling you to do that ??? heck, if you start too early, you might age yourself backwards into actual puberty, shudder ??? but I am telling you to keep the you in youth. So, when people jokingly ask you what the youths are up to nowadays, you can say, ???They???re listening to Fresh Air with Terry Gross and filing their income tax returns on time, thank you very much.??? Bask in their stunned silence ??? they???ll wish they were still card-carrying members of The Youth.I think I just heard your father in the kitchen, so I???ll wrap up the Talk with this last remark: what???s said during the Talk stays in the Talk. Bring your father into the loop, and we???ll wind up with Mother-Father-Daughter Talk, which kind of sounds like an abomination.Let me just say that I am shocked by the news about the famous celebrity who recently died.  The world lost an icon today.  I am sad, you are sad, everyone is very sad.  Sad, sad.  But as sad as all of you surely are in the face of this tragic loss, please allow yourselves to take comfort in the knowledge that there is no possible way that you are sadder than I am about the recent celebrity death.To repeat:  I am the saddest of all.This is not the first celebrity death that has profoundly affected me on a personal level.  I was crushed when Art Linkletter died.  Heartbroken when Etta James died.  I",100
82,"mpaled with a flaming grief-javelin when Robin Williams died.  When Dennis Farina died, I writhed on the ground for months.  It was awful on my joints, but not as awful as having to tell my joints that Mark Ruffalo died.  Luckily, that was a hoax.Just in case you were wondering how I might be impacted in the face of future celebrity deaths, here is a list of some other currently alive celebrities whose eventual deaths will level me with public despair because of the personal connections I have with them.  Dean Stockwell and I share a birth-month.  Queen Latifah is from New Jersey, like my old fake ID.  I can???t recall not knowing who LeVar Burton is.  Gerardo and I flew on an airplane together, possibly.  You probably know him as Henry Kissinger, but he???ll always be Hank to me.  I once saw Lita Ford at a car wash.  She was actually working there, so it probably wasn???t her, now that I think about it.  Clyde Drexler ruined my 14th birthday party.  Ate the whole cake.  I???ll miss him terribly.  I know what a trumpet is, and so does Yo Yo Ma.  I realize Yo Yo Ma plays the cello, but you???re crazy if you don???t think he also knows what a trumpet is, like me, which is why I???ll tweet about how much he meant to me for several days after he dies.  Things don???t look good for George Clooney over the long term.  That???s going to be a tough one for me.  I lost my virginity during Buster Poindexter???s ???Hot Hot Hot.???  Don???t you die on me, Buster.  Not now.  Not so soon after Harambe.Mark Wahlberg and I share a dentist, so I???ll be absolutely destroyed when he dies.  Not a specific dentist, mind you, but like, dentists in general.  Do I know that for a fact?  No, I do not.  I have never seen Mark Wahlberg at the dentist, but with teeth like that, it???s basically a lock that he regularly sees a dentist, and also very sad that I???ll never see those pearly whites up on the silver screen again after he dies, unless I catch Pain & Gain on Netflix or watch the ???Good Vibrations??? music video on YouTube or see his picture up on the wall at our shared dentist???s office.I was very sad when I read Walden and then afterward learned that Hank David Thoreau died.Do not even get me started on the potential death of that one guy with the beard from Color Me Badd unless you are prepared for a tidal wave of public grieving about that time I left the Time and Chance cassette at my buddy Chad???s apartment.  Chad never gave it back, and now he???s dead.  Dead to me, I mean, like we???re no longer speaking.  Also, another reason we???re not speaking is because he???s dead.I try not to think about how Wolf Blitzer will die, but my guess is:  poisoned by his enemies.  I???ll be crushed.  I???ll also be very sad when Goldie Hawn, Nicholas Sparks, and Wesley Snipes die.  I hope they don???t all die on the same day, because Snipes deserves his own Facebook post.  Good ol??? Hank Snipes.The bottom line is that bravely forging ahead in the wake of celebrity deaths has made me who I am:  a person whose personal connections to celebrities inspire very deep and public mourning when those celebrities die and the building I am in has free Wi-Fi.Oh god, now I can???t stop thinking about how Alfonso Ribeiro is dying a little bit every day, and it makes me so, so sad.1. Hi! I???m so embarrassed to even be writing you, but it???s not like I can ask my mom, right? Even my best friends don???t seem to understand what I???m going through (because, yeah, their eggs are still shooting out like clockwork). So there???s this guy. I really, really want to impress him (he???s a high ranking government official). So we???re in a meeting, right? Just ???sovereign immunity??? this and ???injunction??? that. And then my period starts out of nowhere! So I pretend to get a text and run out of the room, screaming, ???My kids??? school just burned down!??? Should I have picked something that wasn???t independently verifiable? Will I be fired?2. This one is even more personal, but there???s this guy I have a huge crush on. I???ve been married to him for, like, forever. He keeps wanting to go to second base, but I???m afraid. I???m not sure exactly why, but I think it might be because the extra estrogen my body is creating to fight the end of my child-bearing years makes going to second base about as much fun as a mammogram. What if he decides to replace me with someone whose body isn???t in the middle of a full revolt against the dying of the light?3. I???m back, again. Just like the acne. So, anyway, every morning at 5:30 my eyes pop open. And then everyone is all, Why does Mom get up so early? Why was Mom baking whole grain spelt muffins at 6 in the morning? Why does Mom go to the grocery store before dawn? Why doesn???t anyone understand me anymore?!?4. So I was hiding in a hotel bathroom watching the Great British Breaking Show on the iPad at 6 AM while my family slumbered peacefully (see question 3), and I dropped the iPad into the sink and shattered the screen! Will my kids ever trust me with a tablet again? How can I make them understand that I can be responsible if they won???t ever let me prove it to them?5. I am so hot. Oh, wait, now I???m cold??? Nope, hot again. I understand that is not actually a question.From: alandwandaDate: Wed, Aug 17, 2016Subject: SO WRONG ABOUT THE DOORSSo how old are you, you prick.

As a southerner, I have always dreamed of living in the North. I hate the heat, and always wanted to live among the pure white snow. And I always wanted to see what happens when I pee on it, lol.I am also attracted to the possibility of imminent death, so there???s that, which makes me a perfect fit for this position.Before I go on, I???d like to apologize for not sending this via raven, the more traditional Westerosi way. My raven is a fucking idiot and hasn???t returned from sending a Dorne Beach postcard to my uncle in the fucking Riverlands. ugh.As annoyed as I am with Raven (my raven), I also think that my ability to so easily email my application is a demonstration of my skills with social media and the Known World Wide Web.I graduated from University of Highgarden (GROW ROSES, GROW!!!) in 297 AC with a degree in communications where I learned a lot (too much) about ravens, and also about some more practical means of communication including GeoCities, Tumblr, Twitter, Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram, and Vine (but that was only cool for a year).I also graduated with a minor in creative writing. The price I paid for these extra classes? I had to take sword lessons. My lord father spanked me to sleep every night until I was ???good enough??? at it.

I don???t know the accuracy of the film to the life of David and David but I???m haunted by a particular scene with Jesse Eisenberg brushing his teeth at Wallace???s house in Illinois. I just want to know if Lipsky actually brushed his teeth or not that night. If the film creators just tossed in the brushing without factual evidence I???m afraid this perpetuates the standard that people have to brush their teeth when staying over someone???s house for a night. Yes, the days in the hotel, great. Brushing at home, terrific. But why must I continually be accosted by friends and family if I do not brush my teeth for a one-night stay somewhere at the end of a tired night? It???s one missed brush. People miss a brush from time to time. Early morning rush, dead tired at night, ran out of toothpaste ???  there???s always a day here and there where a brush is missed. So if a generally well-brushed guy were to stay over his sister???s place in Brooklyn for one night and pack a light bag of stuff for the train ride from the Garden State, would that person really need to pack a toothbrush? What if the toothbrush was packed but the teeth were not brushed because of some late night watching of The End of the Tour, after a thoughtful rental from said sister to watch with brother and mom for the monthly Sloan sleepover in the city? At what point can we honestly just let the brushing go? To put it in our films suggests that we who go without for",100
84," a night, maybe even a couple nights, are some sort of hygiene heathens. If you have the sources to verify Mr. Lipsky???s actual brushing at Mr. Wallace???s, than I would greatly appreciate it, thanks.Best regards,Daniel Michael MurphyColts Neck, NJP.S. I most enjoyed the scene where the uncanny looking Jason Segel discusses Wallace???s use of his middle name to prevent the extreme commonality of his first and last combination.David Lipsky???s reply:Daniel Michael Murphy raises some troubling questions: about hospitality, cinema fact-check, and the debt we all owe our oral cavern.The most pertinent one: David Wallace???s grandfather ??? Wallace side ??? was a Troy, New York dentist. This presents in Infinite Jest as the partial joke of director James Incandenza releasing a 73-minute feature called Fun With Teeth. Dental care as thriller: it???s described as ???horrific??? and, for the special cravings viewer, ???sado-pareodontal.???  (???Silent with non-human screams and howls,??? is the logline.) Wallace was very serious about tooth stuff: We played chess right after my arrival ??? bags dropped, tape on, him having a workshop to teach ??? and he halted the piece exchange. ???All right, we???ve got time for one more move each and then we have to leave. I???ve got to brush my teeth.??? A day later, I repeated a cool observation he???d made ??? research results, chore experiment ??? into the tape machine: ???Dave said he notices on days when he brushes his teeth with his left hand as opposed to his right that he thinks more interestingly.??? Wallace laughed: ???Best of luck putting that into any kind of context that???ll be interesting: ???As we drove into Chicago, Dave began a system of loose associations, some of which follow here.??????  A much briefer Incandenza film follows the complete obliteration of the grandfatherly town. No Troy: seven minutes, disaster footage, released in Canada as The Violet Ex-City. An entire urban center extracted, gone to cavity.On the hospitality side, David Wallace was absolutely generous ??? a wonderful host ??? about offering guest room, spare towel, sink and shower privileges.So down to fact-check: I brushed twice a day there ??? the odd, gravity-less feeling of an absolutely familiar action performed in an away setting, at the home of someone you admire but do not know. What seemed strange was the George Constanza detail: Jesse Eisenberg brushing topless. That stops me. To quote a non-related Seinfeld advisement, ???There???s good-naked and bad-naked.??? Disrobed tooth-brushing seems to fall on the gray side of that ledger. On the question of skipping a day ??? we???re given our bodies fully-featured and ready to use, and don???t even have to find a service provider; they function right out of the box, teeth included ??? Mr. Murphy is invited to square with his own conscience. I???m not anything like as devoted to teeth as David Wallace was. But I remember the first time I got an implant, feeling sad, a sort of creeping mortal defeat, because I???d wanted to carry my own teeth from start to the ground, and my bad luck or faulty ministrations had made this impossible. But that would have been the last square on the board.??? David Lipsky February 23, 2016- - -From: Josh LogueDate: Mon, Feb 1, 2016Subject: Donald Trump and John UpdikeDear McSweeney???s,The founder of the group Students for Trump, which has expanded to 30+ campuses with 300+ members and 24k Twitter followers, explained to me today why he supports Trump???s candidacy via an extended comparison to the short story ???A&P??? by John Updike.He explained that those three girls walking into the store wearing only their bikinis was a rebellious, Trump-esque act at a time when bikini-clad shopping was very taboo. Eventually, Sammy quits because, ""he did not want to conform to the society that was put before him by his family, his boss, etc.??????To me,??? he said, ???Donald Trump is that positive and new change that is needed back in Washington.""My initial thought upon hearing this was that it tracks: The three girls = Trump, their bikinis = Trump???s statements, Sammy = college-age Trump supporters, the store manager = Hilary Clinton, the uncomfortable shoppers (aka ???the sheep???) = the hesitant GOP establishment, Stokesie = the tea party, and John Updike = me.However, upon upon revisiting the text today at work, I realized that this metaphor holds up startlingly well. Unfortunately, Mr. Students for Trump has drawn the wrong conclusion from the story. Allow me to explain.First, on a purely aesthetic level, Updike was obviously describing Donald Trump. One of the girls is ???a chunky kid, with a good tan,??? and it is indisputable, I think, that Donald Trump does indeed possess ???one of those chubby berry-faces, the lips all bunched together under her nose.???The ???black hair that hadn???t quite frizzed right,??? is a little off the mark, of course, but the idea that it isn???t quite right is right on the money.Now, which aspects of Trumps personality each of the three girls represents is for wiser men than me to determine. But, Updike writes, ???You never know for sure how girls??? minds work (do you really think it???s a mind in there or just a little buzz like a bee in a glassjar?).??? Substitute ???girls??? for ???Trump??? and singularize everything, and you???ve got yourself one hell of a true sentence.Updike also writes that ???the girls were walking against the usual traffic,??? and watching that happen was ???pretty hilarious.??? Pretty hilarious indeed.Even Sammy???s observation that ???you could set off dynamite in an A & P and the people would by and large keep reaching and checking oatmeal off their lists and muttering??? is chillingly similar to Donald Trump???s proclamation that he ???could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody, and I wouldn???t lose any voters, OK?""Further parallels also revealed themselves.The A&P = professional politics, the beach = NBC (home of Celebrity Apprentice), and McMahon = the Koch brothers.The ???old party in baggy gray pants who stumbles up with four giant cans of pineapple juice??? is either Ted Cruz or Marco Rubio, depending on what you think ???bums do with all that pineapple juice,??? and Stokesie holding up all those other shoppers is a pitch perfect representation of modern political gridlock.Now, on to the ???sad part of the story,??? which, Sammy notes, ???my family says it???s sad but I don???t think it???s sad myself.???Sammy imagines that Lengel, aka Clinton, ???had been thinking all these years the A & P was a great big dune and he was the head lifeguard.??? A brazen jab at the powerful Clinton dynasty.However, and I???m sure you see where this is going, the revolution fails. The establishment wins. The establishment and the Establishment. Queenie even admits that ???we weren???t doing any shopping.??? They (he!) weren???t really there in earnest.???You didn???t have to embarrass them,??? says Sammy.No, says Lengel. ???It was they who were embarrassing us.???Yours,Josh- - -From: J.

85,"re the research and any links that led you to write the article.I am happy to share more information with you and answer any questions you may have.Sincerely,BethanieIt???s no secret that American democracy isn???t what it used to be. These days, it seems like nine times out of ten our representatives in government are too busy squabbling and taking bribes to even consider getting anything done. There???s no two ways about it: our Congress is utterly useless, except, of course, for the time they helped me get all those insects out of my futon.The biggest problem with Congress is that they have no idea how to compromise. It???s like our country is being run by a bunch of six-year-olds. Those bureaucratic numbskulls can???t seem to stop calling each other names long enough to pass a single damn bill, and the American people are sick and tired of it. That said, there was no name-calling on that glorious day when the members of our representative government came together heroically to expel the vast swarms of ants, bees, and termites that had inhabited my futon mattress for over a year. Other than that one specific instance, Congress is terrible.To be honest, when our nation???s 100 senators and 435 representatives responded to my Craigslist ad requesting the removal of several hundred insects from my Dorel Home Products Pillowtop Futon, I had my doubts. Those fat cats in Washington were going to help me with my insect problem? Weren???t these the same clowns who shut down the entire government because they couldn???t stop fighting about health care? But, believe it or not, they exceeded my expectations, and I???m pleased to say that my futon is now insect-free.As Senator Harry Reid (D-NV) cut a small hole in the futon using his penknife while Congressman Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) lured the bugs out with some watermelon slices, I realized that public servants from both sides of the aisle were working together to achieve a common goal. If only our government could take this sort of bipartisan action on issues like gun control or LGBT rights, there???s no telling what it could accomplish.Now, were there challenges along the way? Of course. A huge debate broke out over what to do with the bugs once we got them out of my futon. Half of Congress wanted to donate them to science, and the other half just wanted to kill them. Ultimately, we compromised by simply leaving the bugs in my living room and calling it a day. As long as they stayed out of my futon, I didn???t mind. But the biggest obstacle we faced was when Senator Roy Blunt (R-MO) tacked on a rider amendment to the removal of insects from my futon that completely defunded Detroit???s public school system and made it legal to throw cranberries at the mentally infirm. I wasn???t too crazy about either of these provisions, but if you want to get anything done in politics, you???ve got to take the good with the bad.Let me be perfectly clear about my view: when it comes to non-insect-removal-related issues, Congress is a bunch of lazy morons. Still, I have to give credit where credit is due. Today, I can have guests stay on my futon whenever I want, without having to warn them of the hoards of insects that dwell within. And, as much as I never thought I???d say these words, I owe it all to Congress.From: ENGL-LISTS [ENGL@LISTS.XSU.EDU] on behalf of Reginald Sharpington [Reg.Sharpington@xsu.edu]???Sent: Wednesday, February 13, 2015 8:11 AM???To: [ENGL@LISTS.XSU.EDU]???Subject: The Ethics of Photographing Sleeping StudentsI took this lovely picture of my snoozing composition scholars (see: attached).

Civility is over-rated. Human connection is probably the central quality of good teaching and one for which several of you are severely lacking. You come across as class pets forever seeking approval for being the smart kid. I can only speak for myself, though I???m sure there are plenty who agree with me but are afraid to say anything.My temporary contract will be up next semester and it???s non-renewable so this will be my last year of teaching at this institution and possibly my last year in the profession (not by choice, but it has gotten extremely competitive out there). And so I???m free to voice what others are afraid they???d be punished for???.None of you would find jobs in today???s market and I think on some level you probably know this. Minus your one stroke of luck, you would also be contingent. I had already seen the Chronicle article and wasn???t offended by it???believe me we know more than anyone what the score is???but I???m often offended by the way you talk with each other as if contingent faculty didn???t exist. I???d like to remind you that we teach twice the number of classes with two to three times the number of students, for less pay, with no chance of promotion or job security, and it seems the natural order???it would never occur to you to stick up for us. We are ineligible for teaching awards or travel money, and we???re required to come to faculty meetings even though we can???t vote. I know you probably can???t help yourselves, but a little more respect???for your students, for the people who live in this community, and for the contingent faculty???would go a long way. It???s easy enough to give the students the benefit of the doubt. You should assume that eating fast food in class is not their first choice. Being here is costing them a lot more than it did us, with mostly debt and shitty jobs ahead of them.

The rate of one picture to a thousand words",100
88," is no longer considered sustainable.Some critics will say this change is long overdue. When man first lifted brush to wall, the result had limitless value. It is difficult to say when things began to change for the worse: for some it was the invention of the printing press; others the first camera; and for many of us it was that awful selfie Karen from HR posted last week. While we will not target any one image as the reason our current system needs to be revised, it is safe to say that the image of Karen PhotoShopped to look like she is skydiving into Manhattan will be burned in our minds forever.The details of our current negotiations are still being worked on, but here are a few exchange rate examples to give you a better idea of our new system:Photo of your newborn child: 500 words (-100 words per each subsequent child):Congratulations for bringing life into our already overpopulated planet, we hope you take these words as a condolence for the years of parenting struggles that lay ahead.Photo that creates the illusion of holding up the leaning tower of Pisa: Two wordsA stock photo would have been more meaningful.Selfie with a celebrity: 10-75 wordsContext is the key in our new system. Was this an organic celebrity spotting or an arranged meet up? Are we pushing back against celebrity culture as a symptom of a regressive society or embracing our new technologically driven world? Is the celebrity Matt Damon?Handmade artwork: Subject to expert appraisalIn the past we have treated all pieces of art equally, emphasizing effort over outcome. As part of our new system of word to picture conversions, all art will be harshly judged on its value by a team of experts. This prevents any potential exploitation of the system, particularly by parents who may want to exchange their children???s crayon drawings and other projects for cheap words.We thank you for your patience while our new system is refined. Remember, these changes are not the fault of one person but a response to an overall change in how art functions in society (and also a response to the tacky Instagram feed of Karen???s from HR).Dear Preeclampsia,You have been the friend every woman longs for during the exhausting final months of pregnancy. Your thoughtfulness was extraordinary ??? you saw clearly my need for rest and relaxation during such a stressful time.Sure, I would have preferred a nice hotel and massage, but three weeks on a intermittently-inflating bed and 5 AM blood draws were a close approximation. While not having to get out of bed to pee was a nice touch, I have to say that I would have liked a chance to look into what other spa services were available. The staff was a little pushy, checking on me every three hours, but they refilled my water as needed.Please don???t think me ungrateful; I know you were looking out for my best interests, making sure I was taken care of with food delivered moderately warm and unsalted right to my bed. At least, when I was able to eat at all ??? that was one of your most creative gifts, a nice magnesium cleanse to help me get a head start on losing the baby weight.You know I support the arts, so you arranged for the IV pump to sing me the song of its people at unpredictable intervals, and you even gave me a head start on the whole adult coloring book craze.You went out of your way to help me avoid stretch marks and torn lady bits, and outdid yourself in your commitment to avoiding the woes of the third trimester. No way would I have gotten my body back as quickly if I???d carried the pregnancy to term!Whereas many pregnancy illnesses are nothing more than an annoyance, you helped me meet my dear son two months earlier than I could have dreamed. I was then relieved of the burden that comes with a screaming baby in the middle of the night, since you arranged for him to stay right there in the hospital for five weeks.You thought of everything!But did you have to try to kill me? It really sends a girl mixed signals.Sincerely,Rhiannon Giles1. Fuck You, There???s a Sale On.2. New This Week: Cigarettes and Horseshit.3. Summer Savings That Can???t Save You From Yourself.4.

Have you successfully destroyed scaly hellbeasts from the bowels of the earth? If so, you should join the PopStart family, where we aim to combine media coverage with an opinionated (and hilarious!) voice.Here at PopStart, our mission is simple: we want to break interesting stories for a hip, young audience, and send the Demon Lord Karazaar back to the underworld. In case it isn???t obvious by now, we like to keep things light. As a member of our staff, you???ll spend time interviewing A-list celebs, playing Ping-Pong or napping in our hammock room during breaks, and casting blood spells to penetrate the dark magic that makes Karazaar impervious to weapons. We boast a team comprised of two Pulitzer-prize winners, three MacArthur geniuses, and a former presidential speechwriter. With your help, we???d like to add ???badass demon hunter of doom??? to that list.As a member of our staff, your responsibilities will include: writing whip-smart stories that crackle with a mix of your voice and PopStart???s; interviewing celebrities and musicians about their projects; wiping down your hammock after use; and finding the Orb of Tiranius, which can open a direct portal back to hell. On slow news days, we might even have you sneak into Karazaar???s lair, which is in the break room. We???ve heard rumblings that his groin is his weak spot, but since he???s a demon made mostly of groins, it???s hard to tell exactly where that is. We???ve been periodically taking turns hitting him with a bat blessed by seven blind monks to try and determine that. We???d absolutely love it if you would take a crack at it??? please?Since we live in a digital world, and would rather have you hear it from the horse???s mouth, we???d like you to know that you wouldn???t be the first blogger/destroyer of the evil and undead that has joined our team. Over the last year, we???ve had four other PopStart staffers succumb to the pressures of the job. What can we say, we like to work hard, and hide in terror throughout the day even harder. To be honest, the main problem has been Karazaar, who has either killed, eaten, or turned an otherwise morally upright blogger evil with powers we don???t yet understand. If you could crack how that happens, it sure would make a great piece for our Science section!While the job may seem like it???s all writing editorials on Kanye West and trying not to cry when one of our former employees/Karazaar???s evil minions gives a speech about something called ???The Days of Locusts and Thunder,??? it definitely has its perks! We offer a competitive dental plan, 401k, and, when Karazaar has slipped away to gather his strength in the darkness, access to all the craft beer and kale chips you can handle! Also, if you can kill Karazaar, Jennifer has agreed to name her baby after you (before or after birth, it doesn???t matter), and one of our MacArthur staffers has agreed to put in a good word for you over at Vanity Fair, which we hear has a similar issue with a demon named Greg, the Intern of Destruction.Here at PopStart, we constantly get asked why we don?",100

Apart from the fact that we all poured an outlandish amount of money into this company, we like to ask: Would Steve Jobs have given up if a demon vomited acid on his Mac prototype? Would Edison have let electricity be if a sinister force kept putting its penises in his ear when he worked late? Would Alexander Graham Bell have ditched the telephone if a creature of the night heckled him when he jammed out on his electric guitar in his private studio (we have a private studio)?

The entire cast of the movie Newsies. This movie was directly responsible for your sexual awakening, and your interest in real life boys depended mostly on whether or not you could picture them dancing with dirt on their faces and talking in tortured cockney accents. Even as an adult, when you re-watched it with your niece, you were horrified to discover you are weirdly turned on by what you now understand are only children.2.	Your gay best friend in eighth grade. You didn???t know. When you were older, and he came out, you were actually dumbfounded. But how could you not have known? He loved Newsies too.3.	The reverend of the church you attended in high school. He would break the bread with his hands???a big loaf of freshly baked bread, cracked in half. You had only ever been given wafers before, but here was this large man with strong hands placing a doughy yeast ball on your tongue! You had to open your mouth for him! It absolutely short-circuited you.4.	The busboy at your first job in a restaurant. You were the hostess, and he would come and talk to you about the large parties. He had a wide nose like a lion and he was always softly chewing gum. Sometimes he would give you gum, but you were not allowed to chew gum while you were working, so this was done in a thrillingly covert way, that involved him passing it into your hand as he brushed against you, pretending to look into the computer screen lay-out of tables and guests.5.	You had a particularly young philosophy professor in college, perhaps thirty-five, older than anyone you had ever dated, but in an exciting way. He had glossy brown hair like a ???90s child star, and very thick thighs and buttocks, and he spoke incredibly quietly so that all of you had to strain in your desks to hear his often puzzling discussions of Kierkegaard. He had a big, heavy looking, gold wedding band, and you longed to suck it right off his finger and then swallow it and see what he would do.6.	Your vet, Dr. Aiken. There was just something about the gentle and yet masterful way he handled your cat, Mr. Tiger. It made you want to be the one being turned this way and that on his cold metal table. He scolded you for how fat Mr. Tiger was getting, and even that made you a little swoony, because he acted like you and he were going to be taking care of Mr. Tiger together from here on out.7.	One of your employees when you were an office manager. You even took him out to dinner once, thinking the feeling was mutual???he was not that much younger than you. But it became clear by the time you ordered a second glass of wine that he was getting increasingly freaked out and you went home alone and felt dirty and horrible about yourself. You blame the movie Newsies. Has it corrupted you forever?8.	Your grandmother???s spinal surgeon. Really inexplicable, he was bald and thin, not your type, but he had mischievous eyes.  Once you asked him, ???When you are not working, and you are just at the mall or whatever, do you look around at people and think: I could cut them open???? He laughed and said, ???A little bit, maybe.??? You wonder if he thinks that about his wife! His children! What strange and yet terrestrial power. It is eerie to think of surgeons as just people. It makes you want to never ever have surgery, even though your grandma came through just fine.9.	Your child???s swim instructor. Newsies again.

Before we were stranded 50 miles offshore with two nights??? worth of provisions, before the models started gulping down seawater, and before a certain professional football franchise owner deliriously decided to swim for it, and we felt nothing but relief that there???d be one less corpse to throw overboard ourselves.That was the last emotion we had on my party boat.I???m technically alive, yes, but what I???ve done to other human beings on my party boat to keep my guts going has made me far less human myself.

Like Anthony, I???d also been asked to testify in court. After my turn, I stuck around and watched everyone give statements. The case took three days. On the stand, Officer Anthony was a sharp-looking man with a fit build, tan skin, and an upright posture, and he wore his hair shaved to military standards. Early on, the deputy prosecuting attorney established Anthony???s basics. He was originally from Nebraska, he said, he was 31 at the time, and he was employed by the City of Seattle as a Patrol Officer. Prior to his job with the Seattle Police Department, he spent eight years in the United States Army. He joined when he was 19. After basic training, he became an infantry soldier, which is ???a grunt, basically.??? In the years following, he was deployed twice, both times to Iraq. Anthony served as an infantry squad leader in the first tour. In the second, he was promoted to platoon sergeant and had forty soldiers directly under him. Among his many duties, Anthony was responsible for planning and executing various missions, everything ???from Search and Rescue; to what we call Search and Destroy???basically, going out and trying to find the bad guys,??? he said. There was also the task of ???winning the hearts and minds of the local populace,??? he said, but ???the biggest priority for me was to make sure that my soldiers all came home in one piece and alive,??? he said.The night of the shooting at the Twilight Exit, Officer Anthony was covering the east precinct in the Central District during third watch, or the 7:30 p.m. to 4:30 a.m. shift. He wore the standard-issue uniform: a sky-blue button-up collared shirt, a visible gold badge, several official SPD patches, navy cargo pants, a gun belt. He was working with a partner that night, a different guy than usual. The men played paper-rock-scissors for driving privilege, and Officer Anthony lost. Hours in, during a routine patrol, the officers spotted a couple teenagers running from a store and ended up arresting one. Then they returned with him to the precinct to start paperwork. That???s when emergency tones sounded over the police radio, followed by the announcement of a shooting-in-progress at the Twilight Exit. Officer Anthony knew the location well. It was within his district, and he???d been inside the bar ???a few times on related police matters: car prowls, theft of purses, suspicious people. Things of that nature,??? he said. To Anthony and his partner, the young man???s crime no longer seemed important. They released the teenager so they could respond more immediately to the scene. Officer Anthony grabbed the car keys from his partner, as he was ???going a bit slow for my taste.??? He activated the lights and sirens while he drove. ???We were flying down the streets pretty fast,??? he told the attorney. ???We were hauling, sir.???En route, another broadcast came on, indicating the situation involved ???multiple victims and the suspect was still inside the bar.??? Another broadcast came moments later, indicating there was an open line, meaning a caller was on the phone with 911 and wasn???t free to talk???but people could be heard yelling in the background, and a gunshot had sounded. Officer Anthony considered this caller???s situation. Perhaps the caller was within earshot of the suspect, or perhaps the caller was hiding while the suspect made ???his way through the bar trying to find other people,??? said Officer Anthony. When the gunshot sounded, the situation became ???what we call active intelligence, which means we know for a fact that something is going on as police are responding,??? he said. ???I figured we needed to get there as soon as possible to save some lives,??? he said. ???I think I mashed the pedal down to the floor.???When Officer Anthony arrived on scene, he parked his vehicle and quickly approached the building. Several witnesses stood outside in groups, pointing in the direction of the bar as he moved past. They were ???visibly hysterical, upset, crying,??? he said. As Officer Anthony got closer to the Twilight, he saw a group of officers gathered around a door and preparing entry. They???d picked the wrong door, the main entrance was around the corner and up the alley. ???I tried to get their attention and yelled, ???You can???t get in there, you gotta go this way, you gotta go this way,?????? he said. As he ran through the alley, Officer Anthony remembers slipping in a pool of blood. ???That was the first thing I knew,??? he said. Once he got to the Twilight???s doorway, he joined two officers who were already stacked near the door with guns drawn. A female witness suddenly appeared from nearby, probably Lexi. ???She actually had blood on her, on her clothing. She was obviously scared. I didn???t have very long contact with her,??? Officer Anthony said. ???She ran at me, directly at me, as I was running towards the door. [She was] saying, ???He???s shooting people, he???s shooting people inside.??? All I said was, ???Go, go, go.??? It didn???t appear that she was injured??? I just wanted her to get immediately out of the area so we could address the threat inside the bar,??? he said. Anthony saw ???a couple other people towards the dumpster. I didn???t notice exactly who was there or what they were doing,??? he said. (It???s likely he was referring to me, outside with Steve. Greg was with us too, but he was around the corner and out of Officer Anthony???s view.)Moving swiftly, Officer Anthony positioned himself alongside the entrance. ???I think training just kicked in. It almost becomes second nature, habit if you will, that we respond in the way that we???re supposed to,??? he said. Officer Anthony didn???t find out who was behind him until much later, but he and the others had automatically formed an entry team. ???It???s what we call a Diamond Formation,??? said Sergeant Marc???he???d supervised the officers that night and provided separate testimony. As the sergeant explained,",100
91," one person goes in front, two are off to the sides, and one is at the end. The unit moves together, while each person covers a unique section of the room in accordance with his position. The formation ???gives a more concentrated front, and it???s the greatest field of view, with the most eyes out. The men aren???t stacked up right behind each other, looking at somebody???s back,??? he said. ???We move these folks in very quickly, giving loud verbal commands, and then we would move to what we call contact. That is, making eye contact or voice contact with the suspect. At that point, we try to either start some kind of negotiation or, we stop the acts of violence through force??? Generally, it???s deadly force at that time, sir.???As explained in court, the officer???s formation response was in compliance with their active-shooter training, according to Sergeant Marc along with the lead investigator Detective Frank. As police guidelines indicate, someone is considered an active shooter if he is armed, if he has potential victims in place, and if he has made an action to do harm. The strategy was developed just after the Columbine shooting. ???It was determined we needed to have a more viable option of how to interdict these folks while they were actively harming people,??? said Sergeant Marc. ???Instead of responding by doing stopping and containing, as police officers historically have been taught, they are taught to immediately form what we call an entry team, to enter the affected area and to address and eliminate the threat as quickly as possible before there could be any more loss of life,??? said Detective Frank.Let???s get back to the Twilight now. As Sergeant Marc described, the structure of the building???s entrance created more obstacles for his team. The door rests in a small cove at the end of a slanted walkway, and ???it???s a very tight space in there. It???s what we could call a Fatal Funnel, which is where we have very limited movement laterally. So if someone was to try to harm us, or shoot at us, or throw something at us, we don???t have very much protection. There???s always potentials for ricochets, and if you can???t move, you???re always able to get hit,??? he said. ???That???s our most vulnerable point, when we???re forced to go through that door, and the bad guys know it. We???re wanting to limit the amount of people that we???re gonna put in. My goal is to clear that Fatal Funnel as quickly as I can, and get the [officers] into a more open space where we can take advantage of cover.???Photo Credit: Seattle Police DepartmentOver the course of your character arc do you pick any of the following: petty fights with tertiary characters?

The woman before him in the grocery line who didn???t put down the divider bar, meaning he had to reach for it himself?Were you the one who went to HR about Michelle???s hand lotion? You were, weren???t you? Do you have documentation for your fragrance sensitivity? Or is it simply that Mama also used to smell of cotton and tuberose?Seriously. Have you considered getting help?And speaking of: have you ever just let anything go? Even once in your entire life? We???re not saying Michelle is perfect (she has that adorable gap between her two front teeth that she???s so insecure about). But she keeps her grudges appropriate: she only looks at her ex???s Instagram every few days and sometimes texts her besties about his new girlfriend???s weird earlobes. She doesn???t keep an itemized list ??? a list, I ask you! ??? of names and addresses. Michelle has never googled ???EpiPen failure???; Michelle doesn???t soothe herself at night saying he is deathly allergic to bees, remember, he is nothing, a bug could kill him, he is deathly allergic to bees.At your last performance review, did you really offer Humbert Humbert and Raskolnikov as counterpoints? Be reasonable. It???s not that they???re men, it???s that they???re classics. Out of your league and deeply philosophical. Do you realize how arrogant your argument comes off? Have you noticed how Michelle is never arrogant? And she???s pretty accomplished. That orchid at her desk is thriving, despite this crappy office light! Would it be too much to suggest Michelle narrate? You???re a little intense to carry a whole book, but you???d make a memorable foil.Wait. Did you just imply Michelle lacks depth? Listen, she???s got back-story. The ex. The Instagram. The perfect sister who went to law school and is getting married next month. The hapless crush on Dan with the accent who lives downstairs. Plus the orchids. They could really do something with the orchids for cover art.Does the reading public want to, say, hang out and grab a beer with you? You do drink, right? Of course. Like Mama, who took her coffee well Irished. Does the boy at the bottle shop know your name? No? Are you so drab that it doesn???t register: every day the same woman of indiscriminate age, same woman of indiscriminate features, same ten years out of fashion coat, same discounted bottle of Chablis?Have you been taking care of yourself? You???d feel a lot better if you did. Look at Michelle and her besties. Mani-pedis, once a month. What? You know the trick to the perfect manicure? You never chip it? Even when you ??? what???s that? ??? work with your hands? A quick soak and swipe of a Q-tip to get the grit out from underneath. Oh, that hard earned grit: dirt from land on which you have trespassed and stalk sap and errant orchid petals, leaving your nails polished and perfect and sharp.- - -I keep two important items on my key ring. The first is my Army-issued ID tag, which I wore on a chain around my neck every single day from August 25, 2005, to December 6, 2006, when I was deployed in Baghdad. It was with me in good times (I???m in the front row, center) and bad. I???m not superstitious, but seeing the ID tag is comforting to me. Subconsciously, I think it protected me, and now it reminds me that no matter how bad a day I might be having, I???ve had it worse and survived.The ID tag (we were told never to call them ???dog tags???) also represents a different me than the person I am now. It says I???m ???METH-CH??? ??? Methodist Christian ??? even though I???d long been agnostic when the tag was issued. I only listed my parents??? faith to give them comfort in case I didn???t make it home. But now it gives me comfort, even if it isn???t accurate.When I think about that time in Baghdad, I remember the moment it all became real. We were told to use Sharpies to write our blood type on just about everything: our boots, our helmet covers, our body armor. This was in case we were injured and a blood transfusion needed ",100
92,"to be expedited. There???s something very humbling and fatalistic about writing your blood type on your boots ??? it feels like you???re attaching your own toe tag. But it???s important, so my key ring also includes my Oklahoma Blood Institute tag listing my blood type.

Let us count the ways.And this, my friends, is probably the first reason that Elizabeth Barrett Browning (let???s call her EBB for the sake of brevity) should be pissed off. People use and misuse, appropriate and massage her poetry to suit their needs, as I did above. Why can???t we just leave this poor poem alone?The original poem is part of a collection of 44 sonnets called Sonnets from the Portuguese. She wrote them for her husband, Robert Browning, who knew they were brilliant and urged her to publish them. She titled them as she did because the sonnets were deeply personal and she wanted people to think that they had been translated rather than written about her own marriage.Nice try, Liz. We see through your little scheme.The most famous of the sonnets, number 43, is the one I butchered in those first two sentences. People read it as a breathless love poem where EBB is basically inarticulate with love. (Kind of a stupid assumption about someone who lived her whole life as a poet and also married a poet. Let???s see if we can think of two people more unlikely to be inarticulate??? nope.) In fact, as my brilliant (now retired) University of North Dakota professor and international EBB scholar, Sandra Donaldson, pointed out to my enthralled grad school class, EBB is very articulate in this sonnet, almost scientific. She asks, ???How do I love thee???? and then states ???Let me count the ways,??? before going on to, yes, essentially count the ways. In a series of statements beginning with ???I love thee,??? she details her love for her husband.Aside from misreadings and bastardizations of her work, the other reasons EBB should be pissed off include our lack of attention to her political work. This is not to say that she was a politician, but she did take on important issues in her poetry. Case in point: her poem, ???The Cry of the Children.???They look up, with their pale and sunken faces,And their look is dread to see??????How long,??? they say, ???how long, O cruel nation,Will you stand, to move the world, on a child???s heart??????I???ve messed up her brilliant rhyme scheme by giving you only these excerpts, but I wanted you to get the imagery and call to action that is in the poem. Doesn???t it make you want to travel back in time and at the very least take all of the children working in factories out for ice cream? Poor kids. (Literally.)In 1843, when EBB published ???The Cry of the Children,??? factory acts had restricted children???s workdays in textile factories to 12 hours for 11-to-18-year-olds and 8 hours for 9-to-11-year-olds. In other industries such as coal mines, chimney sweeping, iron works, and more, children as young as five years old worked 16 hour days.Yeh. Puts our lives in some perspective, no? (I say we all agree to hold this information over the heads of children spending their summers bickering and driving adults crazy. ???That???s right, kids???I will turn this car around and send you back in time to a Victorian factory! At the very least I will make you start sewing your own underwear out of wool and then we???ll see what???s worth whining about.???)The year after EBB???s poem was published, legislation was changed again to improve working conditions for children. This is not a coincidence, and yet people have forgotten how influential her work was.EBB also took on slavery, which is complicated for her because her family was from Jamaica (EBB was the first of her family born in England) and made their fortune through plantations that used slave labor. This didn???t stop EBB; in fact, it motivated her to work against slavery in her poetry. She wrote The Runaway Slave at Pilgrim???s Point from the perspective of a slave woman: ???So the white men brought the shame ere long / To strangle the sob of my agony.???Lastly, EBB should be pissed because after her death her husband, Robert Browning, eclipsed her fame and reputation. Now, Robert Browning was an incredible poet who deserves his place in history, but EBB was almost Poet Laureate in her lifetime (she lived 1806-1861). She lost out to Tennyson, but it???s a huge deal, especially when you consider that Britain did not appoint a female Poet Laureate until 2009.EBB lived one of the most endearing literary love stories of all time. She had one son whom they nicknamed (so appropriately) Pen, and, like a hipster before her time, she refused to have his hair cut. She moved to Italy with her little family in an attempt to revive her health, which worked for a while. She helped change laws and get silenced voices heard. She hob-knobbed with the literary eli",100
93,"te of her day. She wrote brilliantly and she knew it, setting high expectations for herself and her work.She deserves to be pissed off. She deserves to be re-read.Moonshiney HouseThe bright copper exterior of this house hints at its function as an alcohol-producing pressure vessel. The light of the moon is all you???ll need to operate the system, and having everything in your life within arm???s reach is very convenient when you go blind from sampling a little too much of the product. A positive ventilation system safely evacuates ethanol vapors.Briny HouseA tiny house with a miniature desalinization plant built in, perfect for siting on beaches, salt-marshes or mangroves, or wherever sources of freshwater are absent. The salty byproduct is used to cure meats and perishable foods, eliminating the need for a refrigerator, freeing up valuable floor-space, enhancing the home???s self-sufficiency and minimizing its carbon footprint.Whiny HouseFeatures interior walls and surfaces of moan-absorbing materials, to deaden the sound of the occupants??? laments over the ???tininess??? of their homes, aggravated by the perpetual banging of one???s head on the low ceiling of a loft bed, or having no closet space for Kohl???s Door Busters.Unconfiney HouseOne in which the homeowners continually urge us to marvel with them at how ???full sized??? various appliances and conveniences are, how fully the drawers open, how pots and pans are not small, how surely there???s no difference whatsoever between a life lived in 200 square feet vs. 2500. And look: the composting toilet is full-sized, too!Heiny HouseNot the booty or derri??re, actually a ???Heineken House???. The authentic recycled green bottle-glass windows are the subject of much controversy, claimed by competing tiny-house builders to cause the home???s contents to become ???light-struck???, resulting in a ???skunky??? atmosphere inside. Brown glass windows offered as an option.Pliny the Elder HouseIn honor of the Roman commander and admiral, author and naturalist, who led his troops to survive the debris falling from the eruption of Mount Vesuvius by having them tie pillows atop their heads. A ???Pliny??? is equipped with a soft, flexible roof that can deflect meteors, tree limbs, and other falling objects.Co-Signy HouseA property in which the guarantor of the mortgage is given a master key to the property and rights of ingress for non-payment. In the case of trailer-mounted homes, the key also opens wheel-locks which the surety can disengage to allow retrieval out from under the deadbeat???s nose, if it should come to that. Not to be confused with the Cosiney House a dwelling in which all horizontal surfaces are inverted bell-curves.Einsteiny HouseLight inside a tiny house is easily ???bent,??? proving ???gravitational lensing.??? Next, Schr??dinger???s cat, leaping from the loft bed onto the head of a homeowner reclining below, and unable to avoid because the light in the tiny space is bent, will feel heavier on impact than when sleeping on one???s lap, proving ???E=mc 2???. Finally, because the house is so small, family members, in-laws, and next-of-kin are the least likely to visit, proof of ???relativity.???Palestiney HouseWith support from groups on both sides of the conflict, this house is designed so that it deflects undamaged off the blades of bulldozers, avoiding demolition, allowing for resettlement. This effectively eliminates the significance of either building new homes, or rebuilding razed ones as political acts in disputed lands.Mastermindy HouseOne look at Elon Musk, and you can understand why he thinks there???s a one-in-one-billion chance that we???re not living in some higher intelligence???s video game. Probably his. Add your name to the waiting list for the house that runs entirely on batteries, features gullwing doors, the lowest drag coefficient and largest panoramic sunroof of any tiny house, and can drive itself to its destination lot.I have a lot of freedom when it comes to what I do with my body. I can make it dance. I can take it to the bank. I can dress it up in footie pajamas and go for a walk. Last week, for no reason, I read a few books to my body and then we built a boat together. Honestly, if you asked me to think of one thing that I can???t do with my body, I wouldn???t be able to think of one thing that isn???t outside the bounds of our physical universe.But that???s the problem. I???m starting to feel overwhelmed by the sheer number of things I can do with my body. It???s making it hard to even get my body and me out of bed. Should I take my body to the movies on a skateboard, or should I let my body pee in the woods?  Should I paint some fake abs on my body, or should I help my body fulfill its lifelong dream of being a successful small business owner? These are the kinds of questions I struggle with every day.I???m tired of this struggle, and have therefore decided that I no longer want to tell myself what to do with my body. Please, will someone just tell me what to do with my body?I???m jealous of those people that I meet who are being told by other people what to do with their bodies. I???m also befuddled by their insistence that others NOT tell them what to do with their bodies. How are these people not completely exhausted, as I am, by the sheer infinity of choices for what to do with one???s body? The Bible tells us we should never turn away free, unsolicited advice. So here???s my free, unsolicited advice to anyone who desires complete body autonomy: Be careful what you wish for.???My body, my choice,??? these body micromanagers might say.???My body, my reason for not getting any quality me-time,??? I might say back.You see, the problem is that, sometimes, the body has a mind of its own. This can make telling the body what do akin to raising an ornery child. Let???s say you need to go to the DMV to renew your license, but your body wants to stay home and organize your cookbooks by ethnicity? What do you do in that situation? Go to the DMV and you and your body will end up standing in a long line for several hours. Organize the cookbooks, and you and your body may become locked in a futile argument about who takes precedence when it comes to Mexinese Fusion cuisine.These are the kinds of debilitating scenarios that confront people like me who are cursed with the freedom to choose what to do with our bodies.Life would just be so much less stressful for me if I had some sort of objective third party or emotionally detached governing body that could tell my body what to do some of the time. Emphasis on the word some. It???s not like I don???t want to have some input on what my body does, especially on weekends and during vacations. That would be crazy.I think what I really want is a stern nanny who can come over for about for about 40 to 60 hours a week and take over some of the decision-making responsibility. I want him or her to handle the big ones, like deciding what my body eats and where my body goes and or how my body dresses. That way, I can focus on the more interesting minutiae. Just think of how much ground I can cover with my Criterion Collection if I didn???t have to tell my body who to love?With all of this in mind, I would like to announce that I am now accepting applications for a full time Body Nanny. If you are interested in telling me what to do with my body, please provide a resume and three professional references. Or you can just suggest a few things I should do with my body while we???re waiting in line for coffee. I promise to make my body do whatever you say.Dear Lululemon Yoga Pants ???This CEASE AND DESIST ORDER is to inform you that your persistent act",100

It???s getting toward the end of this movie about a trial, and it???s time for me to rise from my chair and make one last heartfelt speech about why my client is innocent.Now, I know the events leading up to this moment have all but confirmed this case is doomed.  We???ve had numerous obstacles and curveballs thrown at us by the prosecution. Every promising lead turned into a dead end. I???ve struggled to overcome interpersonal conflict with my defense team. At times, I???ve made poor decisions consistent with my character flaws.I???ve had to take a hard look at my personal issues. But I want you to know something, judge and prosecution lead attorney/love interest I???m trying to win over, and it???s this: I???ve overcome these flaws and combined that with my already-existing positive character traits to become a better person. Heck, I???ve even learned a thing or two about what justice actually means in the broadest sense of the word.You see, not long ago, when everything reached peak hopeless, someone mentioned something very innocuous. Something that jogged my memory and sparked a connection to a seemingly innocent moment from earlier in the trial. I snapped into action at this final shot at redemption.  I breathlessly gave my team orders even though they were visibly flummoxed. In fact, they still don???t understand fully what???s going on and their every trust in me hangs in the balance. You see I didn???t have enough time to explain what was going through my head, I only had the exact amount of time needed to procure this bag of evidence I am now holding in the air. I hear the prosecution scoff that I???ve once again missed the mark with another red herring, but as soon as I seamlessly articulate its subtle, yet irrefutable and incriminating connection to the crime at hand, everyone in this court room will understand it proves my client is innocent.While the opposing prosecution is now trying to shut me up by forcefully objecting about something related to proper procedure, I???m going to shout her down because I???ve just poured a full tank of gasoline into the metaphorical steamroller of justice, and I???m not getting off until I???ve paved this courtroom with righteousness.Your honor, I rest my case, and I await your banging of the gavel to silence the ensuing hubbu",100
96,"b from this shocked, packed court room!- -In 1982, when I was 10 years old, my family moved to from Sharon, Mass., a small town about halfway between Boston and Providence, to Los Angeles.California represented a huge culture shift for me. I didn???t have any Vans skater shoes, Town & Country Surf T-shirts, or corduroy OP shorts. But I figured I could bond with the other kids though sports, so I wanted to get some apparel featuring the logo of my favorite team, the New England Patriots.At the time, the Patriots weren???t the national powerhouse they are today, and internet shopping didn???t yet exist. So I did what any ambitious kid would do in 1982: I mailed a handwritten letter to the Patriots??? front office and explained that I was a Patriots fan stuck on the west coast, desperately wanting to support the team and represent my fandom.Sure enough, they wrote back. I wish I still had the reply letter and the sticker they enclosed. Alas, those are gone, but I do still have the Patriots key ring they sent. I???ve used it for my keys ever since.I still live in southern California and still root for the Patriots from afar. As it happens, a few weeks back I thought I had lost my keys (fortunately, I later found them). This was initially troubling because I don???t have a spare car key. But I was really more stressed by the prospect of losing that Patriots key ring. Car keys are replaceable; a gift sent from my favorite team???s front office in 1982, not so much.I get it. You love New York. You grew up there. And sure, it???s a New York classic. But once you experience West Coast crippling anxiety, you won???t want crippling anxiety from anywhere else.Yes, New York is known for its crippling anxiety; it???s a trademark of the culture. Crippling anxiety most anywhere else just makes you miss the Big Apple. It???s hard to know what makes the crippling anxiety in New York so good. Some people say it???s the water. While I fear drinking from the tap and can vividly imagine someone poisoning the reservoir, that???s not what makes the crippling anxiety in New York so special to me. It???s the people who make it. Like that little old man in the shop on the corner, who came over on a boat from Italy when he was a child. Every morning he opens up at 6 AM, you walk in at noon, and he gives you that hot, piping screaming match you???ve been looking forward to all day. Just like your mother used to make. It???s real. It???s authentic. It???s New York.You???ll always have a special place in your heart for New York crippling anxiety. But don???t look at West Coast crippling anxiety as something that needs to be compared to New York. Just think of it as an exciting chance to try something different. For starters, the crippling anxiety on the West Coast is more organic, and comes from things that are much more in tune with the environment.There???s the beach, where you can think about sinking into the sand as nobody hears your muffled screams. The surf, which can pull you out into the ocean amidst your muffled screams. And the sun is always shining, which is perfect for worrying about that new weird mole on your neck while you???re being crushed by the sand or surf.There are brush fires, there are earthquakes, there are avocados. Yes, they???re all things that you wouldn???t necessarily associate with crippling anxiety, but once they???re in the mix, you won???t be able to remember crippling anxiety without them.Sure, the West Coast is not New York. You can???t just walk down to the corner to find a source of crippling anxiety at the end of the block. You need to take a car everywhere to really get that crippling anxiety you???re craving. But maybe that drive ??? and that journey ??? makes the crippling anxiety all the more rewarding.So, please, don???t dismiss West Coast crippling anxiety right away. Give it a chance. In time I think you???ll find it has its own merits, just like New York???s.Just make sure you stay away from that highly overrated Chicago crippling anxiety. That stuff is a deep-dish mess.- -Jews throw seriously awesome parties. I haven???t had to go to the grocery store in four years. Every bar and bat mitzvah has so much food I make out with a full duffel bag of pigs in a blanket, chicken tenders, and crudit??. And they hand out an insane amount of swag. I???ve got plastic fedoras and inflatable guitars up the wazoo and you???d be surprised how useful they are. I always have something to put guacamole in and I???m going to sew the guitars together to make a rockin??? raincoat. I even got this really cool gumball machine filled with blue and white candies that says, ???Josh???s Bar Mitzvah Was Sweet!??? on it and it???s a great conversation starter. I have literally 500 miniature chocolate Torahs from Hannah???s bat mitzvah. I heard it was because Rachel had just had them at hers, so obviously Hannah couldn???t let her friends see them or that would have been so embarrassing. Thanks to Eric I have all the sports balls I???ll ever need and they???re all saying exactly what I was thinking the morning after his bar mitzvah, ???I Had a Ball at Eric???s Bar Mitzvah!???

I am Morgma the Mauler, harvester of souls, and lord of your local apartment rentals.  No doubt you have come prepared to wage battle and earn a fantastic living space.  I can tell by your puny and crumpled slacks that you have been sleeping on a friend???s couch.  Or perhaps you recently moved to this city expecting a quaint studio with vaulted ceilings and exposed brick walls.  Well, be forewarned, it is your foolhardy hope that gives me power!Morgma has trained long and hard for this battle.  While you were but a babe, Morgma was squatting oak trees and growing muscular high-pressure sales tactics.  While you were stoned in college, Morgma was slipping impossible apartment standards into your afternoon Friends and Sex in the City marathons.  Yes!  Morgma was once an aspiring set designer and possesses a devious minor in art history!Are you ready?  Do you feel agile, mortal?  For apartments under Morgma???s rule move quickly.   Rentals you saw posted merely an hour prior may disappear like ships in a squall.   Morgma demands you be ready to sign a three-year lease without giving a second thought to the substance oozing from the oven.  Morgma also demands that you arrive with a briefcase of cash and a tupperware of your dignity.   Do you have your social security number and childhood memories?  For Morgma demands these as well.Each skull that festoons my iron gorget represents a soul that I have conquered.  This one is Becky, who now sits dead-eyed in a lightless studio with lazy plumbing.  This one is Tucker.  He wakes in a cold sweat each dawn on the southern end of Penn Ave.  Your wide-eyed terror pleases me, child, for he lives even south of the strip malls.  HA!  Yes!

Can you organize the twenty-seven tabs you opened?  You had better, for it is only the beginning!  Do not be distracted by the exclamation points and flippant capitalization.  Do not dare ignore the ???sub-patio level??? snare in this description ??? for it spells your doom!Your skills are weak, mortal.  Morgma has not yet summoned his noisy neighbors or false promise that the unit will be professionally cleaned!  Can you fight on?  Will you drive across town for another showing?  This time prepare to surrender your very soul and also your quarters, for Morgma has only installed one shared washer/dryer for forty units!  And the cost is $4 per load!!  This is Morgma???s fury!!Morgma can see your strength fading.  Are you willing to settle for this disfigured studio with a carpet the color of weak tea?  In your moment of defeat Morgma demands more ??? you must pay an application fee!  Even to compromise, you must pay me three months??? rent and your ability to taste ice cream.  Morgma demands your complete surrender, a signature, and initials next to paragraph three.This battle was fun, mortal, but by the signed 32-page contract in my scarred grasp, Morgma has defeated you.Your tears amuse me.  Do not dwell on your friend Tara who inexplicably landed a rent-controlled corner unit.   Only a lucky handful can slip by Morgma.   Now your soul belongs to me.

As my significant other, you have every right to be upset. But, as I???ve said many times: I love you, but our happiness doesn???t fit my personal brand narrative strategy.My market research shows that nihilism is hot right now. Malcontent millennials tend to share posts significantly more if they contain phrases like ???I???m dead inside??? or ???I???m am consumed by despair.??? So, while I do love you and love the life we share together, expressing that joy on social media would undo all the work I???ve put into carefully crafting my personal brand???s ???voice.??? It???s called strategy for a reason, babe.I have 665 followers on Twitter ??? that???s almost 700. Can you imagine what would happen if all of the sudden my personal brand narrative went from self-deprecating existential musings to ???Hey guys, I???m in love!??? What would my followers think? Sure, most of them are our mutual friends and colleagues, but still, who would they turn to? I can???t bear the thought of ever finding out.If I want to have a strong brand narrative, my ???voice??? has to be consistent across all distribution channels. So, yes, that does mean captioning Instagram photos of us with ???If I had a time machine I would change everything. EVERYTHING.??? And yes, that does mean that when I check into our favorite restaurant on Facebook the caption is just that straight-line-mouth emoticon. And, yes again, that even means pinning cross-stitch patterns that say STARING INTO THE ENDLESS BLACK VOID on my Pinterest page. That???s just strong brand equity common sense.And, really, just because I am not constantly professing my love for you online doesn???t mean I don???t love you. I do love you. I tell you that all the time in private.  So, when I say ???I love you, you are my life,??? I mean it. The fact that I tweet, ???I hate my life, I want to die??? immediately afterward doesn???t change a thing.1.

Your employer has been notified of your socially stigmatized, yet lucrative, chin hair levels and you should see your salary increase in your next paycheck.Although you will soon receive ",100

Will they pick up a starting pitcher for the pennant run? Let???s go to the phones. Donnie from Dundalk, you???re on 105.7 The Fan.DONNIE FROM DUNDALK: Hey, my thing is, why don???t they just go out and get a good starting pitcher? Thanks for taking my call, and I???ll take my answer on the air.HOST: Well, it???s pretty simple, Donnie. There are only a handful of decent starting pitchers available and just about every team wants them. So it???s a supply-and-demand thing. Not enough quality arms to go around, and the ones that are available are very expensive.DONNIE: Right. I think they should get what???s-his-name, from Chicago.HOST: If you???re talking about Chris Sale, Chicago has said repeatedly they???re not selling him, no matter what.DONNIE: Yeah, him. I think they should go get him.HOST: Chicago???s not selling him, Donnie.DONNIE: I think they should do a trade for him.HOST: OK. Well, teams are asking for a heavy price. What do you suggest the Birds do? Trade their All-Star centerfielder and their All-Star catcher and half their bullpen?DONNIE: Perfect.HOST: I was kidding. What I just proposed is unreasonable.DONNIE: Sounds pretty cut-and-dried to me, buddy. So, hey, listen, I was thinking, while they???re at it, why don???t they get two good starting pitchers?HOST: That???s really, really unreasonable. That would cost something like, I don???t know, eight hundred million dollars.DONNIE: Bingo. Let???s do it. Great show.HOST: OK, next caller. Fred from Aberdeen. Talk some sense to me, buddy.FRED FROM ABERDEEN: Why don???t we send some boys out to Chicago, drug that good pitcher they got, and put him in a truck back to Baltimore?HOST: Um, OK. We???re talking felonies now. Next caller. Damon from Catonsville.DAMON: One word: Clones.HOST: Patrick from Remington, go, buddy.PATRICK FROM REMINGTON: I think they should buy one of those pitching machines and throw it out there on the mound and crank it up to like fuckin??? infinity, man.HOST: Jesus Christ, language, people. Stacie from Washington.STACIE FROM WASHINGTON: I???ve been thinking about these pitchers who shoot laser-beam baseballs.HOST: It sounded like you said ???laser-beam baseballs.???STACIE: Yeah.

Jamal from West Baltimore. Go, please.JAMAL FROM WEST BALTIMORE: I wanted to get in on this laser thing.HOST: What the last caller, just 10 seconds ago, was talking about?JAMAL: Yeah, my thing is, I think the laser-beam baseballs should be on fire.HOST: How???what am I saying????how is that even possible?JAMAL: And the baseballs should be invisible.HOST: Matt from Stoneleigh.MATT FROM STONELEIGH: The pitchers should be invisible.HOST: Jill from Arbutus.JILL FROM ARBUTUS: Pitchers who can do mind control.HOST: Magan from Mount Vernon, talk some sense, please. Please.MAGAN FROM MOUNT VERNON: I don???t have anything to say about trades, but I wanted to say something about strategy.HOST: Finally, some sense. What do you got, Magan.MAGAN: You know how in that movie Stand by Me how that fat guy drinks the poison and throws up on everyone at the pie-eating contest?HOST: OK, yeah. But what does that have to do???MAGAN: I think the Birds should do that.HOST: You want the Birds to throw up on the other team?MAGAN: Oh, no, that would be crazy.HOST: Oh, wow. Good. I was thinking you meant???MAGAN: They should poison the other teams, is what I meant.HOST: What is happening?MAGAN: I don???t know how to make this any clearer.HOST: You???re still on the air?!MAGAN: Fuck yeah, I am.HOST: I???m out of ideas with you people. This is very dangerous territory. Let???s take one more call. Kenny from Park Heights, you???re on 105.7 The Fan, or what???s left of it.

Thanks for the sanity, Kenny.KENNY: You didn???t let me finish.HOST: Oh, no.KENNY: A lefty hologram. Very hard to hit.HOST: Let???s take a break. Next up, what do the Ravens need to upgrade to compete in a competitive football division? I see the phones are already lit up. Please help me.Q: You worked in a law office.A: It was 1994, I think. I was in college, and I saw an ad in the paper for help in a small office. When I say small???it was small. It was one attorney and me.His area of practice was family law so he handled divorces, adoptions, paternity suits??? The stuff he worked on was down and dirty.I saw a lot of bad cases because he was often appointed by the court as the guardian ad litem for kids. So, if parents were getting a divorce, the mom had her lawyer and the dad had his lawyer, and if things get really nasty, the kids would get their own lawyer issued by the judge. They are meant to look out for what???s best for the kids.So when the kids get their own attorney, that???s when cases get particularly gruesome.Q: So you saw a lot of nasty divorces.A: Yes. Which sounds sad, but sometimes it was actually funny. The way people acted was shocking to me. The pettiness was beyond anything I???d ever seen.One couple I???ll never forget for the rest of my life. They hated each other???s guts. It was like ???War of the Roses.??? Neither one of them were likeable so their constant bickering was hilarious. At one point, they were dividing up their household goods, and I had to go to their house with a notebook and pen and a sheriff???s deputy. And we stood there watching two people fight over plates.The ",100
99,"husband was a police officer, but on the side, he had a business doing bathroom renovations. At one point, the two of them were literally fighting over a toilet in the front yard. He had one side of the bowl and she was holding onto the other.I was at this job for three years and this couple was fighting for two of it.They had both started dating other people, and I???m sure it was completely out of spite. The man the wife was dating???his last name was Enos. This was a long time ago and the ex-husband was able to change the message on their home answering machine so it would say, ???Hi. You have reached the Penises, please leave a message.???Then the husband was dating a woman that the wife claimed was fat, and the wife would only refer to her as ???BonBon Bitch.??? She???d never use her name. Even in our office. It was always ???BonBon Bitch.???Oh! And here???s an interesting sidebar: I had quit my job there and fast-forward seven years later???I???m in a carpet store and a woman working there is helping me. She looks soooo familiar but I can???t quite place her. Then, in the middle of our carpet conversation, she works in a complaint about her jerk-off ex-husband. And bam??? it was her. Crazy, divorce lady! It all came back to me.Q: Eek. What else can you tell me about the job?A: It was probably the most interesting job I ever had. It was such a small office that I did everything there. I washed windows, I hand-delivered divorce papers.Q: You had to serve divorce papers?A: Right. I???d go to someone???s place of employment and say, ???Can you page so-and-so???? And then some poor guy would show up and I???d ask him, ???Are you Joe Dirt???? or whatever. He???d say yea, and I would hand him an envelope with divorce papers. I had to watch them open it to prove they???d been served, and then I???d get the hell out.There were other times I went to people???s houses. You develop a knock???thump thump thump???like you mean business. I remember going to an apartment where the door was made from painted plywood and there was a glob of dried blood on it, like in a classic, crime scene ???spatter??? pattern. That guy didn???t answer the door, thank God.But it was all about the knock. Just use the side part of your fist like a hammer. Even today a lot of people tell me, ???You knock like you???re serving a warrant!??? I???m pretty proud of that.Q: This seems crazy. Would you do something like this today?A: No.Some of the stuff I was asked to do was pretty crappy, looking back on it. And dangerous. But there was never a dull moment. One time, a client paid the lawyer with a baby pig. So that day, I babysat a pig.What I remember was that I wanted to pick it up and hug it and it was like, ???Weeeeeeee!??? and kicked the crap out of me. And it stunk so bad???it smelled like pig shit. That???s the kind of oddball weirdo shit that was always happening. I remember thinking, ???Wow, I didn???t know pigs were currency.???Q: Nice. What other kinds of cases did the lawyer have?A: Adoptions, which were happy. Usually it was grandparents adopting grandkids because the parents were unfit.And so many kids went to foster care. These were kids from women on the edges of society. In some cases, the moment the child was born, the state would take it from them because the mothers were unfit. There was a case like that with one lady. She had a baby and it was taken from her because, years before, she scalded her baby to death in a hot bathtub. It was an accident and she was crazy so she put the baby???s body in a metal trash can and filled it with cement. She moved that trashcan all around to every apartment she ever had until someone tipped off the cops about it.There was another lady I remember???she had 12 kids and ALL of them were taken and put in foster care. At one point the judge asked her, ???Do you know where babies come from????Q: Why is the lawyer involved in cases like these? A: He was appointed the guardian ad litem for the baby.Q: Ah, I see. Any other types of cases?A: There were also paternity suits. It went on and on, like ???That???s not my baby!??? ???Oh yeah it is!??? It was straight-up Maury Povich. The guy would swear up and down that the baby wasn???t his but he would be court ordered to take a blood test. And, guess what? It was ALWAYS the guy???s baby.Q: This seems so interesting.A: It was fun, and I learned a lot. It happened at a formative time in my life though. I was getting my journalism degree and I thought about going to law school, but this job killed that dream.I???d meet a lot of different lawyers and I???d ask them, ???If you could go back and do it again, would you choose to be an attorney???? and not one person ever said yes. Not one! That was pretty revealing.You deal with a lot of dirtbags in that job. I think it sandpapers away the shiny parts of your soul.So far, you???ve only learned to make yourself unemployable on two continents.You spend most of your time talking about the hometown you couldn???t wait to leave.You start using the phrase ???cultural cachet??? to defend your choices.You find a tourist bar so you can get WiFi and ???places to meet people??? and just google yourself back to the tourist bar.Your phone is full of pictures of you in front of old buildings. You in front of statues. Just you.Only your debt has become worldly.You actually find yourself hoping you are boring but in an exotic way.You make friends with other expats who you would hate back home.You wake up next to someone you absolutely should not be waking up next to and you don???t know which of you is shittier for having let it happen.Moreover, you will never know, because when things are done here they never happened.  You???re told it???s a cultural thing. Which, who knows? You don???t understand the culture. Fine.It was you, though. You were shittier.You think probably no one knows who you wanted to be an ocean away from.The wolves find you, anyway.Chris Christie: Don???t even pick him up, proceed immediately to the trash. Some objects are simply too pathetic.Rudy Giuliani: Pick him up. Fondly think about how your grandfather mispronounces this man???s name. It sounds like an Italian cold cut, a deeply racist Italian cold cut. Proceed immediately to the nearest waste removal plant.Peter Thiel: You aren???t really sure how he got here. Proceed accordingly.Laura Ingraham: Now is a good time to remember that not all objects have meaning. Proceed accordingly.Ben Carson: You may be reminded of the summer you believed the devil had descended earth in the form of Gabriel Byrne in that Arnold Schwarzenegger movie. Proceed accordingly.Mike Pence: Pick him up. At this point you will have grown so bored that you???ll likely have forgotten why you picked him up in the first place. He???s sort of like that turtleneck shirt you still have from college, if that turtleneck were deeply intolerant of LGBT rights.

He may be coated with a liniment, exclusively sold at The Sharper Image. You will be familiar with the Sharper Image, it is the origin of the many objects currently taking up your overpriced storage facility in Manhattan, and the reason you???re reading this book right now. Distance yourself from any memory involving the travel companion thigh massager your Uncle Ted bought you in 2003. It???s kind of a perfect metaphor for Presidential candidate Donald Trump, but you???re too polite to get into the details of said metaphor: It shouldn???t exist, but it does.Reject the skin, which now only reminds you of your favorite Cal Ripken Jr. glove you broke in o",100

I???m fiercely intelligent, loyal, and clearly the smartest of my family. Like Jo, I too often long to be a boy so I can shed the shackles of society???s expectations: with her it was the stigma of domesticity that comes with being a perfect little woman and with me it is the baggage I carry trying to be an ideal juvenile crime-fighting anthropomorphic reptile. It???s like we???re sharing the same soul. As an inventor and writer, I just get Jo on a whole different level than my turtle siblings who have never created anything before and couldn???t possibly understand. You may also notice my close yet platonic relationship with April O???Neal, the Laurie to my Jo. You may even ???ship??? us. Well, don???t. I have my own pursuits and hopes and dreams and aspirations, and I cannot be contained by some immature yet beautiful parentless gadabout. Maybe I???ll just go and marry Casey Jones even though he seems outwardly dull and painfully moralistic and like an awful fit for me. You can???t tell me what to do! I???m the Jo March of this story, and I???ll write my own destiny.You???re probably wondering who is the Meg and who is the Beth of us turtles. You know, it???s not as clear-cut to me, but I have to go with Michelangelo being Beth. He???s got that free-spirited relaxedness about him. I get that he lacks much of Beth???s shyness, but he shows that characteristic Beth-like joy when surrounded by favorite things (kittens, knitting, chamber music, pizza, etc.). I may be a post-pubescent albeit not fully adult male, but I???ll admit I???ve shed a tear thinking about a day when Michelangelo says his nunchaku have grown too heavy and he finally succumbs to complications from some sewer-based disease. Plus, Leonardo is a closer personification (turtlification?) of Meg???s qualities: the leadership, the calmness, the maturity. If one of them is going to be Meg, it???s Leo. Also Splinter = Marmee, duh.And here???s where I realize things may get controversial, but Raphael is just sooooo Amy, am I right? Come on! I love my brothers (they are family after all!) but Raphael can be the fucking worst. Grow up, dude. You aren???t cool but crude; you are just awful. You are always flying off into petty rages and ruining all my amazing plans and, God, just everything else terrible imaginable. You are such a stupid Amy. Why not just burn my b?? staff when I???m not looking? Why not steal my job, my trip to Europe, and my girlfriend. And yes, I know I rejected April, but there are conventions here (not that I???d expect you to even try to learn them). Also, don???t you dare name your first born after Michalengelo when he tragically dies! He likes me better than you, and if Professor Casey Jones and I ever want children, I should be the one that gets to do that.I mean, I get that there are other ways one could read our relationships and interactions. If somebody insisted I was a Meg, I could see where he or she were coming from. I am, after all, quite dutiful, and I too have the pers",100
101,"onality flaw where I envy others for their fabulous wealth. Yet, while I may share these few superficial similarities with Meg, I really epitomize all the plucky good-natured iconoclasm of Jo and Raphael is absolutely a lousy rotten Amy. But, as I said, I???m willing to entertain other theories, especially theories where I am Jo March. Like, if you were going to write Ninja Turtle fan fiction, I think a good plot would be where we are all sliding along the frozen streets, but then the ice breaks and Raphael falls through an open manhole, and then I save him because I???m the hero, and I only entertain one or two thoughts of letting that asshole drown even though I really ought to just leave him to his own devices and we???d all be better off without him. Then, we all fight crime or whatever.Really, there are so many possibilities, and I want everyone to know that I am open to other points of view on the matter. I think we can all just agree though that, in an alternate universe where instead of being trained in the ways of martial arts by a giant rat before reaching legal voting age we were instead transported to a frozen wilderness thanks to a conveniently placed piece of Belle ??poque furniture, I would definitely be Peter Pevensie and Michelangelo would most likely be Lucy. Splinter could either be Aslan or Mr. Tumnus. (I can see arguments for both so I have to give it some more thought.) However, Raphael is totally Edmund, and everybody hates him.In order from most to least likely???Government provides easier access to the White House Pokestop.Hillary Clinton pledges to fight for free college for all, even if she has to pay for it herself with her Goldman Sachs blood money.All of Susan Sarandon???s movies 99-cents on iTunes.$100 gift certificate to Teespring.Tim Kaine plays more harmonica, does fewer Trump impressions.Delegates receive exactly 340 pounds of green M&M???s, Poland Spring water chilled to 36 degrees and a live boa constrictor in their green room.Joe Biden promises to cradle each delegate???s head in his lap for 30 seconds while softly stroking their temples and whispering ???malarkey??? into their ears over and over.At the end of her speech, Hillary Clinton unzips her skin suit and reveals the alien spawn we all know is lurking inside her.As she steps onto the stage, Hillary Clinton says, ???I???m proud and humbled to be our party???s nominee???JK, as a patriot, I know it???s my duty to step aside for Bernie Sanders because he is the only one who can defeat Donald Trump,??? after which she disappears in a poof of smoke as 40,000 balloons fall from the rafters and a choir of unicorns shits gold while singing Simon & Garfunkel???s ???America.???At the age of 23, I lit a dozen firecrackers and put them in my ears, nose, and mouth as a goof. When I showed my roommate, Josh, I pointed at the nametag on my chest where I???d written, ???Mr. Firecracker Face.??? He laughed for quite a while and then told me that he was going to get his camera. ???Of course,??? I said through my mouthful of novelty explosives, their fuses hissing away, ???take your time.??? The next thing I knew I was in the emergency room being treated for a condition that I later determined to be firecracker poisoning. And ever since, I???ll be completely honest with you, me occasionally no think so good.That???s why I often get frustrated when I hear all these slick politicians on television using a bunch of words I don???t understand like ???deficit??? or ???congress??? or ???law.??? But when I see Donald Trump shouting about how he???s going to make America grape again, I turn to the bucket I painted a face onto for companionship, and we both smile, reassured by the knowledge that a fresh wind is blowing in American politics.For starters, grape is my favorite flavor. I find it purple-y and refreshing. It???s also one of the only flavors I can still taste after my youthful brush with head explosions. But there???s so much more to Donald Trump???s platform than his promise to make everything in the United States taste like grape. He also talks about a lot of things that are very important to me, like his hatred of losers. And man, let me tell you, I hate losers too. When I???m playing Scrabble with my bucket/best friend and it loses, I yell at it until my face turns bright red. I say things like: ???What???s the matter with you, you loser!? Don???t you realize that you???re supposed to win games when you play them!???? And when the bucket wins and I lose, do you think I???m any less hard on myself? I am not. Because losing is simply not as good as winning and there is very little anyone could say to convince me otherwise.I also like how Donald Trump says that he will run America like a business, even though lots of people try to say they don???t know what that means. Well, I might not be the smartest guy to ever shave 30 points off his IQ with seven dollars worth of firecrackers, but it seems pretty simple to me. All he has to do is sell America Units for more money than it costs to produce them. And even if we end up taking a bath on America Units, all we have to do is find some big business loophole so we can write the whole thing off on our taxes. That???s right, if the U.S. government fails we can just stick Uncle Sam with the bill. What???s so hard to understand about that?Oh! And I haven???t even gotten to the best part yet, which is that Trump really tells it like it is. He has his own money, which means he doesn???t have to pull his punches for any special interest groups. He???s not part of the machine. No way. He???s more like the guy who sells you the machine and then leaves town disguised as an elderly woman before you realize it doesn???t work. That might sound disreputable, but think about it: That???s how he got the money so he didn???t have to be part of the machine. And so now we get to hear him tell it like it is, which, if you remember from earlier on in this paragraph, is the best part.Another important thing I took into consideration when evaluating Donald Trump as a candidate is what I like to call, ???the beer test.??? This is where you ask yourself if Donald Trump is a person you would feel comfortable having a beer with. For me the answer is a resounding yes, because the fact of the matter is that I drink beer all the time. In this regard, it helps that my best friend is in many respects still just a bucket, whose ability to hold an impressive 650 fluid ounces helps cut down on trips to the refrigerator. So not only would I be comfortable drinking with Mr. Trump, but depending on what part of the day he decided to show up, I probably wouldn???t even realize he was in the room.In conclusion, I feel Donald Trump is the clear choice for President of the United States. I look out my window these days and I don???t like what I see. Mainly that???s because my patio furniture is covered in bird poop. But also, no grapes. Listen to me, my fellow Americans: We are so close to making America grape again. This election day, I urge you all to select Hillary Clinton on your ballots, because I have it on good authority that November 8th is opposite day. In the meantime, God bless. Keep your fuses long and your grapevines longer.Sincerely, Seth Fried and Bucket the bucketThanks everybody for coming to this meeting on such short notice. Let me cut right to the chase: I???m worried about our lack of communication. I know it feels like we have a lot of meetings, but our communication is still not good enough. We need more meetings.Dale, I see you rolling your eyes. Look, I get it ??? I have six meetings today, seven tomorrow, and fourteen on Friday. I have four breakfast meet",100
102,"ings, and I???m going to eat four breakfasts, because that???s how much I care about communication. At this very moment, I???m participating in two meetings and I???m conferencing in for a third.You say ???We???ve got too many meetings!??? But all I hear is ???We don???t have enough communication!??? That???s what my mother always said, at least. The fact that we haven???t spoken in 20 years is because we don???t have good communication, and I won???t let that happen to our company.Here???s what I propose: team meetings for every portfolio; meetings for each level of management; and geographic meetings based on where your cubicle is located, to make sure that you are maximally communicating with the people around you. If there???s time, we should really add committee meetings: a kitchenette cleanliness committee meeting; a birthday patrol committee meeting; and, of course, a cubicle height committee meeting, because we still haven???t figured out whether it is acceptable office behavior to put folders on top of your cubicle to stop people from peering over the wall. I, for one, will not stand for folder-stacking, but it???s best to discuss it in a meeting. I won???t make any decisions without full communication.I appreciate Dale???s suggestion that we try some kind of shared internet calendar or intranet, rather than just having more meetings. I agree that technology could improve our communication, but there???s just no substitute for a meeting.Trust me, I???ve tried to reach out to my mother through the Internet. She didn???t respond. I found her in the Yellow Pages and sent her hundreds of Blue Mountain eCards. Nothing. She might be able to ignore her son???s love on the Internet, but she can???t ignore it in a good ol??? face-to-face meeting.I???ve heard it all before: too many meetings, no time to ???actually do your job.??? I know, I get it. You???ve seen the movie Cool Hand Luke, right? The one where that guy says ???What we have here is a failure to communicate???? That will never happen in our office. We are going to crush communication so hard that there will literally be no room for miscommunication. Am I right, guys, or am I right?Dale, I know you???re skeptical about meetings. But here???s something to not be skeptical about: the pain of being twelve years old and stranded for ten hours in a Starbucks in a parking lot on the top of Mount Rushmore because your mother didn???t specify which Starbucks we were meeting at after the kids??? program ended. I mean, it???s America ??? of course there are going to be multiple Starbucks there. All we needed was a mother-son meeting to decide which one we were going to, but instead I sat alone in a brown leather chair and stank of mocha lattes until the employees kicked me out for crying and peeing myself. Don???t you think meetings are important now, Dale? Don???t you?Let???s table this meeting???s discussion for a future meeting. I have to go call all of my mother???s neighbors in hopes that I can hear her voice in the background. I???ll see all of you back in this room in twenty minutes for our daily pre-lunch medium-to-long-term strategic planning meeting. Don???t be late ??? that???s a sign of poor communication.Let???s face it, there aren???t a lot of contenders. Star Wars, at its best, is more fun than funny.Han Solo is pretty funny, and he makes a good comedy team with Chewbacca. R2D2 and C3PO are also a decent comedy coupling, at least in the original trilogy. In The Force Awakens, former stormtrooper Finn provides many laughs. Everything in the awful prequel trilogy is a little funny???unintentionally. The Emperor is an especially campy delight, thanks to the ultra-arch acting of Ian McDiarmid. I???ll never understand why ???Talk Like the Emperor Day??? isn???t a thing.Of course, there???s a lot more to Star Wars than the movies. I???m oblivious to the old expanded universe of novels and what have you, but I???m a careful scholar of recent comics, which have led me to a conclusion as inescapable as a tractor beam: the funniest Star Wars character is Triple Zero from the current Darth Vader series. Even a nerf-herder would have to agree this that murderous protocol droid is a hoot, and I pray to the force he someday makes it into a movie.Before getting to this diabolical droid, I should mention that I???m not proud of myself for reading Star Wars comics. I???d much rather support creator-owned comics, including gems such as Saga, Southern Bastards, Powers, The Sheriff of Babylon, The Fix, and Grizzly Shark. I don???t want to give my money to Marvel, much less a Marvel licensed comic.But you never know where you???ll find something great. Believe it or not, the most visually creative comic of recent years was Transformers vs. G.I. Joe. You???d never expect the collision of two corporate toy franchises to produce a next-level Kirby-esque art book, but that???s exactly what???s happened thanks to Tom Scioli and John Barber. Similarly, ever since Marvel got the Star Wars property back, all their Star Wars comics have been good to great, but Darth Vader has been a gem.The comic???written by Kieron Gillen and illustrated by Salvador Larroca???takes place between Star Wars and The Empire Strikes Back. Vader is being blamed for the destruction of the Death Star, since everyone else who could be blamed went kaboom. The Dark Lord of the Sith is in a bit of a professional pickle, as he???s been demoted and finds himself mired in the galactic empire???s middle management, taking orders from British prigs and competing with other possible apprentices to the Emperor. On top of all that, he finds out that the pilot who blew up the Death Star is his son. So this comic is the story of Vader trying to find Luke and marshaling his own forces so he and sonny boy can take over the galaxy themselves.While marshaling said forces, Vader enlists a rogue archeologist named Dr. Aphra who has a penchant for reactivating droids who were deactivated for very good reasons. This is where Triple Zero, a literally dark version of C3PO, comes in. His first words are quite honest: ???I???m a protocol droid, specialized in etiquette, customs, translation, and torture, ma???am. Charmed to meet you, I???m sure.??? Not since Hannibal Lecter has a bloodthirsty monster been such a stickler for manners, and much like Dr. Lecter, Triple Zero is a walking clash-of-context sketch who brings buckets of black humor. He and Beetee (an evil version of R2D2 whose head conceals a zillion blasters) serve Vader while looking for people to murder, torture, and dismember. Oh, Triple Zero is also a holo-chess enthusiast. This is a droid with layers.The peak of Triple Zero???s villainy/comedy is a little plan than makes even Darth Vader shudder. Triple Zero, as a droid, is very appreciative of other droids, but realistic about their limitations: ???We are less fragile than organics. We are quicker. We are mass produced with ease. So??? Why do droids not rule? The problem: The force is??? indifferent to us.???Triple Zero lays out his elegant but icky solution with the enthusiasm of a fringe Presidential candidate: ???We drain human blood and use it to drive an engine of my own design. I have the technology. It???s a relatively simple battlefield modification. Plus ingenious extra features! They can refuel on the battlefield from injured opponents???or generous allies???by inserting a probe into an artery?????? During these lines, Triple Zero helpfully extends a needle, in case the blood-sucking horror of his proposal wasn???t clear.Darth Vader has a simple response, which you should imagine in James Earl Jones??? wonderful voice: ???No.??? The subtext is ???Hel",100
103,"l no. I am cinema???s greatest villain, and even I have the willies right now.???Aside from Gillen???s smart dialogue and plotting, Larroca???s art is consistently gorgeous throughout this series, giving you the feeling that you???re looking at stills from a lost movie. Or maybe a future movie?I realize that suggesting a movie based on a comic book is crazy talk, but if the current owners of Walt Disney???s sacred, frozen head are reading, I have one small request: make a movie based on the Gillen and Larroca Darth Vader comic, for the love of Greedo.  Disney???s already planning to release a new Star Wars movie every year, which would drain wallets as efficiently as my favorite droid would like to drain blood. I reckon I???d give blood and money to see Triple Zero, Beetee, Dr. Aphra, and the rest of Darth Vader???s wacky gang on the big screen.Hey, it???s just been confirmed that Darth Vader will be appearing in Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, so let Vader have his own movie and droids???and let me have Triple Zero, the only droid in sci-fi who could inquire, ???As there???s no one here to murder, presently, how may I be of assistance????You can???t go to his place for obvious reasons, but you aren???t willing to incur the judgment of your roommates by bringing him back to your place either. So where can your forbidden love flourish? There are loads of exciting options???1. That Bar Everyone From Work HatesRemember that time your coworkers let Chad from Finance pick the happy hour bar? It was a totally epic night for Chad, but utterly miserable for everyone who got food poisoning from the $1 oyster shooters. This place is the perfect romantic rendezvous for you and your dream guy. No one from work will ever set foot in here again, and one look at the collection of bras hanging from the ceiling will let your sweetheart know you really are a cool girl. This place practically screams, ???I???m going to be as laid back about this relationship as I am about these low sanitation scores!???2. That Place That???s Always EmptyNo one here will recognize you or your unfaithful friend-with-benefits because no one has ever eaten here. What???s it called? It doesn???t matter because it???s so generic you???ll never remember. What you will remember is the plethora of empty corner booths and tucked away tables this deserted watering hole has to offer. Sure, the Top 40 hits echoing through the empty space are a little loud, but at least it???s dark and totally off the radar??? kind of like your conscience when he starts feeling you up under the table. The abandoned atmosphere of this venue will pair perfectly with the ever-present promise of abandonment that haunts your relationship.3. The ParkThere is no more beautiful place for your ill-fated love to bloom than the great outdoors. Sure, when you pictured this scenario in your head, it involved him building a cabin upstate and holding you next to a roaring fire, but that can wait for the future. Right now you need to show him you aren???t high maintenance like those other girls. You???re not uptight. You???ll love him anywhere. Even right here in the grass under the cover of night. So what if the ground is littered with dirty needles? You???re a risk-taker. Why else would you be risking your future happiness and mental stability to be with him?4. The Back of a CabThis isn???t really a date spot per say, but then you aren???t really dating this guy are you? Besides, a yellow cab offers more privacy than you can hope to have in a bar or a restaurant. Don???t worry about the driver watching your passionate exchange. He sees this shit all the time and nothing short of slaughtering a goat in the back seat is going to make him look up. Plus, when you think about it, having his silent, third party presence is beautifully symbolic of the real third person in your relationship.5. A Back AlleyThis spot will stimulate all of your senses, and if you think making out behind an overflowing trash receptacle isn???t sexy, then you have no imagination. The rusty, metal walls of the alleyway dumpsters will shield you from the elements as well as from the unforgiving gaze of the public. What more could a girl want? Just remember, one man???s trash is another man???s treasure, and one woman???s rock bottom is another woman???s loving, mutually respectful relationship.6. A Charming Spot Down By the DocksIf you aren???t afraid of a slightly rougher crowd, then this is the place for you. Forget about all those classy dates you used to dream about; they aren???t worth the constant fear of being found out. Consider this dilapidated, seaside shack a novelty getaway from your usual haunts (sort of like role play!). Just imagine how romantic it???ll be when he tells you how much he wishes you could meet his mom right next to a dock worker with MOM tattooed on his neck.7. A Penthouse Apartment He???s RentingThis is probably the most convenient option for both of you. It???s pretty amazing that you didn???t think of it before. What your relationship has been missing all this time wasn???t trust or respect ??? it was private real estate! Having a place he can see you anytime he wants, without anyone knowing is the perfect set up (just until he ends things with his girlfriend of course). And don???t worry, this doesn???t mean he???s paying you for sex; he???s simply paying for a place to have sex with you. Because, baby, you???re worth it!1. Sit down in your favorite breakfast nook, the one that looks out upon the babbling brook, spreading chestnut tree with a tire swing, rippling corn fields, and the picture windows of your more adulterous neighbor???s bedrooms. If you do not have a chestnut tree, substitute another nut-bearing tree. Do not use birches. You???ll just embarrass yourself.2. Set up a work area equipped only with a prissy little notebook and a fancy-pants fountain pen. Brew up a pot of chamomile tea and pour yourself a spot. Take a drink. Write your name. Stop and take a drink of tea. Now look into the distance while sipping it. Say, how much tea do you think you can drink? Drink tea until your bladder screams for release. Deny yourself this release until you???ve produced 15,000 words. Write about how great it would be to pee right now. Oh God. Oh GOD.3. Set up a weekly ???date??? with a table at your favorite diner. Bring a stack of paper and pen without internet access. Gradually grow bored and create a little condiment house with the salt, pepper, sugar, jelly, ketchup, and mustard packets. Empty the shakers and burst each packet, then run your fingers through the ooze to create a swirling expressionistic tabletop landscape. Leave and never come back at the owner???s requests.4. Learn from the experts! Find a great writer online and read their work for inspiration. Become obsessed, find the author, and strangle them so their talent flows into you as the light leaves their eyes. Write about it!5. Feeling blocked halfway through a manuscript? Stick it in a drawer and leave it there for a week. Or a month. Or six months. If you wait long enough you might luck out and die and never face the soul-sucking thing again. Unless you go to Hell, where it will be waiting for you.6. Try this: Dig up Flannery O???Connor and make a soup of her bones, so as to acquire her talent through anthropophagical magic.7. Try this. Find an article you admire on the internet, copy and paste it to a Word document, then change the author???s name to your own. Now YOU wrote it!8. Bad writers borrow; good writers steal. Adequate writers perform blackmail; poor writers dabble in payola. Passable writers commit manslaughter; excellent writers lay with the beasts of the field",100

Classic fucking Safire.10. Use one of these random first lines to spark your creativity:???The writer was trying to spark his/her creativity with a first line he/she came across online, not knowing the Tripe Giant stood behind him/her, ready to carve his/her guts into bowel masks.?????????Call me Ishmael. I am captain of spaceship Radon, on a 12-year mission to have space sex with green alien women resembling Emma Watson. Except green. Stately, plump Commander Buck Mulligan came from the stairhead, bearing a bowl of space lather on which a mirror and a laser gun lay crossed. ???I bet I have more green alien sex than YOU,??? said Buck Milligan, ???You totally cannot,??? said I. Then we flew to Planet Hermione where I won and have cyborg arms.?????????I might as well pack it in,??? sighed the failed writer, ???The shame and disappointment will kill me unless I do it first.??? He/she happily eyed the nearby letter-opener as if it were a gift from God.??????The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog. ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ1234567890.

Combat writer???s block by creating a Rube Goldberg device that drops a large concrete block on your head if you stop typing. Har! Get it? Irony! That???s irony, right? Or is it metaphor? You should know. You???re the writer.12. Here???s a simple exercise. Spend at least an hour each day typing a story, preferably one with characters and scenes described in sentences, arranged in paragraph form. Continue to do so until you have 80,000 to 100,000 words. Experiment by developing a solid plot and satisfying ending while taking a few moments or months to shape the prose into a readable and compelling text. As an exercise, figure out what readers would pay money to read. For fun, pitch the story in its final form to various publishers, being sure to note that most will not publish it. Here???s a tip: find a publisher. Use this exercise as a sort of jumping-off point for other stories or ???books??? if you will. Easy peasy!- -This is my husband???s third wedding ring. Not my third husband???s wedding ring, but my only husband???s third ring.We were married in 2011. Less than a year later, David lost the original band while swimming in the Atlantic Ocean during a summer trip. We immediately went to a shop a few minutes from the beach and bought a stainless steel replacement.The following year, while visiting David???s parents in California, we threw the second ring into the Pacific Ocean as a symbolic balancing gesture and replaced it with this one, a black ceramic ring.Over the past year, David lost a lot of weight, and this ring no longer fit him, so he had to get yet another one ??? his fourth. He suggested that I put the third one on a necklace, but I decided to put it on my key ring, so it would always be with me. Few people know he???s had so many rings, so it???s kind of an inside joke. When I???m by myself and missing him and our daughter, I can slip it over my finger and think of them.It???s also a spare in case he loses his fourth one!1. His pictures consist of exactly 50% stock images of American Adult Men and 50% blurred images of TGI Fridays Baked Potato Skins.2.

But if you play your cards right, you???ll make it back to the real world (NOT THE SHOW ??? we are talking about the actual ???real??? world) by your 21st birthday!It???s hard to believe it???s been four years since we, Bernie Sanders??? true believers, proved to Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Establishment that we wouldn???t just line up like sheep and do what we were told. Whether you voted for Jill Stein, Gary Johnson or chose not to vote at all, together we proved that nothing, not Bernie???s endorsement or even our own self-interest, could derail our convictions.Though we didn???t vote Trump into office (despite what the Democrats say, they are the ones who split the vote), now that Trump???s first term is up, let???s take this opportunity to realize in just how many ways Bernie???s dream for America is still alive.DisenfranchisementAfter the 59th Amendment passed and Trump was proclaimed Emperor, the entire voting process was abolished. At long last, minorities are no longer disproportionately turned away at the polls.Immigration ReformWhether they are now states, colonies, or smoldering piles of irradiated rubble, every formerly sovereign nation has been conquered by the United States. Given that each (habitable) square foot of land in the world is technically part of the US, immigration is not really an issue.Income InequalityNow that Trump has dissolved the Federal Reserve and replaced the US dollar with his cryptocurrency ???Ivankoin,??? he single-handedly controls all the money. If you think about it, that means that income and wealth inequality has fallen to almost zero.EconomySure, people scoffed at the labor camps at first. But, it???s hard to deny the results: good jobs and affordable housing for all.Climate ChangeEver since the University Purges, the overwhelming scientific consensus is that climate change is no longer a problem. Hard to imagine Hillary turning things around that quickly for our environment.LGBTQ RightsAfter the sweeping regime of forced sterilizations, not that many LGBTQ people even want to get married anymore.Affordable EducationEvery young person that survives the annual culling receives free thought conditioning at Trump University. As a result, no one with the physical capacity to endure their re-education is saddled with crushing student loan debt.VindicationHillary has still never explained those emails.Hey there, mind if I scooch by? You know, you really should keep the walkway clear in case of an emergency. It???s just that bags too large to fit under the seat are supposed to be stowed in the overhead compartment. No, I don???t work for the airline. Just a concerned citiz ??? shhh, safety briefing???s about to start! Let???s give Megan our full and undivided attention.Sorry Megan, I???m gonna have to interrupt. 14A ??? what the hell is that? A sudoku?! What part of ???your full and undivided attention??? did you not understand? That???s it; you just lost your window seat privileges. Clearly you can???t be trusted with the emergency slide.Please continue, Megan.Am I comfortable performing these exit row duties? Uh, should passengers secure their own oxygen masks before assisting others? Duh.You know, this may be about the extra legroom for everyone else, but this is life and death stuff, people. Here, let me show you a picture, 14A. Not too pretty is it. It???s called de-gloving, and it???s what happens to the skin when it comes into contact with 800 degree jet fuel.Come on! Don???t tell me I???m the only one who took Delta???s two-day intensive seminar on exit row responsibilities.You believe these amateurs, Megan? Unreal.Okay ??? pop quiz, hot shots: how many emergency exits are there on this wide-body 747? Tick tock, tick tock. Nobody? Well congratulations, you just lost 264 souls???kids mostly; class trip to Washington, D.C. What. A. Shame. The good news is you???re dead too so you don???t have to live with the guilt. Because, believe you me, with that kinda thing on your conscience, it???s not long til you???re sucking on a revolver like a cocktail straw.Ooh that reminds me ??? Megan, can I bother you for a ginger ale? Thanks, doll.Right, while we???ve got a few moments to ourselves, I???d like to lead the Economy Plus section in some quick evacuation drills. Go ahead and grab that red handle and jerk ??? Oh, Megan, you???re back. No ginger ale, I see??? Sure I???ll take my seat, right after I???m sure ??? now don???t go alerting the captain.Oh, I???m a flight risk? No you???re the flight risk, Megan!

Digital Natives shall agree to check the WhatsApp group once every 2-3 business days, and their responses to questions from Parents will be longer than ???yep,??? ???nah,??? and thumbs up emoji.2. Parents withdraw their right to contact Digital Natives on other social media platforms once this WhatsApp group has been established. All photos of shirts on sale at Barneys that they would previously tweet at Digital Natives will instead be delivered to this Family WhatsApp group. If this clause is violated, Digital Natives have the right to sue for damages to social media presence.3. Digital Natives agree that they will not take screenshots of the Family WhatsApp group for use in any Buzzfeed list about Funny Text Messages Parents Send Their Kids. Failure to comply will grant Parents the right to recount in painful detail a true moment of weakness they have observed in the Digital Native, to a social media platform of their choice.4.  All communication within the Family WhatsApp group must take place only between the hours of 11 AM and 10 PM. Parents acknowledge that attempting to make contact with Digital Natives before 11 a.m. is unreasonable, as Digital Natives are still in bed attempting that bed yoga routine they just found on YouTube. Similarly, Digital Natives acknowledge that if a Parent???s mobile phone goes off after 10:00 p.m., they have no choice but to assume that one of the Digital Natives has been kidnapped by a drug cartel.4a. The only exception to these time restrictions are messages sent from Digital Natives to Parents that include a list of random physical symptoms and a close-up photo of the back of the Digital Natives mouth, so Parents can confirm to Digital Natives that they do not appear to have a terminal illness. In exchange for this act of generosity, Digital Natives agree to respect and tolerate the videos and memes Parents proudly share with Digital Natives, and will not mention that they saw the goat yelling like a man video six years ago.5. Digital Natives understand that it is not appropriate to outsource the",100
106,"ir messages to the Family Whatsapp Group to a writer on Freelancer.com???even if that writer???s CV does say they ???excel at giving writing a personal touch.??? Parents accept that after the 2013 Siri Racial Slur Incident, they will not use speech-to-text for any correspondence in the Family Whatsapp Group.6. Parents are restricted to sending one job advertisement per week to Digital Natives. Parents acknowledge that receiving these job ads can be hurtful for Digital natives, as if they were to apply for them, they would be compromising on their creativity.7. Digital Natives are restricted to requesting one Facebook like/share per week from a member of the Family Whatsapp Group for their confessional first-person essay about the pressures of growing up in an overbearing family.8. Even though WhatsApp uses end-to-end encryption that ensures no third-party can ever possibly decipher the data transferred, Digital Natives understand that Parents still don???t think it???s safe to discuss the exact location of the spare key for the back door.9. No GIFs.Finally, it is mutually agreed upon signing this contract that within 14 business days Parents and Digital Natives will have multiple bottles of wine at dinner and decide that the Family WhatsApp group should be shut down in favor of the usual weekly 10-15 minute Sunday telephone call.Looking for an organism who believes in ???one ocean, one phylum.???

Arielle???s hair is long and black and lightly tangled, and a silver barbell pierces her nasal bridge at eye level. She???s a bartender and lives in an artsy-industrial Seattle neighborhood. In her free time, Arielle volunteers with child refugees in the Middle East. ???As the war in Syria started, my heart was breaking,??? she says. Today we???re on the phone, but I met her in person a couple years ago, shortly after we???d witnessed a shooting at the Twilight Exit. To Arielle, the event carried a residual spookiness. ???Usually stuff like that doesn???t happen. But it???s sort of like an intricate spiderweb.Things can sometimes slip through. A fly can land on the web and get stuck there, or it can fly through a hole completely. You can be doing your normal routine. I???m sure people went to Twilight every Sunday for karaoke, and they were totally fine. But things can change in an instant.1 Maybe someone will come in with a gun and shoot you. It can happen anywhere,??? she said. ???I think we have an illusion of safety, especially as Americans. It is so false. I???m also a queer person, so I can get beat up, or I can get shot. My friends of color can get killed by police. None of us are as safe as we think we are.???Around the time of the shooting, Arielle was making coffee at a donut shop. ???I was like, ???Ugh, this is horrible.??? I didn???t like donuts to begin with. They???re too sweet. You get sick of them. You???d be surprised,??? she said. Arielle had come to the Twilight Exit for her friend???s twenty-first birthday party. ???She???s a little bit younger than I am, but not even by a year. It was my first time there. Hers too. I???d only known her a few months, but I???d gotten to know her really well. We???d worked together on a feminist/anti-rape-culture activism project with a bunch of like-minded people. We were part of a girl army,??? she said. ???I had to be at the coffee shop at five the next morning, and the bar was only a couple blocks away, so it was really convenient for me. She texted me later that night and said she was going to a different spot. I told her, ???I really wish you could go to the Twilight so you could see me.??? So she changed her plans. I know there was no way to know what would happen that night, but oh my god, if only I hadn???t been so selfish.???As Arielle was walking into the bar, she remembers ???there was some kind of commotion. I think a guy was getting kicked out. I wasn???t really paying attention. It was loud, there was stuff going on, it was karaoke night, I was in a new place,??? she said. ???There were maybe ten of us. We found a seat right by the entrance, and at one point, I went up to the bar to get my friend a drink. At the Twilight they have a birthday drink, and it???s free. It???s basically a Long Island Ice Tea, and it comes in this huge boot glass. It???s insane. There were probably umbrellas in it, I don???t remember. I just know it was huge.???The mood at Arielle???s table was festive. ???I was talking to my friend, asking her, like, ???How was your day, what did you do for your birthday???? Just stuff like that. We hadn???t been there long. Maybe fifteen or twenty minutes,??? she said. Suddenly, a gunshot sounded right outside the bar in the alleyway entrance. ???I thought it was a balloon popping at first. I was like, ???Why is there such a big balloon and why did it just pop? What the fuck is this???? We all paused, not knowing what was happening. I looked up and saw one of the bartenders, I think her name is Natalie. She was right there by the juke box. In an instant her body language tot",100
107,"ally changed. I remember focusing in on her face. It was just, like, total seriousness. All in a quick moment. I heard Greg yell. He said, ???Oh god, no. No, no, no. Call 911.??? We all scattered. Everyone was freaking out and panicking.??????My logic was: run. I just wanted to get to the opposite direction of the door. I wasn???t really looking where I was going. I was just going. I don???t know if I grabbed my friend, or if I just started running, but she was behind me. I didn???t know the layout, and I don???t think she did either,??? said Arielle. Guessing their way, the women ran past the dining area and straight into the lounge. When they approached the far wall, ???we saw we were at a dead end, and there was nowhere to run, so we huddled under the bar as quickly as possible. My friend was right in front of me, right next to me. We kept really close because it was so terrifying,??? said Arielle. When she spoke with a detective later that night, she detailed the narrow aisle from her position, with her back to the dead end. ???In my mind, I knew there were other people behind me, not very far away. Like, much less than a foot. I???d remember seeing two girls back there earlier, sitting across the bar,??? she said, referencing me and Lexi. ???I looked at them when I was ordering drinks. They were just sitting and talking. I don???t remember what they looked like, but I knew they were there. Maybe I saw Whitney too, I don???t know.???Photo Credit: Seattle Police Department.As Arielle crouched on the floor, ???I don???t think I comprehended yet that what we???d heard was a gunshot until we were under the bar. The guy came around the corner. When he stood over us, I saw he had a gun in his right hand. I could tell he was pointing the gun at somebody but I wasn???t sure who. The person was behind me so I would???ve had to turn around and make way too much movement,??? she said. ???I had a lot of disbelief. I was in shock. I remember thinking, ???There is no way this is happening. How is this happening. This doesn???t happen to me.?????? (Later that night, Arielle described the gunman James to a detective. ???He was least half-black, he was pretty light skinned. He was in his mid-20s. He wore baggy clothes. Light-gray pants and a gray shirt. I don???t know how tall he was. I mean, I was on the ground so he looked tall.???)???He looked massive,??? Arielle added when I read her this statement. ???He looked like the biggest, scariest thing in my life in that moment. He was like an arm???s reach away. He was directly across from me but even closer to my friend. She and I were side by side. We can???t plan out how we???re gonna sit when someone comes in shooting. That???s just how it happened. But I was feeling really guilty. A lot of guilt. I wanted to keep her safe. I was scared she would get hit first. That???s obviously the first target, whoever is closest. I felt bad about that for sure. But we talked about it later in a group-therapy session, and she was totally like, ???I was glad I was in front of you because I wanted to protect you.??????Although Arielle and her friend were right in front of me, we somehow didn???t notice each other. When I stood up and ran away, ???I don???t remember you leaving at all,??? said Arielle. Mostly, she was concentrating on holding still. ???I didn???t want to draw any attention to myself. My reaction was kind of like a little kid???s, like: ???If I don???t move, he won???t see me,?????? she said. ???At the time, I had no idea if he was on a wild rampage and wanted to kill lots of people or if there was just one specific target. I was thinking about the mass shootings that had been going on. They???re all running through my head: Columbine, Sandy Hook, Cafe Racer. I was like, ???OK, everyone gets shot. Mostly everyone dies.??? I was thinking, ???No one???s gonna save us.??? I figured the bullet would hit my friend first, and that it would go through her, and it would hit me. I was preparing my body as best I could. I was waiting to feel a gunshot,??? said Arielle.???I had this funny thought of, like, ???What would a normal person do in this abnormal situation? Pray? Should I pray???? I have my own spirituality, but I???m not a religious person at all. I was like, ???No. God no. Fuck that. That???s fucking bullshit. Stick to your guns here. Don???t pray. There???s no point in praying. What is that gonna do. What would I say. Like, ???Oh please, God. Please, make this stop. Please keep me from getting shot.??? That would literally do nothing. I???m gonna get shot whether or not I pray to some made-up god,?????? she said. ???I???m not trying to knock it. If someone believes in God, and that???s their thing, that???s fine. But for me it was a big moment, and I was learning about whether I believe in God like everyone else does. In that very instant, I was like, ???I don???t have any control over the situation and neither does any kind of god. This guy has all the control.??????I asked Arielle what she remembers of James in these moments. ???I didn???t look at his face. I had my head down and was looking at the wall, looking mostly down. I was thinking to myself, like, ???Don???t move, don???t look at him, don???t let him see you.??? I had no idea he was targeting his girlfriend until he started yelling at her. He said, ???Fuck you, you fucking bitch. You ruined my whole life.??? He was being very angry with her. He said, ???They took my dog,??? or ???They killed my dog. You left the door open. They stole everything.??? He mentioned something about a TV. I remember just being like, ???Really? All of this is for a TV???? I was like, ???Seriously dude. Like, what is wrong with you. You???re shooting people over what sounds like a break up or because your material possessions are gone. And now you???re ruining people???s lives over this? What the fuck is wrong with you.??????As James continued, Whitney responded. ???I think she was saying, like, ???Stop. Why are you doing this???? I heard one gunshot. I don???t know where it went,??? said Arielle. ???I didn???t hear her scream so I assumed he didn???t hit her. He yelled some more. He said, ???Why did you do this to me???? and he shot her again. It???s possible there was one more gunshot, I don???t remember,??? she said. ???I just know it was really, really loud. We were in a small area, and he was right next to us. My ears were ringing for a while afterwards,??? Arielle said. ???The smell of gunsmoke was really strong. It reminded me of my uncle???s shooting range. He lives in Montana, and when I???d visit him, we???d shoot a board in the backyard. It was still a little scary because I don???t necessarily trust guns, but it was something fun we???d all do together in my family. My grandparents would come too, they make their own bullets and stuff. That was just, like, this part of my life,??? she said. ???It was a completely different scenario.???Back to the floor. While Arielle and her friend quietly huddled together, ???the girl closest to me was trying to crawl over us and get away from him. I got kinda pissed. I thought, ???You???ve got to stop right now. You???re gonna draw attention to us and we???re gonna get shot,?????? she said.2 ???That grabbed his attention. He told us, like, ???I don???t want to hurt you guys. Get out.??? I was shocked. I was like, ???Woah, really? We can just leave???? I got up and my friend got up and before we started running, I looked back to be sure I???d grabbed my purse. What was I thinking? There was a shooter right there, and I looked back to make sure I didn???t leave anything behind! It was so insane.???Once Arielle and her friend were outside, ???we",100
108," ran around the corner and the shots came. We heard those six gunshots. Cops aren???t my favorite, but I was grateful they came that night. It was an incredibly contradictory thing. Most of the times they don???t make me feel safe, but in that instant they did. Then a few months later, on May Day, I was out, and the police were shooting rubber bullets at people,??? she said. ???I felt unsafe around the cops again, and I still do.???As far as the police???s response to James, ???I don???t know if I feel one way or the other. I don???t think it???s up to me to decide if he deserved it,??? she says. Then we go over James???s conflict with Whitney, and Arielle weighs in firmly. ???Really, this was a domestic-violence crime. This was a man proving he had more power over a woman. So, he shows up with a gun. That was something that really bothered me. Because, like, what the fuck does that even prove? It???s fucked up. It goes into the whole male-power thing. He shouldn???t have been that livid and ignorant to deal with her like that. You???re mad at your lady, or you don???t get what you want from her, so you???ll hit her, or you???ll kill her to solve the problem. Like, how is that the go-to,??? she said. ???I think it has a lot to do with how males are raised. There???s this thought of men being more powerful than women, which is 100% not true, but that???s what everyone thinks, and that???s what society has us all believe. It just creates more problems like this.???We go back to the shooting and the hours that followed. Exhausted after the waiting and the statements and the conversations with police, Arielle returned home and fell into a heavy sleep. ???The next day was super weird. I called in to work, obviously. I didn???t feel well. Maybe I hit my head on the bar or something and gave myself a mild concussion. There was this thing happening with my hearing. My ears would stop and cut out. There???d be this ringing, sort of like a tunnel. Like a faraway-sound thing. The sound in one ear would go away for a bit, but then it???d come back. It was super bizarre. Whenever that???d happen I???d start crying. It was proof physically that this thing had happened.???1 A memory pops into my head as I???m speaking to Arielle. It???s one of those things you see once and then always wonder about. It happened about a year ago, on a crowded Seattle street, near the entrance to a nightclub, on a weekend night. My friend and I were passing through, with nothing on our agenda beyond a short walk to a nearby vending machine for a couple sodas. A clearing opened before us, and we stood watching as a guy latched himself onto a policeman and pounded the cop???s back with his fists. The puncher was a white guy???a gel-haired, clean-cut, date-rapey type in a polo shirt bearing the print of a giant American flag, of all things. The cop was white also. He was locked in, taking a beating. It went on for a while. I waited in terror for the cop to pull out his gun. He never did, and neither did the several other cops stationed nearby, who kept a watchful distance. Abruptly, the white guy broke away, and then he ran off. It didn???t look like anyone caught him. Afterwards, I searched for the story in the news but never found it.2 Quickly after, ???I had another moment of, like, ???I can???t blame this girl because she???s doing what she thinks she needs to do to survive, and clearly we???re gonna have different ideas of what???s going down,?????? said Arielle. Meanwhile, in the weeks after the shooting, Lexi couldn???t shake her guilty feelings, and she used social media to locate Arielle and reach out with an apology???even if she probably didn???t need to. Things were cool between them and still are. Now and then Arielle and Lexi run into each other at music venues, and they say hi.Wearable Tech is all the rage these days. From heart health to hydration, ???wearables??? are entering many facets of our lives. Now, finally, we have a wearable that will impact your trip to the beach. No longer will you have to look down and ask yourself, Do I feel adequately ashamed of my physique?That???s why I was so stoked to review Gutties???, the swimming trunks that automatically remind you to be self-conscious. After years of testing, Zuckerberg and team finally developed an algorithm to prod and poke all your seaside insecurities. They???re handcrafted in some small village in China from and specifically designed for the average American man, who is hairy, gross, overweight, and probably shouldn???t be topless in public in the first place.Here???s how they work: While you sit lazily at a forty-five degree angle getting sunburned in a beach chair, Gutties??? are sending updates straight to your mobile device. These reminders can range from telling you how many calories are in that Bud Light Lime-A-Rita, mentioning that you didn???t have to have that second donut at work three days ago, or that, in case you forgot already, you???re actually drinking a Bud Light Lime-A-Rita.In one instance, my Gutties??? sent me a digital list of all the workouts I???d skipped this past spring, even including how many planks I could have done.Gutties???, however, go beyond the standard features of wearable technology. Microchips in the waistband keep track of everything from how poorly you???ve pleased your wife to how bad your sales numbers were in Q2. Gutties??? can even tally the number of times you???ve typed ???extra ranch??? into your Seamless orders.There???s also a feature where, through built-in speakers in the waistband, they can shout cutting insults directly to your ears.

The director of composition is chipper about a professional development opportunity at a neighboring institution and he???ll reserve space for any of the teacher-persons who want to go, the fee paid by the English Department. The invitation is for a workshop with a nationally recognized composition scholar, and ",100
109,"the teachers can carpool. For teachers, professional development means a day without teaching, but a day spent talking about teaching, and this is a welcome and often productive change. Almost as an afterthought, the director of composition ends the email by saying anyone who would like to attend the workshop who teaches on that day should arrange for a substitute to teach their classes.If you???ve never heard of substitute teachers for college classes, that???s because they don???t exist. A substitute is a teacher-person who goes from school to school, and from class to class, to sit in when the regular teacher has taken a day off. Since the students who attend high school, middle school, or elementary school are required by law to sit in those classrooms, the job of the substitute is to watch the kids, end of story. The teacher calls their principal and says they won???t be coming in that day and the principal goes down the list until someone agrees to substitute. It???s never been the teacher???s responsibility.Professional development is important for teachers: professors go to conferences to stay relevant and to make contacts. It used to be that the university would pay for this, and that???s still mostly true, though it???s almost never the case for the kinds of teacher-persons who received the director of composition???s email. The director of composition recognized that these were teacher-persons who needed professional development for different reasons. The adjuncts, the graduate students, and the temporary-contract full-time instructors were all in the same boat, valued for their semi-pro status, and the director of composition would escort them to the nationally recognized scholar like Scouts on their first camping trip. No one believes that the workshop attendees will ever achieve the heights of the national scholar, no matter what their potential, and in the meantime, they???re still expected to adhere to university policy and to be sure the classes are being taught.The director of composition should have known more than anyone that it would be next to impossible for composition teachers to get substitutes for their classes, due to the number of them attending the workshop and the number of classes those teachers regularly taught. You see, there???s no substitute pool for them to draw from, so they have to ask unpaid favors of each other, because they certainly can???t ask the tenured professors, who have minimal contact with contingent faculty as they come and go from year to year. Despite the good intentions of the director of composition, the contingent teachers have been reminded that they can???t pretend to claim the perks taken for granted by tenured professors and also do their jobs effectively.What college students buy with tuition dollars has changed, with a shift in the direction of the utility model of the public high school, with bodies in seats, and mandatory attendance. As a full-time teacher-person at a state university, I???m asked to report on attendance, I have a required number of hours I???m supposed to sit in the office I share with another professor who also has a required number of hours to spend there, and I???m supposed to get a substitute if I know ahead of time that I???m going to miss a class. I happen to believe, because I???m an idealist, that students pay for an education, which is an abstract unquantifiable commodity. Meanwhile, administrators see tangibles that can be represented with numbers on spreadsheets: the number of students per department, the number of seats per class, the number of classes per semester. Whatever else we might say about student-persons, they are undoubtedly numbers, and they pay in dollars that can be divided, so that a class period that has been paid for must occur.When a student tells me they want to be a teacher I suggest they try substitute teaching. It doesn???t cost anything, one doesn???t need a license, and there???s no prep. They only work the days they want to work and if they are even semi-competent, the schools will keep calling them back. For my own part, I had good experiences as a substitute teacher. It let me know that I was able to go into a classroom where I was greeted with extremely low expectations, yet I could trick the students into learning despite themselves. Anyone who thinks they want to teach will get a pretty quick sense of whether they still want to teach after they???ve tried substituting.As sensible as this sounds, this suggestion, that a student should try substituting is almost always greeted by the student with disdain. We tend to think of ourselves as better than substitutes, even those with no teaching experience. And so asking someone to be a substitute for a college class only works if that teacher is already in a position that comes with a degree of disrespect. By comparison, instead of asking ???Will you be the substitute for my classes???? a contingent teacher might try out some of these equivalent phrases on their colleagues: ???Will you babysit my child? Will you be a server at my wedding? Will you pick up my mom from the airport???? The only reason I need a substitute for my classes is because the director of composition told me I did, and the only reason the director of composition told me I did was because the university administration, a.k.a. the numbers people, told the director that I did.I???m in a position that comes with disrespect, though my students don???t really know it, because whether I go to a workshop for faculty development or not, I???m a professional. Sometimes, the students who turn their noses up at the suggestion that they try substitute teaching will say, ???I don???t want to teach high school. I want to do what you do. I want to teach college.???I tell them that if they teach in the public secondary or elementary schools they???ll have better job security and will likely be paid more. They might have to deal with student discipline or with standardized tests, but maybe that???s not such a big deal. Maybe it just is. It???s teaching after all. It???s a calling.Blind faith in the capitalist meritocracy makes it surprising for a student to hear that a professor with a Ph.D. can make less than a teacher with a bachelor???s degree, someone they might think of as more like a smart mom than a scholar. But at the end of the school year that teacher won???t be let go simply because her contract has run out. She???ll almost automatically be kept on the payroll, and she???ll be given a raise. At public secondary or elementary schools it???s easier to keep someone around than to do a new job search, so even without tenure there???s almost always job security. At institutions of higher education, however, they pretty much always run job searches, even when they have someone they want to keep around. A professor on a temporary contract might be asked to reapply for the job they already have, or their renewable contract could be replaced with one that is nonrenewable, because the rules can change without warning.I cancel class to attend the workshop for faculty development, I make no attempt to get a substitute, and no one complains. I get to the workshop early and the director of composition sits at the table with me. By the end of the day, I think the director of composition has a better idea of me as a teacher than the impression I give shuffling through the halls exhausted between classes. It???s a small triumph, since my contract will run out and a younger less-experienced teacher-person will soon take my place, very likely someone who won???t question the absurdity of being asked to find a substitute for a college class.Numbers people",100
110," are numbers people. They???re going to do what they???re paid to do. They don???t sit in classrooms and most have never taught. But the decisions they make will affect the people at the institution with the least autonomy: the students, the grounds workers, the custodial staff, and the temporary teachers. If those a little higher up, who the university stakes its reputation on, don???t stick up for the these people, who often can???t stick up for themselves, and who are the foundation the university rests upon, the people at the bottom will founder. Students will pay for less, teachers will be expected to do more for less, and that longstanding marketing tool, the school logo, will come to represent a swindle, a fa??ade, a hollow promise, a substitute for what used to be genuine.Congratulations from all of us here at your high school ??? we are so thrilled to have heard from the PTA that you just got a job! And we are so excited for your newfound financial stability. We know, we know ??? it???s a part-time summer job at your college???s campus bookstore, but to us that???s just as great a title as any to put on our list of donors for this year???s Annual Fund!As you know, we see every job as an opportunity to grow, learn, and send us funds to maintain our lawn. That???s right, the very lawn where years ago you sat and did your homework next to the beautiful plaque that the class before you donated.And, it really means so much to us to watch our birds fly out of the high school nest and into an income bracket that could really benefit the Annual Fund this year. I mean, we have 85% of our goal, but as you know, that???s only a B. And we know that you are an A student. So much so that one year out of high school, you???re already employed! At your college! First you were paying tuition to them, now they???re paying you ??? so that you can pay us for our Annual Fund! We can???t say that we are surprised. Ever since you were in these halls, you always worked like you were getting paid for it. It was a wonderful aspect of you we could nurture, and we are not just saying that because it could give us a summer enrichment program starting 2017.We don???t want to label your job right now. So, instead of thinking about it as earning ???minimum wage,??? we???d like to encourage you to see it as having ???maximum potential??? to support your Alma Mater???s Strategic Plan of 2016.??? And we think it???s important to see every job as an integral learning experience ??? leading to bigger and better jobs down the line and bigger and better donations to our fundraising efforts.We know that despite your incredible achievement and new endeavor, you will have so many places to go from here. You are primed for success in a globally changing society that begins with your bookstore shifts on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 12:30-2:30 pm and ends with a check made out to your high school to keep our foreign language teachers employed.While you use your academic skills and apply them to the real world, like ???alphabetizing the academic inventory in the biology section of the bookstore,??? you probably realize how important it is to us to prepare our kids for the real world. Which is why we are thrilled that you can give even a fraction of your eight-dollar-an-hour wage to increase the amount of lab equipment we have for our STEM classes. You, of all alums, know what it???s like to benefit from hands-on learning.This letter isn???t about convincing you to invest in our ever-changing academic curriculum. It???s about convincing you to invest in our ever-changing holistic curriculum, which does include our new athletic fields and tennis courts. We remember your tenure in Junior Varsity lacrosse, and we are so sure that your skills on the field are now being put to great use in your college campus center.From the bottoms of our hearts, and from the bottom of your wallet, we want to say: we are so impressed with you. It takes a special person to be so young and so stably employed. We, in the education business, are very aware of how rare this is!We wanted to send some support your way and let you know that your support our way is tax deductible. So, congratulations, again! And remember: to you, being a campus bookstore cashier may be part time. But to us, replacing our soccer field turf is full time.Donald J. Trump, a son of the late Fred and Mary Trump, and Michael ???Mike??? Pence, a son of of Edward and Nancy Pence, were married July 19 at the Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland, Ohio.  Reverend Sean Hannity performed the ceremony.Mr. Trump, 70, is a reality television personality.  He previously managed a failed airline, a failed for-profit education company, a failed professional football team, and a failed brand of steaks.  He was recently nominated by the Republican Party as its presidential candidate.  Mr. Trump graduated from the University of Pennsylvania, and received an Honorary Doctor of Business from Liberty University, which teaches young Earth creationism as an explanation for the appearance of life on Earth.Mr. Pence is the governor of Indiana.The couple met during the Republican presidential primaries.  ???I wasn???t sure at first if he was the right one for me,??? Mr. Pence explained.  ???He gave off an orange glow and had very small hands.  His calls to ban Muslims from entering the U.S. struck me as offensive and unconstitutional.  But he won me over with his denigration of women and Mexicans.???Mr. Trump stated that he felt the same attraction. ???I???m a huge Mike Penz fan!!??? he tweeted.The romance blossomed after Mr. Pence said that he found himself constantly following Mr. Trump on Twitter. ???I tried conversion therapy, but I couldn???t get him out of my mind!??? said Mr. Pence.  Mr. Pence realized he was ready for a deeper commitment after Mr. Trump accused an American judge of being biased against him because of the judge???s ethnicity.Two of Mr. Trump???s previous marriages ended in divorce.

We are far too quick to demonize those with whom we disagree. Far too willing to engage in harsh rhetoric, to place blame instead of seeking common ground. But we cannot let our passions blind us to rational debate. Although it may be difficult, we must learn to respect not only those who agree with us, but also the poisonous enemies of America who do not.I recently met a young woman from Decatur, Illinois. She told me of her struggles???she had recently lost her job, then he",100

And I felt her struggles, because her struggles were also my struggles, as a fellow human being. And something changed in me. And then, later, it changed back after I saw that she had ???liked??? a Facebook post by a celebrity endorsing a political candidate that I do not like. I hope she and her dumb parvo family rot in dog hell.It is time to unite as one, America. Time to come together. And that applies to everyone, including the large group of protesters that my security team penned behind steel barricades a safe distance from this podium. In fact, let???s come together right now. Let???s take down those divisive barricades. Yes, all of you protesters, let???s make this symbolic gesture of coming together right now. Right this way, protesters. Right up to the edge of the moat. That???s it. Right up to the platform extending out over the edge of Agitated Gator Moat.Remember: at our core, we are all Americans or Americans who are stupid and ruining America. We must remember that thing we almost have in common.So you there, with the MSNBC-issued horn-rimmed glasses:  put down your pitchfork, and engage your fellow man in respectful dialogue! And you there, with the FOX NEWS T-shirt, preparing to throw a Molotov cocktail into a Planned Parenthood:  lay down your gasoline-soaked cloth wick, and extend your non-lighter-bearing hand! And you, with CNN written in green Sharpie across your bare chest, with your head stuck in a paint can and you are banging the paint can with a wooden spoon and you just stepped on a rake and now you are tumbling down a hill into a briar patch filled with flaming horse crap and fireworks and bees and SARS???never mind, you just stay down there! The rest of us will begin a national dialogue, and then we will head down to check on you!Now is the time to engage in honest discussion about real issues without resorting to petty squabbling or name-calling. It is time for respecting our differences.

Once, you invited a girl you didn???t know well over for a sleepover and you made her put her head under a blanket with you so you could tell secrets, and you told her that over the summer you spied on your father in his home office and he was just sitting there with a gun in his mouth. This did not happen. You do not know why you lie, but it gives you energy, it is exciting, this glittery wind of what might be evil that courses through you.3.

If aliens came, you would offer them cats and Verdi and porno and say: ???It is your call. Perhaps this should be destroyed, but it is awful interesting.???6.

Your mother is on so many antidepressents that she can???t feel anything, and nothing you can do will make her feel, nothing you ever do will get through to her, she is just a huge wall that you fling yourself against. But no wall can stand forever.Read Part One- -As winter gave way to spring, I received my get-out-of-jail free card???I had somehow passed the test for Brainiac High???and perfected the mechanics of stoop ball such that almost every time I slammed my spaldeen into the iron-nosed edge of the third  tread up, it would explode off the step, not stopping until it caromed off the fa??ade of the mesifta1  building across the street, and if not caught on the carom, on the fly, would be a ground-rule homer. But even though I had mutated into Schneider the Slugger, I still couldn???t whistle. And while my mind continuously reviewed the empirical data related to my parentally introjected homo-fate, never once concluding that I might yet develop an ability to whistle, my body confounded all that cerebral candlepower by never once allowing me to escape a subway car filled with Catholic school girls???a genus wont, on their way to and from Yushka High, to hike their demure, pleated school uniform skirts up way past the point of glorious indecency2 ???without having to hunch my way through that thicket of thighs.Though it was more than a smidge confusing, my need to gaze upon titties and shit remained unabated and unrequited. I mourned being locked out of the my personal Playboy mansion, while steadfastly refusing to acknowledge just whose fault that was, and was too craven to attempt acquisition of a tittie glossy off the rack at either a newsstand or my used zine store.But then, one unusually warm early-spring day, the itinerant merchant named Cheap Naftali, making his usual rounds, appeared during recess with his well-worn, seemingly bottomless shopping bag full of merchandise for sale, some of it harmless, like candy bars and packs of baseball cards, and some of it proscribed, like fire crackers and loosies that went for a nickel apiece.Seeing Cheap Naftali flog his wares on this particular midmorn generated a storm of the brain. Soon I found myself standing in front of the Nafster as he sat on a bench in the pocket park on the corner of Henry and Madison, counting his shekels. I asked him, squeaked at him more precisely, Hey, Naftali, you got any tittie magazines in there? pointing at the ratty shopping bag at his feet.Cheap Naftali slowly craned his head up in my direction, focused his eyes on me, studied me, looking for anything that might give him pause, some tic or tell that would reveal me to be an undercover NIT (nark in training) out to nail him, to force his appearance before the Sanhedrin of the luftmensch rebbes of RJJ on a charge of satanic black marketeering. Satisfied that I was nothing more than a scared, horny little brat, he reached deep into his bag, rooted about in it, before finally pulling out a rolled-up magazine.Funfzig was all he said.Fifty cents! I croaked. That was a lot of money. I tried to hondell him; I delved into my jeans and after an appropriate interval pulled my hand out. In i",100
112,"t were nestled a quarter and a nickel. I showed them to him: This is all I got.Cheap Naftali gave a world-weary sigh: was this little doofus standing before him really trying to bargain with the master? Without saying a word he stowed the magazine I now had to have back in the black hole of his fraying bag and began the long, theatrical process of getting his creaky ass off that bench to leave the park, to leave me holding nothing but a useless quarter and a worthless nickel in my otherwise empty palm.I pulled the Wimpy move: I???ll pay you tomorrow for a tittie magazine today.This made him laugh. As he began trudging toward the cluttered cave of a store he had over by Canal Street, desperation sent my hand digging into my pocket, not daring to come out until it had secured another quarter. I ran toward him, calling out, Hey, wait up.He turned, held out his hand, said nothing. In my frenzy to take ownership of the magazine, I poured all my change in it???the two quarters plus the nickel I had originally produced when I first tried to bargain. He swiped the money, dug deep once again, pulled out the same magazine, still rolled up, handed it to me, never saying a word, then turned and walked away.After the initial mind-fogging ecstasy of acquisition had subsided, I realized I???d overpaid. You said it was fifty cents. Gimme my nickel back, I yelled after him, that nickel representing a Knickerbocker bar???cherry jelly enrobed in luscious milk chocolate, a candy bar I dream about to this day.He didn???t even turn around. Instead he straightened his right arm, balled his hand into a fist, raised it ninety degrees so that fist and arm were a hypotenuse short of a right triangle, released his index finger, pointed it straight up. He then shook his hand side to side on a swivel: there would be no backsies for my nickel.That was my first lesson in the laws of leverage.??????The school bell tolled, signaling the end of recess. While the rest of the students headed back inside, I lingered in the pocket park trying to figure out what to do with my proscribed periodical. I went contemplative for a bit before I came up with what I thought to be an excellent solution. I???d just tuck it into my shirt. I unzipped my satin Dodgers jacket (a relic of the days before O???Malley broke our collective heart when he yanked Dem Bums out of Brooklyn) and was about to stow it away beneath my brown-on-brown, three quarter sleeve, paisley shirt (which had served as my woobie for about a year), when I realized how uncomfortable it would be to sit until lunchtime with this jugs journal nestled up against my ample tummy, its edges digging into my sensitive boychik skin. And I???d still face the same predicament I was dealing with now when the lunch bell rang. I returned to my ponder, now with some urgency???the street was empty, quiet; all the kids were now back in class while I was stuck outside and where I would remain until the problem was solved. I had my second storm of the brain in less than a half hour???a new record???when I remembered that when I first laid augen on the prize it was rolled up. Eureka! I took my left arm out of the jacket, rolled the loosened digest de jugs around it, then stuffed the arm back in the sleeve, secure in the knowledge that the jacket???s knit cuff would keep my treasure safely stowed away even if it somehow managed to slide all the way down my arm.Once inside and seated I opened my Gemara, leaned it up against my desk, resting it on my stomach, essentially hiding within the vastness of the Talmud. As the Rebbe stood in front of the blackboard doing the Talmudic shuffle, I drifted off into daydream mode, musing about how wonderful it would be when I was finally alone, just me and my tittie mag.The windows were shut tight, the steam was going full blast, sweat was running in streams down to my lard ass. I was now worried the magazine would become a soggy mess if it remained rolled round my sweaty arm, right below (one of) my dripping pits. I had to get my jacket off, and pronto.It was a complicated maneuver I decided on. I would slip the magazine out and secrete it inside the acreage of my Gemara long enough to take off my jacket; then I would place the magazine back inside the jacket, which I would then fold and store under my desk secured by my book bag until lunch time, when I would be able to stow it inside the briefcase, safe from prying eyes.Everything was proceeding according to plan until the moment I gazed upon the magazine nestled within my Gemara. Its title was Sir Knight, and on the cover was a color picture of a blowsy babe, her alluring parts blocked from view by an almost preternaturally thin and flimsy piece of cloth, through which the outlines of her massive titties could be clearly seen, as could those of her marble-sized nipples, which were threatening to bore holes through the sheer chemise.Sir Knight was clearly a low-rent product, a package of crushed, off-brand potato chips in comparison to Playboy???s potatoes lyonnaise. There were few words and no names in it. But that didn???t make me no never mind. The moment I opened Sir Knight I became enveloped in a carnal cocoon. Everything else faded away. I no longer heard the rebbe didactisizing over the Talmud; I didn???t hear the constant leak of steam from the faulty radiator valve or the street noise filtering through the outsized windows rendered semiopaque by years of grimy buildup. There were only two things left in my world???me, and the photo layout I had fallen in love with. This object of my affection was so present to me, I had to give her a name. I chose Ann, for Ann Francis, the lubricious object of desire of the Forbidden Planet, so hot she was responsible for unleashing a monster from the id, a cousin of whom seemed to be running rampant in my chinos that very second.Ann???s mouth was slightly opened, in an inviting kind of way. Ann???s eyes felt like they were looking right at me, through me, talking to me, telling me I should open the book up and look inside, where more, much more of her would be revealed. This was an offer I couldn???t refuse.In one picture (disappointingly, the ones on the inside were all black-and-white) Ann had the cloth draped over one shoulder, the fabric covering only one of her perfectly globular tits, giving her the look of a slutty Greek goddess???Hera the Nympho. In another, the fabric was twisted at the cleavage, creating natural cups on either side, the better to house Ann???s glorious breasts, the fabric tied off tightly in the back to create a see-through, live-free-or-die Maidenform bra, the best ever. And in the last picture, Ann, given some lift from stiletto-heeled shoes, stood in all her natural glory, her right hip pushed slightly forward, her right knee slightly bent so as to shield her nethers from view, her unencumbered, uncovered breasts ripe fruit demanding to be plucked.All systems were going, going, gone. I could barely breathe, I had an ache in my loins, my heart was beating like a tap-dancing fool, you could fry an egg on my feverish brow, time had stood still???just as it had when Joshua prayed to god to keep the sun from setting so that he and his army might finish the slaughter of the inhabitants of Jericho before the Sabbath began.Ann so had my undivided attention that I didn???t even feel the first couple of blows raining down on me from somewhere outside; I couldn???t yet hear the epithets that punctuated each blow.I was like the brontosaurus for whom it took several minutes for pain from its tail to register in its pea-sized brain. But register it finally did. And when I snapped out of my lust-laced fugue state, I found",100
113," myself staring into the face of madness: my rebbe, an obese, foul-smelling, dentally challenged death camp survivor, torrents of spittle spewing from his yellow-crusted lips, was screaming at me hysterically (in the crazy, turn-of-the-twentieth, lady-parts sense of the word), repeating the same word, over and over, ahh-pee-kuy-ress (apostate), ahh-pee-kuy-ress (apostate), ahh-pee-kuy-ress (apostate), beating me about the head and shoulders with each iteration of his damnation, his dirt-encrusted fingernails contusing my sensitive skin.I don???t know how long it took, but when he was finally all potched out, he stood over me, his breath coming in shallow, rapid wheezes. I was convinced his heart was attacking him and that any second he would fall down dead on top of me, my Talmud, and Sir Knight. As he continued to stare at me in disbelief, a string of spittle hanging from one corner of his mouth got longer and longer, until gravity did its thing and the drool dropped with a slimy splash onto my Gemara, which was still open, as was Sir Knight, from the pages of which Ann, naked and smiling, Delilah proud, stared up at the crazed cleric. This slaver shower seemed to rouse him, pull him back from death???s door. He rejoined the here and now. Looking at me and the filth I had laid atop the sacred text almost drove him wild, again. But after whatever his version of counting to ten was, he picked up the desecrated tome, slammed it shut with Sir Knight (and Ann) still inside, and wheeled and waddled out of the room to seek (guidance from) the yeshiva???s ginger principal, Rabbi Ginsberg. I followed behind at a safe distance, arriving at the glass door of the principal???s office in time to see the two holy men engaged in rat-a-tat-tat Yiddish, a quizzical, disbelieving look on Ginsberg???s face. Finally he had heard enough and, needing to get back to his kabalist meditation, gave disinterested, pointed at a pile of books indicating where my rebbe should place the tainted Gemara, and dismissed the raving Talmudist. That was my cue to scoot. I was safely back at my desk, trying to give remorseful and not pulling it off, when he returned and expelled me from his cheder (classroom).As I stood up to go, I noticed blood oozing from a wound clawed by the filthy fingernails of Rabbi Cuckoo. It flowed in tiny rivulets down my left arm, along my hand, down my fingers, and departed my body in drips, each drop landing with a microsplatter on the filthy marble floor of the classroom. I draped my jacket on my briefcase, picked the case up with my unsullied right arm, and headed out the door. On my way out of the building I sneaked a peek inside the principal???s office and scoped my Talmud stuffed with my tittie mag on top of a pile of books on the side of Ginsberg???s desk. Between the blood and the confiscated book, any delusive hope I may have harbored that this was just a nightmare on Henry Street was dashed. No, this was something worse, far worse. This was a bad life, a miserable life, one which would be forfeit once the Father-Mother were hipped to the sordid, sacrilegious mess I had made.I crossed the street and sat down on the stoop opposite the mesifta, on the very step from which I used to send my spaldeen into orbit back in the good old days when recess was for playing games like stoop ball, and not the departure time for an obsessive odyssey to Booby Island and beyond.??????One of the bennies of the boho life, if you???re so inclined, is daily dinner with the mishpucha. After a long day of the Organizing Principle and me ramming our heads against the Great Wall of Show Biz trying to conceptualize the Pitch of Gold with (usually) only a headache and an existentially disquieting sense of desperation to show for it, and after Our Son the Moon and Our Daughter the Conscience trudged home and recovered from the doctrinal assault of education camp, we would sit down for a grub-and-gab, sharing with each other the trials and tribs of the day. If during one of these nightly slurp and burp sessions I would go to the woe-is-me place, one or both of the block chips would rub their index finger along their thumb and ask me what they were doing. Before I could guess, I???d be told they were playing ???Cry Me a River??? on the world???s smallest violin. Alternatively one of them might ask, Do you have a license to be driving this waa-aa-ambulance? or demand to see the permit authorizing the pity parade I appeared to be the grand marshall of.Those bracing thanks-I-needed-that psychic slaps were, from where I sat as a pubescent dumpling of misery across from RJJ, light years away on the dark side of a faraway galaxy. I was still trapped then in Shtetlville USA, where it was clear that I was royally fucked. Nothing on that day stood in the way of my wallowing in a giant steaming vat of self-pity.Self-pity is a salve for those of us too weak, warped, or unwilling to look at shit the way it really is. It is a weapon to be aimed at any convenient or contiguous target of opportunity upon whom blame can be transferred. Self-pity is the indispensible tool of self-deception.As I sat on the stoop in a wallow, reviewing the events of the previous hour, as well as the events of the previous few months, my targets were manifold, my need to transfer guilt massive. There were the parentals, who had, for reasons only they knew and were not sharing, made every effort to damn me to a life without whistling. There were the religious zealots charged with my spiritual indoctrination who were the architects of the hot-house environment in which such a shanda3  as I had perped was possible, even fucking inevitable. There was Cheap Naftali, the money-grubbing, moral compass???missing degenerate who had sold that piece of wondrous radioactive trash to me, a confused and flaming hunk of pubescent tumescence.  And there was Mr. and Mrs. Booze-and-Schmooze, who wrote the book on irresponsible when they hired the cretinous, hormonal wreck who lived down the hall to watch over their little Alvin Albatross and were so lacking in judgment that they left a powder keg of Playboys hidden in plain sight for him to blow his mind over.There was, as you can see, more than enough blame to go around, enough so that I could focus my anger on others while coincidentally diffusing my own shame and guilt. But the ameliorative benefits of self-deception are dramatically constricted when undercut by the astringency of self-examination. And I just couldn???t shake the question I???d been asking myself in myriad ways since I???d read Fleming???s fateful sentence a few months back???why was I, as someone unable to whistle, so obsessed with women? Why did my body belie my brain and reward me with a boner every time I ogled the passing parade of dames, all shapes, all sizes? They could be, as the Bluesman told his audience, young, tender, old, don???t make no difference, dem girls! If I really were a homo, why would the last thing my mind???s eye rewarded me with when I laid me down to sleep be the image of Marilyn Monroe in a tight white silk dress with a cherry print and a plunging neckline, in The Misfits, in a bar, on a bet, banging the shit out of a paddle and ball, her unencumbered titties, barely corralled, bouncing joyfully, hypnotically with each stroke, or, when Huston gifted us the reverse-angle view, that searing image of her sweet ass swinging, stroke by stroke, east-west, presto tempo, doing the boogie-woogie right in the middle of the floor???????When you???re barely pubed out, and all you have to worry about is when you???re going to scarf that next grease-blossomed bag of ketchup-coated fries washed down by a Mission gr",100
114,"ape soda or better yet a Wink, or how you wound up facing a looming tittie-mag-confiscation-generated force-five shit storm, the most pressing metaphysical question of the day might very well be???why did the moron throw the clock off the roof?Because he wanted to see time fly.Which is exactly how it played out as I sat on my tread of solitude pondering the condition my condition was in. The tiny slice of world in front of my frozen-in-thought self pixilated by as if rendered in time lapse: a quiet street save a pigeon-hunting feral cat or two jump cutting through the frame; the lunch hour in quintuple time???a mondo-frenetic basketball game, a dizzying, open-air baseball card trading mart, yo-yos looping the loop in defiance of the laws of physics, tops spinning at the speed of light, soda slurped, knishes scarfed in vomitous overdrive; then, just as quickly as the kinder chaos came, it went, replaced by an eerily empty street disturbed only by the appearance and disappearance of cars swallowed by black holes, and a garbage man pushing his wheeled wastebasket and push broom, magically sweeping the detritus of the day away in a wink. The sun, finally setting, its blue tones replaced by the warm orange glow of streetlamps, cued the Brownian bedlam of my fellow prisoners of piety making their eager escape from madrassah. Their mass exodus snapped me out of my reverie, brought me back into real time and space, where I found my meditation rewarded with two interlocked conclusions about the events of the day, the first conceptual, the second pragmatic.The conceptual breakthrough came as a result of a provocative question I had asked during Talmud study earlier in my year of living dangerously: The Torah says that we have free will but it also says that God is all-knowing. But if God already knows what???s going to happen, which means he knows what anyone is going to do under any circumstance, how can there really be anything like free will?He who was soon to become my tormentor, taken aback by the cogency of a frage coming from one so young and disrespectful as me, fumfered for a beat or two before commencing his jig on the head of a pin by quoting Maimonides, who said that both the propositions (man has free will, God knows all) are true, but that it is only God, infinite and omniscient and omnipotent, who can understand how these two antithetical propositions can be squared. He then cited Rebbe Akiva, who put shit a bit more koanically???All is foreseen, yet permission is given. Rendered in Aristotelian double-speak, even though God knows future contingent events, his knowledge does not annul the contingency of these events.At the time of asking, the callow committed atheist4  I was cared little about the nature of free will and was interested only in generating a spiritual squirm. But from the perch of my contemplative tread, free will (which I had much less trouble with than my rebbe, since in the absurd universe I floated in what else could will be but free?) took on a much more profound meaning, one that led to its concomitant, my liberating practical pens??e, the conclusion that came to me by way of Ockham???s Razor (In answering any question, the simple is preferred over the complex) mediated through the prism of Sherlock Holmes???s first rule of deduction (When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth), to wit: I was drowning at the bottom of the pickle vat because, whatever my perception of the intent of my parental nurturing may have been, I had come into this world factory-equipped with a heaping helping of free will, and with this ontological autonomy I chose (had no other choice, really5 ) to gaze with gusto upon the female form and that therefore, cogito ergo sum masturb??r??.True that. I was, for sure, no homo.??????That settled that.My voyage back to Goyville was like hitching a ride on a cloud, my burden having been lifted as I came to realize that no matter what this douchenozzle Ian Fleming thought he understood about the ramifications of whistling within the Masters & Johnson/Kraft-Ebbing universe, he knew nothing about my world, about what made Rob-it tick. But by the time the doors on the AA opened on 42nd Street, my cloud had turned dark and stormy as I was slammed with the realization that no matter how happily my tale of homo woe may have been resolved, the piper had yet to be paid for the (Clue compatible) Sir-Knight-in-the-Talmud-with-the-boner incident. I expected that the particulars of my transgression might well have preceded me home and that when I opened the door, I would be greeted by the singular face of Father-Mother madness. I nearly shit my pants.But it hadn???t, and I wasn???t, so I didn???t.That evening when the parentals, My Brother the Other, and I sat down to a meat and two starch scarf session, I was so relieved by what I considered my close shave that I got cocky (characterological deficit #33). I proceeded to instigate a tortured convo about civil rights and the evils of Amurrica, which got Mom, Dad, and Bro so worked up, they had to remind themselves that the neighbors might be listening in order to calm themselves down. Womb and Seed were now so pissed at me for shit completely unrelated to the shit they really should have been angry at me for, I was certain a parental mushroom cloud of rightous rage would vaporize me if news of the nudie mag episode reached them later that night.And so after dinner, when my peristalsis froze, I feared it might even reverse as I waited on the couch for the phone to ring and the other shoe to drop like a lead brick on top of my conk. But besides the sound of tommy guns spraying bullets on The Untouchables, it was crickets all night until I slid off to Slumberville.The next morning as I ate burnt french toast???the womb always pushed the envelope with her frog toast, sometimes caramelizing the egged Pechter???s Chalah6  to perfection, and other times carbonizing it???I dissected the quandary of the confiscated Gemara like the Talmudist they were training me to be. I figured that if shit were to have hit the fan, it would have happened already, and that Ginsberg was either keeping his powder dry, waiting for a more auspicious moment, maybe the eve of the Day of Judgment, to drop the nuke on my nukes (and me), or (in the best of all possible, delusive-hope universes) had somehow forgotten about it altogether.On the ride down to school, I weighed my options and concluded I had no choice but to take my own version of Pascal???s wager???to assume that the delusive-hope option might really be possible, that Rebbe ???Lost in Spiritual Space??? Ginsberg let all earthly shit go before schlufen and in the morning experienced secular amnesia thanks to a religious reboot brought on by morning prayer before he split for madrassah. If that were true, the bold choice was the only choice. And really, what could I lose? If I was right, I would be free at last, and if he was waiting for the right time to let the guillotine drop, better to make it sooner rather than later: in effect, I could put myself out of my own misery. Either way I would kind of, sort of win, though one way would be far sweeter than the other.By the time I rode up the escalator at East Broadway, I knew all the steps in my die-trying plan to save myself from near-certain destruction.I entered the mesifta building, practically flew up the two flights to the floor that was home to both my classroom and Ginsberg???s lair, took a deep, deep, deep breath, walked into the office, grabbed my Talmud like it was a chunk of found gold, the Sir Knight still peeking out from its heart, mumbled somet",100
115,"hing about relief at not losing the holy book, and tore ass out of there before Ginsberg so much as raised his nose out of his whatever-the-fuck-he-was-studying. I then rushed into the bathroom, grabbed an empty stall, transferred tittie mag from Talmud to briefcase, flushed for cover, and entered the classroom praying I would get a free ride there as well, which I did.And that was my first Hollywood ending.- -1  Mesifta is the high school part of the yid parochial school experience. Although my candlepower was bright enough to warrant it, my behavioral issues kept me from skipping a grade on the secular side, but on the religious side, mishna study was a meritocracy which assumed brilliance would eventually overcome the crazy, and so I was force-marched to hebe high school in order to gobble Gemara and settle into the starting blocks of the rabbi track.2 Hormone-mad, pheromone-radiating Catholic school girls who, as soon as they split school, rolled their skirts up over the waist band, twirled them over and over until you could practically see some righteous Catholic camel-toe, were really responsible for introducing the mini-dress to urban Amurrica.3 Scandal in Yiddish. It???s poetic that the creator of that TV show should have a variant spelling for her first name.4 See My Ontological Argument.5 This was the 50s, before we learned that substance abuse or gayness were not choices but rather the products of what you might call genetic determinism (see, there???s that word again.6 Shtelville???s own personal sliced Brioche.Monday, July 13 (7.5 hrs.)0.3 hrs.

FACEBOOK)Thank you, Mr. Trump, for inviting me to speak tonight, and thank you, disgraced figure skater Tonya Harding, for that wonderful introduction.Now, you???re probably wondering why I???m up here with a chair again. Well, this isn???t just any high-backed swiveler. Go ahead, buddy, tell them who you are??? No? That???s okay, they???ve probably figured out that you???re the Supreme Court seat vacated some 155 days ago, upon the death of Justice Antonin Scalia. What gave you away? I???m guessing it was that off-putting sheen of cobwebs ??? but don???t worry, I???m going to introduce you to Donald???s hair guy!Seriously, though: I brought you here today, brave and distinguished SCOTUS seat, just to thank you for being out of service. I know it???s hard to turn your tufted leather back on the millions of Americans who are demanding that you be expeditiously filled with an experienced and well-intentioned arbiter of the law. But every day you sit in a basement storage room is an important victory.Now, I know what you???re thinking: ???Clint, I don???t know about this. It???s pretty damp down here ??? I feel like I???m catching a cold. Roaches are crawling. Can we maybe just speed things up a little so I???m warmed by the buttocks of a reputable, even-handed steward of the Constitution????Look, I hear you, compadre, but if Clarence Thomas went ten years without saying a word, then you can damn well lay low until we get a member of our rapidly disintegrating party into office.What? What???s that you say? ???Most Americans agree that in the interest of justice and due diligence, we should get the confirmation process rolling????Well, I???ve got news for you, punk: The only thing rolling is going to be you ??? right back into a musty, forgotten corner in the bowels of the Supreme Court building, where you???ll be covered with a bed sheet before anyone can fill you with an impeccably qualified interpreter of federal law.Look, I don???t mean to sound harsh. I???m just the guy from A Fistful of Dollars ??? which, by the way, is not a documentary about Trump???s campaign budget. I hear you when you say, ???Clint, I???m serious, I really think I should be filled with someone who can cast a deciding vote in cases involving the fates of women???s health, immigration, and voting rights. This is bad. This is really bad.??? I get it. But trust me, soldier: if you know what???s good for you, you???ll get right back into that foxhole and stay completely motionless but for the occasional imperceptible swivel brought on by a passing tumbleweed.Take it from the director of Sully, coming soon to a theater near you: You don???t want to be ???sullied??? by the keister of some no-good rapscallion determined to help the court uphold its sacred motto, ???Equal justice under law.???I know you???ll stay strong, sweet SCOTUS seat. Underneath that five-month c",100
116,"oat of dust and mouse droppings, I can still see your handsome beige hue. And so I leave you with the catchphrase everyone???s been waiting for: ???Brownie, you???re doing a heck of a job.???- -In 1987, at the height of my Anglophile youth ??? post-Brideshead Revisited, pre-Four Weddings and a Funeral, and dead in the center of my Chariots of Fire obsession ??? I spent a college term at Cambridge University???s Gonville and Caius College. I was assigned rooms that exceeded my wildest expectations. ???Ah, lucky gel, you???ve got scholar???s rooms,??? said the porter when I showed up to claim my spot. He handed me a prehistoric-looking skeleton key with a brass tag that read ???Caius.??? Since I had watched Chariots of Fire for the tenth time before boarding my overseas flight, I knew this was pronounced ???keys.???The key opened an outer door that lead to a microscopic vestibule containing two more doors at 90-degree angles to each other. One led to my bedroom, which looked out at the roof of King???s College Chapel and down King???s Parade; the other led to my sitting room, which overlooked Caius??? ancient Tree Court. I paced the floor-through over and over, unable to believe my good fortune.The term that followed did not disappoint. I sat in a punt on the Cam, poled by a perfect Englishman, as we drifted under the Bridge of Sighs and through the dreamy ???backs.??? I learned about ciders and shandies, and coffee at 11 and tea at 4. I ate dinner at the school???s ???high table??? in a Laura Ashley dress and discussed Dorothy Wordsworth and Iris Murdoch and Phillip Larkin. It was a peak experience in that very specific way that experiences can peak when you???re 20 years old and exactly where you want to be.Term ended, bags were reluctantly packed, and the skeleton key went back to the porter. But I screwed up the courage to ask for the brass ???Caius??? tag as a souvenir, fully aware that it was the height of American obnoxiousness but also knowing my life would be better in the days and years that followed if that tag sat on my key ring as a homophonic reminder of that magical time. The porter gave me a stern look and I started to slink away in shame, but he stopped me and said, ???You???re the only American who???s ever asked if they could have it. Usually they just take them. Good luck to you, my dear.???And indeed I have been lucky, and so much the better for the daily reminder of perfect happiness attached to my keys.Welcome to Cleveland, host of the 2016 Republican National Convention ??? a week???s worth of cathartic release after the most harrowing, terrifying, and flat out surreal Presidential primary campaign in American history. Was there ever an occasion more demanding of inner peace?Didn???t think so, which is probably why this retreat is over-subscribed. Now, unfortunately, we got bumped from Conference Rooms B and C at the Hampton Inn out on I-90 because the delegates from Florida bungled their headcount and needed an extra place to crash, but those of us in pursuit of enlightenment require no such material pampering so fear not ??? we???ll be taking off for nirvana from the comfort of my parents??? basement!Unexpected? Perhaps. Insulated? Not at all. But the Buddha teaches stillness of thought in pursuit of one-ness with the eternal, and Roy ??? that???s my dad ??? teaches carpentry which is why you may find your ass chock full of slivers after sitting lotus-style for three hours during this morning???s mindfulness session.Ignore the pain. It???s a transient state, not unlike an election cycle ??? just kidding, those are permanent now and Thank God because boy, couldn???t we all use a good do-over now and again? Anyway, it???s all in your head. Focus on your mantra, or maybe just the chanting down the street. True, it???s probably a riot, and that intermittent whistling noise sounds suspiciously like the discharge of tear-gas canisters into a crowd of angry protestors who lost their savings studying whatever it is people studied at Trump University, but take a deep breath???Ommm???Because tuition for this retreat is fully refundable??? IF you can say with a straight face you haven???t reached a higher plane of existence and found yourself floating three inches or more off the sawdust floor at least once this week. Fair enough, that could just be from the reverberations of the National Guard tanks rolling through the back yard, but I???ve always found that a neutral, soothing background noise was just the thing to calm my monkey mind.Deep breaths now. Who says the world???s falling apart? What is the world anyway? An idea? A SuperPAC-funded attack ad predicated on lies, half-truths and back-ass-wards conservative dogma? A spinning molecule on a flea???s flexed bicep on a cosmic French Bulldog???s ass? Who knows? The important thing is to never forget the Buddha???s teachings: No mud, no lotus.Brexit. Trump. Zika. Trump. Syrian refugees. Trump. The NRA. Trump.That???s a boatload of mud, so have faith my Anxious Ones ??? that lotus is gonna be a fucking smokeshow whenever it finally pops its head out of the shit-strewn ground!There! Do you hear that? That???s the seductive whump-whump-whump of an Apache helicopter gunship. Mint tea for the tortured soul. And a cure-all for civil unrest. What a treat. And it???s only Monday! They haven???t even formally nominated Vladimir Putin for Vice President yet.Shhh???Remember the advance reading packet. You can???t let the explosions distract you. That???s just the world going to hell in a bloody shrapnel shower of red, white and blue Trump-branded hand grenades. But we???re not of this world, are we? Exactly. Join hands now. Close your eyes. Don???t mind the clomping of Roy???s combat boots. Don???t mind the sound of metal blinds rattling shut upstairs, or the finger-roll tickle of the stray bullet casings tumbling along the hardwood floor. We???ve got supplies to last us a year in the bunker. Roy???s a champion canner. I know, he does look an awful lot like Bernie Sanders. It???s weird. I???ve been saying that ever since I moved home. ???Dad, what???s up with the permanent semi-hunch and the glasses? And the yelling???? The yelling???s what drove me to meditate in the first place. Well, that and the fact that I???m living in my parents basement and I???m forty-five. It was mindfulness, or vote Trump, so???.Ommm???Well. That was pretty intense, wasn???t it? We just went somewhere special there. It???s ok. Open your eyes. I know it???s darker. I know I???ve grown a beard. I know your ass feels like a pincushion. You???ve transcended several months in quote-on-quote ???real world??? time. It???s January 2017. Yeah. I had to drop some sedatives in your mint tea. No choice really. The Tea Party jackboots and the anarchist mob and the last four moderate Republicans on earth were going at it on our front lawn. Roy didn???t make it. But he wanted us to stay focused on enlightenment. Roy was always Buddha-like like that; the still depths of a mountain lake even as its surface is whipped to a revolutionary froth and society as we know it begins its inexorable decline into madness. Existential noise. Just like Trump winning the election. Hey ??? HEY! Stay cool. Fluke thing. Nobody saw it coming. But you???re safe down here. I haven???t even opened my stash of Twizzlers yet. That???s right. Even a being of pure light gets a Twizzler now and again, you know? And we???ve got plenty to go around.Shhhhhh???Remember the breathing techniques from the advance reading packet?

A lot. To the point where I resist re-reading it because I???m convinced that I won???t find the same magic in it again, even though I always do. It???s the book that keeps on giving, really, because you find something new in it at every age.You should also know that Middlemarch has long been considered one of the best novels in English ever written. George Eliot does many things with this book that are nothing short of genius, and the people who spend their time thinking about these things (I always picture an oak-paneled board room full of old white men, though hopefully that demographic has changed significantly) have taken notice.Even so, I think George Eliot should be pissed off.First, because George Eliot was a woman who felt she had to write under a male pseudonym. Congratulations if you already knew about that little gender switcheroo. If you didn???t, now you have a fun fact for cocktail parties.Eliot is not alone in the use of a male pseudonym. All of the Bront?? sisters wrote under male pseudonyms. Even today, it???s not hard to find women writing under male or gender-neutral names (J.K. Rowling, anyone?).Still, though, even though it was more or less her choice to write as George Eliot instead of her given name (which was Mary Ann or Marian Evans), and even though women writers were fairly widely published by the time Eliot lived and wrote (1819-1880), she still felt as though her books would be more successful if people didn???t know that she was a woman, and that had to have angered her.I think she???d also be pretty ticked to know that many people still believe she was a man. Most don???t bother to check (and why would they?) the gender of the author, especially when the name is pretty gender-specific. Still, it???s frustrating to see people still falling for this slight of hand from such a well-known writer. (And yes, I know that it shouldn???t matter what gender a writer is, but it does when you live in a time when women are repressed for any number of reasons, in almost all areas.)Eliot is different from other female writers, though, in that I think she was probably a little bit pissed off that she wasn???t actually a man. I don???t mean sexually or literally (we???ll cover her romantic life in a minute) but socially, mentally, and academically, she???d have liked to have had what men had. She came close in many ways, given her large number of male friends, her extensive education (though most of it informal), and the fact that sometimes in her writing she seems to stand with the patriarchy that condemned women.Eliot???s friend, Margaret Fuller, perhaps best expressed what Eliot likely felt: ???I have always thought??? that I would not write like a woman, of love and hope and disappointment, but like a man, of the world of intellect and action.???1 This sentiment speaks more to the gender expectations and stereotypes of the time than it does to any condemnation of women and the way they supposedly wrote.Eliot did, after all, also think that men should be more like women in some ways. She even thought that entire countries were losing some of the ???female??? traits that were crucial to humanity, like nurturing, commitment, community, and appreciation of nature.My point is that she???s a bit of a paradox. She never gave birth but writes extensively about motherhood; she celebrates virtue even though she was herself a ???fallen woman???; and she addresses religion although she was an agnostic.Having said that, let me clarify that she is as entitled to write about motherhood as anyone because:A.	Plenty of men have done it and as far as I know none of them have actually given birth.B.	She had three stepsons with her partner, George Henry Lewes. I am a stepmother myself and there are step-relationships threaded throughout my family tree, and while the role may sometimes be different from a straightforward parenting role, you are parenting nonetheless. Eliot was close with her step-sons, who loved her dearly.And as far as we in the 21st century are concerned, she can also write about virtue all she wants because our moral codes are more relaxed than those from Victorian England. George Eliot lived with a married man for 24 years. Now, before you gasp and clutch your pearls in dismay, hear me out.George Henry Lewes (and isn???t it cute that they are both named George?) was married to a woman named Agnes. Lewes and Agnes had children together, and then Agnes had children with another man. Since Lewes???s name is on the birth certificate of one of those children, even though he knew the child wasn???t his, Agnes and Lewes could not be lega",100
118,"lly divorced. They decided instead to separate and both went on to have relationships with other people.So. I guess this is one of those gray areas. Generally, I???d say it???s unwise to be in a relationship with someone who???s married to another person. Seems like their attention might be split. But I defy anyone to read about Eliot???s relationship with Lewes and not find one of the best literary love stories ever.Eliot should also be pissed that people are often so scandalized by her personal life that they neglect to give her writing the attention it deserves. Such is the case with so many literary women. Lena Dunham even tweeted about this a few years ago, writing: ???FYI George Eliot???s Wikipedia page is the soapiest most scandalous thing you???ll read this month. Thesis: she was ugly AND horny!???Dunham???s not wrong, though I will list a couple of books at the end of this piece in hopes that your search into Eliot???s life and work goes beyond Wikipedia (as I???m sure Dunham???s did). As for Eliot???s personal life, I think she and Lewes had a very healthy relationship and I will leave it at that. And in terms of her looks, people over the years have often commented on her less-than-ideal beauty. Henry James went on and on about it, though you should look up pictures of him and tell me if you think he???s anything to write home about. But I don???t think Eliot would be pissed if people think she???s ugly. I don???t think she???d care at all. I hope not.As irascible as I???m making Eliot sound, she had a life that was quite content and wonderful, and really only a couple of things to be pissed off about. She even had literary female friends, including Harriet Beecher Stowe, Margaret Fuller, and Christina Rossetti. I wish they???d hung out together more, though. I???d like to see them walking in slow motion ?? la Reservoir Dogs, armed with stacks of books or quills and ink pots.

Please find it attached.Portrait by Kelly Bjork.- - Sitting at my kitchen table, Lexi wears skimpy tights, pointy-toe ankle boots, and a rip-neckline t-shirt bearing the name of a band in drippy Halloween font. As always, her hairstyle is new and fascinating. Tonight it???s a neon-turquoise and highlighter-yellow concoction, set into a squishy top-bun. Before this, she had a bowl cut, which was so glossy and blunt and electric-blue it was seemingly made of plastic. When that look became too familiar, Lexi shaved her head to the scalp except for a longish purple patch on top. ???I styled that into fake pin curls so it was all spikey with lots of bobby pins sticking out of it,??? she says. ???I called it The Pineapple.???We???ve met to talk about the shooting we witnessed at the T",100
119,"wilight Exit. To start, we go over an incident near the end, just after Lexi had fled the building. She and an incoming customer Steve tended to Greg while he lay bleeding from a gunshot wound. As I described here, Lexi???s response was strikingly proficient. ???I learned it through military training,??? she said. Lexi has a septum ring, and she absently pinches it as she???s speaking. With her other hand, she holds a coconut popsicle. ???They gave us a PowerPoint showing us different types of injuries involving major trauma, and the best way to treat them. It was very basic. Just, like, what to do before medics arrived. If someone???s got an artery wound and you don???t make a tourniquet, they???ll bleed out,??? she said. (This can happen in minutes, by the way. The average person has ten or eleven pints of blood. Once someone loses six pints, their heart can???t get enough oxygen, so then their brain can???t get enough oxygen, and then they fall into a coma.) ???I offered to give my sweater for a tourniquet or whatever and his friend Steve was like, ???No. I???ve got pressure on the wound. I???m putting pressure on the wound,?????? she said.Steve???s story is coming up later, but let???s back up now so I can tell you more about Lexi, who comes from a military family and served ten years in the navy. ???We did full deployments with our weapons systems armed and all that, but there was not ever a call for us to be in combat, luckily,??? she says. ???I was a nuclear engineering officer.??? Among her many tattoos, a string of letters and symbols along her inner bicep tributes her most-treasured scientific formula. ???It???s the six-factor formula. Each term represents a factor that affects neutron population in the reactor core,??? she says. Before she moved to Seattle, she???d been stationed in Japan for a couple years, and before that, she got her degree in engineering mechanics. ???It???s a multidisciplinary degree in the engineering physics field that focuses on the design of dynamic structures,??? she says. Today, Lexi works a union job and lives in a vibrant neighborhood. In her free time, she used to sing lead in a punk band whose set list included titles like ???Grow Up (Don???t Throw Up)??? ??? but as it happened, they???d broken up that very day. ???I don???t get along with the guitar player, and he was saying things I thought were offensive, so a friend of mine stuck up for me and poured beer on him,??? she said. In Lexi???s world, outrageous things tend to happen with frequency. Confrontations materialize then quickly dissolve. The music plays loud. Her stuff gets stolen. Seductions occur. (Once with a member of Franz Ferdinand.)Back to the night of the shooting. As it started, Lexi and I had come to the Twilight Exit to sing karaoke, and we???d grabbed a couple stools in the corner of the lounge. Lexi first noticed James as he approached a woman, Whitney, who was seated across from us. ???I don???t remember what he was wearing. He had an olive complexion. I wouldn???t say he was African American, but he was not Caucasian. His hair was cut real short and he had facial hair, some sort of beard,??? she told a detective later that night. Lexi and I watched as James and Whitney had a heated exchange. As Lexi remembers, James???s statements involved unlocked doors, broken windows, and stolen TVs. The fight was too peculiar to be upsetting. ???He was hysterical, and she was completely ignoring him. She had this dead look on her face,??? said Lexi. As she saw the it, ???I didn???t want to be the asshole to step in. I guess it was just like any other thing ??? it???s not really going to be any help to them, all they???re gonna do is tell you to go away, and she???s probably gonna tell you to fuck off too. I had a feeling that???s what would happen. When you???re around other people, you put that wall up.???The bouncer led James away, and fifteen or twenty minutes passed without incident. As Lexi and I chatted and took pictures, ???I was getting ready for the karaoke guy to call my name because I knew my song was coming up soon,??? said Lexi. ???He???d told us the order when we turned in our slips so we were both half-listening for that. Your song was gonna be up right after mine,??? she said to me. In the dining room, a customer named Chris had just finished his rendition of Tina Turner???s ???Better Be Good To Me.??? A short silence followed as Karaoke Steve reloaded discs and selected the next song???s track. Microphone in hand, Steve was seconds from announcing Lexi???s name when a gunshot sounded in the alleyway entrance just outside the bar. ???A girl comes in the door. She says, ???Oh my God. He???s got a gun. He shot Greg,?????? said Lexi.In moments, Lexi and I were huddling on the floor in a dead-end corner with Whitney and a couple customers. James stood over us with a gun. I asked Lexi whether her military training had prepared her for this scenario. ???I don???t have commando training, I just have basic training, and I know there???s nothing you can do when you???re starting in a crouched position,??? she said. While Lexi and I had nearly the same view, we remembered James???s weapon differently. ???It was like a silver metallic, possibly a revolver,??? she said to a detective, while I would later describe it as ???a very generic-looking hand gun. Like a squirt gun, but dipped in black paint.???As we???d backed ourselves into the aisle, Lexi was directly behind me. Quickly, I stood and ran away.1 If my actions caused Lexi to feel abandoned, she didn???t mention it. ???There was a pause and you got up. I thought, ???Marti???s leaving me behind,??? but it was more like I was kicking myself. It felt like that was my chance, and it was over,??? she said. As Lexi remembers, James kept his gun on Whitney. ???He started yelling at her. He said, ???They killed my dog. They came into my house. Why did you do this to me???? I think Whitney was edging closer to the back corner, closer to me. She seemed really scared. She was saying, ???No. Please don???t.??? James said, ???My life is over. Now my life is over.??? Whitney was like, ???Why are you doing this to me???? and James said, ???Why are you doing this to me???? They just went back and forth like this,??? Lexi said.???I remember seeing his face. He looked completely miserable that everything was happening. I felt like I was witnessing something very private. He knew he was ruining his life. I think he was more mad and sad and hurt and upset about that than whatever it was they???d been arguing about earlier. He???d already shot the bouncer and at that point he knew it was too late to go back. He said something about, ???They killed my dog. They came into my house. Why did you do it. Now my life is over. My life is over now.??? That???s when he shot her,??? said Lexi. ???I remember smelling the gun smoke and thinking, ???This is the smell of violence.??? That was strange. I???ve been on firing ranges so many times when I was doing weapons training in the military. It had always been such a nonviolent smell to me.???On the floor in the corner, Lexi kept still. ???He was shooting down. It hit her in the stomach maybe. I???d been looking down when he fired the weapon. I couldn???t see clearly because she immediately hunched over,??? she said. ???Whitney was like, ???No. Stop. Why are you doing this???? She sank down on top of me. I had originally been on my knees but I ended up laying on my side and trying to crawl away as she fell on me. She was like, sitting on my hip and my stomach. I don???t think she even realized I was there. He shot her again. I thought he might???ve hit her, somewhere in her lower torso",100
120," or upper legs or in the pelvic area. He said, ???They killed my dog. My life is over.??? Her eyes were glazing over. She was like, ???Why are you doing this??????? said Lexi. ???It sounds weird, but I thought her blood would get all over me, and I???d be able to feel it spilling out and seeping into my clothes. I thought it???d be warm and wet, like pee. I was bracing for it, but it didn???t happen.???Just after the second gunshot, ???I sort of panicked. I was thinking, ???Oh my god. This is really happening. I???m gonna die here.??? There was no doubt in my mind he was going to shoot all of us. I was frantic. I started clawing my way out from under Whitney and climbing over the girl next to me. I still feel awful I did that to her, that I climbed over her like that,??? Lexi said. ???That???s when James turned. He saw me crawling away. He looked down at me and said, ???Just go. I???m sorry. I???m not trying to hurt you guys. Just go,?????? she said. ???Suddenly, I started identifying with James even though I knew he???d put me into that bad situation. I felt bad for him. He was just a human being. I saw how troubled he was. He was angry because he was hurt,??? she said. (My brain told me the same things about James. Just after the shooting, as Lexi and I discussed him again and again, our sentiments took on a reverential quality.)Immediately after James spoke to Lexi in the lounge, ???I ran out. I???m not sure if the other girl followed behind me, I wasn???t paying attention,??? she said. As Lexi exited the building, she remembers feeling ???total relief but also total confusion.??? She observed Greg propped against the building and bleeding heavily. ???At first I ran past him. But I couldn???t stop thinking about that girl I???d crawled over on the ground. I???d acted like she didn???t matter, or like she wasn???t human. I felt so bad. I thought, ???Stop. I can???t do this. I can???t be this shitty of a person. I can???t just crawl over someone,?????? she said. ???The whole situation gave me a guilty feeling, like I hadn???t done enough. I forced myself to turn around and help Greg.??? Working together, she and Steve maneuvered Greg near a dumpster around the corner and out of sight from the entrance. ???I was like, ???We gotta get him safe.??? Maybe I thought there might be a gunfight. In retrospect, it didn???t make any sense to move him. The guy with the gun had just let me go, and it seemed pretty unlikely he would come out after I left and try to shoot me or anyone else. I don???t know why I didn???t realize that til later,??? she said.Photo Credit: Seattle Police Department.Beyond Lexi???s first-aid efforts, much of her memories exist only in shards. ???I was just sort of freaked out and numb. I was processing that it was happening,??? she said. ???I saw you come out from behind the dumpster and you handed me the phone. I saw the police gathering to go in. I used to have a clearer memory of the cops lining up, but that???s faded. I heard a couple single shots and then a few spaced out shots and then a big burst, all at once. I don???t know who fired which, in terms of the single shots. I know there were a few apart.???Later, amidst the police tape and the ambulances, Lexi and I hugged for a long time. Her whole body was shaking. ???I was freezing. I had to leave my boots behind.2 They were caught under Whitney???s body, and they slipped down my legs when I was struggling to get away,??? she said.3 ???I didn???t have my jacket. It was cold and wet outside. My tights were soaked. I asked the cop if he had anything to put on my feet. I was hoping he had, like, CSI-style crime-scene booties. He was like, ???Here???s a blanket,??? so I stood on that,??? said Lexi. I remember it well. It was a yellow emergency blanket made of a lightweight plastic, too bulky to tie yet too flimsy to fold. Kneeling, I gathered the material into a dome around her feet and attempted to secure it at her ankles. No matter what variation I tried, whenever Lexi shifted, the structure would tenderly bloom itself open.As Lexi looked back on the night one year later, she spoke of James. ???I think about him every day,??? she said. ???One of the last things he did in his life was decide not to shoot me. He had mercy.???- -fn1.  Lexi and I discussed these moments later that night. As I understood her, she said Whitney had been making a move to get behind me and potentially use me as a shield. But when I asked Lexi about it later, it seemed Whitney???s actions might???ve involved me less directly. ???She was trying to get closer to where we all were. She was trying to climb on top of all of us. Maybe she was trying to hide behind us out of total fear,??? said Lexi. There are only two things I can remember of Whitney from our brief time together on the floor, and they barely amount to anything: the sight of her long black hair, and the pressure of her body directly against my side. With no way to verify the facts, the proper thing would???ve been to drop it, but for a time, my emotions mingled confusingly. Once, as I zipped by on a public bus, I saw a woman on the sidewalk who resembled Whitney. I was seized by anxiety.2 ???They???re knee-length black leather boots with multiple buckles,??? said Lexi. ???I couldn???t wear them again for a few months. I didn???t have the courage. The bar owner called them ???the sticky boots??? when he handed them back to me. He said his bar manager wiped them down. I kept them in a plastic bag in the back of my closet,??? she said. ???Finally, one night I was getting dressed up to go out, and I was like, ???Fuck that. It???s already bad enough that I???ve been having problems with this. I???m not gonna let them fuck up my favorite pair of boots.??? That???s where the line was drawn. I cleaned them off. I scrubbed them out in the bathtub with soap. A ton of blood came out. You couldn???t see all of it because the boots were black, but I could tell it was there,??? she said. ???To me, it was very symbolic. Now I???m back to wearing them all the time.???3 In the following weeks, ???I had lots of bad dreams. They were always about being somewhere unsafe and feeling unsafe, and having to leave because there was some sort of emergency ??? whether it was a fire or a flood, or there were just bad people around,??? Lexi said. ???I think it???s because I was physically trapped. I was stuck under her. I was trying to get away, but I couldn???t move. It???s like your nightmare when you???re in a scary situation.???A Wise and Informed Proposal to Improve Female Health and Ensure Feminine Suppression- -Sadly, we are living in a morally depraved age. When you walk through the streets of any American city at rush hour, and you see people sprinting for trains, cursing at one another, and pushing their way into cabs with no regard for each other, you can???t help but acknowledge the following fact: There aren???t enough people in this country.The problems don???t stop there. Recent polls show that the United States is one of the least-happy developed countries on earth, and we suffer from a lack of community and familial bonds. Unfortunately, these problems disproportionately affect women because they are weak and lack basic common sense. We also know that women face prejudice at higher rates than men, and that they tend to overreact to it due to their irrational disposition.It is time someone took female health and happiness seriously. It is time we treated women justly by giving them a purpose that aligns with Biblical dictates. I am here to say it is time we made abortion a safe, humane, illegal nightmare.I have daughters who I want to grow up to be the best version of wha",100
121,"t I allow them to be. I have sisters and female friends and wives and mothers who should be able to determine their lives within a certain narrow range. I want equality for some and elaborate shaming procedures for others. That is the only way to achieve full and true equality.With that in mind, I am proposing a plan that will change access to abortion in the following ways:A woman seeking an abortion will be forced to watch an ultrasound of her fetus. She must locate the heart and clearly point to it, even if it???s too small to see.Doctors and nurses at clinics that perform abortions will be required to wear scary masks and, occasionally, scream for no reason.A woman seeking an abortion must put $300 in cash on a surgical table and light it on fire.As part of the state???s sexual educational program, girls in high school will be required to carry a headstone around with them for a day to see how an abortion really feels.Clinics that offer abortions must pay a small, $35 million tax. This will go to subsidizing schools, and by schools we mean American corporations that are now technically based in Barbados.Clinics that offer abortions must not be within 500 feet of any churches, but must be within 400 feet of a confessional booth.With these policies, which smartly combine fear, shaming, embarrassment, needless economic burdens, paradoxical regulations, and good old fashioned threats, I believe we can return to the days of societal contentment and shared purpose we saw in the pre-Roe v. Wade years of 1966-1973.The benefits of this plan are myriad. We will keep women out of the workforce long enough to ensure that difficult, complicated jobs like police office, banker, and doctor are held by men as God intended. Women will soon find that the shackles of motherhood aren???t shackles at all, but are long awaited rip cords for the young, abused, and economically disadvantaged. Finally, because some clinics will be forced to close, we might even facilitate a few STD outbreaks ??? just fruits for immoral behavior.Now, some of my colleagues have disagreed with my proposal publicly and loudly. You have probably heard their arguments. They believe that women should carry a heavy sign around their neck that reads, I HAD AN ABORTION. PLEASE PELT ME WITH ORANGES SO THAT I MAY LEARN. While undoubtedly well-intentioned ??? it is certainly important for women???s friends, family, and employers to know their private medical history ??? we believe these steps go too far. Women are much too weak to carry a sign for very long, and oranges would fracture their frail, brittle bones. We must take a more realistic and humane approach.I have listened to my fellow Americans. I have read Rob White???s letters to the Indianapolis Star. I have listened to Mark Pritner???s voicemails. I have deciphered the scrawl of Gary Tunder. With the input of people like these, I have come up with my plan.I feel confident this proposal will become law because it???s right, because it???s just, because people are scared to speak out about this issue due to threats from far right-wing domestic terrorists, and because the state and national press won???t cover this issue, or if they do, it will be in such a cursory and misleading way that the bill will appear to be some combination of harmless and inevitable, even though it???s neither. Though the movement to spread freedom for women through restricted choices has suffered a loss in the Supreme Court, take heart in the knowledge that we are very well-funded, and we aren???t going away.Know that you can trust me. This bill doesn???t affect me directly because I am a man, so I can approach this sensitive subject with objectivity, righteousness, and rationality.- - -Dayn Rond???s new bookAtlas Flubbed: A Modern Parodyis available here.What???s happening in your ???gut??? may be affecting what???s going on in your brain.As a new area of research, this might sound a little far-fetched, but it???s really happening. We have known for years that we have ???helpful??? bacteria living within us, and they are important to our digestive health. What we are now starting to find out is that these bacteria may also play important roles in our mental health, and anyone who suffers from a mental illness will tell you, our mental health has far reaching effects for our overall well-being.A few months ago, President Obama announced an initiative to fund research into the microbiome. For me, this is exciting for a few reasons, namely due to the fact that one of the best ways to make the jump from Early-Career Scientist to Mid-Career Scientist is to secure your own funding. Besides that, the microbiome represents a relatively unknown area of science that may shine some light on some very complicated questions. You know, the usual exciting science stuff.The traditional definition of Microbiome is the study of the collective genomes of microbes (fungi, bacteria, viruses) that live within a distinct habitat. Based on this definition, we can survey a small, ecologically-distinct area (the soil 6 inches deep in an old-growth forest, the human small intestine, the lichen on a downed log, etc), then extract and sequence the genetic material to discover the diversity of microorganisms living within these distinct spaces.Several studies have done this, and the general consensus is that there are incredibly high numbers of bacteria within these ecologically-distinct systems. Now, the focus is not so much the genetic diversity (still important), but has headed toward a second, more ecologically-focused definition: the collective activity of the fungi, bacteria, and viruses that live within an ecologically-distinct habitat. In other words, vast, diverse communities of microbes don???t just sit there. They eat, excrete (don???t think about it), communicate, reproduce (lots), and in many instances, transfer genes between themselves. The big questions remain: how are these different species co-existing?  What does this mean for the higher life forms (plants and animals) they colonize?An effort to organize and classify the work done on microbiomes of the human body has yielded the National Institute of Health???s Human Microbiome Project,1 a database that organizes all of the genetic work done on five ecologically distinct areas of the human body: skin, airway, gut, urogenital, oral, as well as a sixth, miscellaneous classification. Collections are sampled from the healthy, as well as no-so-healthy individuals, so that we may characterize the differences between microbiomes of healthy and ill individuals.For me, the most striking result from human studies thus far has been the sheer number of bacterial cells found, estimated to be about 1014-1015 just within the intestinal tract. This is 10-100 times higher than the number of eukaryotic cells found within the body.2 On a case-by-case basis, the bacteria that colonize us may be symbiotic (awesome!), commensal (thumbs up), pathogenic (thumbs down), or a combination of these categories, depending on the population density and the presence of other species.What exactly are these bacterial cells doing?  What do they want?  Do they have goals? Are they helping us?  Hurting us?  Do they help each other?  Are they trying to destroy each other?  Are we really just a walking, breathing, eating framework to supplement all the different microbes within us?This is where it gets really complicated.Traditionally, there have been three major functions of our microbiome: First, they collectively protect us from pathogenic bacteria through competition of resources (you can???t sit with us), secondly, they fortify the intestinal epithelial barrier to limit bacte",100
122,"rial movement into tissues (none shall pass), and thirdly, they help us break down indigestible dietary molecules (nom) to improve our uptake of vitamins and other nutrients.Now, we potentially have a fourth role: to protect us from harmful collective stress responses, which may result in everything from generalized anxiety disorders and depression, to diseases caused by low-level inflammation, such as irritable bowel syndrome and Crohn???s disease. In fact, some studies are hypothesizing that this list of neuro-psychiatric disorders could potentially be expanded to include autism and Alzheimer???s disease (reviewed in 3 4).It???s been established that signaling pathways connect the nervous system, the endocrine system, and the immune system, and we know that the gastrointestinal system can also trigger the central nervous system (gut-brain axis).4 The recent findings suggest that this occurs through signaling by gut bacteria. One of the many theories is that if our gastrointestinal microbiome is shifted to less-than-optimal conditions, a systemic stress signal is activated.Behind every emotional state, including stress, there is a synthesis and release of hormones. In the case of stress, these hormones are namely adrenaline and cortisol, which trigger signaling cascades resulting in the fight-or-flight response (elevated heart rate, movement of glucose into the bloodstream, altered immune system response), while shutting down ???unnecessary??? bodily functions including digestion. The stress response has been great for us on an evolutionary basis, but we can imagine that the cumulative effects of chronic stress make us rather ill. Problems such as anxiety, depression, digestive problems, headaches, sleep problems, weight gain, and memory/concentration issues have all been linked to chronic stress.5Now we have a bit of a chicken and egg scenario: what came first?  Are chronically-elevated levels of stress preventing us from maintaining an optimal microbiotic balance?  Or is it our poor microbiotic balance keeping us vulnerable to the effects of chronic stress?Timing is very important when it comes to establishing a microbiome. The human fetal gut lacks any kind of significant biotic colonization; the microbiome is established very shortly after birth, and the completed signature is present within less than one year.6 This colonization is thought to happen primarily through close contact with humans, particularly mom. This implies that there is a short window of opportunity for us to establish an optimal microbiome, and it???s the establishment of this microbiome that is necessary for us to maintain good neuropsychiatric health throughout all of our lives.Of course, this brings into play the importance of sufficient maternity leave, but that???s a topic for another time, and probably another author.At this point, there are still tons of known unknowns, hence the drive to fund research into this area.Here are some questions that we still have:What are some of the microbiome community dynamics? Is the presence of some species ???better??? for us than others?  What exactly is an ???optimal??? condition?What are the origins of the microbiome? When and why did bacteria start colonizing higher life forms?How does the host genetic makeup affect the microbiome?What are the effects of antibiotics on the microbiome?How can a microbiome be altered to improve overall health?Should I let my toddler eat dirt? Their own boogers? Should I be eating dirt or my own boogers?Obviously, there is still quite of work to be done. But in the meantime, eat healthy, get sufficient rest, make sure you walk about 10,000 steps each day, and just imagine yourself as some sort of planetary entity, a Mother Earth-type vehicle for masses of thriving bacterial specimens that are eating, reproducing, dancing and singing to that great cosmic order.- - - 1 Human Microbiome Project2 Gill SR., et al. 2006.

What???s that? 10 things ??? no, 11 things you probably didn???t know about William and Kate???s wedding cake? Number one: the cake was three tiers tall because three is Kate???s lucky number. Number two: the cake was accompanied by pistachio ice cream because that is what the royal couple ate on their first date. Number three: the frosting included the fingernails of every butler that has served the Queen in the last 60 years. Number four: the cake was made with low-calorie ingredients, but the frosting was 90% butterfat, an homage to the late Princess Diana???s yo-yo dieting habits. Number five: the cake was adorned with 14,000 Swarovski crystals, 9,000 of which were accidentally consumed by the Dowager Duchess of Devonshire, who it appears has something of a crystal habit. Number six: the cake was topped with a jaunty fascinator. It was made of marzipan. Number seven: the cake was designed by notable pastry chef Dominique Ansel, who reportedly threw up his hands during the baking process and shouted, ???Dees stoopeed piece of sheet cake!??? prompting the Queen Mother to do a frontside 180 in her grave. Number eight: William and Kate saved two servings to enjoy on their first anniversary, which also included a round of putt-putt and a serenade performed by Adele. Number nine: the cake was insured by Lloyd???s of London for two million pounds (also an unfortunate reference to the late Princess Diana???s weight). Number ten: British psychic Jane Fryer has suggested that the cake was the reincarnation of Richard III, and that people should have recognized that when the cake started shouting, ???Hey guys, I???m buried under a parking lot. Fookin??? nice way to treat a king!??? Number eleven: Camilla, in yet another cruel snub, was disallowed from utilizing the royal cutlery to eat her cake; instead she was forced to use a fork fashioned out of a splintery tongue depressor supplied by the Queen???Ladies and gentlemen, now back to the discussion at hand.

Good night.[Cue Steve Miller Band, ???Fly Like an Eagle??? outro]TO: execstaff@cia.govFROM: Office of the Director of the Central Intelligence AgencyRE: Great Work On Pok??mon GoCONFIDENTIALI???d like to take this opportunity to congratulate everyone on the extremely successful rollout of Operation Pok??mon GO to Raise Public Morale. I know we had to hustle to speed up this launch by several weeks from its scheduled release on September 10th but it seems to have paid off. More people have downloaded this game in the last 72 hours than have voted in every Democratic primary combined.It seemed crazy when we floated this idea last year, between Mass Shootings #188 and #189: could ???augmented reality??? really distract people from regular, awful reality? We took a bold gamble that it would, and it paid off!Thank you for giving the American public something to engage with mindlessly after two Black men and five police officers were shot in cold blood within three days. It seemed, for a fraught 48 hours, like Americans would have to engage with the news, and as past history evidences, that???s not great for us. Luckily, we can leave that discussion to the talking heads; good, ordinary Americans can find solace in locating Jigglypuffs in public spaces.In an unprecedented threat, it seemed even Twitter and Snapchat were getting away from us: a huge number of users were seriously grappling with police brutality and racial politics. Were it not for the power of ???90s nostalgia and dynamic animation, this may have been a turning point for these platforms. I am incredibly moved to see Twitter repopulated with hilarious photos of Pok??mon in inopportune places, like a frying pan.A couple of housekeeping notes for the forthcoming update:Let???s ramp up the Pok??Stops in public squares and on main streets; many municipal leaders have said the user influx is really helping to disrupt public protests and visible civil disobedience.Hold off on the in-app purchases; let???s keep the price point at zero so we can reach the maximum number of Americans who stand to engage substantially with current events.We have been encouraged to plant Pok??mon on Trump properties, and tacitly threatened with Twitter censure if we don???t. It???s not worth risking the user base loss, so let???s go ahead and knock this out ??? but nothing above a Pok??dex of 12.But those are minor tweaks at best. This really was one for the books, boys. I???d put it in the crisis distraction hall of fame, alongside Grease, Dorito Tacos, and The Bachelor. A world filled with adorable monsters is so vastly preferable to one filled with violent illustrations of structural injustice.Let???s not rest on our laurels, however. The Minions AR game has a hard launch of November 7, one day before the presidential election. Universal Pictures expects a working prototype by summer???s end. Is it a tall order to surpass the inane animated cuteness of Pok??mon GO? Of course.

This famous quote is often attributed to Benjamin Franklin, a man who, I assume, famously died doing his taxes. However, many conspiracy theorists disagree with Mr. Franklin???s sentiments regarding the certainty of death. Plus, most of them don???t pay taxes, as they???re positive the government uses the money to pay Bigfoot to strongarm Edward Snowden out of the news.Are conspiracists correct in asserting that several important individuals faked their deaths? Are we sure anyone has ever really died, or is death just a hoax used to sell coffins and have The Sixth Sense make some sort of sense? If you fake your death in The Matrix, do you fake your death in the real world? Will I reference another movie? No. Dr. No? Yes.To possibly answer these questions, I???ll analyze the supposed false deaths of several famous figures by examining the claims of conspiracy theorists, debunkers, and then rebunking with my own maniacal ravings. This will undoubtedly determine whether or not these people truly passed on, or just passed themselves off as someone else and lived out their days incognito.Hell, you might be one of them. Or maybe I???m one of them. Maybe both of us! Maybe You, Me and Dupree.- -Conspiracy Claim: Elvis Presley faked his death in 1977 in order to live a quiet life outside of the spotlight. He may even still be alive today.Debunking Claim: Elvis has left the building known as life. He ain???t nothing but a hound dog. A hound dog that is dead.Rebunking Claim: The King, the name Elvis paid us to call him, was larger than life by several inches, making it impossible for him to die. Faking his death allowed Elvis to get away from music and focus on what he did best: making ridiculous sandwiches. Everyone knows Elvis??? famously odd peanut butter, banana, and bacon sandwich creation, but that???s just the tip of the iceberg lettuce. For years, Elvis self-published bizarre sandwich cookbook after bizarre sandwich cookbook under various pseudonyms, most of which rhymed with Elvis. He passed away in 1997 after eating one of his patented roast beef, chocolate syrup, cloves, and live grenade sandwiches.- -Conspiracy Claim: Adolf Hitler did not commit suicide in 1945, rather he fled to Argentina to live out the rest of his days.Debunking Claim: Nein, Hitler died exactly when historians believe he died. He is survived by his infamy and Michael Jordan???s occasional mustache.Rebunking Claim: While getting destroyed in the sequel to World War I, Hitler realized his true love had always been writing. While most are under the impression that he only wrote the page-turning romp and book club favorite Mein Kampf, in Argentina Hitler combined his knowledge of military strategy and writing and became bestselling author Tom Clancy. Hitler kept his identity under wraps by always wearing sunglasses and insisting that his hard German accent and constant wearing of armbands was just a funny thing he liked to do.- -Conspiracy Claim: Renowned rapper Tupac Shakur was not murdered at the age of 25. Not only is he still alive, he???s still recording and releasing music.Debunking Claim: Tupac is still rapping, but he???s doing it alongside Beethoven and Kurt Cobain, both of whom are dead and hate rap.Rebunking Claim: In 1996, Tupac was shot and rushed to a hospital in critical condition. The only way to save his life was an experimental surgery that turned him into a hologram. News agencies reported Tupac as dead because reporting that he was turned into a hologram would???ve required more work and explanation, which everyone agreed they???d rather not do. At Coachella in 2012, Tupac came out as a hologram, yet sadly nobody realized that this was the true Tupac, the Truepac. Hologram Tupac is now a substitute history teacher in Wyoming.- -Conspiracy Claim: Andy Kaufman???s ???death??? due to lung cancer in 1984 was just another one of the comedian and performance artist???s elaborate hoaxes. Soon he???ll reappear and reveal the truth.Debunking Claim: Kaufman took the Taxi to deadtown. He???s the Man on the Moon, a place where everything is dead.Rebunking Claim: Kaufman wanted the hoax of his own death to be the greatest comedic performance ever. He???d lay low for many years and then announce to the world that he was still alive. Everyone would get a big laugh, his family would forgive him, and the IRS would be like ???You got us good. Keep the taxes!??? However, right before he was about to come clean he saw the hilarious movie Cool Runnings, which Andy deemed a far better comedic performance than his faked demise. Not wanting to have his death hoax joke described as a ???lesser Cool Runnings,??? Andy decided to keep his secret a secret and watched Cool Runnings until he happily died.- -Conspiracy Claim: Harambe, the gorilla supposedly shot and killed at the Cincinnati Zoo, is actually still alive. He pretended to die in order to teach parents to be more mindful of their children. He now lives in Wyoming with Hologram Tupac.Debunking Claim: Wait, what?Rebunking Claim: Wait, what?7:04 AM.Name: PidgeyNotes: A hipster pigeon has taken roost atop one of the kitchen cabinets.

Occasional foaming at the mouth suggests that it might additionally have an untreated case of rabies.

(Thirty-eight, maybe, if you are genetically gifted, incredibly wealthy and/or have access to Cate Blanchett???s stem cells.) Visible aging is inconsiderate and self-indulgent. By not dyeing your hair or moisturizing routinely, you are hurting the people around you, forcing them to confront their own mortality with each puckered crease of exposed elbow skin.Take steps to protect the innocentCamouflage, conceal, and distract. Buy every lotion, potion, contour pallette, and self-tanner you can get your hands on. Bleach or otherwise remove dark spots as they to appear on those hands.

Purchase all the Spanx.Start transitioning to a predominantly digital existenceAvoid daylight and un-retouched images. If you must be present in three dimensions, limit yourself to dark basement venues without access to the internet, cameras, or cell phones. Socialize only in select circles. Ensure those circles are not under your eyes.Get your nails manicuredOnce polished, do not allow visible chips to form on your fingers. Chips suggest a hurried, harried woman with little time for frivolity. Chips imply that the weight of adulthood and responsibility and a lifetime of relentless personal monitoring and physical upkeep have begun to rob you of girlish, carefree charm.Adopt a girlish, carefree charmDo not be harsh. Do not sound harsh. Do not stand under harsh lighting or dress in anything too severe. When you visit your dermatologist/plastic surgeon/aesthetician, insist they take the steps necessary to plaster your face into a permanently pleasant visage.Regulate your emotionsDo not yell. Do not cry. Consider experimental procedures to have your tear ducts removed. Crying will undercut your authority, highlight your physical and psychological liabilities, and compromise hours of strategically applied societal warpaint. Also, after a certain age, tears will cause you to spontaneously melt.Wear heelsComfortable shoes and sneakers are reserved for young, braless, perpetually perky women who amass at music festivals or on beaches with dress codes of triangles and string.

It is therefore curious that we???re so indifferent to the simplest way of facilitating a long, happy life: saving our money.Americans are terrible at saving for retirement. A third of us haven???t saved anything at all, and those of us who do have retirement savings usually have nowhere near enough. Without Social Security and Medicare, most of us would spend our post-work years eating cat food and treating our angina with baby aspirin.One sector of our populace, however, has enthusiastically embraced a certain version of retirement planning. The ???prepper??? movement is a growing cadre of Americans who believe that the collapse of civilization is imminent, and the only rational course of action is to dig a hole in the ground, fill it with dehydrated scrambled eggs, and defend it with automatic weapons. America being the capitalist wonderland that it is, myriad enterprising companies have sprung up to peddle the guns, the eggs, and the shovels for digging the holes.Prepperdom is fertile territory for Fear, Inc. ??? a significant block of people living in daily expectation of terrorist attacks, earthquakes, electrical grid failure, hyperinflation, global pandemics, rising sea levels, overpopulation, martial law, nuclear war, the Yellowstone supervolcano, solar flares, hurricanes, and tsunamis. Some preppers blend a generous helping of apocalyptic religion into their theories, but many others do not. Whether their disaster of choice is natural, supernatural, or man-made, preppers all tend to assume that once ???the shit hits the fan??? (or ???TSHTF,??? as they have jargonized it), humans will turn on one another, competing violently for food, shelter, and whatever else still retains value after the day of reckoning.The marketing opportunities are self-evident: anything a person values, or that might become valuable in a catastrophe, can be sold to preppers. Even better, it turns out that when people make purchases under the assumption that supplies will one day become scarce, they???re more willing to pay the kinds of prices you???d expect to see after supplies actually become scarce. As a result, security industry analysts have observed, ???many traditional-use products are marked up when offered as part of a disaster survival kit.??? It???s a sort of Doomsday Bonus for this sector of Fear, Inc.: price gouging somehow increases their products??? appeal. Armageddon may soon bring to Earth the total destructive force of God???s holy wrath, but in the meantime, it???s a solid profit generator.Gauging the overall dollar value of the prepper market is tricky, since the movement???s adherents are characterized by mistrust of most social structures, and the companies who sell to them naturally reflect the same worldview. But prepper activity certainly surged after 9/11, and again after the 2008 election of President Obama. Residential generators, to take one example, are now a $17 billion annual market, and growing. Product offerings have diversified. A Google ???shopping??? search for ???emergency water storage??? yi",100
128,"elds ten pages of products, including 4-oz. pouches of water, available in lots of 96, approved by the U.S. Coast Guard. Why store water in old milk jugs, Fear, Inc. asks, when for $29.95 (plus shipping) you can possess twenty-four 12-ounce cans of water (which ???will stand up on flat surfaces???), with a guaranteed 50-year shelf life?Of course, it???s wise to be prepared for a hurricane or earthquake if such natural disasters occur in your area, and even if they don???t, FEMA recommends keeping 72 hours??? worth of food, water, and batteries on hand for unexpected situations. But preppers disdain this low-key approach. Their all-out investment in prepping ??? both emotional and financial ??? has been portrayed in gruesome detail on television where programs showcase preppers building Burmese tiger traps, homebrewing biodiesel, and blowing off their thumbs during marksmanship practice.These people may not understand the concept of self-preservation the way you or I do, but their zeal is undeniable. It???s part of a hallowed American tradition of preparing for the worst, rooted in our self-sufficient frontier heritage, and in the religious idiosyncrasies that forced many Americans to move to the frontier in the first place. Mormon families are still urged to store food in anticipation of lean times, and in fact many of today???s internet-based food-storage companies are headquartered in Utah.Other religious leaders profit more directly from End Time fears. Televangelist Jim Bakker, who knows a thing or two about disaster, sells an entire line of survival products. ???Preparing for Tomorrow Starts Today,??? Bakker???s website advises, just in case we???re unclear on the meaning of ???prepare.??? His Morningside Ministry offers products (called ???Love Gifts,??? possibly to avoid jeopardizing the ministry???s tax-exempt status) like Morningside Fire NOW (price: $100), which is essentially Sterno (???Composed of recycled wood, inert minerals and shielded with a patented blend of paraffin, Morningside Fire NOW is inherently safe???). Or there???s the FUEL-LESS??? Generator 100-Watt Foldable Solar Panel (Maximum output 100W; $450), or the $350 EMP3 Bag, made of woven copper mesh and waterproof ballistics nylon, withstands lightening, solar flares, and even a full on EMP attack (currently out of stock). There???s also a first aid kit, with ???over 500 quality emergency basic supplies,??? like ammonia inhalant, Calamine lotion, Cayenne Pepper, a rain poncho, a scalpel, a stethoscope, a ???Skin Stapler w/ Staples??? and (thank heavens) a ???Staple Remover Kit.???If whiling away the post-apocalyptic hours playing doctor makes you hungry, you can sustain yourself with the survival food Bakker sells, packaged in convenient buckets. For a hundred dollars, you can choose the Italian Variety Bucket, the Family Feast Bucket (???includes 62 servings of fixin???s for a satisfying home cooked meal including freeze-dried turkey, mashed potatoes, bread rolls, green bean casserole and pumpkin pie mousse!???), or the 30 Day Fiesta Bucket. For a mere $3,500, you can purchase the Time of Trouble Tasty Food PLUS Meal Multipliers, which nets you twenty-eight 90-Day Emergency Food Buckets, and will set you up for seven years of troubled times ??? almost twice the duration of Bakker???s stint in federal prison for mail and wire fraud.The food in these buckets, despite the language of homey comfort and abundance used to describe it, is unappetizing to the point of being inedible, and like many of Fear, Inc.???s disaster-branded products, it???s overpriced (frankly, I wouldn???t pay $80 for a box of pancake mix even if it was the last one on Earth.) Yet Bakker claims his food will, after the apocalypse, be ???more valuable than gold.??? If he???s right, you???d better be prepared to defend your stash from the hordes of people who find themselves stuck on Earth after the Rapture with nary a Fiesta Bucket laid by.Morningside Ministry doesn???t sell weapons (which are admittedly difficult to frame as ???Love Gifts???), so anyone wanting to safeguard their $9,660 investment in pasta marinara will have to turn elsewhere. Fortunately, armed defense is integral to prepper culture, and the internet is full of helpful lists of weapons every prepper needs. Stocking your arsenal properly won???t be cheap. The gun assortment recommended by Freedom Preppers, prices out at $4,452.84 if you buy from online retailer Impact Guns, not including shipping and fees. And keep in mind that Freedom Preppers recommends buying two of each weapon (in case you need to ???cannibalize one for parts???), so your total bill would be $8,905.68. Then of course you???ll need some specialized magazines and bullets; Freedom Preppers provides a helpful example of how they accessorize their AR 15s for practical dystopian use: ???In a battle scenario, we would carry 30 round mags filled with 28 rounds to limit jams. The last three rounds would be tracer ammo to warn us the mag is being emptied.??? They also recommend hiding a few extra .9 mm handguns around your property (perhaps in a spare Family Feast Bucket) so they???re ???available when needed.???Preppers??? fantasy-driven purchasing behavior is a godsend to many sectors of Fear, Inc., but especially to gun manufacturers, who increasingly rely on repeat sales and hoarding for their profits. You could argue that preppers who buy a bunch of guns and hide them all around their private Boy Scout camps aren???t really hurting anyone, as long as they keep to themselves. What business is it of ours if people want to waste time, money, and food preparing for something that will never happen? Plenty of young women, back in the days of hope chests, poured heart and soul into laying up linens for weddings that never transpired. It???s a bit tragic, but people get to choose their own dreams.Except that people planning for an imaginary future will often end up terribly unprepared for the future that does come to pass. How many Morningside Ministry customers can really afford to spend $70 on a pound of freeze-dried chicken breast chunks? Wouldn???t most of them be better off saving or investing that $70? You could easily pour a lifetime???s worth of disposable income into prepper merchandise, and still end up effectively eating cat food in your old age, treating your angina with cayenne pepper.I won???t try to argue against the charm of self-sufficiency and battle scenarios. I???ll just point out what we know from many past events: That cooperation, not competition, is what increases your odds of survival in a disaster. So the ???Survival Tips??? offered by the Happy Prepper (???Use up all your cash,??? ???Do NOT alert neighbors and friends,??? ???Gorge on the contents of your refrigerator???) aren???t just selfish and petty, they???re bad practical advice.Prepping isn???t a new phenomenon. End-of-the-world cults always flourish during times of social anxiety. What???s new is the existence of an entire suite of industries working assiduously to maximize the profit potential of this anxiety. By diverting the average American???s already scarce income to fantastic survival schemes, prepping increases the real risk of poverty in old age. By feeding our fears of social collapse, this sector of Fear, Inc. is encouraging more and more Americans to be paranoid, detached, selfish, misinformed, violent, and armed.The prepper industry may in fact be nudging us toward a society that???s more likely to collapse. It???s certainly selling us a society whose collapse we???d be unlikely to mourn.It seems like everywhere I go, somebody wants to contradict my parenting. When passers-by see my two-and-a-half-",100
129,"year-old son, Oscar, trip and fall they go to help him up while I???m trying to teach him to pull himself up on his own. His friends??? parents just assume I???m okay with him eating gluten. The Heteronormativity Enforcers keep asking him if he has a girlfriend. And worst of all, they ruin our special time: robbing liquor stores together.???Isn???t a little late for such a little boy to be out???? they ask.Wow. Just wow. They think I don???t monitor my son???s sleep just because he???s out at night? Oscar and I are out at 2 AM because daytime robberies can go bad really quick. So you see, I???m doing what???s best for him here.???Is it safe for a little boy to hold a shotgun????Yes, guns can be dangerous, but I am not going to shield my son from all the dangers of this world. Rather than pretend life is just rainbows and ice cream, I have given him a shotgun. You think I don???t care about safety? I made it smaller for him by sawing off the barrel. And it???s pretty rich that you think I???m unsafe when you???re the one with a shotgun pointed at your knees.???Please, here???s the money! Just go! I have a family!???Is that suppose to imply that I don???t have a family? That just because I choose to incorporate my son into my life rather than leave him at home with a sitter, somehow your family is better than mine? Armed robbery is the only way Oscar and I feel truly alive and we will ride this tiger straight to Hell. But some people see us having a good time together and they just don???t understand. Would you believe someone actually called the police? The police! Just because my son was unsupervised for a few seconds while I was threatening the cashier. Go helicopter your own children! Oscar and I are doing just fine.Also, yes, a toddler in a ski mask holding a sawed-off shotgun is adorable, but don???t record my son without my permission. It is an invasion of his privacy and a denial of his agency. He is not an object for your amusement; he is a trained outlaw who will never be taken alive.Yes, yes: I know people mean well. We all want children to grow up happy and healthy, but give the benefit of the doubt to us parents that we just might know what???s best for our own kids. Please respect my decisions and let me raise my own child.Now, hurry up and empty your wallets into Oscar???s Thomas the Tank Engine knapsack.As I stood in line, I couldn???t help but wonder how I looked to the outside world. Me, hijabi, hitting the club.Having found ??? as usual ??? no pop culture precedent to refer to, I???ve customized a few popular song lyrics to help set the scene:That???s why I need a one dance/got a hijabi by the hand/one more time ???fore I go/rogue Muslim girl taking a hold on me???Hijabi in the club/bottle full of bub/look Muslima, I got the X if you into taking drugs/shouldn???t you be at the mosque or something???My headscarf brings all the boys to the yard/ and they???re like, it???s better than yours/Damn right, it???s better than yours/I could teach you, but it would be cultural appropriationI don???t remember what I was wearing. Considering the fact that that my spring wardrobe almost entirely consists of clearance rack maxi-dresses, old-lady cardigans in dark colors, and ill-fitting blouses stolen from my mother, it probably wasn???t impressive. (I don???t think you would want to hit the club ??? or your local supermarket, or your downstairs mailbox, or even your fire escape in the event of an emergency ??? in my spring wardrobe.)I don???t remember the exact name of the club, either; only that it started with an L and sounded vaguely European, sleek, sexy. In one word, it represented everything I was not. For one thing, I???ve never been invited to a single high school party.This is probably because most people assume that practicing Muslim women embody certain non-partying values. For the most part, they???re right: you won???t find a burka-clad woman sliding down a stripper pole or knocking back vodka at the bar. I personally do not believe in drinking, smoking, or hooking up with strangers.The problem is that the assumptions don???t stop at partying. I???ve received shocked looks for listening to rap music, for dropping the rare f-bomb, for wearing nail polish. For laughing too loudly, for caring about my appearance, for having friends who drink, smoke, and hook up. In other words, for being anything other than the sexless, miserable, and severe worshipper that my headscarf ??? the ultimate Islamic symbol ??? conveys to the Western world.This kind of social non-recognition is painful. I am, after all, a 17-year-old girl.Last year, at the peak of my frustrations, I decided to start wearing a snapback atop my headscarf. Perhaps the two social symbols would cancel each other out. They did not. (I did discover, however, that wearing the two items in conjunction is the quickest way to make my friends laugh. It has become my regular party trick ??? minus the party, of course.) The snapback incident has been the latest in a string of (usually less embarrassing) attempts to distance myself from the extremist stereotype.So when the three students who were hosting my overnight stay at their college asked me to party with them, I instantly agreed. What better way to show that I was fun and normal and definitely not a suicide bomber than to join them? What better way to prove that I was not too undesirably Islamic than to engage in markedly, undeniably un-Islamic behaviors?Outside of the club L, the bass dropped again and again, pulsing through me like a defibrillator jerking a body back to life.The college students were offering me much more than a party organized by frat boys. Beyond the doors of the club lay the opportunity to finally be perceived as an ordinary American teenager. For the first time in my life, the persona of Cool Hijabi seemed more of a possibility and less of an oxymoron. Perhaps I had been too hasty to abandon the snapback aesthetic.My optimism shattered when I found myself directly in front of the bouncer. There is no better reality check than facing a man whose upper body is bulky enough to qualify as a medical anomaly. And as it turned out, the reality outside of club L was not sleek, sexy, or particularly European. It was pathetic: me, in my dreadful spring wardrobe, realizing that I had a) let myself down, and b) come to this realization much too late.The college girls looked on intently as I performed the ruse we had planned, rummaging through my bag with an increasingly puzzled expression.???Oh my God, I think I forgot my ID in my dorm?????? I started.???You need ID to get in,??? the bouncer said coldly, looking as though he was exactly one more insubordination away from a fist fight.???But she???s with us?????? said one of the girls, gesturing so that the paper bracelet he wrapped around her wrist flapped gaudily.???No.??? the bouncer said, lifting the red queue rope and all but shoving me under it. If he hadn???t terrified every last cell in my body, I might???ve smiled at him. And that was the end of my first club experience. It was approximately five minutes long.As soon as the bouncer???s hulking upper body was out of sight, I couldn???t help feeling pleased. After all, I had achieved Cool Hijabi status in my hosts??? eyes that night without so much as touching a barstool. I immediately considered pulling a regular whoops-I-forgot-my-ID stunt at college (even when I did become of age) to show my peers that I was always willing to party. (Though I now suspect that my hosts were not partiers themselves ??? that would explain their initial offer, their belief that the bouncer would let me in, and their eagerness to leave the club wit",100
130,"h me after he did not.)I remember standing in front of the mirror sans headscarf when I was about thirteen years old, wondering whether I would be more popular this way. Would my classmates think me hotter, funnier, and more relatable? If so, would their validation make me happier? Considering that I still wear the headscarf, I must have decided that the answer to these questions was no. But they still cross my mind, usually when I feel the most insecure.I wish that my takeaway from my first clubbing experience was that my obligation to myself and to God far outweighs my desire to be considered cool by a group of strangers. In this moment, as I sit here writing in solitude, this statement transcends believability: it is a given, a truth. But this statement is hardest to believe when it is most relevant: when an older girl asks me casually ??? it???s the most casual question in the world ??? whether I???d like to ???come with,??? a smile on her face and a pair of room keys in her hand.I would be lying if I said that I wasn???t still intrigued by the thought of combining the mutually exclusive worlds of traditional, alcohol-driven, American Pie popularity and Islam. The notion of a Cool Hijabi who can straddle both worlds will likely continue to fascinate and haunt me.It seems like the more socially vulnerable I feel on account of being Muslim, the more I rebel by engaging in non-Islamic behaviors, of which there will be plenty at college. This cycle is both self-perpetuating and deeply ironic. Young adulthood is on the horizon, and the question at the forefront of my mind is: will I ever find the strength and faith to break the cycle?Or will this be how I lose my religion????I???ll fit into this once I lose my winter weight.??????I just won???t sit.??????I just won???t stand.??????I just won???t raise my arms.??????I???ll fit into this once I lose my fall weight.??????If I just roll it up at the ankle the length will look intentional.??????This will be good incentive to stand up straighter.??????I had a big lunch.??????I???ll fit into this once I lose my spring weight.??????I could be this person.??????If I change my mind I can always return it.??????I???m stuck!??????Shit.??????There???s someone in here.??????THERE???S SOMEONE IN HERE.??????I???ll fit into this once I lose my summer weight.??????YES I KNOW I???M TALKING OUT LOUD.???Great news, denizens of the Internet!

The prospect of America having its first African-American or female president was truly exciting. At the time, we were young and pushing boundaries, exploring feminism, politics, and art. We felt like something was going to change both in Australia and in America, and that we were at the vanguard.Soon after that, one of my friends went over to the States for a three-month law internship in Texas. She brought back a key ring with a medallion featuring a portrait of the Obama family. It was fun, mainly because we don???t get the same theatrics with our political campaigns in Australia. You would never see our upcoming Prime Minister???s family on a key ring. It epitomized the contradictions in American culture that we Australians find so fascinating, and was a good symbol of that exciting time.About three years later, I thought I had lost my keys. After going key-less for four days and just about giving up hope, I found them in the pocket of a jacket. I was jumping up and down and trie",100

He didn???t get it; we didn???t last very long as a couple.I???m no longer in contact with my friend who gave me the key ring, and the ???hope??? that Obama ushered in has now subsided, but I???ve kept the Obama family on my key ring. Sometimes I take a longer glance at the portrait and think, ???What a peculiar thing to have.??? But most of the time I just look at it like it???s become part of my body. Like staring down at your feet.Let Spotify be the soundtrack to your summer. We???ll set the right mood no matter what fresh horror your day has in store, because life doesn???t take a vacation. Simply hold your portable music player in your hand or strap it to your body as you go about your typical summer day and Spotify will use its proprietary motion detection technology to determine what you???re doing and match that favorite summer activity to the music that best suits it??? and you.- -??? Spotify has detected from your erratic movement and frequent despondent sighs that you are at home with your five and seven-year-old children during their week off between the end of school and the start of camp. Oh, I???m sorry, did you think summer meant a break? Not for you, silly! Because you???ve chosen to spend the better part of your productive adult years parenting two growing humans who are dependent on you or your designated caregiver for their nearly every need. Uh-oh, is that the rhythm of you yelling at Julian for eating an entire box of crayons while Casey pees in the inflatable kiddie pool for the third time today? We think it is. Here???s The Beastie Boys??? ???No Sleep Til??? Brooklyn??? followed by REM???s ???Everybody Hurts??? and ???I Can???t Feel My Face??? to kick off what is sure to be a soul-crushingly exhausting seven days with your precious little darlings.- -??? Based on your motion Spotify has discerned that you are frantically carrying armloads of objects up and down your patio steps. Sounds like a backyard barbecue to us! And really, what says summer more than a party that mixes generalized social anxiety with day drinking, sweat, and grilled meats? What???s that we detect? Is that you pouring jello shots? Hell yes, let???s just lean into this shitshow. Pump up these sexy party tunes by Rihanna, Robin Thicke, and others to make everyone feel even more self-conscious about their aging bodies and anxious about whether or not there will be dancing on the patio as they strategize about who they might have a chance of going home with at the end of the day and which corner of the yard will be best to puke in should the need arise, which it almost definitely will on account of the jello shots. Party on!- - ??? Spotify has determined from your relative inactivity and general air of pretension that you are currently sitting outside a local coffee shop drinking a cold brew coffee and reading David Foster Wallace. We???ve also discerned that you went into teaching so you could have the summers off to ???work on your writing??? but that five summers have come and gone now and all you have to show for them is honorable mention in a regional poetry magazine contest and a half-written short story about the death of your pet iguana Robert that, if you???re being honest with yourself (and you rarely are), is nothing more than a piece of J.D. Salinger-copycat trash. Enjoy this ???Emo Hits of the ???90s??? playlist to accompany your beverage, book and thinly-veiled self-loathing while you contemplate applying to an MFA program for the fourteenth time this month (Spoiler: We???ve detected that you???ll never actually apply. Another spoiler: We???ve also detected that Kristen is about to leave you for a lawyer she met at a bar crawl.)- - ??? Your complete lack of motion other than the occasional transfer of your right arm from your lap to your mouth can only mean one thing: you???re sitting on the couch eating Nutella straight from the jar while you watch Tiny House Hunters and wait for Mark to text back. Yes, why go outside and enjoy this beautiful summer day when you can sit in your air-conditioned apartment listening to female-empowerment pop anthems as you await Mark???s imminent text? Why hang out in a sunny beer garden with friends when Mark is definitely going to text you back very, very soon and totally ask you to hang out? That???s right, just wait patiently listening to Kelly Clarkson and Taylor Swift while you watch Linda and Dan decide whether or not a lack of indoor plumbing is a deal breaker, because Mark is bound to text back any minute, since he is a good guy and not a thoughtless monster like Dan who doesn???t understand that his woodworking table isn???t more important than Linda???s writing nook and that sometimes you have to make sacrifices for the people you love because that???s how relationships work, Dan! That???s how they work! Oh my God Mark???s never going to text, is he? No, no he???s not. We???ve now taken the liberty of ordering you a large pizza with extra cheese. We hope we haven???t overstepped.- - ??? Ah, we see from the steady rhythmic rumbling of your backside that you???ve loaded the family into your crossover vehicle to head out for a fun-filled Saturday at the beach. But first you???ve got to slog through the almost two-hour long bumper-to-bumper traffic to the coast as your spouse points out all the alternate routes you could have taken to save time, an argument that somehow leads into a discussion about how you never assert yourself at work which is why Margaret always gets the good accounts and why you can never take a proper vacation like Margaret does with her family every summer. Oh, good, now your children are arguing over who gets the first turn with the pool noodle once you reach the ocean, as though they have no idea that it literally doesn???t matter since life is fleeting and death comes to all. Here???s a mix of The Beach Boys??? greatest hits and Nine Inch Nails to capture your deep ambivalence about this day, this season, your marriage, your family, your career, and every choice you???ve ever made that has led to this inexorable moment. Also, you may want to pull over because we???ve also detected that Sophie just puked up her chicken nuggets all over the back seat of the car.Misogynishe QuicheSTEP 1: Preheat your browser to 3-4 prominent female Twitter users.STEP 2: Find tweets discussing important female issues that has nothing to do with you.STEP 3: Respond with ill-informed chauvinistic counter-arguments.STEP 4: Engage with angry reactions you get from other tweeters to increase the flavor.STEP 5: Pepper your tweets with male entitlement and poorly-constructed sexist jokes.STEP 6: Wait 30 minutes for your mentions to rise.STEP 7: Upon being hit with concise and funny jokes at your expense, douse each user with harassments and threats.STEP 8: Once 15 females have blocked you, it is ready to serve.TRUMP???

I show my boarding pass. I am ushered into the TSA Pre-Check line. Existence unfurls before me. I claim my birthright, destined for me since the birthing of The Void. My shoes remain on.I bypass the teeming throngs of commoners, powerless to save their oversized toothpastes and contact lens solutions. There was a time when I would mourn with them??? but that life seems ages ago.For what are travel-size fluid regulations to a god?I clear security: My laptop still packed, my belt still fastened, my thermal fleece still zipped. No peon eyes dare meet mine, for they know that before them strides eternity. And they tremble.The Terminal C Baja Fresh sign gleams like living flame. I feast. The salsa bar is limitless. The refills overflow. I browse John Grisham courthouse thrillers within Hudson Booksellers for 15 minutes??? or was it a millennia? Time is a breath to me now.I choose Rogue Lawyer. I haven???t read that one yet. A ???Kevin??? says I must pay, but I am TSA Pre-Check. Money ??? the laws of men mean nothing to me now. I free myself of clothing and ascend to a higher spiritual plane.I hear cries unto me of ???Oh God!??? ??? but the prayers of the ants are drowned by the symphony of the cosmos that only I and my known traveler ID may hear.I am now pure consciousness. I bathe in the infinite. I drink from the sun.And yet??? it does not burn. Why?If I am the fulcrum of existence??? the heartbeat of all that is??? why do I feel nothing? Is this the price of efficient business travel?I return to my throbbing, naked form ??? surrounded by worshippers. They scream for my removal. The ants have turned on me. And what the ants do not understand, they crucify.Guards seize me, like Christ. I am carried away to face judgment, also like Christ.Upon my Via Dolorosa, I gaze upon the Terminal C Baja Fresh sign, but it does not gleam. All is gray. All is silent. And I am lost.I weep. I beg them to strip me of my godhood. No business traveler should wield such power. They oblige. I ask for a refund of my application fee. They refuse. The knife twists deep. I leave the airport in disgrace. I vow to never fly again.Two months later, I have a job interview in Tampa, which is probably too far for a Greyhound. I re-enter Charlotte Douglas International Airport, a mere worm. I unpack my laptop. I unfasten my belt. I unzip my thermal fleece. My contact lens solution is confiscated. I do not resist.And yet??? I am not broken. I feel newfound strength within my fellow passengers. We struggle. We claw. And when we emerge from the Valley of the Shadow of TSA, we soar. I look upon the Terminal C Baja Fresh sign. It gleams. I weep. A TSA Pre-Check business traveler breezes through security and brushes my shoulder. I pity him.For I know that gods soon envy the small.Let me be the first to say that I???m no scientist. I???m not trying to pretend to be a scientist or an expert in a field that I have no experience in. But I am a human, and I am an American, and I???m sick and tired of other self-proclaimed scientists coming out and saying that climate change is real. And I think I???ve finally come up with a pretty good argument that will shut up a climate scientist real fast: If climate change is really happening, then why are there still oceans on the Earth?Checkmate, ???scientists.???We all took middle school science, and we all know water evaporates when it gets hot. Climate change allegedly makes things hotter. Heat plus water equals no more water. Hot Earth plus ocean equals no ocean. It???s basic math, and I know basic math. I???m not an idiot; you can???t pull the wool over my eyes. And even if you did, I bet it would make me warmer than climate change ever could.Here???s another stumper. Last year I took a trip to Canada, and guess what happened? I got frostbite. Notice anything odd about that? Frostbite. I got frostbite because I was too cold, aka the opposite of being too hot. Back then I was a believer, thinking that the Earth might be warming, but after that harrowing experience I can promise you I???ll never believe the scientific press again, nor will I continue to walk barefoot around Winnipeg.We???re living in a world that follows the words of scientists blindly without truly questioning them. The other day I was given a drink in a compostable cup made from corn. Are you kidding me? Corn needs sunlight to grow, sunlight that conservationists are all too worried about having too much of. Whose side are you on, people? Also, I???m not putting my tax dollars towards stupid plant cups. To make a point I threw the cup in a landfill anyway. I???m not falling for your tricks, environmenta-losers.Hear that? That???s the sound of me successfully dissing the entire green revolution.  The only thing burning on this planet is you, because of my insults.If we believe that the world is warming due to human activities, what are we going to fall for next? That the moon is made of cheese? That cats and dogs are conspiring to rise up and become superior beings? That genetically modified food is actually relatively harmless? I know these all seem ridiculous, but I wouldn???t be surprised to wake up one day to find cats and dogs making moon cheese sandwiches on GMO whole wheat bread.Well I???m not falling for it. Any of it. And it starts with the belief in global warming, which I very elegantly denied. Nice try climate scientists, but maybe you should be more cautious next time you yell fire in a crowded planet. If you want a fire, I???ll give you a fire. But in the meantime, I???m going to enjoy the ocean while it???s here.1. Tim Kaine, Governor, VirginiaPro: Swing state, fluent in Spanish, safe choiceCon: Political equivalent of plain yogurt.2.

At the time, I was a freelance writer for Seattle???s alternative weekly newspaper, and I had a full page scheduled for the very next issue, which was coming out Wednesday. It was a news story about my apartment building, which was located in a rapidly gentrifying neighborhood. The building had recently sold to a development company, and the new owners were doing invasive construction remodels while they were also drastically boosting everyone???s rent. Their treatment of tenants raised interesting ethical questions, and I knew my piece would do well. All the hard work was over. That night I was going to sing ???Hello??? by Lionel Richie.My friend Lexi met me in the bar. She came straight from the airport following a trip to D.C. to visit a buddy she???d met in the Navy. Lexi and I sat in the lounge, by the back wall, where the dead-end aisle abuts the horseshoe bar. I mentioned to her we were lucky to have snagged the spots. The bar always filled up fast, and it was better to be out of the dining area because the karaoke often got loud, and Lexi and I had a lot to chat about. I was still getting to know her. Lexi was new to Seattle, while I???d been here more than a decade. She and I come from the same Wisconsin town, where the population hovers around 2,500, and many of the residents take up employment at a nearby beef jerky factory. I grew up on a cranberry marsh. Lexi???s parents owned a bar and restaurant. Lexi and I share a birthday, but she???s closer in age to my younger brother Stosh, who was good friends with Lexi???s older brother. By association, Stosh regarded Lexi as a kid-sister figure. She once described a night they endured together, sharing a too-small bed out of necessity. Lexi was smashed against Stosh so tightly that his nipple left an imprint on her cheek, she said. Around the time of the shooting, we???d both started new jobs, and as it happens today, we???re both at the same places. Lexi works as a power dispatcher. ???I monitor and operate Seattle???s electrical grid. I love it. I operate in real time, so I know about accidents or water-main breaks or other events. It makes me feel connected to the city,??? she says. I???m a seamstress in an alternative bridal shop. I sew custom-made wedding gowns of every imaginable color: egg-yolk yellow, gasoline brown, lipstick purple, dish-soap blue. For a time, I wrote a conceptual fashion column for the paper I mentioned earlier, and the gigs paired together well.At the Twilight, a collection of ordinary things happened in arbitrary succession. Lexi and I chatted, we ordered beers, we requested our songs. (Hers was ???Faith??? by George Michael.) Lexi mentioned she???d had a couple drinks on the plane, then she grabbed a paper and flipped through it. A towheaded hipster in a Def Leppard shirt started a conversation with me about Def Leppard. They were his favorite band, he said. A guy friend te",100
134,"xted me to say he was on his way. Once he arrived, it was likely he and I would sing ???New Sensation??? by INXS. Somewhere in all this, I glanced up and noticed a man. He was standing at the bar. He paused at the counter, then he left.I thought he might???ve been Black or Hispanic, possibly Italian. Later, I would learn his name was James. He wore a white long-sleeve Henley, blue jeans, and a gray knit cap. He looked distraught. It puzzled me that he hadn???t waited for the bartender to approach him, but I didn???t give it much attention. Not long after, a woman came into the lounge. She wore a black cardigan and a black shirt, and she had dark skin and long, wavy black hair. I thought she might???ve been half-Asian, and maybe Black or Hispanic. I would learn later her name was Whitney. She sat at the bar, across from me and Lexi, in direct view. I watched as the bouncer Greg approached her. He asked to see her ID, and he was friendly about it. She peered into her phone, actively ignoring him. I couldn???t understand her response. As I told a detective later that night, I thought she was being ???pretty rude.??? A bartender who recognized Whitney noticed the exchange and assured Greg she was of age. Then Greg went back to his post, and Whitney settled in, ordered a beer, patiently sipped it.Soon after, the man from earlier was back at the bar. He approached Whitney. He was shouting, and it was disruptive. Lexi and I stopped and watched. He got right in her face, though I didn???t see that he ever touched her. He was saying things like, ???You left my door unlocked. They took everything. They took my flat-screen TV. You let all these people into my house and all my stuff is gone.??? James hurled sentence after sentence at Whitney. She remained a vision of perfect indifference. She kept her phone at her ear. She quietly said, ???I don???t know this man. I???ve never seen him before in my life. Someone call the cops,??? but her affect was oddly flat. Quickly, Greg appeared and escorted James outside. As they were walking away, Whitney announced, ???Call 911. I don???t know him,??? and then the door closed, and it was over. I studied Whitney???s face. It held no expression. Lexi leaned into me and said, ???She???s totally lying. She???s feigning ignorance. You can tell they know each other, for real.???The whole thing made me impatient. I couldn???t sense any real danger. I figured they fought in public because they relished having an audience, and I didn???t want to indulge them. I shooed off the residual awkwardness and got back to my night. Lexi had a Polaroid with her, so we took a couple pictures. It was fun. I posed with the paper because I had a full-page pictorial in print that week. It was the annual wedding issue, and I???d asked a few local designers to create veils. They came up with some delightfully crazy shit. They used hot-dog wrappers, plastic shower curtains, dog muzzles, and other symbolic items. That night, I was wearing bright purple jeans and giant hoop earrings. Lexi had a new hairdo???an asymmetrical bob dyed cherry auburn. She wore black leggings, a black skirt, and a red cardigan over a white shirt. ???It was a T-shirt, and it said, THANK GOD! and it had, like, this huge exclamation mark,??? remembers Lexi. For her portrait, I snapped her getting hammy with a painting. As we watched the pictures develop, I said, ???Now we???ll never forget tonight, not in a million years,??? and we both laughed.The Polaroids taken moments before James???s returnFifteen or twenty minutes passed, and suddenly, a loud sound filled the room. ???I wasn???t worried. I thought it was a balloon popping. For two seconds, I thought: ???Oh???ha ha,?????? said Lexi. I heard someone shout, ???He shot Greg.??? Lexi and I dropped to the ground and crouched beneath the bar, waiting, listening to screams. I noticed Whitney and a couple other customers as they gathered into our area. Lexi and I backed ourselves out of the way, deeper into the corner of the dead end. I couldn???t see much, but later I would learn there were five of us, all women. At once, James turned the bend. He had a gun, and he was holding it at waist level. He stopped and stood over us as we huddled together. He could???ve easily killed us all if he wanted to. Photo Credit: Seattle Police Department???So this is how I die,??? I thought to myself. It gave me a heavy feeling. There was another element to it, a kind of distant amusement. I???d spent my whole life guessing how it was going to happen, and here it was. When I looked up at James, things became strange. I could feel my vision distorting. As I remember his gun, it appeared vividly, but everything surrounding it blurred away. (Trauma-expert psychologist Dr. Laura Brown told me the effect is known as weapon focus. It happens because ???our brains alert us to threat, and we alert to the weapon because that???s where the threat is. The attention just narrows down. It causes witnesses to be bad at remembering what the person holding the weapon looked like,??? she said.) Beside me on the floor, Lexi experienced these same moments very differently. ???I don???t remember focusing in on the gun. He had something in his hand, but I was trying to not look at anything. I was trying to keep my head down. I was scared, and I wanted to make myself as small as possible,??? she said.It was hard to tell exactly what was happening, but I pieced a narrative together. This was the same angry man from earlier, and now he was coming back for his girlfriend who was right next to me. I felt her body backing into mine. It made me frantic. I remember thinking, ???Oh my god, get her away from me.??? Throughout, I kept my eyes on James???s face. His expression embodied a total focus. I could tell he believed he had no other choice. I became aware that James was looking only at Whitney, and his gun was pointed only at Whitney. I had the sense I was violating something private, that I???d wandered into an enclosed world. I understood with certainty that James wasn???t interested in harming me. I rose up and moved past him, down the narrow aisle. Apart from a couple bar stools in the background, I???d remembered my escape path as perfectly clear. (Months later, when I listened to the court testimony of a different witness, I learned there were two women huddled on the ground directly in front of me. They had to have been right in my way.)Lexi was on the floor behind me, but I didn???t consider her until I was standing. The space was snug, and James was right there. It seemed risky to double back. I decided to keep going, and I decided to leave Lexi behind. It was impossible to not do both at once. This hurt me a lot. The situation made me resentful. I told myself the whole thing was stupid, just really stupid, and Lexi would be totally fine. As I ran through the dining area, my movements felt thick, I appraised myself in a flash of hateful words: fat, clumsy, slow. I imagined getting shot in the back. I considered crouching as I ran, but it seemed too impractical. Pushing open the door brought a stark relief, but it didn???t last. When I passed through the entryway, I glanced down and saw on the cement a huge pool of blood. This led to Greg, who was on the ground, just outside the door. It was too much. I tried to block it out. I didn???t let my eyes take him in.A man was standing over Greg. I recognized him as Steve, a karaoke-night regular, though we???d never officially met. Steve handed his cell to me. He said he was on hold with 911. He kept his voice clear and slow, and his decisiveness was comforting. He recited the bar???s address a couple times so I???d know what to say",100
135," when they picked up. Steve???s phone was heavily smeared with blood, and as I took it, the blood got on my hands too. As I waited for the operator, I strayed off, tucking myself into a tiny space nearby, where a tall wooden fence encased a dumpster. It was a tight squeeze, and I could barely move, but I had a full view of the entrance, and I was able to crouch out of sight if I needed to. ???I???m OK,??? I told myself. ???I???m OK,??? I told myself again, and then again and again. The more I repeated it, the emptier it felt. I got a terrible feeling that things would not end well. I???d brought Lexi to this place, and if she died, it???d be my fault. The feeling wouldn???t land. Most of them didn???t. I felt numb, disoriented. I blamed Lexi for staying behind. I grew smug. Random thoughts slipped through. I pictured my body on a metal table. A stranger looking down at me. Ass-up. Naked. Legs need shaving. Cellulite on the backs of my upper thighs.I stared at the entryway, willing Lexi to come through, but soon I realized I was waiting helplessly in yet another dead end, so I edged back out to the alleyway. By the time the operator picked up, Lexi had stumbled out from the building. She was fine. When I saw her I wanted to fold her into my arms, laugh-crying and squeezing her, saying stuff like, ???Oh thank God. Don???t ever do that to me again, Lexi, you big silly weirdo.???There was no time for that, of course. As Lexi describes her passage outside, ???I didn???t notice any blood in the entryway. I kept my eyes on the door.??? When she saw Greg, ???he was upright, kind of leaning against the wall. He was being so calm. He was saying, ???I can???t believe I got shot. I can???t believe this is happening.?????? She and Steve quickly worked together, shoving Greg???s body away from the entrance and around the corner. The spot gave Greg a little cover. ???He was in a lot of pain. We were trying to pull him, he was screaming because it hurt so bad,??? she said.Meanwhile, I hung back, talking to the operator. She asked a couple standard questions, but her tone was sharp, and that irritated me. When she said the police were on their way, I couldn???t see the point in talking to her longer, so I cut her off abruptly. I handed the phone to Lexi, who spoke to the woman in bursts: ???He???s inside. He???s inside. He had a gun. He???s inside. I don???t know, I think he might have shot her,??? she said. As Lexi remembers, ???Greg was right there, and I told the operator, ???He???s bleeding to death.??? He must???ve heard me. I felt so awful about that. I really didn???t think they were gonna find him in time.???When Lexi finished speaking, I took back the phone. I thought about running away. I wanted to. We were out in the open. I didn???t know what to do with myself. The door was right there. If James came out shooting, we???d be dead. At the same time, abandoning the scene would show everyone I was a worthless asshole. Especially when Lexi and Steve were attending to Greg so purposely. It was dark outside, and to help them see,  I shined the phone???s light in the direction of Greg???s injuries. I directed my gaze to a patch of cement just above Greg???s head. Whatever was happening below his jeans, I didn???t want to know.As Lexi remembers, she???d taken off her sweater to use as a tourniquet, and Steve was applying pressure. ???I didn???t realize how high the bullet hole was until we took his pants off,??? said Lexi. ???There was this perfect little round hole. It looked black against his white flesh. It was pulsing. It was horrible. The blood was, like, pulsing out in waves. He was losing tons of blood. It was coming out fast,??? she said.[Originally published July 3, 2013.]- - -How to begin this review? Few countries that debuted in the 1700s have been as controversial or long running (it???s into its 237th season now) as America. It may not have the staying power of perennial favorites such as China or the credibility of indie darlings such as Finland, but America has proven that it can at least make some cultural impact. It???s not the best, but hey, they can???t all be Louie.America was originally a spinoff of the long-running England. Airing from the 1776-77 season through today, America focuses on a small ensemble of white people using things in the ground to become rich or kill brown people. A sprawling dramedy, it combines all of the loose plot points of a Tyler Perry sitcom with all the fun of being white.It has widely focused on the themes of war, freedom, sitting, Fenway Park, maps, the one true Christian god, rugs, pregnancy tits, Vice magazine, butterfaces, coal, butterdicks, ???Where???s the Beef?,??? Chicago, Larry Flynt, colonialism, Terri Schiavo, NBC single-camera sitcoms, toddlers, suicide pacts, Atari, penny farthing bicycles, SpaghettiO???s (Cool Ranch flavor), tiny dolls, the TLC show Sister Wives, H1N1, television, and genocide. It has some unique perspective every once in awhile, but honestly, America can be super derivative. Most of the stories have already been on The Simpsons.A lot of episodes in America don???t really hold up. Slavery? Parachute pants? White slavery? It just feels really overdone now. Among the most memorable episodes are ???The Civil War,??? ???Texas,??? ???World War??? (a two-parter), and ???Black President.???Some of the storylines are also a bit of a stretch. Are they really expecting us to believe that they killed all the Indians and that all those Indians did to deserve it was invent diabetes?! And come on???that stuff in the 9/11 episode could not have happened without someone working on the inside. That makes no sense. ???9/11??? jumped the shark. Hard.It???s been on so long that no one wants to comment on the OBVIOUS PLOT HOLES. Such awful continuity. Like, how could it be explained that in season 170, George H.W. Bush fathered a mentally disabled son, but then in season 225, that son became president?! Really terrible continuity. I would like to point out that I do appreciate a recent callback to earlier plots. Around seasons 174-184, some of the anti-feminist and sexist storylines were put on the backburner, but it???s nice that we???ve seen a resurgence in this last season.America has time and time again proved itself as a launching ground for young starlets. It???s fun seeing people before they became huge stars, like John Ritter, Stella McCartney, Theodore ???Ted??? Kaczynski, and Ted ???Ted??? Bundy. But the ensemble works best when we see the regulars yearn for a raise or promotion, struggle with Mary Tyler Moore???s foibles and be there for Mary Tyler Moore when the going gets rough. I stole this from a review for The Mary Tyler Moore Show, but I think it completely and entirely makes sense to literally lift from that review and drop it into this context as well.As someone with more quirky and alt tastes, I can???t say that America is my favorite thing to watch. I???m more into Breaking Bad. Have you seen season 4?! Season 4 of Breaking Bad is flawless. Season 4 of America is VERY uneven. It had no main black characters. Girls, much?! I love The Wire!I just hope to God (the American/right one) that they don???t pull some deus ex machina shit at the end of this series. Like, there???s nuclear war with North Korea, or they???ve been dead the whole time or something.Anyway, it may have veered off wildly from the pilot, but America is definitely worth a look. It???s an interesting experiment in the world of primetime sovereign nations. What the characters lack in consistency, they make up for in body weight, lingering racism, and inconsistency. But it makes for a quick and easy viewing, and can often surprise you",100

And hey, sometimes things get really good right before they???re cancelled.MY RATING: 50 stars (out of 100).- - - -Available in print withThe Best of McSweeney???s Internet Tendency[Originally published July 2, 2015.]- - -Wear the fuck out of red, white and blue.Eat like a motherfucker.Drink like a motherfucker.Sweat like a motherfucker.Feel all proud and shit about our fucking kick ass country.Swat the shit out of that motherfucking fly.Eat like there???s no fucking tomorrow.Drink like there???s no fucking tomorrow.Bitch like a motherfucker about our fucking broke ass country.Will the shit out of Tchaikovsky???s 1812 Overture to hurry its long fucking ass and get to the goddamn part where shit blows up.Blow shit up.Lose a fucking finger or two blowing shit up.Laugh our ass off when someone else looses a fucking finger or two blowing shit up.Stuff the shit out of our fucking face one more fucking time.Drink ???til it fucking runs out.Feel all proud and shit that our country is what it fucking is.Pass the fuck out from all the patriotic shit.Today America begins a new era of unprecedented public peace and safety. After years of fierce debate and rancorous discourse, we have the sweeping gun reform so many of us fought to achieve, but never dared dream would pass in our lifetimes. Starting today, every man, woman, and child in America will be required by law to carry a working, loaded firearm at all times.As your newly appointed Shooting Czar, I understand a small portion of you are uncomfortable with this new law. You???ve enjoyed years of shirking your responsibility to contribute to the safety of your communities, while more civic-minded citizens picked up your slack. These people have been the sentries on the wall, prepared to shoot and kill at the first sign of danger, despite having zero training to do so. Their vigilance is the reason we average only one mass shooting every day in this country. As of today, this burden is no longer these brave citizens??? alone to carry.Now we will all go to work, care for our families, and live our lives in a shrieking state of high paranoia and cowboy fantasy. Even as we???re settling in for a night of restful sleep with our guns tucked comfortably underneath our pillows, as they???re now legally required to be, we will always assume the shooter in the dark is about to strike. We will live with our fingers on the trigger, as if we are all that stand between our loved ones and a cold-blooded murderer. Because we are, despite all statistical evidence to the contrary.Today, with the help of the good people at the NRA and some brave legislators, this mindset that critics once derided as a hysterical delusion borne of small penises is the law of the land. The next time some whacked-out psychopath with a death wish wants to shoot up a public space, he???s going to shudder at the probability of being killed even quicker, and then reconsider! Because there are no longer ???gun-free zones???; there are only ???all-guns all-the-time zones!??? The government is not coming to take your guns; they???re giving them to you!Can I get a ???we the people???? Thank you! Thank you. I feel safer already.Of course, while more guns is the best solution to the mass shootings our country has faced in recent years, it isn???t a perfect solution. This new law requires no training or additional scrutiny for you to buy your federally-mandated firearm???paid for with the Keep America Safe tax credit ??? because as you know the 2nd amendment is a right, not a privilege! That said, there are some best practices I???d like to share with you as we transition to a fully-armed and empowered citizenry.No.1: All children between the ages of 8 and 14 are now required to carry either the Lil Buddy Pistol from Smith & Wesson or Bushmaster???s My First Handgun. Please do your best to help your child understand when it???s appropriate to shoot and kill someone.No. 2: Similarly, our teachers will need another tool in their toolkit. When there are emotional confrontations in the classroom and hallways, teachers must de-escalate them by being a quicker draw than their students. Practice saying, ???I don???t think you really want to do that??? in the mirror.No. 3: Sometimes you will need to take out your pistol in public to ensure it???s loaded, show it off to a friend, or just take a fun selfie with it. This can make others nervous. Consider giving a verbal reassurance by loudly declaring, ???I ain???t got murder in my heart!???No. 4: When negotiating a deal or purchase, please don???t casually pat your gun. Guns are for dealing with threats, not making them.No. 5: If you do feel threatened, pull and fire. That???s what guns are for! But do your best to ensure you???re in real danger before killing someone.  Because everyone also has a gun, this can be difficult. Has the suspicious person said, ???I ain???t got murder in my heart???? If not, proceed with caution.No.6: Suffered a grievous insult? Don???t shoot! All spontaneous shooting deaths should be committed in a dispassionate state of mind. Agree to delay the gunfight for 24 hours. This is also a good rule of thumb for settling domestic disputes.No. 7: Try to avoid using the phrases, ???Make me,??? and ???You don???t have the balls.???No. 8: Lastly, law enforcement will continue to be a crucial part of public safety. When officers are called, make their jobs easier by keeping your hands away from your weapons. Unless, of course, you suspect they???re some sicko posing as police so they can get the drop on you.Then you gotta do what you gotta do to keep your family and community safe.- -I don???t really know how I got to the King???s Storeroom, but now that I???m here I???m not sure how to get out. I thought I???d be making something like Lessons of Darkness by now. I thought I???d be making films that???d be a real catalyst for change in the world or something. I barely know these kids. I???m not sure I even like children, you know. All I know is that they must???ve made it across that moat and answered some questions and then I???m expected to grab them and take them out of the temple. Even if you get comfortable with invading a 12-year-old???s personal space, you???ve also gotta deal with the fact that you are inevitably going to scare the crap out of these kids and do they really deserve that? Do I really deserve to get thrown up on? Should I feel responsible when a kid wets himself because I jumped out at him after he just waded through a bunch of foam blocks? A kid punched me in the throat one time and maybe I deserved that. It???s a pretty cutthroat competition considering the grand prize is just a bike.

137,"gh. One exclamation point, emoji, or wayward ???um??? can send my professional credibility right down the drain. That???s why I???m removing ???sorry??? from my vocabulary once and for all. I refuse to apologize for every dumb little thing ??? like forgetting to respond to an email, or poisoning Janice slowly over several months in order to steal her job.At first, I felt that censoring my words was a negative thing. I felt it would deaden my personal expression while at the same time giving my colleagues a set of arbitrary criteria with which to harshly judge me. I felt it would distract me from using my brain cells on things that really matter, like hitting my revenue goal for Q3, and making sure Janice dies of what appear to be natural causes in Q4.It turns out I was completely wrong on all counts, because a woman should never start a sentence with ???I felt.???I???m cutting out upspeak, too. You know, that thing where the ends of your statements rise like questions? And you sound like a valley girl, unsure of your own thoughts? Well, no more. I???ve stopped saying ???Janice: Green tea???? and upgraded to a stronger ???Janice: Green tea.??? It???s amazing what people will drink when you project a little confidence!I???m sorry for that exclamation point.Wait??? no, I???m not.I???ve also said goodbye to low, croaky vocal fry. Whether I???m in a client presentation, an internal check-in, or the interrogation room, I sing in classical opera style for maximum volume and glottal control. Even when the detectives mansplain how they found a bottle of cyanide in the break room with my fingerprints all over it, I don???t allow my voice to weaken. I take a deep diaphragmatic breath and belt: ???Bring me a lawyer. A lawyer with a vagina.???I certainly don???t ask forgiveness from Janice???s friend and relatives at the memorial service. The last thing I need is for them to look down on me as incompetent, ???girlish,??? and admitting guilt to a felony. Instead, I look them dead in the eye, give them my firmest handshake, and thunder in my big opera voice: ???I had nothing to do with Janice???s death, and this PowerPoint will explain why.??? I don???t refer to any notes during my presentation, either, because I want to look like I know what I???m talking about, which I do, so why don???t you get off my back, already?I hope I didn???t come across as aggressive just then.I hope saying ???just??? just now doesn???t cause you to rethink my professional qualifications.I hope my use of the phrase ???I hope??? doesn???t make me seem ineffectual.Lest you think I???m wasting energy in the impossible pursuit of verbal perfection, let me remind you that it???s helpful beyond the office in everyday life. When I???m on the stand, for example, the judge seems to appreciate my straightforward description of using the pistol to wrap up Project Janice on time and under budget. Like I told him, I was only doing what any capable male manager would do.Some women are so dumb, they don???t understand how important it is to put in the effort to improve your speech. Take the female prosecutor on my case, for example. She has no idea that every time she says ???like??? during her cross-examination, she???s basically taking a giant shit all over her argument. What self-respecting woman would take a giant shit at work?Janice, that???s who.It???s funny. Now that I???m sitting at Janice???s desk, doing Janice???s job, wearing Janice???s Spanx, my communication skills are ten times better than they were before. People listen when I talk now, and nobody dares question my authority. I guess the old adage is right: all you need to get rid of those pesky vocal tics is the confidence of unproven murder surging through your remorseless veins.What can I say? I???m a powerful modern businesslady, and that???s nothing to apologize for.Dear beer nerds,It???s official. A trip to the liquor store ??? once a relaxing and uncomplicated endeavor ??? is now an experience rife with anxiety and booby traps. Oh, pick you up a six-pack? Something ???local???? Something you ???haven???t had before???? This mission is bound to be an embarassing failure.That???s right. My husband???s joined your ranks. He and his buddies are in deep, and now when we have parties, they fill up the cooler with unidentifiable bottles and cans, because cans, I guess, are not an indication of poor quality anymore.I???ll have, like one-and-a-half and am dancing rather enthusiastically on the patio after putting the kids to bed and it???s like, yup, I???m a cool mom! But that???s not it, is it? It???s because these double-hopped, triple-bagged, melon-washed, 190-minute IPAs or whatever, clock in at about 18% alcohol. I???m hungover before the night???s ended.Sometimes I stand in front of a store???s beer display in a near cold sweat, looking at all the bold labels with their professional illustrations and flowery but masculine narratives (???flowery but masculine??? is actually a good way to explain this entire phenomenon).The labels explain how this unique, captivating brew came into existence. Often there???s a ???journey??? involved, which displays excellent creative skills on the part of the marketing team involved, and no flagrant embellishment or anything. Beer is important and political and life-altering.The beers are named things that scare me. Stuff like, ???Put You in the Penitentiary Amber??? or ???This Will Kill You.??? Not those exact names, ok? But you get the picture.I???ll spot an old familiar like Sierra Nevada Pale Ale and think, hey, that???d taste good on a hot afternoon. But buying Sierra Nevada Pale Ale would be an enormous, unforgivable mistake, I realize. Holding one up, saying, ???Have you guys, um, tried this???? because ???Have you guys tried this???? is the absolutely mandatory required statement one makes upon opening a beer, every single time.Can you imagine? Meanwhile, your friend, your friend who didn???t make an incredibly huge error at the liquor store, has the new coffee stout from those brothers who started a brewery in their bathroom right down the street from here, and now they???re selling to local restaurants. Come to think of it, you guys could start a brewery in your basement. Don???t even start.Listen, I like these beers. They are interesting and fun. It???s all gone too far though.The other day I was in the grocery store, where the beer selection should still be easy to navigate because it???s the grocery store, but it turns out they???ve jumped on the bandwagon, too. There was nuanced fruit beer and beer where it didn???t even tell you what style of beer it was, you were just supposed to know by the brand and name, because everybody???s extremely educated regarding these matters.I was getting mad, to be honest with you. I felt tense and ill-at-ease, because picking a beer has become one of the more difficult tasks in my life, marked by decision fatigue and self-doubt, which is notable considering we have three children and responsibilities such as home ownership and whatnot.So you know what I did? I reached out and I grabbed some Sam Adams Summer Ale. That???s right, Sam Adams Summer Ale. Like a fucking novice. I did it for three reasons: 1) it was summer; 2) I like it; and 3) I was mentally exhausted.When I got home to my husband I raised the six-pack above my head in victory. ???Ha!??? I said. ???Look what I got! Sam???s Summer. Just like old times! It???s going to be delicious!???And, lemme tell you something.

Eastman- -A foppish hipster fell off his barstool. The floor rose up to meet him. ???I must call myself an Uber,??? he slurred. And out of the bar he went.Outside, the streetlamps blurred and the ground seemed to wobble. There were many cars like colored eggs, but none that sought him out.???Where is my Uber???? the hipster asked. He plodded along the curb, but did not see his Uber anywhere. ???I will go and look for it.???A neon blue mini-fridge pulled up. Inside, two faces floated in a cloud of smoke. ???Are you my Uber???? the hipster asked. ???No,??? said a dancing cigarette. ???I am a smart car.??? And off the smart car went.The hipster kept on until a powerful wind shivered him still. The ghost had appeared without making a single sound! ???Are you my Uber???? the hipster gasped. A blonde with short-cropped hair answered: ???No, I am a Prius.??? The hipster squinted at her COEXIST bumper sticker as the Prius drove away.The hipster was getting chilly. He wrapped his scarf tighter and squinted into his phone. He regretted eating so much poutine.On the other side of the street, a brontosaurus was wading in a brown lagoon. The hipster ran across shouting to a red helmet inside the dinosaur. ???Are you my Uber???? he asked. ???I am not your Uber,??? cried the red helmet. ???I am a goddamn crane. Move it!???Just then the hipster saw a phalanx of women in mini-skirts and high heels. They clattered down the sidewalk, falling over each other, LOLing and validating and waving their phones like air traffic controllers swatting flies.A yellow box rolled up and lowered its window. On top was another box that read TAXI. A man inside had gray eyes and a non-ironic beard.???Are you my Uber???? the hipster asked.The yellow box driver said, ???SNORT.??????Oh no,??? the hipster said. ???You are a scary Snort!???The women piled into the backseat. One of them asked the Snort if he could take them to a club called Swag. Another invited the hipster to come with them.???I???m searching for my Uber,??? the hipster said.The Snort scanned the hipster???s skinny jeans and coiffure.???Sixteen years I???ve been driving this cab,??? said the Snort. ???People like you never set foot here. Now who can afford it? You treat the city like a fucking playground.???A woman in the backseat puked.???Christ!??? yelled the Snort.Suddenly, from behind the Snort came a tan sedan driven by a man with a friendly wave. The hipster stammered ???Goodnight,??? and he ran from the yellow Snort. He ran right up to the tan sedan. The driver smiled and welcomed him by name: ??????Sup, Adam. Know who I am???????I know who you are,??? the hipster said. ???You are not a Smart Car or a Prius or a goddamn crane. And you are definitely not a Snort! You are the tan sedan I saw in my app. You are my Uber!???The driver nodded, handing him bottled water. The hipster climbed into the back seat and passed out.When you have no clue what the poem is about???I???m very intrigued by your beautiful language in this poem. It gives each line such an ephemeral feel. Something you could do to make it even more powerful is perhaps include some solid, vivid, and explanatory details and imagery in order to further push the concept you are wanting to convey.???When the ending is so predictable that you knew what it was before you even started reading the story???You lead up to the ending in a really swift, smooth, and sensical manner. This works great, though I???m curious about how the story as a whole might feel if you were to toy with the ending just a little bit. What if Bob and Sally never got married? What if they never had a baby? How would those things change the reader???s experience of the story? I think that with your language skills and genius creativity, you could have an even more memorable ending. Just push yourself a bit and let???s see what happens!???When the story is racist???The scene where the twelve members of the Rodriguez family all pile into a beat-up truck is a really interesting moment for character development. I???m curious if you could go just a little bit further here and perhaps address their relationships with each other and what family means to them. By giving a little bit more information about who these characters are, they will feel even more real and alive on the page.???When the author doesn???t know what a comma is???I???m wondering what this scene would read like were you to slow it down with some commas. Think of commas as speed bumps that can improve the flow and readability of a sentence. Without a comma, some sentences might feel overwhelming. If you want readers to feel a sense of chaos or confusion in this s",100
139,"cene, then you???re doing great and don???t need to change anything. If you want to pace the reader through this scene so she absolutely understand the purpose of each sentence, then I would at least include commas after your conjunctions.""When an essay is so boring you???d rather listen to your grandfather try to recount his half-remembered stories from way back when ??? which are the same stories he half-recounted for you just an hour ago???You have done quite an amazing job at thoroughly providing the reader with a good number of details about the setting, and what the narrator is thinking! On page 24, after you describe his joyful fishing trip, I think you could add in another scene before you transition into having him back at home and mowing the lawn. Maybe include some information about the other people who are in his life, or perhaps a significant moment he has experienced in relation to fishing or yard work. Bringing in these little digressions would make for an even fuller story.???When the male writer uses his dick as the main character in every essay???Wow! You???re really pushing boundaries here! It???s intriguing to read something so raw and forthright. While I was reading this, an idea came to me: What would you think about occasionally shifting the focal point of the essay by weaving in a second narrative thread? I think if you were able to pull the writing away from your body, the reader might be able to get an even better sense of how you relate to world and who you are as a sentient being. With your skilled writing, I don???t think this would be too hard!???If you???ve never had to live on an adjunct???s salary, the numbers make very good business sense. We take a teacher, a traditionally underpaid professional, who, in higher education is over-educated by definition, and divide up the duties of this one person among two or three equally educated people, then pay them a combined sum that is less than what the original teacher was paid, and we also subtract benefits. It will be embarrassing to explain to the new hires how little they???ll be paid, and that they won???t have health insurance, but it???s worth it to save money. It???s such a simple and forthright concept that it follows that what is good for higher education can expand out into all kinds of jobs and professions.Adjuncting the Postal WorkerMail carriers are always running around in a hurry. We???d be doing them a favor by splitting up the work into smaller routes. How small? So small they won???t need trucks, because dividing one carrier into several carriers doesn???t save money if they each drive a little truck. We make them buy those red wagons, which is good for the red wagon company. They walk to the post office every morning and deliver the mail on foot. Think about that carbon footprint. They might have to take a couple of trips, even with small routes, but if the work adds up to more than 40 hours per week, don???t worry, because we pay them by the street. They???ve contracted out two streets, for example, and we pay one small sum for one street, and one small sum for a second street, none of this with benefits and none of it paid until a good six or eight weeks into the contract. And so what at first might seem absurd or inefficient is actually a really great way to save money.Police Can Do This TooExcept that in addition to them not having cars they also won???t have guns, because guns are cost-prohibitive, and if we have more cops we don???t need more guns. Cops walking around without guns, you say. We say, yes. They do it in England. Except those Bobby uniforms look kind of expensive. We???d get them T-shirts. Or polo shirts. They could buy polo shirts from us and we???d take it out of their first check. But their checks are already small, you say. Can???t we at least buy the polo shirts for them? Which makes it clear you don???t know anything about saving money, because polo shirts, though far less expensive than a Bobby uniform, can also add up when multiplied by the number of streets covered. Are there streets that won???t get contracted out? Maybe, but we won???t concern ourselves with that. People will know where the good streets are and they can always go to one of the good streets if they need a police officer. Isn???t that asking adjunct cops to do more than what they contracted for, if they have to handle the police work coming in from other streets? If an adjunct police officer takes on more work than they???ve contracted for, that???s up to them and of no concern of ours. If adjunct labor is good enough for higher education, which is full of smarties, then it???s good enough for our public sector.And Utilities. And Hospitals. And AirportsDividing up everything into smaller tasks and contracting out those tasks for less than what had originally been paid is a splendid way to save money. And saving money is great. It???s the best.Then why does college tuition keep going up? Why is student debt more than a trillion dollars? To find that answer, we???d have to ask the students themselves, because millennials are spoiled. We used to live on spaghetti and ramen. These kids have expensive tastes. Have you heard about those gourmet burger joints going up? You can buy a burger with truffle oil or caviar on it. And Whole Foods? They didn???t have Whole Foods or Trader Joes when we were in college. If the kids are racking up debt it???s probably because of Whole Foods, who was caught price gouging, remember that? And they wear nice clothes, these kids. And designer glasses frames. If you???re thinking that can???t be it, you aren???t considering how small luxuries add up.What else could it be? If we???ve lowered the cost of teaching, why would the cost of higher education continue to go up?Don???t Point Your Finger at UsRemember, we???re the ones who have been saving money. How much are we paid, you want to know? We are paid in direct accordance with our stature: we???re managers. The decisions we make affect everyone at this institution. We hang out with the university president. We have administrative assistants. We???re paid for money-saving ideas and we have lots of them. Yes, there???s a new building where we have our large offices, and we need to be paid enough to drive nice cars, so our building signals the proper esteem of those within. Because if we didn???t have nice cars and nice offices and people working for us, then they might not trust us to make the big money-saving decisions. You get that, right?Maybe if you were paid less you wouldn???t ask so many questions. And you???d understand the way the world works. We???d love to be able to spread our influence, because we???re really good at what we do. We???ve got amazing wardrobes and we???ve turned our state college MBAs into gold. And when we hit another line on the budget, we???re thinking, seriously? For example: can???t we get some of these kids to cut the grass? We???ll let them use our mowers. And why are we paying them to serve each other food in the dining halls? Because that???s a good social activity. It???s a way to pitch in and help each other out. Maybe instead of adjuncts we could get the smarter students to teach the average ones. Or a robot. It would be perfect if someone would go ahead and invent an adjunct robot.No, come to think of it, robots are expensive. They could start out with robots at the Ivy Leagues and then after they???ve mass-produced enough of them, maybe we???d jump on the robot bandwagon. As long as they didn???t need too many upgrades. As long as the students thought it was modern, a robotic state-of-the-art twenty-first-century way to get educated.Because Without Adjuncts",100
140," or RobotsCollege students might self-educate. Which is the cheapest option yet, but there???s not really a way to make money off of that. And to pay us. Because it???s not so much the education as the diploma, and it???s not so much the school as the accreditation of the school, and it???s not so much the teacher as the grades. Unfortunately, students need teachers, and colleges need middlemen to keep the greedy money-loving teachers in check. Can you imagine if a greater portion of the students??? inflated tuition costs went to the teachers instead of to the college? You probably wouldn???t be able to call it a college. You???d have to come up with a whole new name, because it would be a paltry place without cupolas or sculptures or stadiums. Can you imagine if that money went to teachers instead of all that good stuff? And the students, who have to sit there all day with the greedy money-loving teachers, they deserve the good stuff in order to make up for it.And That???s the Best Part of the JobBelieve it or not, as important as saving money is, we don???t relish it. We???re good at it. We can squeeze money out of existing salaries like nobody???s business. But where the squeezed money goes is what we???ve built. There???s an architectural continuity, with pillars and shaded walkways teeming with friendly squirrels. There are really good T-shirt shops that siphon money from students twice a year via contractual book monopolies. There???s a climbing wall and a waterslide at the rec. center, and a beautiful building full of computers that used to be filled with dusty books. Elliptical walkways are accented with flowerbeds for the parents of prospective students to admire on campus tours. Walking around one can???t help but be puffed up by how great a place this is.I???m proud to announce that I was the one who bought George Zimmerman???s gun. And once I destroy it there will be only four Trump horcruxes left.For decades I???ve hunted and destroyed his dark objects, from incinerating Miss Universe???s satin sash, to melting down Marla Maple???s wedding ring.There exists no object too sacred for He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Elected to curse with an undying fragment of his emaciated soul. Not the first draft of The Art of the Deal sent to him by ghostwriter Tony Schwartz, nor the China-made engine of his private jet.My partners, a brave disabled ginger and a keen Muslim woman, fled our mission, fearing for their safety. I alone can blend in at Donald???s rallies, with my scarred pale skin and a worldview created from under a staircase.Shredding the Trump University ???accreditation??? certificate Donald printed out himself was easy, a hollow husk of a horcrux, even he must have known would crumble under the slightest inquiry.But it was David Duke???s white hood that nearly derailed me. It screamed profane names for Obama as we burnt it. To this day, Trump???s butler Anthony Senecal mutters its dying epithets on Facebook.The horcrux Donald left in a ???small million-dollar loan??? from Trump Mortgage folded in on itself. Why he would sacrifice any part of himself to a loan and credit venture in 2008, I???ll never understand.In my best night I destroyed ten horcruxes, the top halves of Donald???s original fingers, each one planted deeply into the bosom of a female employee he promoted solely to degrade and manhandle for sport.How he manages even the most basic of tasks now with those tiny leftover stubs, I struggle to fathom.The horcrux he left in a Trump Steak was tough. Not just to destroy, but to eat. I soaked it in a case of syrupy anti-freeze-laden Trump Wine to swallow whole, and knocked out two horcruxes in one nauseous evening.But I worry the taco bowl will break me. It carries Trump???s love for Hispanics.And it is a dark dark love. Perhaps even bordering on hate.Vanquishing the horcrux in his tax returns will be quick. There???s actually much much less in them than he wants you to think.My gravest challenge will be the hair, that jaundice-themed spider???s web, which cost Donald $60,000 from Ivari???s line of surgical hair interventions, and must be devoured strand by strand like Lucifer???s spaghetti.It makes my teeth shiver to think about.Donald plans to erect another horcrux in the Wall, and make Mexico cast the spell to put it there. Mexican officials say that makes no sense, and everyone agrees. It doesn???t.But to his followers, there is no reason, only an unforgivable Imperius curse blinding them to mindlessly chant, ???Make America Great Again,??? a nonsense incantation stolen verbatim from Reagan???s 1980 campaign, the last time a ???silent majority??? of uneducated muggles complained that they could no longer be as racist in public as they would like.Donald???s final horcrux, once thought to be indestructible, will be our greatest sacrifice.Hillary.Donald transmitted a foul scrap of his human-adjacent life-force to her when she attended his third wedding. He disguised it as a campaign contribution, one of many he gave to Democrats up until this election year.The prophecy foretells that neither can live while the other survives. Trump cannot be destroyed with Hillary as our nominee.And so, to save us all, the woman who lived must sacrifice herself, and let He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Elected feel his final burn.From the studios behind Johnny Depp as Tonto, Jake Gyllenhall as Prince of Persia, Tilda Swinton as a Tibetan sorcerer, Scarlett Johansson as a Japanese human-cyborg, and Leonardo DiCaprio as Rumi???- - -Obama biopic(working title: From the Hood to the White House)- Focus on overcoming odds, ascending from single-parent household to pinnacle of power, navigating politics and race in a poisonously partisan Washington.- Actor must be unifying, reassuring, presidential.- Martin Sheen?

The forest team has successfully lured the chipmunk into the chamber and we???re moments away from hacking Mother Nature and blowing up the Internet. Looks like it???s finishing now.#3DChipManiaUnfortunately, it appears our synthetic chipmunk is a stillborn. You can see our colleagues trying to resuscitate it, which is mostly them playing catch with the carcass. For our ninety-two thousand viewers, we???ve got a staff of sixty camped out in the woods, so we???ll keep at it all week until one of these cuties comes through alive or we run out of wildlife. The main thing you have to ??? wait a minute! A leg moved! It???s running around the newsroom, folks! How about that? Amazing moment in live viewing history. We???ve named it Silky.#SilkyLives #HistoryMadeViewers may have noticed that Silky is putty-colored, and faceless. Our tech team is looking into why the face was rendered improperly. The brownish hue is because our printing material is a silicon resin, which is why Silky looks like a chipmunk-sized slab of Silly Putty.Big news! For our three-hundred thousand viewers, we???re being told a baby deer has wandered into the printing chamber. Our forest team is printing it now.While we wait, we???re getting questions how any of this is possible. We have no idea. We???re journalists covering the syndicated debt markets and just thought this would be fun to live stream. We think we may have tapped into some teleportation wormhole in the millennial-cleverness continuum, and now we???ve overloaded the internet with cleverness, allowing us to 3-D print live creatures. Are we defying molecular laws of the universe with which no untrained group should tamper? Our legal department doesn???t think so. And neither do the four-hundred and eighty thousand viewers who took time out of their busy workdays to watch this live.#Miracle #BeamMeUpSilkyIt appears the printer ran out of silicon resin, so we only achieved the front half of the Silly Putty deer. It???s still adorable. Halfsy is tugging itself around the newsroom by its forepaws and playing with the staff. On a positive note, it has a face ??? good job, tech team.#TheHalfsyCrawl #SoExcitingWow, this is something. To our eight-hundred thousand viewers, we???re getting word a grizzly bear was spotted grazing near the printing chamber. Apparently one of our forest colleagues is severely injured, but the team managed to corral the bear inside the chamber and it???s coming through now. We???re seeing the muzzle and the front claws. Is that a ??? yes, folks, we???re confirming that is, in fact, a human arm in the bear???s mouth. The cool thing about 3-D printing is that if we can wrestle the Silly Putty arm out of the bear???s jowls, we can probably reattach it later.That???s a big bear. And it seems agitated. Viewers, we???re being told by legal we need to shut this down immediately. Forest team, stop printing. Forest team?The forest team says the grizzly does not want to be 3-D printed and is in a rage. No one can get near the apparatus. The Silly Putty bear is nearly complete and ??? oh, fuck, this isn???t what we originally conceived with the chipmunk concept. That bear is about to go Revenant on us.It???s in the newsroom chasing Halfsy! No, Halfsy! The putty bear is clawing reporters. Geezus hell, someone stepped on Silky. Forest team ??? print some bows and arrows! Everyone, to the conference room! To our millions of viewers, we are under attack. Stop sharing this and leaving witty comments. Can someone use one of the millions of cell phones you collectively own to send help?#RIPSilkyandHalfsy #RevenantLiveBows and arrows coming through now. We???ve got one chance at this, news team. Viewers, join us next week for more coverage of the syndicated debt markets, and hopefully a Silly Putty bear skin rug.1. Cleaning is actually not possible. All you are doing is moving dirt from one place to another, but you are never eradicating the dirt, as you sweep, as you vacuum, as you wipe down the stove. You are just moving it. This bothers you.2. You begin to fantasize about moving the dirt differently. For instance, taking your sweepings and depositing them under a neighbor???s car, or in the park, or hiding them inside plastic Easter eggs and leaving them in the bushes. Perhaps this is simply because you have a degree in graphic design, but if your life is to be wasted in the relocation of dirt, you want to become an artist, a true innovator in your field.3. Is there a set amount of dirt? Is it like matter or energy, unable to be created or destroyed? You aren???t sure. You put fruit and vegetables in the baby, and poop comes out. The baby is creating filth. But why? What does it signify about life that life is constantly making poop, and why are we so terrified to admit this? Half your life is spent hiding the dirt, the poop, the mess. You clean toilets, sinks, noses and ears, assholes ??? oh are you ever tired of wiping your kids??? assholes. Sometimes you force the three-year-old to do it himself, but he is so bad at it that you always take pity on him in the end.4. Once, when your three-year-old was pooping, he got an erection and started tugging on it and said, ???Tell me about girls.??? Not wanting to assume this was going in such an alarming direction, you asked, ???What about girls???? ???Tell me about boobies,??? he answered. Who would have guessed it all came pre-wired-up like that? You would have thought it happened over time, during puberty, through exposure to pornography and who knows what. But no, men come preloaded as if their sexuality were an Operating System.5. Sometimes you just give up and lie on the floor and let your children hit you with toys.6. This period in your life will not last forever. In fact, it can???t. You look at the baby???s chubby face and you wish it would last forever, even though you are on the verge of some kind of break.7. When your children really piss you off, usually around 5 pm, you just start throwing away their toys. Not the big ones, just all the little stupid shit, the goodie-bag garbage that floods yours life: spinning tops and pencil toppers, foam balls to a gun that broke, plastic dinosaurs no one has ever played with for a single second after they were out of the package. You are living in a tidal wave of tiny plastic replicas of real objects: small, hollow fruit, Playmobil guns the size of a fingernail, a multitude of animal forms, rigid or soft, squeaking or silent, an entire reproduction of the world has been created and then thrown into chaos inside of your house.8. It is a temple. That seems so clear, late at night, as you look at your sleeping children and sleeping husband, their soft flesh exposed in the blue light of the TV as you stay up eating hidden chocolate, drinking vodka, and watching Chelsea Handler. You are the priestess of some kind of strange life/shit, world/chaos temple, and the trash is holy, and the flesh is holy, and the poop is holy, and even your ravings are holy, holy, holy.- -Ruf",100
142,"i Thorpe???s new novel Dear Fang, With Loveis available at your nearest bookseller.Hey there, step right up! Don???t be shy! Allow me to introduce the hottest concept in mobile street cuisine: my new food sedan!It???s way better than a food truck.It might be hard for you to believe, but I???ve got every griddle cake you could possibly want in here: flapjacks, waffles, pancakes, crepes, as well as my own personal creations: flapcrepes and panffles! All served from this innovative, environmentally friendly 2002 Ford Taurus I???ve whimsically named ???Flatjacks,??? because my car is short and has no wheels. I also tried to invent a menu item called a ???flatjack,??? but it didn???t sit well with one of my taste-testers and her very nice team of doctors at the emergency room.Would you like a sample? Trust me, it will leave your mouth watering for more of my expensive water.Sure, I may be a little cramped inside this gold-tone beauty, and I can???t seem to keep my electric griddles level (hey, you try jerry-rigging a countertop onto remarkably cushy bench seating), but you will love my wedge-shaped pancakes. They have a crispy side and a mushy side, perfect for whichever way you like it. And I insist on providing pure maple syrup, not that corn-based abomination peddled by Aunt Jemima. It???s only four ounces, but it???s four ounces of pure Vermont Grade B.Here, have a coupon. It???s good for one free souvenir cup of water, minus the cost of the water ($12.99, plus tax).One bite of my amazing fare and you???ll never want to go back to one of those stupid food trucks that litter our city???s loading zones. Honestly, I don???t know why anyone would choose to eat from a decommissioned DHL van in the first place. I mean, I get the appeal: so much room for custom graphics. But would you ever eat at a restaurant that provided the amenities of a food truck? Of course not, because I went into $73,000 of debt trying make that work.It was a great idea: all the seating was on retaining walls, the servers were disgustingly sweaty, and the aroma of carbon dioxide played nicely against piped-in car horns. Anytime you wanted to order a different type of food, you just got up and went to one of three very tiny restaurants down the street ??? just like the real food truck experience! You could come back, of course, but there was no guarantee that someone wouldn???t have taken your retaining wall.I had high hopes for that place, but I guess I didn???t realize how much people truly love open-air curb falafels.But I do know that you will love my food sedan, this time. My initial experiment foundered pretty quickly when I couldn???t meet the payments on the Tesla. But one more bankruptcy later (another bad idea: food F150), and I have a rock-solid business plan built on great food, low-cost spray-paint, and carnal relations with a Food Network reality-show producer. I???ve got a prime location at the Old Farmer???s Market satellite park-and-walk, and I???m easy to spot with all the swarming gnats. Only a few dozen people have mistaken me for an eccentric real estate agent or independent exterminator.The best part is, unlike a food truck, I am not engaged in any money-laundering.So what will it be? The Crepejack? Perfect! Here???s your pre-greased tinfoil. Do you need any more toilet-quality napkins?Thanks for stopping by! Please spread the word! Tell your friends not to be put off by the sight of me crawling around on all fours and occasionally brushing a skillet with the business end of my very relaxed-fit jeans. Let your neighbors know that there???s not a lot of headroom for theatrically flipping a flapffle, but that I plan on installing a non-stick ceiling soon. Rest assured, my peculiar yeasty smell will eventually dissipate once I can afford an apartment, or when I???m able to get a nicer toddler???s mattress for the trunk. Your coworkers will love it!And if they don???t, I have a great idea involving a windowless panel van and Uber.Job Description:The Night???s Watch is looking for a talented and highly motivated Social Media Intern to join our award-winning team at Castle Black.

They each work in the restaurant industry: Christian is the chef de cuisine at a fancy seafood-and-steak place; Collin is a bartender at a popular cider house. Both are in their mid-30s???Christian is a year older???and they share a home nearby. ???He works days and I work nights. It???s a great situation,??? says Christian. ???I???ll leave paperbacks out for him to read. We mostly share fantasy books. That???s the only genre we agree on,??? Christian says. He and Collin grew up in a town near a state park, where ???you could always ride bikes to the waterfront,??? says Christian. Their mother was a nurse, and their father worked at a tires-and-rubber store for 30 years, and then ???he had enough one day and quit,??? says Collin.Christian mentions he just got back from an oyster-opening festival. ???We shucked 55,000 oysters in two days. I did 7,000 myself. I kept stabbing my thumb. I can???t f",100

Eventually, he???d like to move to the country to start his own oyster farm. ???My end game is peace and quiet???with the trees, and the smell of saltwater,??? he says, and it all sounds lovely. As we???re speaking, Christian and Collin and I occupy a tall-back wooden booth in neighborhood bar. The room is outfitted with old-west items: medallion wallpaper, curved brass furnishings, lampshades with brothel tassels. I???ve called the brothers to talk about their encounters with gun violence, and we begin with Christian and the Twilight Exit.Christian was in the lounge the night of the shooting. He was perched on a stool at the center counter of the horseshoe bar. ???I still sit in that same damned spot, every time,??? he said. Christian and I were strangers to each other then, but we were seated in direct view, and our presences registered. Amy, another customer, was to Christian???s immediate left, and that was their first meeting. As Christian remembers, they were chatting, she was very nice, and she had to leave for work soon. ???She had to go in for a crappy graveyard shift,??? he said. Christian had ordered a meal, and he was drinking a beer while he waited. ???I got a Cajun chicken salad with tater tots, light on the seasoning. I like to eat bland food when I???m done working,??? he said. At one point, a woman came in. Christian didn???t know her, though later he???d learn her name was Whitney. As Christian would describe her to a detective, Whitney was thin, about 5???8???, and mixed-raced, African American, or Hispanic. She sat one seat down from Christian, on the other side of Amy. Christian heard Whitney asking the bartender if she could charge her phone, but he didn???t pay her much attention until a man came in. From Christian???s statement, the man was a light-skinned African-American in his late twenties to early thirties. ???He was yelling at her as he walked in the door,??? Christian told me. ???He physically grabbed her, it was either on her shoulder or the side of her neck. He pushed her up against the wall or something. I couldn???t really see the whole thing, but it looked like he was restraining her. He accused her of having somebody break into his house, break his windows, and steal everything he had. He was listing all kinds of personal possessions. Something about his flat-screen TV. He was like, ???You know what you did. You know what they were after. They killed my dog.?????????I got up just to see if it went any further. I didn???t want to get into the altercation, but I was gonna help if I needed to. Amy and [the bartender] Natalie broke them apart. Amy told the guy he needed to leave, then the door guy Greg took him away. It kind of dispersed and we sat back down,??? said Christian. As James was guided outside, Whitney ???was smiling and chuckling about the whole thing. When I think about her smile, it was like a social shield,??? he said. ???Everybody, all the staff, asked her if she knew the guy. And she, like, nonchalantly said no. But it was very obvious she did know the guy. You could tell in her reaction. Anybody that gets grabbed like that by somebody is gonna freak out and yell for help. But she didn???t. She just kept looking at her phone. She was texting the entire time he was shouting at her. She had this smug look on her face,??? said Christian. When James was gone, Whitney ???sat there very calmly and continued to text and charge her cell phone. She was saying, ???You guys need to call the cops. You all should just call the cops.??? Amy said to her, ???Are you sure you don???t know him???? And Whitney said, ???I don???t. I???ve never seen him before.??? Then Amy commented to me. Something like, ???She???s up to no good. She knows what she???s doing. She???s provoking him.??????The exchange was odd but not especially jarring, and Christian and Amy quickly got back to hanging out. Fifteen or twenty minutes passed. ???It was karaoke night, so everybody was talking about what songs they were going to sing. You know, everybody???s having fun,??? he said. When James shot Greg near the building???s entrance, ???we heard a loud pop outside in the alleyway. It sounded like gunfire. I???ve never really been around guns often, but it sounded like a gunshot. People started running all over. Somebody said ???Out, out, out.??? It was so much chaos,??? said Christian. ???Then James comes in. He???s in the bar. He???s returned and he???s got a firearm pulled out. A silver handgun in his right hand. He???s making his way right to the girl. She runs past me, kind of behind me and around the other side of the bar where there???s a corner, and you can???t go any further. You???re stuck right there. That???s where you two were,??? Christian said, in reference to me and my friend Lexi.As James approached the lounge, ???I was really nervous. I didn???t know where Amy went. I didn???t know where you two went. What I did was, I picked up the barstool by its feet and held the seat between him and myself and said to him, I don???t know what exactly: ???Just get out of here. You don???t have to do this. You can leave. You can turn around and run right now.??? I was a couple feet from him. I was very close. I mean close enough to where I can see it right now. He pointed his gun at me. He aggressively, like, pointed it towards me. It was six or eight inches from my nose. I could smell the gun smoke. It smelled like fireworks. It was a hot metal smell. Once I had that thing in my face, it sunk in. I???ve never felt such a dropping fear. I was like, ???This is actually happening. This is fucking real. He shot someone, and now he is pointing a gun at me.??? It was pointed right at me. I mean right at me. I???ve never had that happen before. I???ve never seen anything like it. It???s something I???ll never forget. It was a silver handgun. I don???t know anything about guns. The barrel had a large opening. It had like a square. You could show me the end of that gun, and I could tell you if that was the gun or not,??? said Christian.James???s weapon was a Smith & Wesson 9mm semi-automatic pistol.Photo Credit: Seattle Police Department.???He was looking at me. I was so shaken I don???t remember exactly what he said. He said: ???Get out of my way. Get out of here. Do you want this to be you? I don???t want to hurt you, but I will.??? Something to that effect. We were eye-to-eye. I remember the look on his face. It wasn???t anger. It was concern. He realized the gravity of his actions,??? said Christian. ???You know, he said ???I don???t want to hurt you,??? and he had a smoking gun in his hand. That???s weird.??????The reality of my situation became very real, very fast. I thought, ???What am I gonna do with a barstool against a gun???? Not a whole lot. I was like, ???Look, man, this is uneven.??? I dropped the barstool to the floor,??? said Christian. ???I thought about my mom. At the time, I???d just gotten approved to give her my kidney. My right kidney. She has lupus. I???d gone through all the testing. I was so happy when they said I was a match. I wanted it to be me since the moment they said they were gonna test me,??? he said. ???Just earlier, I???d been asking one of the bartenders if she???d be able to walk my dog during my recovery time after the kidney-transplant surgery.???As Christian ran from the lounge and towards the alleyway entrance, ???I heard one more shot. Then one more shot right after that. Once I got outside, I stepped over Greg. He was off to the side of the doorway, laying on the ground bleeding. He asked me to call 911, but my phone was dead. I said, ???Look, can I help you? Can I he",100
144,"lp you up???? He???s like, ???No, leave me right here. Just go call 911.??? I went and grabbed someone, but they were already on the phone with the police. At that point, I just sort of ran around the corner of the bar, to get away from all the commotion and everything happening. I was a block away. The police were kind of already there, and then I heard pop pop pop pop. I think it was one, two, three, four, five.??????There were many unanswered questions for me, but I think the police did the right thing,??? said Christian, looking back. ???At first I was really pissed off at that woman. I still am. I didn???t realize how mad until this morning. I thought, ???Man, that fucking bitch kept me up again.??? I knew I was going to talk to you today, so I???d been thinking about the whole thing a little more than I usually do, and I lost a little sleep,??? said Christian. ???She halfway knew what she was doing. James had concern for other people???s well-being. He had some slight human capacity. But why did she have to go to the bar? It???s not like she had no place to go. She didn???t provoke him from her house,??? he said. ???She???d set the guy up for something, based on his reactions. That was somebody pushing somebody to the limit. That was a human coming to a breaking point. When people would talk about the shooting afterwards, the racial thing would come up far too often. But that had nothing to do with it. Anybody could do this to anyone else. It matters how far you push them,??? Christian said, then he transitioned into another vivid scene.???Six months later my brother got shot right outside our house. He was coming down the stairs, and a guy came out of the alleyway and asked him for a cigarette,??? said Christian. Collin stands and turns, and as he lifts his shirt, he reveals a smeary pink oval just above his hip. ???It was a flesh wound,??? said Collin. ???The bullet went right through the fat. When he shot me, the guy had been standing so close that the bullet was hot, and it cauterized the tissue when it went through.??? The shot was close enough to Collin???s kidney that doctors monitored for complications, but none appeared. ???The recovery ended up taking about a month. I wasn???t supposed to twist at the waist. I couldn???t really move or do much. It sucked, but it wasn???t as bad as passing a kidney stone,??? he said. (Collin has a history of stones, so his kidney was never considered as a donation option for his mother.)The shooting occurred on the fifth of July. ???I was headed home from work. It was just after midnight. I???d gotten food at a brewery and bought a growler of beer that I???d put in my backpack. I couldn???t have been closer to home. I was literally about to get home,??? he said. Collin passed a stairwell in a dark area. ???There was a lady who???d passed away. She???d been gone eight months or a year, and her house was still vacant. I couldn???t really see him coming out of the yard. That???s where he came from. He was an older black dude, maybe 45 to 55. He was wearing a big dark hoodie, and he had the hood up so I couldn???t see his face really. He asked me for a cigarette. I told him I didn???t have one. He said, ???That???s cool because I don???t want a cigarette. Give me your fucking wallet.??? He had a .22 revolver cocked and pointed at me, ready to go. I had $25 on me. I tried to hand it to him. He was about six feet away. The gun went off. I got popped right in the side. I don???t know if he meant to shoot or not. He took off running. He got away clean,??? said Collin. (Later that night, cops apprehended a suspect at a crowded drive-in burger joint. ???They pulled over some guy at Dick???s. They thought he matched the description, and they asked me to identify him,??? said Collin. ???It turned out he wasn???t the right guy, but he happened to have a ton of drugs on him, so he got arrested anyway. It was his unlucky day.???)We return to the moment of injury. ???I didn???t feel it at all. I didn???t even know I was shot at first. Then I noticed my legs were wet. I thought it was blood. Then I thought I???d pissed myself. I realized it was beer. The bullet went through my side, through my backpack, and it broke the growler,??? said Collin. ???I???d totally forgot that was even in there.??????Were you scared???? I said.???Yes,??? said Collin.HELL YEAH MAN (CLEANING SERVICE).I???ll come to your house and clean whatever you need, man, RIGHT NOW! I got a Swiffer; let???s just jack this place up!

Female police officers were a rarity in the late 1970s, so when someone was needed to process a female prisoner in the city jail, I was pulled from the phones and radio and turned into a de facto prison guard. I still have a certificate buried in a file cabinet somewhere from the Wyoming State Prison System, attesting to my training. The patrol officers got tired of my borrowing a key to unlock handcuffs all the time, so one of the guys ??? probably our shift sergeant ??? gave me one of my own to keep.I took the key with me after I left that job, and it came in handy when I took a similar job in Ohio during the mid-1980s. Interestingly, the key worked just as well with Ohio handcuffs as it had in Wyoming ??? law enforcement???s version of a skeleton key.I moved on to other occupations when motherhood demanded a more normal schedule, but the key stays with me as reminder of those war stories that fuel my novel writing. And it???s a guaranteed conversation starter at parties ??? at least if the guests have an interest in 50 Shades of Grey and BDSM.Who???s a good dog with a gun? Who is? Is it me? It is? It is! I???m a very good dog with a gun, yes I am! And I???m very, very sorry about shooting my owner in the leg. Oh boy, I am so sorry. But did I act strictly in self defense? Did I? Yes I did!Because who feared for his life? Who did? I did! And if you???d ever been in the car with my owner when he drives home from Grady???s Tavern on a Friday night, you???d understand my fear. Was I scared? Oooh, was I a scared boy? Yes I was! I was such a scared boy! But did I roll over and play dead? No! I???m a good dog with a gun, and a good dog with a gun is the only thing that can stop a bad dog with a gun, or a drunk driver, or a tyrannical government, or a vacuum cleaner.Who exercised his legal right to stand his ground? Me! Yes I did! Because I am good! I stood my ground, which in this case is the upholstered center console in the front seat, where the cup holders are. I always stand there, so I can keep a lookout for tyrants, and squirrels.And who regrets this unfortunate incident more than me? Nobody! I never intended to harm my owner. But who put the loaded pistol in the cup holder? Who escalated the situation by trying to take the gun away from me by force, leaving me no choice but to shoot? That???s right, my owner did! Fortunately for him, I???m a good dog, but a bad shot. The surgeon says he???ll be fine.So who is confident in my eventual exoneration? Me! Oh I am so confident! I???m absolutely certain I???ll be exonerated; as confident as I am that someday I will destroy every squirrel in this great nation of ours. And every vacuum cleaner. And the mailman, who lately has been engaging in what can only be described as deliberately provocative behavior. Tyrannical, even.And besides, who is legally entitled to handle a firearm in the state of Louisiana, even without a permit? Who can do that? Can I do that? I can! That???s right! I may have flunked basic obedience training, but Louisiana knows what a good dog I am. I AM SO LAW-ABIDING I JUST CAN???T SIT STILL.Who feels truly blessed by all the support he???s received? Who is humbled by the generous donations people have made to his Kickstarter legal fund? Me, that???s who, the good dog with a gun! The best dog with a gun!

Of course it is.Just keep saying that, and no one gets hurt.I???m guessing you???ve never heard of Nana Asma???u, and she???s okay with that. In fact, I think she was probably one of the most zen humans ever and rarely got upset about anything. But she should be pissed off about at least one thing.Nana Asma???u lived from 1793-1864 in the Sokoto Caliphate, an empire that was eventually absorbed into what we know today as northern Nigeria.Asma???u was well educated. She spoke four languages and wrote poetry as well as scholarly works. She was an educator and a social reformer.Nana Asma???u wanted people in her caliphate to be as educated as possible, and trained other women to help her do this. She wrote instructive poems that the teachers would memorize and then pass on to their students in the villages they traveled to (genius move for teaching a mostly oral culture). These women wore distinctive red scarves on their heads so that everyone who saw them would know that they were Nana Asma???u???s trained teachers, and they were to receive the highest respect. They were never restricted in their teaching, and traveled the caliphate instructing both men and women on general as well as religious topics.But Nana Asma???u was an African Muslim woman, which, according to today???s stereotypes, makes her ignorant and oppressed.To some extent those stereotypes make sense, especially if we look at women of Asma???u???s time elsewhere in the world. This is the time of the French Revolution and Napoleonic Wars in Europe, and, at the end of Asma???u???s life, the Civil War in America. So, when we picture most women of this time period, we picture enormous hoop skirts and a lot of fainting away at th",100
146,"e mere suggestion of violence (thank you, Gone With the Wind, for providing those images).Some of those stereotypes are true, of course, and women were ignorant and oppressed in many parts of the world. But here???s the thing about Nana Asma???u: She was not unique for her time and place. Women in her region, and in her religion, were regarded as equal to men in many ways, and they considered it anti-Islamic to keep anyone, man or woman, from getting as much education as they could achieve.To be fair (or unfair, such as the case may be), there was a bit of a ???separate but equal??? divide between men and women in the Sokoto Caliphate. Women were to obey their husbands, but they were only held to obey their husbands??? lawful wishes ??? an important distinction that Asma???u wrote about and was adamant about teaching to everyone.And anyway, let???s put this in some perspective. I???ve seen women???s magazines from the 1950s preaching things like, ???Be sure to put lipstick on before your husband comes home. He???s worked hard all day and doesn???t want to see your unadorned face when he gets home to eat the hot supper you should have ready for him.??? So, let???s not pretend that we all haven???t had gender issues that are not only recent, but some of them ongoing.So why have relatively few of us heard of Nana Asma???u today? Well, she lived 200 years ago and people fade through history, I suppose. Women in particular have a way of disappearing between the pages of Things We Must Remember.But what if Nana Asma???u disappeared for some of us partly because of our own ignorance? Some people today assume that Muslim women are all oppressed, are all submissive, are all uneducated and unaware. They think that all Muslim women wear the burqa and are forbidden to drive, so why would they look for progressive female Muslim heroes in history?Yes, those stereotypes of Muslim women come from some measure of reality; yes, there are societies where women are oppressed, wearing the burqa and forbidden to drive. But those are specific countries and cultures, not an entire swath of over 1.7 billion people (almost 25% of the world???s population is Muslim).So here???s what Nana Asma???u should be pissed off about. The things that she did were not unusual for her time and place. She was noteworthy in her society because of her famous father (who founded the caliphate in which they lived), but not because of her level of education or the freedom with which she lived her life.Chances are, Nana Asma???u would be dismayed to learn that some of today???s Muslim societies are oppressing women, just as she would be disheartened to learn that some of today???s Christian societies are oppressing women. But she would be downright pissed off to learn that so many people in the world have such misperceptions of Islam ??? misperceptions that become words, accepted without question by those who hear or speak them and refuse to learn the truth; misperceptions that become ugly, dangerous, destructive actions when those who believe them decide that they are somehow better than people whose religion they haven???t bothered to try to understand.And on a slightly less important but still disturbing note, I think Nana Asma???u would also be pissed off because so many people think and speak of Africa as simply ???Africa,??? as if it???s a homogenous place where everyone looks and speaks and thinks the same, as opposed to 54 distinct countries (on the second largest continent) and even more cultures that are unique and vibrant, with much to teach the rest of the world.- -I hope that you choose to learn more about Nana Asma???u.

Travel back in time to the moment just before the mother is leaving the house to go to the supermarket. ???Don???t forget to take Hunkerdoodle,??? tell her, referring to the purple and green musical stuffed toy which usually puts Jonas into an agreeable trance. When she looks up from the floor where she???s kneeling down to put socks on Jonas and says, ??????How did you get in here? What the fuck are you doing in my house???? say, ???You???re welcome.???2. Travel back in time to 1930, when Michael Cullen opened the first King Kullen store, the grandfather of retail supermarkets. Point out to Mr. Cullen that every single element of the modern supermarket ??? the fluorescent lighting, the chromatic packaging, the character product tie-ins and the unrelenting candy ??? seems designed to drive most small children insane, and that when combined together they will inexorably lead to the worst moment of any SAHM???s day. Plant some alternative ideas in his head. ???How about a soft-lit sensory room with fish projections gently swimming across the isles???? you might suggest. ???Or a cozy tent???? When Cullen replies, ???Why are you carrying a ladies??? bag???? just say, ???Everything is about to get really bad. And then it will get worse. Also, the Wizard is just some guy behind a curtain.???3. Travel back in time 10,000 years to New Guinea, where homo sapiens first domesticated sugarcane at the end of the last Ice Age. Tell them how ???White Gold??? is destined to become the world???s most evil food, driving the transatlantic slave trade and leading to unprecedented, colossal human suffering. Tell them about the modern epidemic of obesity which is at least partially due to the fact that our Digital Age brains are exactly like theirs, and we???re still programmed to eat whatever we see in front of just us as hunter-gatherers did. Finally, tell them about Jonas??? tantrum which was triggered when his mother refused to place a box of multi-colored breakfast cereal, whose toucan spokes-character was making direct eye contact with Jonas, in the shopping cart. ???Just leave it alone,??? tell the Micronesian ancestors. If that doesn???t work say, ???Look over there. Some taro!???4. Re-trace your steps back to the moment when the mother is about to leave the house for the supermarket. ???You should have put the $2300 you spent travelling to Costa Rica after college in a low-risk investment,??? tell her. ???Then you???d have money for a babysitter. And you still haven???t found Hunkerdoodle! It???s like you want this to be a crap day.??? If that doesn???t work, go to the supermarket ahead of her and tase the other shoppers with a sonic gun. Then at least no one will judge the mother when Jonas goes bananas.5. Travel back in time to 2007, when the mother finally agrees to go out with the shy mid-level manager who has admired her from afar for many years. Steal her away from him and marry her. Together, you will create a different child, one whose meltdown trigger is being denied iPad time rather than sugary junk. Now, before the time-space continuum has a chance to calibrate, travel back to the supermarket where Jonas is flipping his lid. Walk right up to the mother, who is starting to become transparent because of the rip you created in the Fourth Dimension, and say, ???Don???t worry. You and I are going to have such great sex together.???  When she looks as if she???s trying to decide whether to cry or knee you in the groin, explain how none of this matters because in just a few minutes everything she knows as reality will cease to exist. Then say, ???Sorry you???re having a hard time with your kid. It happens to everyone.???[Originally published June 21, 2016.]- - -I",100
147," have a confession to make: I am Elena Ferrante.When, in My Brilliant Friend, Elena Ferrante brutally exposed the class divisions in Neapolitan society, that was me. When she documented a tempestuous female friendship in Those Who Leave and Those Who Stay, that was me as well. When she declined interview requests from the world???s leading literary publications ??? also me. They were all me because they were all Elena Ferrante and I am Elena Ferrante.Much of the speculation around my identity has started from the assumptions that I am female, middle-aged, Italian, from Naples, have lived in Pisa, and am a professor in some humanities-related field. Very few literary detectives have figured out that I am a male, 26-year-old American whose experience with Pisa is limited to viewing a picture of a friend holding up the Leaning Tower through a hilariously original manipulation of perspective, and whose work experience is limited to data entry, SAT tutoring, and multiple unpaid internships.Now, some of you might be skeptical of my being Elena Ferrante due to my linguistic capabilities, age, gender, Italian-ness, writing ability, and life experience not corresponding with your expectations. But fear not! I will assuage all these concerns as eloquently and completely as I painted a portrait of the struggles of a woman with ambition trapped in an impoverished, deeply patriarchal society.You may be wondering how someone who is not Italian, doesn???t speak Italian, and cannot even pronounce the word ???gnocchi??? could write a series of acclaimed novels that showcase both fluent Italian and a deep intimate knowledge of the Neapolitan dialect. Well, Spanish is basically Italian and I took one semester of Spanish in college, receiving a B-. Profesora Garcia described my writing as having ???muchas ideas interesantes, pero tambi??n muchos errores de gram??tica.??? So the potential was always there. You would be amazed how far basic Spanish, augmented with Google Translate, can get you.My writing may seem awfully mature for someone so young, but look, I???m an old soul. I have grown-up, sophisticated taste. I do the NY Times crossword puzzle and eat vegetables sometimes. I can write with wisdom beyond my years. And as to my writing seeming remarkably sensitive to female issues for a male author, I grew up with sisters. Sisters who, for all their so-remarked-upon-at-family-reunions accomplishments have yet to win praise from James Wood in the New Yorker or a Man Booker prize. As I have, because I am Elena Ferrante.Now, it might seem strange that someone whose writing career has as yet received little recognition would be able to achieve such literary acclaim writing as his Italian lady alter ego. Maybe so. Or maybe my writing career is just more impressive than I???ve previously been given credit for. After all, in my non-Elena Ferrante life I am an internet-published author whose work has been featured in one college newspaper and two (now-defunct) blogs. It has been retweeted by three separate twitter accounts, only two of which were spambots and only one of which was a porn spambot/men???s rights activist.Statements in my letters to literary critics and my searing portrayal of the aftermath of a contentious divorce in The Days of Abandonment have lead many to speculate that I have been through a devastating marital disintegration. Not so. However, this is not to say that I am not drawing on my personal life when I so elegantly portray the interior world of characters dealing with heartbreak. One time on a Tinder date I asked a girl what she liked to do for fun and she said, ???I don???t have any hobbies.??? And I said, ???really, not any? Like not even watching TV or something???? She then drained her drink and looked pointedly at her watch. So I too have known loves lost and hearts broken.Why am I coming forward now? Why am I reversing my deeply held belief about the importance of anonymity for preserving the integrity of the artist? Well, I realized ??? in a thought totally in keeping with the emotional maturity and sophistication I have demonstrated throughout all my writing ??? that I was missing out on a bunch of fun awards ceremonies where I could collect cash prizes while flirting with attractive women who work in publishing. What is artistic integrity when weighed against the chance to chat up an assistant editor over comped champagne?In the coming days my publisher might deny that I am, in fact, Elena Ferrante, but that???s just because she commits very seriously to bits. I am definitely Elena Ferrante; keep inviting me to galas and sending me checks. Also, some of you might now be double-checking the dates my novels were published and realizing that my first novel was published before I turned four. To these of you I say, ???Would you believe that I???m Thomas Pynchon????Dear Limp Bizkit,I???m writing mostly to thank you, which I have a feeling isn???t something that happens all that often. My apologies if that, or any of this, comes across as curt; honest, I???m on your side.See, 1998 and 1999 were my anni mirabiles. I was eleven, so that???s sad as hell, I know, but listen. That was when a schism in my Catholic school occurred ??? between sexes, between phases in our individual bodies (at least mine ??? I got my first period and had to play the snare drum in a school band concert ??? standing up! ??? the same night), and, like every fucking ???90s teen movie ever, between cliques, namely the ???popular??? kids and the ???alternative??? kids (because, didn???t you know, there are really only like five kinds of people??) ???and we didn???t have Tumblr or anything to help navigate these differences. Nobody got along and it was horrendous.But, wait. Not all of it. Because 1998 was also ??? November 12, to be exact ??? when the music video for ???Faith??? debuted on Total Request Live. It squeaked right in there at number ten, helping round out what was, actually, a pretty solidly ???alternative??? list, save for the boy bands who held on tightly to the top.No offense, but I do wish that my musical epiphany happened like, at Woodstock, or while seeing the Ramones live, or hearing the Beatles for the first time, or during fucking anything else, but it didn???t. It happened that day, while I was sitting on a ratty brown sofa-bed, probably still half in my school uniform, eating Dunkaroos, watching you, Fred, mime-scream George Michael lyrics into a fisheye lens. Watching you sign the breast of a girl with a blurred-out face. Watching you flip off your own audience a half-second before you launch into the chorus.That???s when everything changed for me. That following year, guided by your muddy guitars, I slid into an identity chiseled by the buzz-bin MTV gods and sculpted by modern rock radio. I begged my mom to take me to head shops to buy iron-on Korn patches. I wasn???t scared of Hot Topic anymore. A few boys thought I was ???rad??? to hang out with (but not to date or kiss or like). I bought two anole lizards, and I named them Fred and Wes (Fred died immediately and Wes escaped; I found a shriveled lizard carcass at the back of my closet two years later). I saved allowance for a red Yankees cap, although I never wore it outside the house, except maybe once to my sister???s stupid gymnastics practice, which I was dragged to against my will, obviously.So why am I thanking you? What exactly did all of this do to me, or for me? Well, eventually I realized that it wasn???t the rap-singing, or the all-black contact lenses, that drew me to you. It was your anger ???and it was the same anger that had drawn countless hormonal, disaffected teens (or pre-teens) to music their p",100
148,"arents hated for generations upon generations. It was the angst within lyrics like ???shut the fuck up??? and ???stick it up your (yeah),??? not the lyrics themselves, that I really connected with.(Although, really, how much more relatable could a lyric be than ???It???s just one of those days/Where you don???t want to wake up/Everything is fucked/Everybody sucks???? So pure. So honest.)Yes, I moved on. And I guess I???m not super apologetic about that. But I am sick of hiding away my n??-metal past like a receding hairline under a fuzzy Kangol bucket hat. I???m sick of, when asked by an old friend if I remember when I used to wear JNCO jeans, not saying yeah of course I fucking do, and do you know how comfortable that shit was? and instead, nodding bashfully, and acting like I don???t remember that time she wanted a Dave Matthews fire dancer tattoo.A year or so later, when someone stole Significant Other out of my 48-CD zipper binder during a bus trip to Boston, I was bummed, but now I realize that, too, was a gift. That empty sleeve just opened up room for more music ???better, more respectable music (again, sorry) ???but music I probably wouldn???t have discovered if you hadn???t come into my life.So, thank you, Limp Bizkit. And I???m sorry I outgrew you before Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water, but wasn???t that about buttholes? I mean, come on.Sincerely,Emily CostaMansplainingManspreadingManscapingMansfield ParkManchester UnitedManicottiManslaughterGive consideration to your man???s careerWe live in a changed time where men can be both fathers and have a career. It???s a balancing act, sure. My husband Bill and I discussed at length his proposal for returning to work after the birth of our first child. I was skeptical at first, but agreed that as long as he was able to keep the house in a functional state of cleanliness, it might work out.In hindsight, I???m glad I had such an open mind. He seems to get a real kick out of being back in the workforce! It???s nice for him to get out of the house and have some social interaction; plus, there are perks for me as well. He tended to ???fill up??? on unspoken conversation when he was just staying home with the baby. This is not the ideal situation for any woman, who yearns for peace and quiet when she returns from a long, hard day at work. Having Bill go back to his job has done wonders for our relationship in this regard (although we???ve actually decided now that it would be best if he cut down to three days a week, just so he???s less stressed about fitting in all the child/household stuff as well).This little experiment has taught me that it is possible for men to have it all ??? to juggle the demands of raising a family and maintaining a career. It???s not for every partnership, but it???s worth considering, especially if he starts getting a bit naggy about it.Laugh at his jokesEasier said than done! Just the other day, I gave what I assumed was the appropriate degree of chuckle in response to something Bill said, and it turned out that his comment was not intended as a joke. (Incidentally, it???s good to practice transitioning from a laugh to a cough for use in exactly this type of situation.)According to Science, there???s a gland (from memory, located at the base of the neck??) from which humor is secreted. There???s a good reason why men simply aren???t funny, and that is that the development of this gland is dependent on the presence of two X-chromosomes. Please don???t blame your man for being hugely dull. It???s not his fault. Encourage the poor thing! With practice, he might one day stumble onto a pun.Compliment himMen crave validation from women. This even goes for ones you haven???t met. If you see an attractive male out in public, give him a hearty wolf-whistle and watch his whole face light up with joy.Men in relationships tend to get a bit snippy when their partners don???t notice a new tie or haircut. Do try to keep a look out for these things, and if you like what you see, let him know! Something as simple as a well-timed ???you smell nice??? will remind him that he???s special.It???s important that you keep track of the frequency with which you hand out compliments. I personally find an Excel spreadsheet is useful for this. Sometimes, you might find that you get a better result when you withhold the compliment. A man???s complacency is, after all, the result of too much carrot and not enough stick (and before the PC-brigade jumps on that, I mean ???stick??? in a purely metaphorical sense ??? I???m not a bastard).Communicate openly about any disagreementsIt???s fine if your man wants to negotiate for some independence, but make sure that his other, more useful traits aren???t being forfeited in the process. Consider reining him in a bit if things start to slacken in the areas of home upkeep, personal grooming, or wife-directed attentiveness. It???s important to keep a dialogue open about such things, so that you can communicate your thoughts and he can listen.Occasionally, he might think that he has a complaint of his own. Learn to take this in your stride. Suggest a nap, or buy him a trinket.Remind him how good it isFemales and males are naturally suited to different roles. On the one hand, females are able to carry human life, while on the other, males are quite tall. One gender isn???t better than the other ??? we???re just different! It???s been a long time coming, but we can all agree now that we???ve finally arrived in an era of gender equality. I for one think it???s great. You go, guys!""When considering the most important figures in history, a few names come to mind. Yours and mine, of course, but also one more: Jesus. While many consider Jesus the son of God, the central figure of Christianity, the awaited messiah, the inventor of stained glass, and the guy from the big statue that television and movies show us to establish that the setting is Rio de Janeiro, conspiracy theorists view Jesus in a different, less holy, light.Is the Bible a truthful account of Jesus of Nazareth, his disciples, and his teachings? Did Jesus even exist or is he like Santa Claus, fake, fat, and the creation of Coca-Cola? When turning water into wine, was it only red wine? I feel like it???s always red wine in pictures, but could it be white wine or ros?? as well?By examining the claims of conspiracists, debunkers, and rebunking with my own blessed thoughts, I???ll attempt to lift the Shroud of Turin and reveal the truth behind the Church???s favorite mascot.Does Jesus??? story hold water that he can walk on or is this just another tale of a carpenter that lies and dies and makes it so I have to build my own damn gazebo?Let???s find out, because, hey, it???s Sunday somewhere.- -Conspiracy Claim: Jesus??? favorite and most important disciple was Mary Magdalene. With Mary, Jesus sought to make women feature more prominently in Christianity, a fact that the Church covered up, as it opposed their male chauvinistic agenda.Debunking Claim: Only certain Gnostic Gospels purport this belief and such texts are specious at best, hence why they weren???t incorporated into the Bible. Jesus??? thoughts on the role of women in the Christianity aligned with those of the Church.Rebunking Claim: Jesus favored Mary Magdalene because he felt a direct kinship with her. Mary was a prostitute, a woman who sought the patronage and money of others so that her pimp wouldn???t kill her. Jesus was a proselytizer, a man who sought the patronage and money of others so that his pimp, God, wouldn???t kill him. This is all the more obvious when you realize the Gospel of John is more correctly translated as the Gospel of A Joh",100
149,"n.- -Conspiracy Claim: Not only was she favored, the Gnostic Gospel of Philip refers to Mary Magdalene as Jesus??? partner, proving that the two were married and might have had children. The bloodline of Christ may very well still exist.Debunking Claim: Not only is that text not considered canonical by the Church, the Greek term that supposedly describes Mary as Jesus??? ???partner??? actually refers to a partnership in faith or business, not a romantic or sexual relationship.Rebunking Claim: The Da Vinci Code, a best-selling novel and best-Tom Hanksing film, develops this conspiracy theory in such detail that it is impossible not to draw one obvious conclusion: Dan Brown, author of The Da Vinci Code, is Jesus??? living descendant. If you don???t immediately take my word for it, how dare you, and also, just think, what would we expect out of Jesus??? living heir?1.	To disseminate his or her views to the world. Dan Brown is a world renowned, and world tolerated, author. CHECK.2.	To reference Jesus with an anagram of his or her name. Dan Brown easily becomes Ban Drown. What better way to ban drowning than to walk on water? CHECK.3.	To be Jesus??? living heir, he or she would undoubtedly be alive. Dan Brown is, and here???s the smoking crucifix, alive. CHECKMATE.- -Conspiracy Claim: Roman soldiers only assumed Jesus had died during crucifixion, when in actuality he merely fainted and was taken down from the cross. Thus, the ???resurrection??? was merely Jesus regaining consciousness, not a mythical return from the dead proving Jesus??? claim as the son of God.Debunking Claim: Roman law was very precise and thorough regarding crucifixions. There isn???t a possibility that Jesus was removed from the cross while still alive.Rebunking Claim: Whether Jesus died or survived his time hanging out on the cross is irrelevant, what mattered to the Church was that he was on the cross. Why? Where do you think the Catholic Church???s money, rumored to be around $15 billion (5 Avatars worth of money!), comes from? Real estate holdings and investments in banking? Ye of little faith and even less knowledge! It???s from selling crucifixes and crosses! The religion aspect is nice and everything, but the Church is all about the merch.- -Conspiracy Claim: The Church has suppressed and erased evidence of Jesus??? belief in reincarnation as it does not fall in line with the Church???s other tenets and teachings.Debunking Claim: This claim only stems from the writings of Origen, an early Christian theologian who was later considered a heretic. None of the numerous other theologians or Biblical scholars support Jesus??? espousing a belief in reincarnation.Rebunking Claim: Jesus believed all sorts of crazy stuff that the Church has attempted to cover up. He even planned on adding 5 additional Commandments to the established ten, however the Church conveniently made these changes ???disappear.??? Below is the only surviving proof of Jesus??? proposed additions, which I photographed inside the Vatican???s vaults while posing as a City Pope Inspector, I job I hadn???t actually had for months.- -Conspiracy Claim: Jesus simply didn???t exist. Jesus and Christianity were invented by members of secret societies and mystery schools into order to unify the Roman Empire under one state religion.Debunking Claim: This ???Christ-Myth??? theory finds virtually no support from scholars. Even non-religious scholars believe in the historical evidence that Jesus was a real person and had some involvement in the creation of Christianity.Rebunking Claim: Jesus had to exist or else Dan Brown wouldn???t be here. And if Dan Brown is one thing, it???s here.""I was going to order cheese, but thought that would be uncool.I couldn???t be the only one who ordered the Triple-Queso Cheese Bowl.Vegetables are just vehicles for cheese.Lettuce negates cheese.All lettuce is the same: better with cheese.I love cheese.I eat cheese in the bathtub every night.I don???t know what kale is.I never want to know what kale is.Does it come soaked with cheese?I will try kale if it???s soaked with cheese.Heaven(s), let me relish the magic, but not the dumbfounded enchantment which I claimed to understand when I first cooed through dirty diapers and explicable sleepless nights, rather something we can actually use this time.

We all realize that. But it???s not the point.- -Sweet Jehovah, must I follow back her friend on Snapchat? Furthermore, would the images within be renounced as biblical abominations? What, pray tell, was your bestowed creed back in the day when fathers married them off at age eleven? Would you say that, since then, you???ve done some of your own course correction?- -Precious Buddha, in order that I may see the divinity of all things more clearly will you deliver from my mind the song ???Wildest Dreams??? by Taylor Swift.

If I???m not mistaken they signal that I don???t mess around. Many pool Moms noticed.- -Blessed Earth Goddesses, anoint me with the succor that my lecture on the value of authority figures made sense. My statement on how sarcasm was probably invented in the 90s was cogent too, I felt. Forgive me. I am weak.- -Hallowed Sovereign Apple Headquarters, yea, though we bow our heads in devotion to thee still, let us together avert our eyes from the horizon rife with widespread doubt, impermanence and the darkening of our various clouds.- -Jesus Christ, somehow I???ve been tasked with the purchase of her new underwear at the department store and I???ve yet to star in an ensemble comedy to make the whole thing adorable.- -Almighty Beyonc??, please confirm that these other parents don???t know what the hell they???re doing and are headed for a sorely overdue comeuppance. Please allow me to ignore that they too, have offered up to you this very same prayer regarding our own household but that we, unlike them, will be able to go forth despite the cognitive dissonance therein.

As a gesture of penitence, I offer to you a portion of this overcooked gluten-free pizza that we may share and be glad in together. You will take a crispy bite first, then I, and back again during this moment of silent kitchen reflection.- -Supreme Rising Oceans, the irony is not lost on me that I will one day look back on these days with gut-wrenching nostalgia. With grace, hold fast then, a little while longer. Though it???s understandable, in the meantime, if you need to swallow a few luxury cruise ships.- -Oh Hera, Queen of the Gods, let us not forget that conviction can be found in the miracle of belief itself. We can go about our days with a fervent wonder at the myths conceived in our own hearts and minds. However, would it also be possible to stick around in case you???re needed to turn someone into a bird or perhaps an echo (or whatever suits this time) that could prove a crucial intervention during the college search and/or learner???s permit phase?- -Angel of Mercy, Patron Saint of Flux, Redeemer of the Open Road, I???ll take her uttering of the word ???peace??? at the short but moving funeral service this afternoon as both a larger win and a last amen.

You have to eat in a bowl with milk for it to qualify as lunch.- -When performing stunts on the couch, bar stools cannot be used as jumping platforms, only kitchen chairs. Kitchen chairs cannot be stacked on top of each other on the couch. A maximum of five pillows can be placed on the kitchen chair (only one!) after it is placed on the couch to increase the height of the jumping platform.- -The only terms you can use to refer to your hindquarters are hindquarters and rear body area.- -No eating cookies before 11 am.

You may choose shower or bath, but once you verbally commit to one or the other, you may not switch. Quick reminder: Hindquarters shaking is permitted in the shower, but not in the bath. Keep that in mind when you make your choice.- -At bedtime, you can watch half of a two-part Miles from Tomorrowland episode on the iPad. That???s it! Then we can read one book.

We???re about bold, over-the-top, adventurous flavor that takes the world by storm. Flavor you???re not ready for, and probably won???t even like because it hurts and makes you sweat way too much.That???s right, hombre, you???d better saddle up because you???re about to ride your horse straight into Flavor Town. But we???re not talking about a regular horse that eats hay and calmly trods down the boring, beaten path most other quick service restaurants take you down. At Taco Hut, you???ll be taking a ride on a wild, crazy stallion that foams at the mouth and behaves erratically because it is afflicted with a very serious horse disease.Once you???re here, you???ll be thankful we have ample seating in our restaurants because this is the kind of flavor you???re gonna want to sit down for. Because Taco Hut???s tacolicious flavor is about to rock your world, blow your lid, and knock your socks off.  And then, when you???re barefoot and vulnerable, our bold, innovative blend of herbs and spices will run back and unexpectedly kick you in the dick.But flavor???s not done with you yet.While you???re still writhing in pain and clutching your bruised genitals, it???ll take an unflattering picture of you and send it to that girl you like. Then it???ll take her to prom in a Camaro with cool flame decals on the side. That???s just how our flavor rolls. It???s the kind of unforgettable dining experience that???ll leave you curled up and shaking in a position we like to call a ???scared flavor ball.???So get used to it. Flavor???s here, and it???s not going to apologize. Even though it probably should because it seems like it???s being really mean for no reason.It???s all part of a development our marketing department likes to call ???hyper-real??? flavor. Based on our brand pillars of spiciness, tacovation, and fear, it???s a daring, wildly irresponsible flavor experiment that will make you taste colors, hear feelings, and speak in riddles. It???s the kind of experience that will leave you wondering ???what did I do to deserve this???? and ???did someone slip acid into this guacamole???? And here at Taco Hut, we can assure you that the answers to these questions will always be ???something very bad??? and ???yes??? because we don???t play by the rules, and our employees don???t exactly ???pass??? background checks.So don???t be surprised when this too bold for comfort flavor isn???t easily extinguished. We guarantee it???ll linger long after the fiesta is over, and after a few m",100
151,"onths, will start to feel like it???s really overstaying its welcome. But you???ll feel awkward asking it to leave, so you???ll end up getting into a heated argument about it with your spouse in the guest bathroom. It???s daring, it???s brave, and it???s the kind of flavor that will make you want to shout from the rooftops ???there is a Taco Hut employee we don???t even know in our house right now and he???s being very aggressive.???It???s just the kind of flavor you simply can???t ignore. Mostly because of its loud, constant screaming. Which is actually pretty unnerving because you???re supposed to be the one with the mouth, right? But that???s just how bold this flavor is. Bold enough to transport you to a nightmarish bizarro world where you are the one who is food. It???s flavor that consumes you, so don???t even try to run. Your legs have already been eaten.Some people might say we???ve taken this whole bold flavor thing a bit too far, that we???ve lost control of our own product and have created some kind of horrible flavor monster. And to those people we say: ???You are 100% correct.??? In retrospect, it???s clear we???ve made a huge and very dangerous mistake. In fact, many of us within the Taco Hut organization are becoming concerned for our personal safety and the safety of our families. Just last week, our very own CMO was assaulted by our authentic Mexican flavor in the form of a renegade chalupa. He is still technically alive, but his mind is gone. Now he???s just an extra crispy shell of his former self.Honestly, we???re pretty surprised that our legal department didn???t flag a lot of this stuff before it went to market. Our tortilla chips contain actual glass and our five-alarm salsa melts most types of bone. This isn???t the kind of flavor experience you should take lightly. We encourage you think long and hard before entering into what some have described as a ???flavor horror,??? and also require that you sign a liability waiver, because Taco Hut flavor is the kind of flavor that changes you. After one bite, you won???t even know who you are anymore, and won???t want to, because of the heavy shame and life-long bed-wetting side effects.But if you???re the kind of person who???s willing to throw caution to the wind and grab life by the horns, we invite you to stop by your nearest Taco Hut anytime. Some of our tacos have recently sprouted very sharp horns and we could use help handling them.Organized Religious: Arrives at church, synagogue or mosque with relevant verses and/or hymns already bookmarked.

I can???t believe that???s even a question, with my history.  I mean, my mom and sisters are all women and I know them, so how could I dislike other women that are not them?  It doesn???t make any sense and, frankly, it???s below the belt. I mean, how dare you?I hate the new Ghostbusters movie because my number one issue when judging a film is and has always been Hollywood finance reform.  And frankly, I???m tired of all big blockbuster movies.  The movie system is corrupt and I think we need to put our foot down, right now specifically in 2016, to put a stop to this new Ghostbusters movie as a signal that we???re done with all big hollywood blockbusters.  And if you don???t agree with me, well, maybe you need to stop buying movie tickets with your vagina.If you???re actually looking for an honest movie with integrity about ghosts, check out Abbott and Costello???s 1941 classic Hold That Ghost which, actually, does more for female movie leads than the new Ghostbusters movie ever will.  No, there aren???t any female leads in the movie and the movie never really bothers to bring up any issues that would be of concern to female leads, but it???s also rarely voted against female lead issues, so??? that???s even better than providing female leadership, in a way.And yes, so far people of color don???t seem to be excited about or interested in watching 1941???s Hold That Ghost in movie theaters this summer, but that???s just because they???re not informed enough about how much they???d enjoy Hold That Ghost.  The plot of the movie hinges on hidden finances, which as we all know, encapsulates and trumps all issues of race and gender and discrimination of any kind.  I wish people of color that have expressed interest in seeing this new Ghostbusters weren???t going against their best interests.  I have a picture of an important, famous black guy standing near a theater playing Hold That Ghost, if you need more proof that this is a cut and dry issue.  Why are we even still talking about this?If the movie theater system wasn???t rigged, then maybe more people would be educated about how great Hold That Ghost actually is.  I called up several movie theaters recently and they said they had no plans to show it in their theaters?  WHAT.  I thought this was America.  They said they wouldn???t be opposed to showing Hold That Ghost for some private screenings, but so far not many people have requested for it to be shown there, so unless the numbers look better, they won???t be showing it.  But, everyone I know and like supports the idea of Hold That Ghost for playing at our local cinemas this summer!  The world isn???t bigger than the people I know!And the people I know, we all mostly agree, it???s either Hold That Ghost or NOTHING.  We think the movie theaters should shut down if they???re not going to play Hold That Ghost.  Yeah, we know some people get food and go to the bathroom at movie th",100
152,"eaters, but if they???re going to play the new female Ghostbusters, that???s just as bad as showing Faces of Death 7 in our opinions!  And those two things are so similar and interchangeable that I won???t bother showing or telling you why.  That???s not good enough? Here???s a picture of a Bridesmaids DVD and a Faces of Death 7 VHS standing next to each other on the SAME SHELF.This new movie Ghostbusters reminds me of the movie Ghost from the ???90s and now that we???re not in the ???90s I???ve decided I don???t like the movie Ghost.  I???m going to say that Ghostbusters is the same as Ghost and hold Ghostbusters responsible for the things I don???t like about Ghost.Of course we???re ready for a comedy-action movie with female leads.  And of course, we???re overdue??? but I think we need to wait for the RIGHT new Ghostbusters movie, not just ANY Ghostbusters movie.  The women in the new Ghostbusters movie have a lot of good comedy experience, yes, of course.  But over the last 20 years, I can find a few examples of them not being funny, especially when you take those moments out of context.Now, if Elizabeth Warren and Jill Stein and Michelle Obama make a new Ghostbusters in a hypothetical four or eight years from now, I could get behind that idea.  That vague notion that wouldn???t hold up under any scrutiny for a variety of reasons is CLEARLY a better option than this new Ghostbusters movie made by competent people that???s seemingly ready to be shown any minute now.I also know a couple women who would agree with me on the things I???m saying, so again, I think that proves I???m not sexist or misogynist.  This new Ghostbusters movie just isn???t for me and I think everything should be for me.  Will this movie just existing inspire young women to get involved with making their own Ghostbusters movies at state and local theater levels?  I don???t know, is representation in media and government even important?Listen, I???m getting distracted.  When it comes down to it, this has nothing to do with misogyny or sexism or even this new Ghostbusters movie.  This is about 1941???s Hold That Ghost coming along and speaking to me in a way I???ve never been spoken to; this is a once in a generation film.  And it???s cool.  No, really, I really think that!  This old black and white movie is cool and I don???t dislike women or hold any weird hidden prejudices against them, I???m just really excited about this old movie a lot of people have seen before.From the grad student point of view, a free lunch with a visiting seminar speaker should be a fantastic opportunity. After all, it is basically free lunch, often catered by a local pizza or sub joint. You just have to show up, right?Also, it???s free.Unfortunately, the old adage ???there is no such thing as a free lunch??? applies. If this was a truly free lunch, you could show up, stuff as much as you can in your bag/pockets/hands/face, and retreat to a good hiding place to be alone with your delicious, free food.But remember, you work at ground zero of departmental research, so you have a role in representing the department. It???s an understatement that graduate school requires a ton of focus and attention, and a casualty of this is that normal, everyday things like proper dress, hygiene, keeping up with popular culture, and of course, etiquette kind of go out the window. And yes, these things can be forgotten.So, I present for you all some general do???s and don???ts for properly conducting yourself while you eat lunch with the visiting seminar speaker.DOBe on time. You can grab a spot at the table set out that is perplexingly too small to accommodate all the grad students. It???s almost like they actually want to exclude the folks that fail to show up on time. Another benefit to being early is that you can also raid the last of the departmental coffee to fill your giant mug. It may not be good, but it???s free, right? Remember, the piggy bank sitting next to the machine is just for donations, right? Whatever. They don???t pay you enough anyways. You???ll take it all.DON???TBe late. If you???re late, there will be no spots left, and you???ll have to sit in the one of the stray chairs that did not fit around the too-small table. Here you???ll be forgotten, left to awkwardly chew your food and think about what you might do better in the future to manage your time. You might get called on to discuss your work, and you can apologize at this time for your lateness and say you were working on something SUPER important that took longer than you thought it would, but no one will be able to hear you. You are now an outsider. What was your name again? Do you even belong here? Who let you into grad school anyways? You may as well take your food and go, you cretin. I guess leaving is for the better, as you get the feeling that everyone makes fun of you behind your back. But look at the upside. If they are talking about you, that means they know your name.DOWhen the ritual going around the table to discuss your research projects commences, make sure you are not chewing/drinking/swallowing.DON???TTake a massive bite of food right as the person next to you finishes their turn. All eyes will be on you as you desperately and insufficiently masticate and swallow. The awkward silence, where the only sound is your jaw working, will feel like hours, and putting one finger in the air as if to say ???just a sec??? won???t make anything better. Once you do swallow without needing the Heimlich maneuver (and probably for the best, as you are surrounded by people that would likely skip the Heimlich and go straight to the tracheostomy) and begin to talk, you can most certainly bet that your teeth will be coated in food. You are gross.DOWhen it is your turn to talk, give a smile to show off your clean, food debris-free teeth and introduce yourself. Give a short, yet concise description of your work, but avoid speaking too quickly. This is actually good practice for the ???what do you study???? question that you will get now and forever. It is likely that the visiting speaker may ask some follow-up questions, and if you are worth your salt (and of course you are, because you are the shit) you will be prepared to answer.DON???TStart by mentioning where you are from, your experience growing up as a neglected child in a wealthy yet dysfunctional family, how you knew you were meant to rise above your peers the moment you were inspired to enter this line of research, and your pursuit of ending world hunger/curing AIDS/figuring out nuclear fission/curing cancer/publishing in Science, Nature, and Cell every year. The more you keep talking, the more likely it is that you will say something completely awkward. And the more awkward things you say, the more your mental state degrades. Eventually, you will lose all pretense and, like a possessed individual, start rambling about how your third dissertation project failed and your advisor has recently told you that there is no more funding left so write SOMETHING, call it a thesis, and GET OUT. It???s too bad when this happens, but your advisor is probably relieved because you are completely insufferable and he/she is looking forward to not having to deal with you after seven long years.DOListen intently as the visiting speaker discusses their program. Be sure to ask appropriate follow-up questions, especially if their work parallels your own. This is an excellent opportunity to talk to someone outside your own department, and to practice having mature adult conversations about science that are not with your advisor, who is a little too eager to play devil???s advocate, and while you know it???s a good exercise, it d",100
153,"oes get a little tiresome.DON???TPut your face an inch away from your plate and start rooting around like a pig, making it apparent that you are only here for the food and have no intention of making any conversation. The professor shouldn???t have to raise their voice to accommodate your sloppy open mouthed chewing sounds. The other students, although grossed out by your behavior, may secretly admire your DGAF attitude, but other students won???t be making or breaking your career.DOAsk the visiting speaker for advice on being a young scientist, and what you can do now to ensure that you are on the path to success. After all, the visiting speaker was once (and still might be!) a young scientist, and if the department saw worth in inviting her/him to give a talk, it means they are successful, right? Alternatively, you can ask for pointers on appropriate life/work balance. In doing this, you have an excuse to work into conversation the fact that you surf/do CrossFit/are a marathoner/play in a band and how you feel like it makes you a better scientist. After all, being a good graduate student is merely a job, and you are interested in Living with a capital L. You are different than all the rest of the lesser people around you, as your motto is to ???work smarter, not harder??? and therefore all your research will be brilliantly flawless. In the meanwhile, the poor muppets around you will struggle to churn out something mediocre that reeks of insecurity and bile.DON???TZone out. You might start looking around and thinking about your status among all of these folks. These are the people you hang out with, both during and after work. That means they are your friends, right?  Or, are they the only people you know since you don???t ever really get out at all? Come to think about it, there isn???t one person that you really like here. Maybe you should get out more often. You do need a hobby; maybe you can meet some people there? Preferably, your new hobby will involve physical activity, because you feel a little squishy. Perhaps you???ve been overindulging in too many free lunches. Anyways, this is not good because you can???t really afford any new clothes on a grad student stipend. Yup. You???re going to buy a membership for university gym today, and you are going to go work out every morning before you come into the lab. This will totally happen.DOGet back to work as soon as lunch adjourns. After all, you need to make sure your experiment du jour is at a stopping point so you can attend the seminar. This is a no brainer. If you attended the seminar lunch and got some delicious food out of it, for sure you would want to show up for the seminar itself, right?DON???TBe a postdoc, and still attend grad student lunches. Grad student lunches are for grad students, and you don???t belong there. The grad students seem to like you just fine, but they probably think you are a little weird. I mean, who spends five and a half years getting a PhD, then makes the conscious decision to keep working in the same department? This is where you plaster on a Cheshire Cat smile that says, WE ARE ALL MAD HERE. Anyways, you make a livable income and should be able to afford a decent lunch. If you really must experience ???free??? food, then know that there are almost always leftovers. But be sure you stop by right when the hour is over; you???ll want to beat the grad student who thought it would be a good life choice to support three kids and a spouse on a grad student stipend.10. ???We Didn???t Start the Fire???9. ???You Picked a Real Bad Time???8. ???Only the Good Die Young??????7. ???You May Be Right??????6. ???Don???t Ask Me Why??????5. ???Say Goodbye to Hollywood??????4. ???An Innocent Man??????3. ???Ain???t No Crime??????2. ???And So It Goes??????1. ???I Go to Extremes???Thanks again to everyone for meeting before the park opens today. For those of you who don???t know, I am Mr. Scott, owner of The Funtastic Fun Zone and your employer. Also, for those of you who don???t know, for the last ten years I???ve been claiming this theme park was an old folks home on my taxes. Don???t feel bad if you didn???t know that. Nobody should know that, least of all the IRS who will be visiting today to verify my decade long claim.That???s why today The Funtastic Fun Zone will become Shady Grove: An Assisted Living Fun Zone. Grant???s repainting the sign out front as I speak, and, like Grant, you???ll all be taking part in making this park look like a passable old folks home so I don???t get audited. I???m not 100% sure what being audited entails, but from what I???ve read online, it???s not funtastic.That means you ticket takers at the entrance gates have a new rule to enforce. Of course, you still can???t get into the park if you aren???t wearing shoes or a shirt, or if you???re wearing too many shoes or shirts, but for today you also can???t get into the park if you???re younger than 65. Check IDs, folks. If an IRS worker sees a bunch of kids and people who aren???t about to die walking around, they???ll know right away this isn???t a nursing home and there go my tax breaks.And if my tax breaks go, so do your lunch breaks. I understand that???s not fair, but I???ve got a business to keep profitable. You know how hard it is to make money running a legitimate theme park? That???s not a rhetorical question. I???d genuinely like to know, since financially speaking, nothing about The Funtastic Fun Zone is legitimate.That reminds me, if any of the IRS agents ask, you???re all interns on work-study programs from Tufts University. I???m aware that school is five states away, but the IRS isn???t.As for the rides, the roller coasters are now wheelchair ramps designed by eccentric construction workers. Nothing illegal about that. The log ride now becomes an automatic bathing machine for our retirees. If they ask where the soap is, just tell them it???s invisible. They can???t prove that it???s not. That???s the beauty of invisibility. The swings are how we dry our residents off after the log ride, hence the lack of towels.I couldn???t think of a way to explain the haunted castle ride, so Grant???s gonna just cover that with a giant tarp. If the tarp gets brought up by one of these tax jockeys, just say you don???t know what ???tarp??? means and aren???t sure if that???s a real word. They should get self-conscience about perhaps using the wrong word and they???ll move on. They???re numbers people, not words people.For anyone running a game booth, some small changes for today. All games will be bingo and all prizes will be nothing.If you???re working concessions, please serve everything in the old pill containers you???ll find in your booths. Yes, I know it will be hard to shove an entire funnel cake into a pill container, but find a way to make it work. Grant went to pharmacy school for a few weeks, so he should be able to help you out.Alright, that should be everything you need to know. If we all work together the IRS won???t suspect a thing and we can go back to being a theme park tomorrow.Oh, but on Friday my investors will be stopping by and we have to make this place look like a winery.Don???t worry. I???ve ordered a bunch of tarps.Pride and Systemic PrejudiceThe Unbearable Lightness of Those Who Self-Identify as BeingThe Sun Also Rises UpMoby [Trigger Warning] DickLove in the Time of a Common Yet STILL Stigmatized DiseaseOf Consensual Human BondageWar and the Need for Self-CarePortnoy???s Valid ComplaintGulliver???s VoluntourismFreed Nipple LunchLes Liasons ProblematiqueThe Man Who Would Be King Thus Perpetuating Deeply Embedded and Harmful Notions of Class and Gendered PrivilegeThe ???Good???

She was in Seattle visiting her former college roommate Taryn. ???She???s easy to talk to and super nice,??? said Lauran. The city was largely unfamiliar to Lauran, and she and Taryn spent a couple fun days exploring. ???We hung out. We went to the market. We ate donuts,??? she said. ???We went to bars and stuff.??? On Saturday, one night before the shooting, Lauran and Taryn had a bizarre encounter with a hostile stranger, but ???that was back when everyone was saying YOLO, and we had that mentality, like: I survived, I can do whatever.???The women had gone to a bar and met two guys. ???We???d had quite a few drinks, and they were all like, ???You should come back to our place,??? and we were like, ???OK, whatever.??? We went with the guys to a townhome. The guy who invited us barely knew the guy that lived there. We didn???t realize that until we got there. The guy that lived there was i",100
155,"nsane. He came out, and he was like, ???Why are you in my space. I don???t even know you. What are you doing here.??? He was big and buff and he was getting really angry. We did not want to get on his bad side. He almost beat up one of the guys we???d come with, so that guy left. We had no idea where he went. Taryn and I were like, ???We gotta get outta here.??????After they left the townhome, they faced a new set of problems. They were lost, for instance, it was late, they had no car. Their friend was missing, and it seemed there was nothing to do but wander the identical-looking streets in search of him. Suddenly, a pizza-delivery man pulled up. ???He???d been to the same townhome. He???d done a delivery there, and he must???ve seen us leaving or whatever. He was like, ???That guy was crazy. Do you need a ride???? and we???re like, ???Oh my gosh. Yes. We don???t even know where we are right now,?????? said Lauran. The pizza man even helped find their missing friend, and then he brought them all to his pizza place. From there, everyone made it home easily.The next day, the women filled their schedule with deliberately mellow activities. ???We didn???t have any plans, and that was fine. The whole night started out with me and Taryn literally eating ice cream and watching Girls. Then Taryn???s friend Laura     called and was like, ???You should come out with us,?????? and so Taryn and Lauran went to Laura???s apartment, where they socialized with Laura???s many guests. When nighttime approached, Lauran and several other women walked to the Twilight Exit in a group. Lauran was delighted to encounter the bouncer Greg when she entered the building. She???d met him the night before, where he was working security at a different bar. ???It was like, I know that man. Seriously???what are the chances. One of the girls we were with had a weird picture on her ID or something, and that???s how we made the connection. When he saw it he said, ???Oh my gosh, you guys are the same ones from before.??? We were totally like, ???We???re your best friends now!?????? said Lauran.Lauran and her group assembled in the dining area. ???We literally got there like five or ten minutes before everything happened. We???d just sat down at a giant table, a little bit inside the door. We were chatting, waiting for some other friends to get there. We hadn???t made any decisions about food or looked at drinks or ordered or anything. I didn???t even take my coat off,??? she said. When James shot Greg in the alleyway just outside the building, Lauran heard a popping sound she assumed at first was a balloon. Shortly after, a girl came in screaming. Everybody freaked out. It was all downhill from there. I remember seeing the guy come in with the gun in his hand and he literally just walked straight ahead to the bar. He didn???t even look left or right. You could tell he was on a mission. He had a plan. I had no clue who he was. I thought he was just some crazy dude coming in. I thought, ???Oh my gosh. This is probably a mass shooting.?????????Everybody was screaming and diving on the floor. People started moving tables and chairs, throwing them over and stuff. It was definitely the scaredest I???ve ever been. I had this feeling, like, ???I don???t want to see what???s happening, I don???t want to see it coming, I don???t want to look at it straight on.??? I got on the floor behind a table. I made myself get still. It???s like when you???re playing hide-and-seek, and you???re being as still as you can. You revert to things from childhood. You don???t know what else to do, so you hide your face. It???s like???if you shut your eyes, then no one can see you,??? she said. ???My head was down on the ground, my hands were up over my head. I was telling myself, ???Stay down. Oh shit. Don???t let him see you.??? I was crouched into fetal position. You know, I could???ve been in the middle of the room with a spotlight on me. I didn???t know any better,??? said Lauran.???People were screaming to call 911. I???m obviously a bad person in these things because I didn???t reach for my phone. That???s something I feel a little guilty about. What if nobody else called 911, and I was supposed to call, but I didn???t. I didn???t even try. I didn???t even try to, like, call for help. I was more concerned about not moving. I was paralyzed, so I was not even going to help anybody. My thought was, ???Clearly other people are calling, and I???m sure someone???s got it under control.??? That was the only time where I could???ve done something to stop it, but I was like, ???I???m just gonna worry about myself right now,?????? she said.As Lauran huddled in the dining area, ???I remember hearing another one or two gunshots and not knowing where he was or what he was shooting. Then it was quiet for a second. Then I was like, ???I gotta do something. I can???t just stay here.??? I finally got the courage to look up. The furniture must???ve gotten pushed out of the way when everyone else was leaving. There were no tables, no chairs around me. I was out in the open. I was so exposed. I???d been trying to hide even though I wasn???t hidden at all.??????Getting out was a blur,??? she said. ???That was my first time in the bar. The building had a weird shape. All I knew was the one door we???d come in through, and there was no way I was going in that direction. I didn???t want him to see me. Some girl behind me???I don???t even know who???she was like, ???There???s a door back there.??? I crawled all the way to it. You wouldn???t have even known there was a door where it was. It just looked like a wall of windows,??? said Lauran. ???As soon as I hit the pavement, I got up and Taryn was there and we started running.1 She turned to me and was like, ???Oh my gosh, you???re bleeding.??? In the whole insanity, I got a busted lip. I don???t remember exactly how. Probably from a kick or a chair or something. People were literally climbing over me, trying to get out of there. My lip was bleeding. It was pretty gross actually.???As the pair ran away, ???we didn???t feel safe. We didn???t know the situation. We didn???t know if he had more people with him that were gonna shoot us outside. I had no clue what was going on or where I was. I wasn???t sure where we were going. I tried to turn and run down a side street so I???d be less exposed, but Taryn shouted to keep running straight,??? said Lauran. She and Taryn continued to Laura???s place, which was only a couple blocks away. ???I remember getting there and hearing more gunfire. We all looked at each other like, ???Oh my gosh.??? I just assumed it was the cops going in,??? said Lauran. I asked whether she felt the police responded fairly. ???I wasn???t there, so I can???t be like, ???They totally did the right thing.??? I can???t get in on this feeling,??? she said.At Laura???s apartment, Taryn and Lauran shared the space with multiple guests. Everyone stayed up late, the mood was somber. Lauran ate a bowl of ice cream a neighbor brought over. When it was time for bed, ???I got the couch. I barely slept at all. I spent half the night awake, texting my friends from home. I was going over it again and again. I wasn???t sure how it had ended, what his motive was. Not knowing that stuff gives you a sense of insecurity. Like, you feel unsafe. I was terrified the whole night,??? she said. The more Lauran thought about James, she reconsidered his intentions. ???I???d watched him walk straight towards the bar. At first I was thinking he was gonna be, like, ???I???ll take care of these people first, then I???m gonna come over here.??? But after being in the dining room so long???even if it wasn???t rea",100
156,"lly that long, but it felt like it was???I didn???t have a sense he was gonna be shooting everyone. If that???s what he wanted, he would???ve started as soon as he opened the door. I think that???s what typically happens,??? she said.The next day, Taryn and Lauran went to brunch with Laura and her friends, and later on, Lauran returned to Colorado as scheduled. ???The fact that I didn???t live in Seattle helped me a lot. I could get on a plane and act like it never happened. No one here knew about it, no one here talked about it. I didn???t see it on the news. It wasn???t in my daily life. It affected me, but it was a lot easier for me to come back and push it away and slowly forget about it,??? she said. As more time passed, Lauran furthered her recovery by consulting a therapist and speaking openly to friends. ???I???m in a good place with it. It still brings up emotions, but I can talk about it and feel OK. I???ve learned to enjoy my family more and cherish the time I have with people. It makes you live your life differently. Any minute something could happen that you had no clue was gonna happen.???Today Lauran works in a mall as the manager of an OshKosh B???Gosh, a kids wear retail outlet. She enjoys the job, but the setting can trigger anxieties. ???We???re right in the food court, in the busiest area. Mall security said it???s the most local place if there???s a mall shooting.2 I do notice I???m a little more on edge if I hear a scream or people running. I???ll turn and look,??? she said. ???One day security was talking to us about how we should handle a shooting if it happens???like, where it???d probably be, where we should go, what we should do. I was like, ???You can guarantee I???ll be out the back door. I???ll be no help at all.??? I got a small glimpse of myself in the situation. People aren???t able to think clearly. They freak out and turn around and try to get away. You don???t know how you???re gonna react until you experience it.???- -1 	Taryn described Lauran in these moments. ???She was in boots with really high heels. They made her look tall and spindly,??? said Taryn, lovingly. ???She literally looked like a deer that???d been in a car accident.???2 Speaking of, my friend Alithea was present during a 2008 mall shooting in Westfield Southcenter in Tukwila, Washington. She was around 23 at the time and worked at an Urban Outfitters in a different location. ???It was a weird day. I was meeting with my aunt and my cousin to talk about whether or not I was going to cut off communication with my dad who was a drug addict. We had this super intense conversation in the Rainforest Cafe, which was already weird. Then we went to Forever 21 so I could buy some leggings,??? she said. As Alithea was making her purchase at the counter, shots sounded in the main mall corridor just outside the store???s entrance.???I dropped my change and leggings and immediately got on the ground. I knew it was gunfire. My aunt and cousin were standing and looking around, trying to figure out what was going on, so I yelled at them to get down. The employee ringing me up went running to the front of the store, then she pulled down the roll-up gate that separated us from the corridor. I often think about that girl. She ran towards the shooting and the chaos so she could keep others safe,??? she said. ???The staff shuffled me and the other customers into the main dressing-room area. A pregnant lady started having a panic attack or hyperventilating, and one of the managers tended to her. We were guided to the upper level of the store. Upstairs, everything was normal. People were still shopping,??? Alithea said.Later, ???they didn???t find the shooter for a while, and that was one of the scariest things about it. He just disappeared. I heard he was spotted on a bus, so as I was riding the bus the next day, I kept looking over my shoulder. I???d never seen the shooter. I didn???t even know what I was looking for.???""A quick glance, barely enough to make eye contact:You???re an introvert.

I???m still human!??? His favorite place to walk is the Brooklyn waterfront.  ???The creation of Brooklyn Bridge Park is one of the great urban achievements of the past fifty years.???  Aquaman, 95 but immortal, splits his time between Washington, D.C. and his Upper West Side walk-up, where he lives alone.Wait, Do Fish Sleep?Just to be clear, I???m not actually a fish.  So, yes, I sleep.  Just like every other human being.Early RiserBeing a superhero isn???t a 9-to-5 type job. It???s a way of life.  I???m up by 6, 6:30 am. But I???m always ready to help save humanity, provided the danger resides in the water.  I???m more of a saltwater guy, but if trouble arises in a river or lake, I???m on it.  To be honest, I hate the way the bottom of the lake feels on my feet.  It???s gross.CrackBerryI admit it.  I???m addicted to my BlackBerry.  First thing I reach for in the morning is my phone. I check to see if one of the Justice Leaguers texted or called.  Typically, I don???t have any messages, but it???s better to be safe than sorry.Fish FoodBreakfast is usually pretty light.  Even immortals need to be sensible. I prefer the savory over the sweet.  My Sunday breakfast is a serving of sardines on toast. Ironic, I know, but I???m addicted to them.  So briny.  It???s my one guilty pleasure.Office Check InYou can???t just turn off being a superhero.  After breakfast I???ll send a group text to the Justice League and see what???s going on.  Sometimes it takes a long time for someone to reply, so I might send two or three follow ups. Everyone is so busy these days.Rivalry with Black MantaDon???t believe a lot of what you read.

Our routine is to meet up for brunch on Sundays.  I???m on the Upper West Side, he???s in Battery Park.  We usually meet at Buvette for their steamed eggs. A-mazing.Pop In to the OfficeOne of the benefits of superpowers is the ability to travel a great distance in a short time. If I haven???t heard back from the Justice League, I???ll swim down to Washington and head to the office. Usually only takes me 40 minutes or so in the water.  If only the Acela was so quick, am I right?Batman, the JokerSometimes I???ll arrive at the Hall of the Justice League and the doors will be locked from the inside. So I???ll knock for twenty minutes or so before they let me in.  It never gets old.  No one takes credit, but I know it???s Batman.  Behind that cowl is a practical joker.  Don???t let the grunts and the ???Dark Knight???-schtick fool you.A Watched Trouble Alert Never SoundsThe Trouble Alert notifies us whenever a crime is being committed or an alien lifeforce attempts to take over Earth.  I usually sit right in front of the console, so I???m the first to hear the alarm. The reality is most of the crimes take place on land, which, to be honest, isn???t my specialty. Superman or Batman typically takes care of it all.  But I???m ready.  Semper Vigilans.Counting BoatsAfter knocking around the Hall for a few hours ??? playing Minesweeper or Solitaire ??? Superman or Batman usually finds a job for me to do. Sometimes I don???t see how it stops crime, but who am I to argue with those two?  They think so far ahead, so far outside the box, it???s scary. A typical job might be, ???Count every boat on the Atlantic Ocean.???  That???s a job that screams ???Aquaman!???Heading Home and Turning OffAbe Sapien, Iceman, Hydroman, and I all like to meet up on Sunday nights to have a drink and catch some music. Maybe the Mercury Lounge or Don Pedros or wherever.  We grab some food, talk shop and unwind before we save the world all over again.Dear Like-Minded Mom,Thank the lord for you, bright angel.Before you walked in, I had no one to talk to. I was watching Game of Thrones on my cell phone and angling the screen away from the slide so no children could catch a glimpse of Daenerys Targaryen???s sideboob.You were immediately my heroine; with your bright blue leggings and copy of The Bell Jar. I thought I was the only one who read Sylvia Plath while eating McChicken. I said this to you, and you laughed, and I thought, FUCKING YES, let???s talk about things! And for the rest of the evening we were like two bright asteroids burning in tandem across a dark sky.Most parents won???t even make eye contact as they yell for their children, tip milkshakes into their mouths, and force-feed them wilted, yellow fries. Finish them before you play, shouts the guilt-soaked parental chorus. It???s the one consistent rule we stick to here in hell.But my shame was erased and you made it okay to feed my kid trash on a Wednesday at six.We chatted and laughed as we drank our delicious (full sugar) sodas, as our wild banshee children howled and writhed along the bright plastic tubes that dangled dangerously below the ceiling. I was reminded of the old-testament followers of Moses who danced and tossed wreaths of flowers onto a golden cow-god and made him so mad.  Just as a modern-day Dionysus with a round belly and a Spongebob T-shirt raised a juice box towards the fluorescent lights, you looked at me and your eyes said:I???m also too exhausted to put a vegetable in the microwave, even ones that come in those sad plastic pouches, and I just can???t turn on the faucet over a sink-full of dishes tonight, and I  don???t want my children to melt from the inside out from chemical waste and animal fat, but isn???t this so easy? SO EASY?! There has to be a better way, to connect with our children and keep them alive and help their precious brains develop let them play, while also being productive adults and retaining our elusive identities. I want to read and travel and explore have a career and be a good mother and never have to walk through the doors of this place where a plastic Ronald McDonald waves at me with his frightening-yet-enticing sodium smile. There has to be something more.You aren???t the only one who feels this way. I???m with you.Then I wanted to touch your orange scarf. I think it was from Target.Do you want to come to my house in the afternoon some weekday and have sangria? I???ll make it in my kitchen and we can drink it out of My Little Pony tumblers and maybe watch Buster Keaton. We???ll exchange books of poems and get take-out falafel. But two drinks maximum, we aren???t fucking alcoholics.We can talk about literary implications of Sylvia???s suicide or reasonably priced summer camps or whatever.XOXO,Your New Best Friend Sarah1. ???I will win.

The main text, centered on the oversized pages, written in reasonably large, bold letters, is in a Hebrew-Aramaic combo sans diacritic marks. On either side and along the bottom, written in what has to be a six on the font scale, are the commentaries of Rashi, an eleventh-century French rabbi, who wrote in biblical Hebrew with some medieval French larded in, and the Tosafot, a compilation of the wit and wisdom of a group of rebbes who earned their medieval po-mo stripes by, among other things, commenting on Rashi???s commentary.The study of the Talmud was a singsong kabuki, the particulars of each tractate prefaced by the Gemara says spoken in Yiddish with as much gravitas as the little pubescent pischer called upon could crackle, with the entire meditation-disputation recited while wagging the right hand in a circular digging motion, thumb in hitchhiking position, which to the uninitiated might have looked as if the hand wagger suffered from some form of dyskinesia.To reach my rendezvous with this religious recitative, I had to yo-yo from Hell???s Kitchen down to the LES, during rush hour, in trains packed with women, all ages, all sizes, all ethnicities, but most especially Puerto Rican women, all of whom seemed to be wearing blouses that, to my horny eyes, strained to contain their curvaceous, heaving titties and wearing skirts that barely corralled their wide, wondrous hips and their tight, tight tushies.While Rebbe Akiva and Rabbi Yochanan were advocating their legal take on what was to be done in the event one happens upon the carcass of a neighbor???s cow, said carcass situated half on the neighbor???s pasture and half on the public road, I was trying to figure out what was going on inside my pants as I relived an accidental frottagistic encounter with a woman???s generous, firm yet yielding ass as I???d squirmed off the A train at West Fourth that very morning.How could I be judged, found wanting, if this Talmudic song and dance became the soundtrack to my vibrant fantasies? As the year went along, I found myself musing more and more, listening less and less, desiring, needing, demanding the addition of visual stimuli to augment my fantastic memories.I started small. Literally. My first engagements with gyno-cheesecake were the passport-size likenesses of showgirls that were a daily feature of Earl Wilson???s syndica",100
159,"ted gossip column ???It Happened Last Night,??? which, along with Larry Merchant???s column, was my go-to read in the yid-lib rag of choice, Dorothy Schiff???s New York Post. I would excuse myself from the daily gathering of the nukes for the invariable dinnertime Roumanian tenderloin gooble-gobble and hit the head, sit myself down on the porcelain throne, and there share an intimate moment with the peroxide blond heartthrob du jour.But as with any drug, a tolerance is reached, and you then have to amp up the dose. Coming home, I began to stay on the D all the way to the Deuce and Sixth, hightail it into the store I got my comics from, and nonchalant my way to the tittie mag section situated over by the elevated counter on the right, the crow???s nest from which the proprietor could keep an eye on his sketchy customers, especially the ones peeping through his used t&a zines.I loved walking into the store, breathing in the rich moldy smell of paper stacked on the dusty shelves or tied in bundles along the floor. I tingled with anticipation at what treasures I might uncover there???an Aquaman wholly devoted to the political machinations of the underwater empire of Atlantis; an exotic adventure in a faraway involving Uncle Scrooge, the Junior Woodchucks, Unca Donald, and the Beagle Boys; or, in the greatest of all possible worlds, an original Mad EC with the cover still intact.But over by the nudies the smell of mold was overwhelmed by the stink of flop sweat and farts as adult males pulled, pawed, and perused the merchandise, each one so lost in his world of erotic wonder he had lost track of what his body was doing.I had, as with most things, a complicated, confused, ambivalent kiddie response to this world I had injected myself into. Guilty Rob-it kept his head low so???s he just might get to ogle the oompas, maybe even get his mitts on a piece of the merch, riffle through it, descend into the valley of the va-va vooms, all without bringing attention to his chubby, underaged, overstimulated self; guilty Rob-it vibrated with fear and self-loathing, knowing he didn???t belong in this cloacal Taj Mahal of mammaries, expecting that at any nano he would be discovered and expelled from his garden of boobies.However, the more meditative, Talmudic Rob-it had the opposite reaction to the circus of ta-ta peeper prurience he was witness to. Rabbi Rob-it understood on a molecular level that for him this was the right time and this was the right place to be, because at this particular moment in the space-time continuum it had become his life???s mission (impossible as it may have seemed) to understand the powerful force that had taken hold of him, had him living in a pheremonal fog, weighed down by a perma-hardon that necessitated his hunching his way through the world. This Rob-it, a defiant, self-righteous Rob-it, was equally convinced that even though he was the one who was as inconspicuous as a tarantula on a piece of angel food cake,3  it was these grown men, some of whom might well have been the same age as his slavo-depresso dad, who were the ones truly out of place.Just as my voyages through Jugs Jungle were becoming untenable, Dame Fortune spritzed some serendipity juice on me: the couple next door to the parental lair, having become completely unhinged, asked me to watch over their spawn while they escaped to a gulp-and-gabble with some friends long upon a Saturday night.Since I was a lonely, shy, and asocial Rob-it and therefore had nothing better to do, I jumped on this golden opportunity to watch Hockey Night in Canada4  and Chiller Theater as far as my shamefully dependent ass could get from the prying and disapproving augen of the father-mother.Once the neighbor kid was deep into his REM cycle, I settled into the den, a manly affair smelling of pipe smoke. It featured wraparound built-in bookshelves along all the non-windowed walls and was equipped with both a luxurious, engulfing leather recliner and a color TV. I turned the tube on, tuned in to channel 9, and started watching Bathgate, the Gumper, and the rest of the Broadway Blues get their ass kicked at the hands of les Habitants, Win Elliott painting the word picture like the great play-by-play benshi5  that he was.When the score hit three-zip my attention began to wander. I started checking out my employer???s library. There were best sellers by yid scribes like Leon Urinal, Irwin I???m-So-Shaw, and Jerome Why-man, an Encyclopedia Americana (this was the time of love-it-or-leave-it in Amurrica), volumes of vocational boosh-wah, and Life Magazine photo compilations themed around historical shit like wars, depressions, and commies. Boring. Just as I began considering a return to the massacre-on-ice, my eyes caught hold of a stack of zines stuffed into a bottom corner of one of the bookshelves. My boob radar started pinging like a motherfucker. I needed to check this out. I pulled out the top one???it was a Playboy. A Playboy!!! I then began to yank out one magazine after another. They were all fucking Playboys.You have to understand, nothing like this had ever happened to me. I was experiencing what until then I had only heard about from kids that I wished I could be; the universe had finally allowed me to understand what being lucky felt like. Spread out before me was a treasure trove of the sine qua non of skin mags. Enough to keep me busy for months. Suddenly I loved this job. And just as suddenly panic overtook me like a cheetah would a hobbled wildebeest. It would be just my luck if I were to have been given this tantalizing peek into nay-nay nirvana only to leave and not be invited back again. I couldn???t let that happen. And so when my employers returned, I ??ber Eddie-Haskelled6  them in the hopes they would have me back.I spent the week thinking about this cornucopia of cooze so near, yet so far away. By Thursday I was convinced that it had all been a cosmic cocktease. But that Friday, upon returning home from the sabbath eve half-day study of the begats and the Thou-Shalt-Nots, the womb gave me the good news???Mr. and Mrs. Ta-Ta and Nay-Nay planned another scarf-and-schmooze and wanted me to watch over their little darlin??? again.On the appointed eve, after Ma and Pa Playboy split, I couldn???t wait for the kid to nod out, got annoyed when he resisted greeting the sandman, was relieved when he finally sacked out and left me free to explore the boobtacular repository I heard singing to me like a siren from the den.I grabbed myself a zine, March 1960, and immediately opened it up to the centerfold, a (literally) breathtaking pictorial of a big-breasted blonde going by the name Sally Sarell. Sally stood before an easel, a beret on her head, her tits oozing out of a paint-splattered smock. It was a portrait of the artist as Rob-it???s wet dream. As I began a study of the pictures, my cheeks flushed and my temperature rose, as did my Hebrew National.Just as I was about to explode, I was yanked out of my erotic reverie by a shuffling approaching from where the spawn should have been slumbering. I got up, tucked myself in, and arrived just in time to witness the seedling marking his territory, spraying the parental night table with a golden shower before somnambulating his way back to bed. I looked at the puddle of pee but my attention went into deficit. I couldn???t stop thinking of Sally in the other room. I so wanted to be with my bare-breasted Georgia O???Keefe that I left the tinkle pooling on the table???s Formica top, drip, drip, dripping onto the parquet floor, figuring I???d get to it later, after my communion with Sally came to a climax. I re-nestled myself within the womblike embrace of the l",100
160,"eather recliner and resumed the contemplation of Sally.After Sally had squeezed my lemons till the juice ran down my leg, I eschewed Chiller Theater, where crab monsters were planning their attack on the scout troop of schlimazel scientists wandering around their irradiated atoll, in favor of further investigation into Sally???s edition of high-class nudie entertainment for men. In accord with the commonplace???I read it for the articles???I turned my hymnal to the table of contents, studied it like maybe I gave a shit and was not just ki??ling time before I could revisit my afflatus with renewed vigor, and noted a short story by Ian Fleming, whose Bond books I knew from the Book Bar in the Port Authority Bus Terminal, the inventory of which I would peruse on my way home from rabbinical vocational training in order to buy a precious few minutes before once again having to suck in the toxic atmosphere of La Casa de Schneider.Reading was, for me, a chore, one that would often reward the doing of it with a heavy-duty headache for which I would drop a couple of extra-strength Excedrin and wait the ache out, having learned already at the tender age of bar-mitzvah-hood the basic drive behind all drug taking, the drive which a future Excedrin TV ad would aphorize: It???s beautiful when the pain stops.In order to mitigate brain-pain without the aid of an over-the-counter analgesic, I developed a reading strategy: I would skim???surf some words, skip others???content in the knowledge that I would inevitably forget whatever it is I read or skimmed or skipped as soon as I put the book, or in this case the magazine, down. But as I began reading Fleming???s short story, one word led to another and before I could stop myself, before I could fall back on skim and skip, a full sentence had articulated itself before my eyes, had reached out from the page, had grabbed me by the throat and begun to throttle me. A man who cannot whistle is a latent homosexual.And wouldn???t you know it, I was that man/boy what couldn???t whistle.??????From the moment I first heard Joey Riesueno say it, then tell us what it meant, I knew that my parentals were determined to fashion me into a homo. The evidence was overwhelming. I had had two girlfriends when I lived on the LES. My mother had disposed of both of them. And for the flimsiest of reasons. My first gyno-friend was, by accident of birth, Puerto Rican, with a barmaid for a mother, who had, one cloudy Shabbos morn, accompanied her pal Rob-it to his house of worship: a sin for which she was chased, and he gulaged. My next had been a member of the tribe. But when Mom, the hard-boiled dick, discovered the both of us in our birthday suits, in a bathtub, carefree and giddy, applying temporary tattoos to each other???s nethers, all she could see was a little Lilith corrupting the fruit of her womb and so banished her from my life. This was my Garden of Eden moment, the blossoming of my shame. Soon after, I was exiled from the Garden to Goyville???Schmatta Alley on the downtown side of the Deuce???where I found no kids of either gender. Clearly Seed and Egg had hermitized me in order to more easily mold me into a homo.??????Clearly, my parents had made sure that I could not whistle, which???tautologically, I???ll grant you???proved my case against them. But as panic gave way to confusion I tried to inject rational thinking into the formation of my reaction to the nuclear sentence that had knocked me for a loop. It was then I began to muse on the paradox implicit in my experience during the previous half hour, for it had been my obsession with the female form, generated by my burden of the eternal boner, that had fueled my gaze quest and resulted in the fortuitous discovery of the Playboy motherlode, which, ironically, also proved to be my generic undoing.  How could one person be both incapable of whistling and yet fully able to (singlehandedly) consummate to the pert tits and ass of Miss March? This was a problem of Cartesian proportions; that disconnect between what my brain had deduced about my parentals??? disposition toward my sexual identity and how my body reacted to external physical and visual stimuli made me a poster child for the mind/body split, an animated incarnation of the Platonic form of duality.I was at this point so engrossed in my masturbatory metaphysics that I didn???t hear the return of the partying parents, who walked in on me with the offending Playboy splayed across my lap and a dazed look on my face. If that wasn???t enough, in my tumult I had completely forgotten about the sleepwalking bubbeleh???s deposit on their end table.I wasn???t going to be invited back there again.- - -1   Which dogs me like a hellhound on my trail. The OP, who loves her some Nova-type TV shit about the nature, structure, and origins of the universe, recently showed me an article in the Times Sunday Review on quantum entanglement, the theory of which is that said universe is populated with twin-paired particles separated at birth that now exist vast light years apart, but if you put any kind of spin on one twin, the other will spin in just the same way at just the same time, no matter how many galaxies long ago and far away it is from its mate; if this is a true-that theorem, then there are things in this universe that can move faster than the speed of light, which has some apparent deep implications for anyone who understands whatever the fuck it is I just wrote. Well, ever since quantum entanglement was proposed in an obscure egghead journal in the ???50s, physicists have been trying to prove the truth of it, with some seeming success except for the possibility???and here???s where the free will/determinist hoo-hah takes hold???that the settings on the detectors they???re using to prove the entanglement are subject to the settings-independence loophole: were they selected freely or were they the result of some unknown and predetermined causal mechanism that puts the whole experiment into question? A mechanism that would enable certain alternative theories to mimic the famous predictions from quantum theory and would make any attempt at proving quantum entanglement (and pretty much anything else, I suppose) a hopeless task.2 In the ???70s there was an oddly poignant, subversive (in only the best way) commercial for Mazola Margarine that could have been written by a Madison Avenue acolyte of Howard Zinn in which a beautiful squaw emerges from a corn field, shucks an ear of corn, and speaks mournfully: You call it corn, we called it maize. (Note the past tense.) We knew all about the goodness of maize, corn, before America was America.3 On the opening page of Farewell, My Lovely Chandler describes Moose Malloy as a big man but not more than six feet five inches tall and not wider than a beer truck and then, after detailing Malloy???s astounding, pimp-like getup???a shaggy borsalino, a couple of colored feathers tucked into the band, a rough gray sports coat with white golf balls for buttons, a brilliant yellow show handkerchief cascading out of the breast pocket, a brown shirt, a tie as yellow as the hanky, pleated gray flannel slacks, and alligator shoes with white explosions on the toes???he then asserts that even on one of the mixed blocks of Central Ave., he looked about as inconspicuous as a tarantula on a slice of angel food.4 Since I believed I was different, by which I mean better, than my peers, I cobbled together an identity that set me apart from them, one component of which was developing a love for Ice Hockey which none of the others listened to or watched. It didn???t hurt that players had names like Elmer ???Moose??? Vasko, Eric Neste",100
161,"renko, and Maurice ???the Rocket??? Richard and his baby brother, Henri ???the Pocket Rocket??? Richard, or that the most famous Canadian play-by-play guy, the voice of the Toronto Maple Leafs, went by the name Fosdick Hewitt, his first named spelled like the last name of the Al Capp???s Dick Tracy parody Fearless Fosdick. (And if there could be a footnote to a footnote this one would read???I only recently, and by recently I mean the last few days, learned that Hewitt???s first name was Foster, not Fosdick, a truly disappointing discovery.)5 During the silent movie era in Japan, the benshi were film bards charged with sitting in the rear of the theater and narrating the action while coincidentally explaining the conventions of the photoplays being peeped by the reverent but clueless audience. (For instance, when a gaijin western was sent fresh from the dream factory, the protags were distinguished by the benshi not by their white hat or black hat but by being assigned signatory names???Jim for the good guy and Bob for the bad guy, a fact that rankled because I learned it during a long falling-out with My Friend the Film Critic, whose first name was Jim. Being a superstitious, easily spooked neuron, I assumed the universe was using this cine-factoid to clue me in as to who was right and who wrong in the argument that was going on mainly inside my sick, thick head.) The benshi became so popular that, in a defining act of the po-mo sensibility, when the movie began the audience would often turn their seats around en masse and face the back of the theater, interested more in what the benshi said about the movie than in the movie itself.6 Leave It to Beaver, an Amurrican family-centric sitcom (1957-1963), featured, as a semi-recurring character, Beaver???s big bro???s best bud, Eddie Haskell. When Eddie faced authority figures, you could practically see his nose turn brown on screen as he acted the way writers imagined a two-faced teen might in the company of adults???he projected a super-sized serving of suburban teen sycophancy. But when the authority figures dematerialized, the real Eddie came out to play. Freed from the shackles of self-serving slavishness, the gleeful Eddie presented bad boy (albeit a homogenized, safe-for-sitcom, ofay bad boy, a toothless JD the audience could laugh at but never feel threatened by). Breakfast. Breakfast stands alone. Breakfast is the most important meal of the day. It is the meal that fuels you for everything you encounter, that gets you ready for those important meetings. First thing in the morning, sit down and eat a bunch of eggs, and you will be able to tackle the day with confidence. You???ll be able to lean in to those who stand in your way and whisper softly in their ear, ???my stomach is filled with eggs.??? Their eyes will widen. They will not have realized that you have come prepared.Walk into work. Can you even call it work? You???re so good at what you do that THEY should be paying YOU to work, which, in actuality, is how all jobs work. But don???t let that stop you. You???ve eaten a big bowl of oatmeal. Oatmeal: The meal with ???meal??? in its name, so that if you weren???t sure that it???s a meal, well fuck, it says it in the name. OAT. MEAL. You???re raring to go. Walk up to that office building and present your ID and smile at the security guard. You smile, because you ???get??? each other: just two dudes, working their jobs, fueled by the immense power of breakfast. He says there is a problem with your identification, but before he can explain you???ve already hurdled over the turnstile and hopped on an elevator.The elevator. A tiny box of people, waiting to be shuttled to their jobs. They all look so sad, so unwilling to start their days. If only they???d eaten a good, solid breakfast, as you had. If only one other person in this flying box had taken the time to sit down with a couple pancakes (or ???flapjacks??? as they???re known to weirdos), some butter, and a bottle of syrup, then they would be as prepared as you are. Look at this person. He seems so sleepy, so woefully unready, and so ready to die. He, and everyone else in the elevator, is moving away from you, either because they can feel the power of breakfast radiate from every pore in your being or because they heard you say the phrase ???woefully unready and so ready to die??? out loud, which you didn???t mean to do, but you did it, it happened, move on, look, this is your floor.The Star Trek doors of the elevator open up to your little village, your tribe. People look up as you enter. Some raise their eyebrows in surprise, others look back down quickly to their work. What a bunch of idiot goblins, probably starving, just trying to get by on any energy left over from the stupid dinner they ate last night. But not you. You have new energy, recent energy. You ate breakfast. Corn flakes. You???ve started your day with a bowl of corn flakes. You know, from the Wikipedia article you read about corn flakes, that they were invented by Dr. John Harvey Kellogg to help curb masturbation, but this morning, they???ve clearly failed. Twice.You close the door to your office. It is empty, save a desk, a bulletin board, and a computer you can???t seem to log in to. You pound on the keys, screaming with all the power that you gained from that tiny glass of orange juice enjoyed as part of a complete breakfast. The computer is a dumb machine, unlike you, a smart machine of power. The computer will lose, and you will win. The computer just has a slow idiotic IV drip of electricity to power it, but you have the MOST IMPORTANT MEAL OF THE DAY. You accidentally break the keyboard in your frustration. You forgot that you have all the strength of someone who has eaten toast this morning.Your boss enters, if you can call her that, which apparently you can???t anymore, according to her. She is pointing calmly at the door, and you respond by very wittily pointing to your stomach and shouting about the grapefruit you ate, which you did not enjoy eating (grapefruit is technically neither a grape nor a fruit, it is just a round container of gross pulp, a fleshy sphere of garbage), but you have seen enough old movies where rich people eat grapefruit in bed to know that yes, it is this, grapefruit is the key, grapefruit is the miracle breakfast that makes rich people rich.You feel bloated. Your boss is calling someone on her stupid phone. Why did you eat so much breakfast? Eggs, oatmeal, pancakes, corn flakes, toast, grapefruit, sausage, French toast, a glass of lukewarm hollandaise sauce, some Lucky Charms, and a waffle. You???re going to puke. You can feel it. At any second, all your hard-earned breakfast will force its way back out of you, into the world from which it came. This was too much power for one person. It is uncontrollable. You are reminded of the end of Akira, bloated with unbelievable power, and you shout ???TETSUO!!!??? as you vomit, but you immediately second-guess: should you have yelled ???KANEDA!!!?????? Which one was the one who absorbed so much power he exploded? You should have yelled the other name. Look at all this breakfast: on your suit, on the floor, all gone to waste.The security guards say you can do this the easy way or the hard way, but no one ever got to be NUMBER ONE by doing things the easy way. They pull you out of the office, dragging you down the hallway back towards the elevator. Some people look up and shake their heads, some still keep their heads down, pushing themselves into their work. As they drag you. you struggle to open a package of Pop Tarts, shoving as much life-giving breakfast into your mouth as possible. Most of the Pop Tart crum",100
162,"bles during the jostling, leaving a trail of crumbs that you will be able to follow back to your office, if, for some reason, you forget the way to your office.But you won???t forget. It???s your office. It???s YOUR office.As you lay on the curb outside your office building, you look at the sun, imagining him holding two big fucking scoops of raisins, ready to pour those raisins right into your stomach.???Breakfast is the most important meal of the day,??? you whisper to yourself, as people step around you, on their way to work.Q: How did you learn to teach logrolling?A: I saw this New York Times article about a woman who taught logrolling and I cut it out and put it by my bedside. I thought about it for a good two months.I really just wanted to try it. To get on that log. It seemed so bizarre.So I contacted her ??? the owner of Key Log Rolling. I asked, ???Would you come to Pittsburgh? Or even Indiana? I have family there?????? But there weren???t any classes that were close. Finally I ended up taking a training workshop ??? it was a training so you could teach other people. I thought I couldn???t possibly teach other people. But I could!Q: So you drove to the training class? Sounds like you were really into it!A: Yeah. I???d watch videos of logrolling clubs at colleges and the girls were taking out the guys. I also saw video of Abby Hoeschler, the woman who trained me, and she was rolling against other professional female logrollers. I think men and women can do it equally well???Anyway, my friend and I went to Ohio.Q: How many people were there?A: There were five of us including the instructor. One was my friend and the other two were men.The men had bought the log and started trying it. They were young, really fit dudes who had started the program at their pool. They were super competitive.Q: So how did the class go? A: It was basically getting on the log, falling off the log. Getting on the log, falling off the log.Q: How do you get on?A: The safest way to get on is when you???re in water that???s a little less than waist deep.There are people holding the sides of the log. You wrap your legs around it like a horse then look at your partner and count to three. You???re facing each other at that point.Then you put your hands on the log and you pop up on the pads of your feet and you start moving immediately. If you stop you will fall off. After you pop up, you???re not facing each other.Q: I???m not sure I understand. What do you mean, you???re not facing each other?A: One person goes backwards and one goes forwards, and you try to trick the other person into falling off. You???re facing in opposite directions and you???re competing against the other person.You know like how in Dirty Dancing she is practicing in the woods? There on that fallen tree? The way she pops up is just like how you pop up. When I was in the class I was thinking, ???This is just like Jennifer Grey!???Q: This sounds like someone is going to get hurt.A: Not at all. If you think about it, you???re falling away from a rolling thing so your body clears it.Q: What if you get near the side of the pool?A: It is free-floating. The only scary thing is that you always keep it perpendicular to the side of the pool. When we were on it, it didn???t move much, but when we fell off it would travel a little bit.Q: What else did you learn in the class?A: There???s a whole history to it. For loggers, it???s how they would get the logs down the river. Then it became a game to pass the time.The woman who taught me comes from a long line of logrollers in Wisconsin. Her mom was like the logrolling queen of her town.Q: So you are now certified to teach others how to logroll?A: Yes, we got certificates. I want to bring it back to the community center pool where I work but it???s too expensive.Q: How much do they cost?A: Like $2000 or $2500. My new plan is to write a grant.You can buy a log made out of wood but it???s insanely heavy. The other kind is plastic and hollow. You fill it with water. And it doesn???t take that long to drain. I???ve heard it???s really easy to empty and store.You can attach paddles to make it go slower when you???re learning. In the class we took those off after about two hours.Q: It seems impossible. A: No! That???s why Abby Hoeschler, my teacher, is going around teaching it. For like team building ??? that kind of thing.It doesn???t matter how strong you are. You could get like a 200-pound muscular guy knocked off.Q: It sounds like you had a really good time.A: It takes a lot of practice but it???s enjoyable right away.My friend also fell in love with it. She looked awesome. She looked like her people were logrollers. She???s a musician too and she is really good with rhythm; I think that helped her.And I thought there was no way I was going to be able to do it. People think you???re insane when you talk about it, but I say it???s wonderful and you should try it! I think everyone who tries it is addicted.Finger of Blame???In the bible, Eve gets in trouble for eating a delicious, nutritious apple and decides to be super generous and selfless by sharing with Adam. When God gets pissed, Adam points his finger of blame at Eve???s beautiful flower area. He does this repeatedly until she gets pregnant, thus populating the earth.??? Genesis 3:35Tyranny Trunk???His tyranny trunk was both tyrannical and prehensile.???Trouble Tube???I was going to apply for grad school, but instead my boyfriend gifted me a baby with his trouble tube.???Arm of Oppression???Throughout history, men have tried to control women by high-fiving their beauty boxes with their arms of oppression.???Gross Beige Thingy???Behind every strong man there is a stronger woman. In front of every strong man there is a gross beige thingy.???Flesh Axe???Since primitive times, men have been systematically cutting down the Great Woman Forest with their flesh axes.???Tee-Tee Organic Fire Hose???He put out the fire with his tee-tee organic fire hose.???Cr??me Machine???Cr??me machines are a cheap, easy way to manufacture cr??me to use when frosting the cupcake of an enemy.???The Spelunker???The spelunker explored the vast, musty chambers of the highly-respectable lady???s cavern system.???The Nasty Needle???His nasty needle was super gross and injected me with a poisonous mayo-like venom. Why does something like that exist? Super gross.???External Vagina???He showed me his external vagina, and I was like blarf, put that away. Why isn???t that inside you? It makes much more sense for that to be internal. How do you ride a bicycle? I don???t understand. The entire situation seems unsanitary.???Wacky Wand???That wacky wand is pretty wacky. Please put it away because it???s making me angry.???Mr. George Stephanopoulos???He insisted I call his wacky wand ???Mr. George Stephanopoulos.??????It That Must Not Be Named???Voldemort kind of looks like an it that must not be named.???Now and Later???His now and later starts out grotesquely hard, but after plenty of rigorous chomping becomes suddenly soft, and gross. It is also common to choke on now and laters. Most of all they are super gross and no one is entirely sure why they???re still being manufactured, because no one has every been like, ???Oh, awesome, a now and later! My favorite! They???re so enjoyable and don???t hurt your mouth at all!???Scare-Shitless Stick???He scared the shit out of me with his scare-shitless stick.???Morally Abhorrent Party Pendulum???He insisted on keeping time with his morally abhorrent party pendulum.???Let???s cut straight past all of the academic, politically-correct, IRB-approved bullshit and get to the point: in order to finish my dissertation, I need 300 ",100
163,"people to take this survey.  Over the past month, only eleven of you have come through for me, and now I???m really fucking desperate.  So, if 300 of you undergraduate fuckheads take this survey by midnight tomorrow, I will broadcast myself cutting off the pinky finger of my left hand with a cigar cutter.At this point, I don???t know what else to do.  You turds apparently can???t be bothered to take a break from your oh-so-demanding lives of waking up at 11, Instagramming your dining hall food, attending some bullshit 200-level class, and bingeing Netflix to take my survey.  I got your professors to offer extra credit, but that didn???t work.  I showed up in each and every single one of your Freshman Comp classes and explained how this study could meaningfully affect the way you receive feedback on your writing assignments, but maybe everyone thinks the feedback they get is perfect.  Or maybe you???re just apathetic assholes.  My advisor suggested offering coffee or donuts to participants, but I???m a 4th year doc student  with a too-expensive apartment, three cats, a dependence on Rex Goliath Merlot, and no funding from the university as of last semester, so I don???t exactly have tons of cash laying around to ply you millennial shit stains with breakfast treats.Then, last weekend, while sitting on a folding chair in my under-furnished apartment, crying into a paper plate of 7-11 taquitos and watching Game of Thrones, pure fucking genius hit me: to get enough survey participants, I???d need to harness the sadistic, protagonist-decapitating, ally-poisoning, daughter-sacrificing allure of George R.R. Martin???s fantasy world.So here???s the deal: I need 300 of you remedial mouthbreathers to not only take this survey but to provide me with quality data.  If you can do that, you???ll have exclusive access to witness me slicing my little finger clean off.  Yeah, there are 83 Likert-scale questions, and I want you to think deeply about all of them.  If you go through and select ???neutral??? for everything, I???m throwing that shit out.  And those seven open-ended qualitative questions at the end?  I expect lengthy, candid responses.  And if you lanyard-wearing adolescents don???t provide me with rich, statistically significant data, you can all kiss your chances of seeing some live-streamed digit-guillotining goodbye.Before you bother responding to this email with the question I know you all want to ask, yes, I totally think it???s worth it to lose a pinky finger in order to finish my Ph.D. and get the hell off of this campus.  For the past four years, I???ve spent the majority of my time entering other people???s data into spreadsheets, then double- and triple-checking thousands of cells to make sure I didn???t fuck something up.  And I???ve done this in an office I share with five other demoralized grad students who spend most of each day either complaining or asking for advice on how best to format their CVs.  Avoiding another semester of that alone is worth a losing finger whose biggest contribution is hitting the letter ???a??? on a keyboard.Plus, if I delay my graduation, I have to listen to my parents question both my work ethic and the relevance of my field of study for another five months, which I just can???t do again.And don???t worry about my personal safety.  My friend Robert, a third-year med student, will be standing by to stanch the bleeding and explain my loud cursing to our neighbors.It???s sad that I have to resort to such a barbaric incentive to recruit study participants on a college campus ??? a place that???s supposed to be a bastion of intellectual progress and cooperation.  A place where like-minded scholars are supposed to band together to solve the problems of their fields.  But I???m not going to proselytize about the waning esprit de corps of the academic landscape because I know you assholes don???t give a fuck.Just get your surveys done by tomorrow night.  My prospectus hearing is next week, and I want my hand to have time to heal before then.- -We asked readers to send short write ups of their chance encounters with Dr. and Mr. Doris Haggis-On-Whey and we received dozens of brave and groundbreaking reports.

If sugary mess found particularly inviting or overwhelming, full finger in mouth encasement ensued. Highly unpleasant surveillance. Worked their way from one shelf end to the other. Dr. Doris Haggis-on-Whey recorded notes in small, leather-bound notebook. The mister repeated hms and ahs. Doctor???s fingertips stuck to paper???s corners frequently. Tiny ripping sounds between tongue laps. I attempted a subtle walk-by in order to obtain a visual on their notes. My other senses were bombarded. Air heavy with sugar stink. Almost palpable to the point of lip licking. Drawings appeared to be of possible better containers for syrups. Followed trend of plastic animals. Snake bottle semi-promising. Slug bottle less so.

In recent months, it has occurred to me that this makes what I do, at best, completely void of meaning and, at worst, totally amoral. In short, my life has no meaning??? but, have you tried the new toaster?Now, if you???re thinking, ???a toaster is not a good enough reason to continuing living such a futile existence,??? then you???ve never experienced the way a piece of golden brown, bread, gently rising from an evenly-heated, cooking chamber, can lift one???s battered spirits from even the darkest pits of despair. To the truly downtrodden, those warm tendrils of steam feel like an approximation of love??? $600 worth of bread-making love.It???s been a true epiphany realizing that it???s not working 16-hour days and coming in on weekends that leaves me with an empty feeling inside, it???s a lack of toasted carbohydrates! All of my true suffering has been at the hands of obsolete toasting technology, and the benevolence of upper management has now delivered me from that false breakfast prophet. Thanks to the fine specimen of modern, kitchen convenience we received today, all of my former problems have been solved.Other corporate sweatshops, I beseech you.

Don???t worry, It???s not your fault if you haven???t seen the light yet???those glowing, orange, strips of light that fill my heart with joy.My suggestion is to stop searching for meaning in your work. The meaning of life is golden brown and waiting for you to butter it. Each morning, I witness a breakfast miracle, and with it comes new hope and new light.

It used to be part of the locker key you see in the picture, the one with the bright-orange head. I got the key almost 25 years ago, when I enrolled at the University of Texas School of Law in Austin. First-year law school, as it turns out, is a lot more like high school than you might expect ??? everyone has the same schedule and the same classes, and there are bells and cliques and intramural sports and locker assignments.You???re supposed to turn in your locker key in when you leave the law school. But nobody asked me to, so I didn???t. I didn???t have a locker for it to open anymore, but it was still useful: I would open letters with it sometimes, or employ it as a makeshift screwdriver, or to pry up the lids on paint cans. When I got bored, sometimes I held the key and spun the other keys on my chain around and around.Sometimes people noticed the key and asked me why I had it. I told them it was to remind me that, whatever else might happen to me, I will never be as miserable as I was when I was a first-year law student.The cotter pin separated from the rest of the key a few years back. I didn???t want to lose the key, so I put it in a cubbyhole in my desk. But I still have the cotter pin on my keychain, although I can???t really say why. It doesn???t remind me of anything, except that the key is broken. Maybe that???s enough.Dear Scout (and family),We at Rollover Academy applaud your decision to enroll in our institution of higher learning. When Congress passed the No Behind Left Unsniffed Act over ten years ago, Rollover Academy???s academic transformation was already well underway. No longer is it enough to simply obey ??? today???s dog must learn how to think.  We believe that an interdisciplinary approach to canine education will help prepare you to lead a successful life in the 21st century. That???s why all of our Certified Professional Dog Trainers have Masters in Education from the Leash-Holders College at Columbia University, with extensive backgrounds in Science, Technology, Engineering or Mathematics.  Please select from the STEM courses below for the coming semester:Who???s a Good Boy? Boolean vs. Fuzzy Logic[Mathematics, Computer Science]Through advanced mathematical applications, we will move beyond the simple binary paradigm of good dog/bad dog, as we harness the power of quantum computing to show how dogs can be both ???good??? and ???bad??? at the same moment (even while peeing on an owner???s favorite pair of slippers).Lego Robotics [Engineering, Computer Science, Technology]Dogs will work in teams to construct and program the perfect cat-startling machine. Each team???s design will be evaluated on its originality, range of motion, sophistication of programmed behaviors, and height of target subject???s terrified, yowling leap.Geocaching Adventure[Geography, Electronics]Dogs will take bone-finding to the next level as we use the latest in GPS mobile technology along with USGS topographical overlays to reliably bury tasty treats (as well as owners??? reading glasses, car keys, and passports",100
165,").The Physics of Fetch[Physics, Robotics, Botany, Biology]Dogs will learn how variations in atmospheric conditions, age and species of a source tree, and the idiosyncrasies of an owner???s throwing motion all contribute to the likely trajectory of a stick???s path. We will employ motion capture technology to analyze the biomechanics of several throwing styles, and also determine which species of tree produces the most aerodynamic sticks for optimal fetch routines.Baconomics[Mathematics, Culinary Technology]Dogs will combine knowledge from the diverse fields of statistical analysis, game theory, and molecular gastronomy to determine the likelihood, at any given moment, that they will be eating bacon. At our final session, special guest lecturers Paul Krugman and Michael Pollan will present their thoughts on how the Keynesian resurgence of 2008 led to an increase in organic pork production.McGruff the Crime Dog Presents: CSI[Biology, Technology]Utilizing our state of the art mobile crime lab, dogs will learn the latest techniques in forensics and biometrics, as they identify the cause of death and likely suspects in the murder of the dead bird they just dropped on your doorstep.Mastering Social Media [Computer Science, Psychology]Dogs will learn how to broaden their friendship networks while leveraging their brand using the most popular social media for dogs (Barc!, SitStay, Poodl, Kibblr, and Instapant).3D Printing[Engineering, Computer Science]3D desktop printers have revolutionized STEM education (as well as the cheap, plastic tchochke industry), and we at Rollover Academy are excited to offer this brand-new course where dogs will use CAD (Computer-Aided Design) to create and then manufacture their own second-rate chew toy.Coding for Canines[Computer Science, Mathematics, Technology]Our Information Technology Department offers three levels of programming instruction:Beginner: Scratch ??? Not Just For Fleas! Even the youngest puppies can learn the basics of scripting while creating interactive games with this fun, drag-and-drop programming language developed at M.U.T.Intermediate: PurinaScript??? Dogs will learn the basics of web architecture while designing their own dogfood review website using PurinaScript???, along with the web application framework, Rover on Rails.Advanced: Mobile App Development Our most advanced course will fully prepare dogs who are looking for a career in software development. As a final project, they will create a hydrant-finding application for the iPhone using the Objective-P programming language.Please note: Our STEM classes are extremely popular, and student enrollment is assigned on a first-come, first-served basis. Rollover Academy does not discriminate on the basis of gender, orientation, or breed (except for bulldogs, which are really, really stupid).Salad Ni??oise with a TwistThis switch up on an old favorite is great for those summer days when you just need a little something different. Begin with the classic tuna and potatoes, then take a little sidestep with some dried cranberries that aren???t really going make much of a difference, Janet, because you???ve really shit the bed this time, haven???t you?Mediterranean Steak SaladYou???d be hard pressed to go wrong with steak. But if anyone could, it would be you, Janet. The steak has even been prepared beforehand and still this is a total disaster, much like your life. All you literally had to do was cut up some lettuce. Wow, your stepmom was right about you.Cold Penne Pasta with a Strawberry VinaigretteThis is a salad you can begin in advance by cooking and refrigerating the pasta the night before. Well, most people could, because most people aren???t up until three in the morning sewing outfits for a disturbing number of ferrets that they actually let live in their house. Good God, Janet, are you a brick shy of a load. Not to mention in violation of several animal regulations.Broccoli Slaw with Bacon Ranch DressingDo you have a food processor, Janet? You did, until you had a five-month-long tryst with a known peyote dealer who stole most of your possessions. Everyone tried to warn you, but you just had to have it your way and get swindled all for a little tonsil hockey with some cheap Norwegian sausage. Was it worth it? Well? Was it, Janet?Tuscan Chickpea SaladChickpeas are part of the legume family and speaking of family, you???re lucky that anyone in yours still speaks to you. Maybe if you get your act together you could see them at the family reunion at the beach house this summer. If only it didn???t violate the restraining order that your siblings currently have against you. Then again, a restraining order didn???t stop you from dropping in on Bjorn two weeks ago, which is why you now wear a special ankle bracelet.Shrimp and Avocado SaladSpeaking of Bjorn, it is probably his baby you???re carrying or it could belong to that bouncer at the gentlemen???s club where you used to work, but are no longer allowed to frequent. What kind of woman wants to hang out at a gentlemen???s club if she isn???t being paid, anyway? A real scumbag, Janet, that???s who!Mexican Black Bean SaladA few Tex-Mex standbys make this one a favorite at parties and with a trip to Home Depot you can probably have that bracelet off in a few hours. The heat will figure it out pretty quick, so you won???t have much time to pack the ferrets into their travel crates and drop in on Bjorn???s on your way out of town. He doesn???t need to know about the bouncer, Janet. But he will need to know where to send the checks.Herbed Fruit SaladBet you weren???t expecting a fruit salad to make the list! Just like you weren???t expecting that cop to run your plates so quick for that duct taped license plate and find out about your home arrest and illegal quantity of ferrets. Oh well! At least they provide decent salad in prison and also prenatal care for the Norwegian bastard you???re carrying.Enjoy your summer, Janet!Unfortunately, not every Robin Williams is hired under equal circumstances, and the failures of an institution that promotes inequality will sometimes look like the failures of Robin Williams. Some are well paid, able to live and retire comfortably, a class of individuals closely portrayed by the Robin Williams of Good Will Hunting, insulated from the student body but able to take a keen interest in a promising Matt Damon through one-on-one instruction, this Robin Williams wrapped in the personhood of the mythical college professor. Meanwhile the majority of Robin Williamses work at reduced or even subsistence wages, hired on short-term contracts. This Robin Williams is Dead Poets Society Robin Williams. He has no job security, he???s easy to say goodbye to, forever the new guy. Except we should keep in mind this Robin Williams teaches four or five classes, so that he???s doing the work of more than one Robin Williams. There???s no time for gallivanting outdoors. There won???t be any standing on desks. He???ll come and go in a whir and those who run the place will be sure to let him know he doesn???t fit in.At the end of the semester, college students are asked to evaluate Robin Williams, and to compare Robin Williamses across all experiences. Who among all Robin Williamses will have an unspoken but obvious advantage? Which Robin Williams took longer to get the assignments back? And remember, Dead Poets Society Robin Williams teaches four or five required classes brimming with first-year and sophomore college students. Meanwhile, Good Will Hunting Robin Williams teaches two or three small upper-level courses for majors and/or grad students. Which students are more invested in their assignments? Which Robin",100
166," Williams is more likely to be rewarded by student evaluations, and which is likely to be punished? Also remember: Dead Poets Society Robin Williams can???t have anyone ripping pages out of any textbooks, because students need to be able to sell books back. This Robin Williams is just a guy and he doesn???t wear sweaters with elbow patches. His glasses are ordinary and out of fashion. He???s a poor substitute of a Robin Williams.It is extremely unlikely that students will be able to communicate constructive criticism via evaluations, which has always been the most optimistic assumed function of these assessments. The more pessimistic purpose of student evaluations is that the masters of the corporate-wannabe entities we call universities use student evaluations as a way to try to take the pulse of the real work of the university, which they almost never experience, which is teaching, which occurs through actual human relationships, which also exists hereafter as a file, and this file exists as an outgrowth of student evaluations, where these primary assessments turn up in other assessments that simply multiply the original student evaluations into a paper snowball. The same institutional constraints that limit the performance of a Robin Williams ??? lots of large required introductory classes ??? also limits Robin Williams???s immediate supervisors. If Robin Williams is observed by a supervisor at all (like the department chair), the observer would likely visit one class, once per year, though the observation probably won???t be done by the immediate supervisor but by another Robin Williams who volunteered, most likely a junior Robin Williams on the tenure-track who feels the need to do some favors in order to inch closer to becoming a Good Will Hunting Robin Williams, someone possibly younger and less experienced than the Robin Williams being observed, though the tenure-track Robin Williams, no matter how experienced, is seen as having seniority since the two Robin Williamses were hired in on different tracks, so that the supervisor???s idea of what happened in that one class, once per year, often isn???t based on personal observation at all but comes from an observation report.It goes without saying that student evaluations are by no means objective assessments of Robin Williams or his classes, because unofficial and wildly informal assessments of Robin Williams have been posted online at RateMyProfessor, which most students look at before signing up, and it only takes one or two disgruntled customers to scare away the Matt Damon-caliber students for years, so that those who do sign up do so for no reason other than the convenience of class meeting time, and these students will base their own formal end-of-the-year university-sanctioned evaluations entirely on whether or not they agree with what they read about Robin Williams at RateMyProfessor, as much as they can, given that their judgment has to be communicated via the bubble sheets that will be scanned and turned into numbers and ratios.To recap: too many students forced to take overcrowded classes in areas outside their majors, who have come into Robin Williams???s class warned against whatever grudge a previous student may have held and posted online, are given bubble sheets at the end of the semester, as they have seen the class size dwindle as a necessary portion of them has dropped Robin Williams???s class for whatever reasons, as they are asked to assess Robin Williams who has been assessing them since they first met that awkward day in August or January when they reviewed the course syllabus together and did not rip up any books or stand on any desks. Student evaluations are then duplicated as they become the primary source of evaluations from supervisors, and overburdened Robin Williamses with limited resources are asked to respond to any particular failing, as perceived by the only people to actually experience the class, the students, many of whom would never have chosen to take the class, and if Robin Williams is able to overcome institutional deficiencies and somehow give the students something of value, then positive evaluations appear to be reinforced by the supervisor???s evaluations, except that there???s no possibility of promotion, and when the contract runs out, and if Robin Williams is given the opportunity to reapply, then these evaluations that were deemed so important all along will have little bearing on the decisions made by a coterie of Good Will Hunting Robin Williamses in closed-door hiring committees, where personal preference reigns and bringing in a new Robin Williams always seems like a good idea.So??? in these corporate-wannabe-entities we call universities, there is a second function to evaluations. You see, not every division of a corporation makes money. The parts of the company that don???t ??? and we???ll draw a parallel here to the humanities ??? will at least be expected to keep the company from losing money, and those divisions will forever be expected to justify their existence, for as long as they exist. The decision-makers can and do cut classics and philosophy. They can and do cut theoretical physics. English and history have the benefit of being seen as core disciplines, so even if English and History don???t bring in grants or produce newsworthy research, and even if the Robin Williamses in English and history rarely contribute cultural gems (like The World According to Garp Robin Williams), from a corporate perspective, a Robin Williams who dabbles in the humanities is forever in a bind of explaining what he does to those who don???t really value what he does, and he must also try to do what he does in an increasingly less expensive way.It???s not like we???ll be getting rid of administrators or supervisors or student evaluations any time soon, but Robin Williams knows when he???s good at teaching, and it tends to be when Robin Williams is allowed to be a person first, a writer or scholar second, and a measurable vehicle of or transmitter of knowledge last, if at all. Being a teacher-person, then, requires transparency with respect to transience. Any embarrassment about his discounted position shouldn???t prevent Robin Williams from being honest and vulnerable. While acting like there???s equality among Robin Williamses might occasionally lend him the authority of Good Will Hunting Robin Williams, who is immune to the negative effects of evaluations, such a charade is ultimately damaging to his possible future employment and the students??? true understanding of what they???re paying for. Managers and supervisors depend upon a willingness to submit to a system that cannot reward Robin Williams, and Robin Williams should take the opportunity, at every turn, to expose the swindle rather than cooperate in his own devaluation.To: Mr. Daniel B. Robertson (co0L_dan_69@yahoo.com)RE: Your identityDear Mr. Robertson,You may have noticed a rash of irregular activity across your personal and professional accounts. For instance, the purchase of several high-end jet skis on your AmEx and the $600 downpayment for a buy-out at the Chuck E. Cheese at Atlantic Center in Brooklyn. In addition to unauthorized credit card transactions, you may have received phone calls and digital correspondence inquiring about unfamiliar debts and/or commitments.If you did notice, you made no effort to investigate further.

Dan, you are the only monster on this Earth who should be burdened by your wretched existence.As an ethical person, I often research folks after lifting their identities, and when I first glanced at your e-persona, your quirks amused me. ???Oh, he owns a typewriter, that???s quaint,??? I tittered. But then there were the hats: top hats, bowlers, and multiple fedoras. Dan! Wake the fuck up, man! It???s the 21st century! Those pretentious accoutrements belong in a museum, not on your bedroom wall. The ironic mustache atop your shit-eating smirk made my stomach roil, and I can???t even with that monocle. Be honest with yourself, Dan: did you really need to purchase a vinyl edition of that Alabama Shakes album? We both know you don???t own a record player.Provoked by your penchant for anachronism, I tweaked your job title on LinkedIn to ???Cobbler???s Apprentice.??? But you gave no indication that you noticed ??? perhaps you don???t spend much time on that network as a part-time bartender/artist. So I adjusted your age on OKCupid to reflect your sensibilities at a more interest-relevant 90 years, and even still, you scuttled on with your life, only sending a single email puzzling over the slowing trickle of romantic interest online.Your problematic lifestyle obsessed me. I think the final straw was your tendency to google pictures of elaborate meals, which you post on your Instagram as your own. I???ve seen your Seamless order history, Dan: almost exclusively noodles with butter from the local Chinese place.

He says he promises that he initially remembered the three things you asked him to get: kale, Irish butter and some other stuff. He went in search of the kale, but got confused upon finding dandelion greens and chard, which looked shadily like kale and all the other land seaweeds. He says he is baffled that dandelion greens are masquerading as an exorbitant superfood when he is forced to spend his weekends nuking them with RoundUp. He says as a direct result of his revulsion at these shriveled lettuces, he panicked and loaded up a nearby cart with ???all the weeds.??? Then he got distracted by a fruit that called itself a deviled horn melon because it sounded awesome and looked like a weapon from Game of Thrones. That one is still in the cart because it???s baller and he says he???s not putting it back. You can???t make him.He found the Irish butter section, but didn???t know whether you wanted the one with the salt or what. Is it cheaper to put in your own salt bits? He figures it is and has nabbed a Himalayan neti pot salt bag. He says you???re welcome.He then tried to find you to ask about the mountain of weeds he was hoarding, Mrs. Germann, but got distracted in the frozen food section by beef-free beefy crumbles, chicken-less chicken nuggets and what this meant existentially.He says then he thought he saw you, but it turned out to be another lady who wears purple Lululemons and stocks up on organic tahini like we???re in a post-Cold War recession. He felt embarrassed for manhandling a total stranger in his desperation and quickly dashed to the area that sold venison nuggets for cats that have the same monetary value as a new kidney. He says his hands were getting cold and stiff from gripping the stupid salt-less Irish butter and he couldn???t find you, or remember the third item and it was starting to feel lonely in this Whole Foods that is only slightly smaller than the state of Nebraska.Then a woman offered him brownie samples that tasted like sunscreen and since they were free he had twelve miniature cups of blackberry-hibiscus chia drink that looked like frogspawn while another woman offered him fermented cod liver oil pills that cost the same as a Playstation. Another nice lady in a white hat was offering small cups of toe-food curry which sounded gnarly, but he tried the toad-food anyway and liked it, but then he started to feel guilty realizing there is a whole subculture of freeloading snackers that no one is talking about and it???s a serious problem! He???s on to those grape grabbers! Twisted by guilt, he says he lobbed a gluten-free zucchini cake, a $14 granola bar and a cranberry feta log onto the mountain of weeds in his cart and tried not to look anyone in the eye, ignoring offers of help while speeding down the aisles, staring at his shoes and running over small children with his cart. A guy in the meat department said, ???Can I get you something???? He panicked and said, ???Meat???? and then ran away at top speed, cranberry feta log spearheading the retreat.He says he honestly thought you were going to stay in aisle five, but you were gone. So then he went to the ???safe spot??? you both decided on in between the beer and the artisanal cheese and his palms were sweaty and he had a sample of Guinness cheddar, which cheered him up a bit but he took in the plethora of microbrews around him and felt a sense of doom.[Adult male sobs in background]He says there are too many to choose from! How will he ever drink them all or remember which ones he liked. And they bring in new ones every week! He wants you to know that he???s knackered and he felt overwhelmed when a staff member told him that almonds can be milked and that he himself would have to massage the kale. He says he was excited to show you the hedge of mint he gathered to make mojitos, but I???ve just pointed out that it???s actually cilantro which he hates even more than the satanic phallus that calls itself a banana. He solemnly swears that from now on he is happy to live on Ding Dongs, Ho Hos and other non biodegradable Hostess products.Mrs. Germann, it now appears your husband has passed out in a bulk bin of couscous.

Murder Beach boasts modern seaside amenities, including a brand new three-mile boardwalk that spans the most pristine sand and blue crashing waves that exist anywhere on the east coast. Moreover, a variety of eclectic restaurants, open-air attractions, and quirky novelty markets make even a rainy day time well-spent. There are tidal waves of fun to be had by kids and adults alike!In anticipation of the fast-approaching vacation season, see below for the most frequently asked questions about Murder Beach.Should I be concerned that the name of the resort is ???Murder??? Beach?Absolutely not. Despite the admittedly off-putting name, Murder Beach is patrolled by a dedicated team of law enforcement personnel. The safety measures and precautions taken are easily equal to, if not beyond, those of any other resort facility in the country.How did Murder Beach get its name?Murder Beach was originally named Cape Lily, until a crime was committed here many years ago. Locals dubbed the area ???Murder Beach??? shortly thereafter. The nefarious nickname stuck. However, due to the unsurpassed quality of beach life, Murder Beach remained a favorite place for nearby residents to relax and enjoy life.Although a vocal few have sought to rename the area over the years, it???s been decided to not sweep history under the rug. Despite an undeniably bloody singular event, it???s the long history of good ???ol fashioned fun in the sun at Murder Beach that shall endure.My Uncle Hank once told me that when he was a kid a debauched clique of sinful, merrymaking delinquents were brutally slaughtered with an axe by an escaped lunatic named Harvey Ward Clementine on the shores of this very beach. Is Uncle Hank???s story true?It???s no surprise that historical details such as those you mentioned often become quite misconstrued over time. Remember the telephone game from grade school? That being said, yes, there is some truth to your uncle???s tale. Per old newspaper articles and unclassified police documents, only three young persons were mortally wounded, not a ???debauched clique??? as your twisted Uncle Hank claims. And there was no ???sinful, merrymaking delinquents??? to speak of, rather a ???small social get-together of neighborhood chums.??? Otherwise, a runaway patient at the West Mills Insane Asylum did thoroughly dismember those ???less fleet of foot.???I told my young kids they???re going to Murder Beach for vacation. Since, they???ve been plagued by vivid night terrors of being gruesomely slain. How can I talk to them about vacation plans while curtailing their spiraling descent into a lifelong delirium?Kids are funny, aren???t they? If you???ve ever explained to a child that the scary monster in the hallway is just a creaking floorboard, you can utilize the same template of placation when you justify your seemingly abhorrent choice of vacation destination. The only difference is that the ???scary monster??? is Murder Beach, and the ???creaking floorboard??? is a majestic sandcastle on the frothy shoreline, or a giant stuffed panda bear prize at Mermaid Gigi???s Funhouse.What???s beach protocol if I unearth a bloated corpse in the sand while digging for crabs along the shoreline?You won???t unearth a bloated corpse.**- Theoretically, no one can be totally assured they definitely will not unearth a corpse. But if you do happen to unearth a corpse while digging for crabs??? your stay at Murder Beach is on the house. That???s the brand new Murder Beach guarantee: Unearth a corpse and your stay is free. Does Murder Beach have family rest facilities?Yes, there are family restrooms every quarter mile along the boardwalk.I???m a metal detector enthusiast. Is there a designated time each morning when I can hit the beach in search of the gold teeth and silver jewelry of all the undiscovered murder victims? Based on the scuttlebutt, I expect quite a haul.A name is just a name, people. Murder Beach, like the Outer Banks or Myrtle Beach or the Hamptons, is just another beach.  Forget that there were murders here long ago. I???m sure murders have occurred at those other beaches too. They just have more palatable names. The only difference between those places and Murder Beach is that Murder Beach is a better place to vacation. Come see for yourself.Will I get murdered at Murder Beach?No. No, you won???t get murdered at??? wait???  actually, for legal reasons, I???m obliged to state that you are no more likely to be murdered while vacationing at Murder Beach. Although it can???t be stated with 100% certainty that you will not be murdered, or that your family will not be massacred, you will very likely survive your stay. Period. End of story.

Grimly, but keeping our views on the Sephora-goblin to ourselves.Illustration by Kelly Bjork.- -Read Part 1- -As Amy huddled on the floor in the lounge, she watched the gunman James approach, move past, then turn away as he followed the path of the horseshoe bar. When he reached the far wall, ???I saw him standing, and he was looking over to the corner where you all were. I saw him lift up his gun. I remembered seeing you sitting back there earlier and just being, like, ???Oh my god, who else is gonna be harmed tonight???? she said to me. (At the time, I was crouched into a dead end with four other women. The bar fully obscured us from Amy???s sightline.) ???I didn???t know who he was shooting at. I was thinking, if he could shoot his girlfriend, then he could shoot anyone else. Then my brain was like, ???Nope, nope, nope. He can shoot me right here in the bar, and I???m all crouched down. I???m just waiting to get shot, and this makes no sense. I need to get the fuck up. Get the fuck up. He can shoot me when I???m running out, but I???m not gonna wait here.??????Lounge area of the Twilight Exit. The helmet is Amy???s.Photo Credit: Seattle Police Department.Amy ran from the lounge, through the dining area, out the emergency exit, and onto the street, which was lined with parked vehicles. Somewhere along the way, she heard a second gunshot. ???I thought he was gonna kill me. I thought maybe he would come outside, I had no idea. I slid and hid under somebody???s Jeep. A white Jeep.1 I didn???t want him to find me there,??? she said. ???The ground was so cold, with all the wet leaves and shit. I was trying to calm myself and get my fingers to stop shaking so I could call 911. I didn???t want someone to drive off and run me over. Every time anybody walked down the street, I would be like, ???Don???t step in the car, keep on fucking moving.??????Amy was wearing a knee-length black-and-coral striped knit skirt, plain black leggings, a plain black top, a heathered pink hoodie, and fashionable running shoes. In the months after the shooting, these items would seem contaminated. ???I love the pieces separately, but I couldn???t wear them all at once, because it reminded me of lying on my belly underneath the car in the cold weather, and the feeling of the dirty wet leaves on my skin. A year and a half later, I was throwing some clothes on in my place, and that???s what I ended up wearing. I had to stay in my apartment an extra ten minutes, just to psych myself up to wear the outfit again. But I was able to do it,??? she said. ???Those sneakers got filthy when I hid under the car. I could never get them looking clean again after that. I threw them away, and that felt better. They were my favorite sneakers. Wearing them just stopped feeling comfortable.???Back to the night of the shooting. As Amy stationed herself outside, the cops arrived, and James was killed soon after. ???I remember seeing the lights of the police cars and hearing the sirens. And the sounds of all the shots. I can???t tell you how many I heard. He got a punishment of death, which was weird, but it felt resolved. It was like, ???OK. He is dead. I feel OK he is dead,?????? said Amy. ???There was a thing going down with him, and that was his reaction ??? that he had to come and do the harm that he came and did. That???s insanity. And now, there was like this element of the universe meeting that.???I ask Amy whether she trusted the cops. ???I???ve got some serious shit with the police, when it comes to brutality and all that shit,??? she said. ???But I know there are good cops. My mother was a cop in Boston for 32 years, and she was a good cop. She didn???t talk a ton about her work. It was just really cool. I remember her doing a lot to support the officers she worked with,??? said Amy. As for the Twilight situation, Amy felt the police ???did what they were supposed to do. They showed up so fast, and I???m grateful they stopped anyone else from getting hurt,??? she said. (A couple months later, ???there were all these cops in the ER at work one night, and I saw the cop who had to take James???s life. I wanted to say something ??? to thank him. But I couldn???t go up to him, couldn???t speak. I didn???t have the words,??? she said.)Amy eventually emerged from beneath the Jeep, then she gathered with a group of witnesses just outside the bar while the police took statements. The wait was long, and she made some important calls. ???I was trying to get in touch with my mother. It was late in Seattle, then it was really late in Boston. I tried my brother too. But then I was like, ???What the fuck can either of these two people do right now? Why am I burdening them with this shit??????? she said, and gave that up quickly. ???I needed to call work. In my head I was like, ???I???m just gonna get cleaned up, then I???m gonna go in and do my shift.??? We had a security line we recorded, and I didn???t want this to be a topic of conversation with my coworkers, so I called the backline. I got one of my dearest friends at the job. He was dispatching that night. In my head, I thought I was doing OK. But when I heard his voice, I started bawling and screaming. He was just super, super sweet. He was like, ???What???s going on, baby? What???s going on???? He transferred me to my supervisor. I was hysterical. I was telling her about Greg. I was saying I never got a chance to tell Greg how much",100
171," he meant to me. A month and a half later, she gave me a ride home from work, and she asked me how he was doing. I had no memory of our conversation.???We return to the Twilight Exit. While Amy and the witnesses waited outside, a city bus arrived to transport everyone to the police station downtown. ???I can???t even connect everything. Sometimes it feels like little floating pieces. Some things feel like they happened all right together. I remember the lights in the bus made me feel like I was in the hospital. I remember I???d separated from Christian, and I was thinking he was dead until he got on the bus. When I saw him, I hugged him with everything I had left. I don???t even remember what time I got to the police station. I remember feeling like it was taking forever, and I wanted to go home.2 I called my boyfriend at the time. I was like, ???I need you to come pick me up.??? I don???t know, I thought he could scoop me up, and I could go home and feel safe, but he was super weird about it. He was like, ???Oh. I???ve got this thing in the morning. I can???t come and get you.??? He was aiming to work at this other hospital, and I think he had a job interview the next day, but I was like, ???Are you fucking serious???????3Amy can???t remember how she got home4 that night, but Christian was with, somehow. He lived close by. ???I???d left my purse and my keys in the bar, so I had to get in touch with my landlord. She was, like, the biggest slumlord in Seattle. She told me that the basement was open, that she kept it open at all times, and somewhere in it she???d hidden an old tin can, and it held the spare set of keys to every apartment. When she told me that, I was like, ???Are you for real.??? Christian stood at the foot of the stairs while I looked for the can. It was like a horror movie basement. It was cluttered and gross, there were spiderwebs. I found the keys. Otherwise, I would???ve had to sleep on my little back porch,??? she said.Once Christian was sure Amy had gotten in safely, he gave a cordial goodbye and headed out.5 Alone in her apartment, ???I was a fucking wreck. I felt cried out. When I fell asleep that night, it was just, like, total exhaustion. My boss gave me the week off. I can???t even remember leaving the house for a couple days. The next day, I had a friend over. She stayed with me, we watched some bad movies on VHS. I was in my pajamas. We had champagne and orange juice, and cashews, and bananas. I hate bananas, but I ate one for the potassium or the protein or whatever. I remember bawling a lot. All I could think about was Greg,???6 she said. ???The Twilight was my favorite bar in the entire world. It was the first place in Seattle where I felt absolutely at home. After the shooting, my sense of home felt really shattered. Maybe that???s what it???s like when something like that happens in your own house.???- - 1  The Jeep belonged to Raven, a karaoke regular. He???d driven in with Christie and Kristin about fifteen minutes prior.2 Darrel brought more details. He remembered spotting Amy in the waiting room of the police station, and though the two hadn???t formally met, he recognized her as a karaoke regular. ???That gal was a really good singer,??? he said. ???She looked really upset. I went back to where she was sitting, and I said, ???You???re a great singer, and it???s gonna be fine.??????3 As far as their relationship, ???that was essentially the end. I didn???t hear from him for a week, and I didn???t see him again until I tracked him down, after I got mandated into O.T. I came back to where he was working, and I was like, ???You???re a worthless piece of shit. Have a wonderful day,?????? said Amy.4 It???s worth noting that Amy lived within walking distance of the Twilight Exit. ???The entire time I lived in Seattle, I lived in the Central District, and it always had this weird bad rap,??? she said. ???I???d never had any issues with the neighborhood. I???d always be out roaming around, and I???d never felt threatened. I don???t know if it was a like a false sense of security. After the shooting, people would say, like, ???Come on, what did you expect? It???s the Central District.??? It felt like they were referencing a very explicit racial component. But to me, it was like, this could???ve happened any place in the city, no matter how black the population.???5 The night???s agenda had been unduly heavy. The next time Amy saw Christian, he was alone and quietly reading in a bar. ???The awkwardness was palpable. I think we reminded each other too much of that night,??? she said. They didn???t hang out again.6 ???I know we spent time talking about Christian earlier, but I had a crush on Greg. He was always so amiable,??? said Amy. ???To say I had a crush on Greg is legit.???Have you ever dreamed of being a ???writer????  Of course, you have! Doctors don???t make as much as they used to and we no longer go into space! What choice do you have? Besides, math was never really your thing. Well then, why not become a content creator for Galaxos Online Publishing?What Sites Do We Run?Good question, and the answer is simple!  Galoxos owns all sites within the InterTrove collective, with the exception of those domains currently directed by InterProse Ltd. In the coming year, InterProse is set to merge with InterTrove and promptly dissolve, but hey, leave the boring money stuff to us! For your purposes, we own the Internet.What Do We Pay?That is a fair question for anyone starting a career in Internet Publishing. Did you like the way we used the word ???career???? Of course, you did. Words are fun, and that???s why you want to be a writer! So you can have a ???writing career.??? Ask anyone and they???ll tell you, the key to building a successful career is exposure. And you just can???t buy exposure. Well, maybe you can, but we certainly don???t need to pay you for it.We pay $15 per piece of content, whether it be a well-cited, thoroughly researched 5,000-word essay or ten captions under fair-use photos, so, y???know, more bang for your buck with the photos. Also no one reads essays, so win-win.Lastly, things are looking up because as of next year, our rates will no longer be below industry standard as the InterProse/InterTrove merger will mean we are the industry.Who Are We Looking For?Do you have a crippling mental illness or substance abuse problem that would make you virtually unemployable in any conventional office setting? You might think that???s a detriment, and truth be told, it normally is, but in the world of Internet Publishing, you can work from the comfort of your own home or parent???s home. We appreciate that our employees aren???t your typical office drones.  You???re colorful. You???re writers!  Also we???re not worried because we widely disperse labor over so many of you, odds are slim you???ll all have breakdowns/relapses on the same day, right?  Anyway, what some might call taking advantage of a vulnerable work force in the worst way, we see as valuing employees who possess a combination of disabling characteristics and limited options, thus making them fiercely loyal.What Kind of Content Do We Want?Hi, this is Steve Pearson, the new Director of Content for Galaxos, taking over for Caitlyn Thomas who started this posting several moments ago. Caitlyn is no longer with Galaxos and we wish her all the best over at InterProse.  I mention this transfer only because, as writers, you might possess the keen eye to discern a difference in tone.

It was discontinued when the military transitioned from canned K- and C-rations to plastic bagged MREs (Meal, Ready-to-Eat). But even though the military stopped using it, the P-38 is still in production today and is distributed all over the world.As it turned out, the P-38 was developed and manufactured just outside of Milwaukee by the J.W. Speaker Corp. While working on the story I met with Jack Speaker ??? J.W.???s son ??? and he gave me a P-38, which has been on my key ring ever since.My wife hates it because she pokes herself on it whenever she takes my car. I occasionally do the same, but I???d never tell her that. Besides, you never know when it???ll come in handy. While I???ve never tried to open a can with it, it does make quick work of any shrink-wrapped package or errant thread.While I initially put it on my key ring more or less on a whim, I think it???s remained because I???ve always been a lover of history and of Milwaukee, and the P-38 is a pocket-sized symbol of both.New study suggests: Pregnant woman silently yearns for opinions of complete strangers on her health, readiness for childrearing, and attractiveness while trapped in a hot, itchy, pulsing, 24-hour fat suit.New study suggests: Yes, it is ???possible??? that area woman is ???still pregnant.???

(King) MinosChief Executive Officer ??? Crete CorpFrom: 	Stephen DaedalusChief Innovation Officer ??? Crete CorpRe: The Minotaur Doesn???t ScaleKing:I wanted to take a moment to recap the results of the SWOT analysis conducted at our recent leadership retreat at the Mount Olympus Country Club and Javelin Hurling Center.StrengthsOur labyrinth remains the category leader. When it comes to mazes for people to wander endlessly before starving to death (presuming they???re not first killed by the minotaur), we can???t be beat.Consumer analytics also consistently puts our minotaur at number one in top-of-mind scores when it comes to human-animal hybrids. This is likely because there is only one half man/half bull creature in the known world, but even so, our market penetration for consumer awareness outpaces nearest competitor Aegeus???s part human/part goat Satyr by a nine to one margin.To put this in context, this is superior to Uber???s position v. Lyft.Our earlier concerns about possible market share encroachment by Lycia Inc.???s Chimera have proven unfounded. Consumers seem to be turned off by hybrids that combine multiple beasts and are therefore absent that all-important ???human element.???Additionally, informant reports from inside Lycia Inc.???s research and development lab indicate that as of yet, they cannot figure out how to get the Chimera???s lion head and dragon head to stop trying to rend the flesh from each other.All things considered, in today???s dynamic business climate, it is better to have a minotaur than to not have a minotaur, and Crete Corp has the only minotaur.WeaknessesEven with all of our efforts, it appears that the minotaur does not scale. Our original goal of putting a maze and a minotaur in every home is somewhere between unlikely and impossible.We have tried recreating the circumstances of the minotaur???s creation ??? as you well know, the minotaur is the byproduct of your (ex) wife Pasipha?????s affair with the enchanted white bull of Poseidon ??? but now that Poseidon???s spell compelling Mrs. Minos to fall in love with the bull has passed, we have had little success enjoining subsequent couplings.Mrs. Minos remarked that ???there???s not enough coins in the kingdom to do that again!???Replicating additional minotaurs from sample DNA has proved difficult, as anyone who approaches the minotaur with one of those cheek swabs is swiftly disemboweled.(None of the blood sampled from the labyrinth floor seems to belong to the minotaur.)More troubling, OSHA-related payouts for these on-the-job casualties have already upped our workman???s compensation insurance premiums to nearly unsustainable levels.The deaths have also been detrimental to company morale. This is likely the cause of our recent upticks in absenteeism and attrition as well. It would be nice to reassure employees that when they come to work, they do not run the risk of experiencing the indescribable pain and torture of being run through by a terrifying half-man/half-bull.The arrival of our new ergonomic Herman Miller Aeron chairs for all employees above minion level should help on this front as well.",100
174,"OpportunitiesFortunately, our chief weakness is also our greatest opportunity. We believe Crete Corp should pivot to present our minotaur and maze through the lens of exclusivity.It appears that income for the top 1% and .1% of earners will continue to increase, even as the median wage stagnates. To survive, more and more products will need to appeal to these elite markets.There is only one minotaur and one maze and they belong to Crete Corp for all the ages. Access to the minotaur and maze will now be reserved for the fortunate few, and those few appear willing to pay a fortune.We quadrupled ticket prices for this year???s sacrifice of the seven Athenian youths and seven Athenian maids and still sold out in record time. Current resale on the secondary ticketing market suggests we could double or quadruple prices again and still be filled to capacity.We are also currently fielding inquiries for advertising on the labyrinth walls from luxury brands such as: Jaguar, Viking Riverboat Cruises, Rolex, and Louis Vuitton.As the minotaur???s impending victims wander towards their deaths, they will be surrounded by luxury and style, creating a brand halo effect that benefits Crete Corp.ThreatsWe believe the threat is small, but our maze maintenance team posits it may be possible to successfully navigate the labyrinth by relying on a string that is unspooled as one goes deeper into the maze???s interior. While unlikely, a clever warrior armed with his father???s sword could, in theory, make his way through the maze, kill the minotaur, and free the youths and maidens.However, as of this moment, this knowledge appears to be strictly in-house, known only to you, maintenance, myself, and Crete Corp V.P. Ariadne Minos, aka, your daughter.One can never count out the sudden interventions of the Gods, but we???re confident that this close-held information will remain as such and therefore be little threat to the ongoing growth of Crete Corp.""Harper Lee is pretty pissed off at us. She unfortunately died in February, but I bet she???s not letting that stop her. She seemed like the type who held a grudge.???Who, us???? you ask, hand fluttering to your chest, eyelashes batting as though excessive inconsequential body movement will ward off such accusations. ???But we LOVE To Kill a Mockingbird!???It???s true. We love To Kill a Mockingbird. I would venture a guess that it???s one of the only works of classic literature that people say that they love after (and this is key) having actually read it. Most of the time we say we???ve read classic literature, but really we read the first page, Google a quick overview, and hope that it doesn???t come up in conversation before a reasonably faithful mini-series airs. (This may or may not have been my personal strategy regarding War and Peace.)But we actually read To Kill a Mockingbird, didn???t we, and we fell in love. Many American schools still require it in probably 9th or 10th grade, and then many of us re-read it when we???re older. I know people who read it every year.We love the movie, too, and cross our fingers that no one ever remakes it, because Gregory Peck is Atticus Finch forever and always. (Harper Lee thought so, too.)But none of this changes the fact that Harper Lee is, I assume, pretty pissed off, because whatever the psychology term for loving too much is, we did that to her first book, and it killed any possibility of subsequent novels from her.Don???t believe me? To Kill a Mockingbird was published in 1960. Within six months it had sold over 500,000 copies. A year later it had been picked up by the Book-of-the-Month Club, the Literary Guild, and Reader???s Digest, and it won the Pulitzer Prize. Two years after publication, Horton Foote wrote the screenplay and made the film that would earn eight Academy Award nominations and win three, including best actor for Gregory Peck (we???ve established that we all love Mr. Peck as Atticus). Over 40 million copies of the book have been sold, and it???s been translated into more than 40 languages. It is often listed in surveys as second only to the Bible as the most influential book.Well boo-hoo, poor Harper Lee was too gosh-darned successful and don???t we feel awful for her?And yet, for a woman from a small town in Alabama to be launched into the world so quickly, and then almost immediately set upon to write a second masterpiece (and it was nothing less than another masterpiece that we wanted from her), it must have been overwhelming at best, horrifyingly claw-your-eyes-out annoying and stressful, at worst.But here???s the thing. Harper Lee DID write a second book, sort of. She helped Truman Capote write In Cold Blood. Lee and Capote were childhood friends (Dill in To Kill a Mockingbird is based on Capote) and worked on Capote???s book together. The collaboration is shrouded in some mystery in terms of who did how much, but Lee felt she did enough to warrant more recognition than Capote was willing to give, thus ending their relationship.So far, then, we have one book that Lee did a great deal to help research and write; yet she did not receive credit and lost a good friend over it. But still, all she hears after In Cold Blood is published in 1966 is ???When are you going to write that second masterpiece????There are rumors that Lee tried to write another novel and failed. There are rumors that she did nothing but write throughout the rest of her life and now has oodles of material waiting to be published according to whatever guidelines are in her will. I don???t know if any of the rumors are true, but I do know that this was one feisty woman who got pissed off and did something about it.I think that???s where Go Set a Watchman came from; Harper Lee got so damn tired of being asked about another masterpiece that she finally said, ???Fine. You want another novel? You want more Scout and Boo and Atticus? Here it is, people. Be careful what you wish for!???Though let me add here that I am a big fan of Go Set a Watchman. I may be the only person on Earth who actually liked it, but I???m loud and proud about it. If you go into it understanding that it is a draft of To Kill a Mockingbird (literally, Go Set a Watchman is the book she submitted; To Kill a Mockingbird is what came from her editors??? notes regarding successes and failures of Go Set a Watchman), then you can see the ghosts of To Kill a Mockingbird and they are precious nuggets in an otherwise lumpy, awkward book. The fact that Go Set a Watchman is, content-wise, a sequel to To Kill a Mockingbird is confusing because we read them in the wrong order, which is really the right order because both books are more brilliant that way. And yes, Atticus is more complicated in Go Set a Watchman, but that???s what happens to parents when children grow up and realize the adults they???ve idolized are only human.Enough about that. Maybe my next installment for this column will be why I???m so pissed off because I???m the only one who loves Go Set a Watchman. But back to my point???I think that Harper Lee knew that Go Set a Watchman would tick everybody off. In fact, I think that???s the main reason she agreed (and despite rumors to the contrary, we know that she did agree) to publish it. She???d spent 50 years being asked for another novel, a masterpiece, after writing a book that she knew she couldn???t duplicate. She was fed up with all of the begging and gave us the new/old book to shut us up. So there.Hey, Boo. Payback???s a bitch.One drink for every time Netflix asks you if you???re still watching.

A Prayer for RelevanceDear God, provide me with some kind of Rosetta Stone for translating popular culture references so that I may understand what my students are going on about. Are the words they are using appropriate? What is a ???360 no scope???? Should I throw out this phrase casually to show them I get it? Or would I get a lot of emails from administration? Heavenly Father, what are the latest dance crazes? Guide me to land somewhere between ???just one of the kids??? and ???that lady in sensible shoes??? (you know all about my low arches from my previous dispatches). I ask these things of you in the name of the Father, the stanky leg, the whip/nae nae, and the Holy Spirit. Amen.2. A Prayer for Maintaining at Least a Tenuous Hold on My SanityJesus, I am having a day. Please send the angels of classroom management from on high. May they blow their celestial trumpets in the face of this amorphous, shrieking mass of children I am supposed to be teaching. Grant me the serenity to use a reasonable tone of voice when saying ???Jeremy you need to apologize to Alyssa for kicking her book across the room because she was better than you at soccer in gym class.??? Lead me away from the temptation of deploying a metaphorical emergency slide and quitting mid-period in the style of that unhinged flight attendant from a few years back. I???m losing it, Lord: Please hear my prayer.3. A Prayer for End-of-Year ActivitiesLord God, please look after the mother in charge of this year???s book fair. Bestow upon her strength in the face of no-show volunteers and petty larceny. I???d also like to ask that if it???s going to rain on field day, perhaps the storm could begin well before the whole school is lined up on the athletic field in T-shirts color-coded by grade? Finally, a note about our class trip to the zoo: Why must you forsake me like this? Give me a sign that mixing wild children and zoo animals is all part of your plan for my spiritual development. Your mercy guides me.4.  A Prayer for My Wrecked BladderHoly Mother, please do not let me urinate before this congregation of children; allow me to hold it for 90 more minutes until my planning period. My bladder must be the size of a basketball ??? does this suffering bring me closer to your Son? I???m going to pretend it does because my principal has just appeared for a surprise classroom observation. Blessed Mary, witness me crossing my legs ever tighter. Deliver pelvic floor muscles of steel unto me.  Amen.5. A Prayer to Hold Off Job Searching Over Summer VacationIn your sacred name, I pray that I find the fortitude deep, deep within to avoid the temptation of plotting my transition into the private sector this summer. Lord, remind me that I thrive in environments reeking of hand sanitizer, and I would miss looking out over my students??? somewhat eager faces and the way they seem to touch everything on my desk with their germ-laden hands. While you???re at it, please inspire my students to use the aforementioned hand sanitizer. I???d like to be able to use my sick days next year as mental health days ??? in Jamaica. In the name of Jesus Christ I pray.???[Nancy] Drew is not going forward at CBS but is being shopped to other outlets by CBS TV Studios. I hear the pilot tested well but skewed too female for CBS??? schedule.??? ??? Deadline- - -Breaking BadNo women will relate to a show that???s all about men having drug-fueled adventures. Idea: reframe this so the main character is Skyler???s sister, who steals spoons. Skyler herself could be a drug dealer (secondary character). Everyone wonders why she does not spend more time with her son, but she is ???trying to have it all.???

Scrap all of them and reframe it so it is a show about Peggy and Joan running an advertising agency while being best friends. Keep Jon Hamm as a potential love interest. Possible Title: Perfectly Well Adjusted Women.The Big Bang TheoryWomen are 48% more likely than men to have completed graduate school. Will anyone believe that ???men??? are ???smart???? This feels like wish fulfillment to me. Make this show about three female scientists who live in an apartment that is 78% of the size of the current set.True DetectiveAt one point a character asks if it???s possible to love two women. The other character responds, ???I don???t think men can love.??? Typical men. Always jabbering about their feelings. What about if this show featured two women who caught criminals? Just a suggestion.  When a man comes in to say things like ???Can you prove you exist in this room??? they all laugh and then tell him to let them get back to their jobs. They catch the Yellow King in the second episode and the rest of the show is about how they achieve a work-life balance.BaseballWho even are these guys? Are their names numbers? Very weak, repetitive plot. Consider reframing to be about a group of women who bake cakes. One of the cakes can be shaped like a diamond (it???s a square cake turned to the side.)EntourageThis is clearly just a rip-off of Sex and the City.

The last time I came into the country you asked me why I did this. Well, you don???t really pick your own name, right? I mean, my parents picked mine. First, there???s the Latin American tradition of having two last names. Torres and Medina are my last names. Torres belongs to my dad, and Medina to my mom. You know that. You have my info. Then there???s my mom???s desire to give me a slightly different name than my father. Carlos is my dad???s name, and since my mom didn???t want me to be just Carlos Torres like him, she added the Felipe. I like that name.To clarify, my name is Carlos Felipe Torres Medina. But you know that. You have my info. That???s the name on my passport. That???s the name you put in your system and gives you a result that I imagine pops a red flag on your system. I imagine there???s a literal tiny red flag on your screen every time you do this, but I",100
176," can???t know because we are separated by thick glass, and your computer screen has that ???no snooping??? 3M plastic film over it.You???ve never told me who???s the bad guy who shares any combination of my names and makes the little red flag pop up.

Victim of murder in Kodiak, AKIf I did find the person you and your colleagues mistake me for every time I come into the United States, I???d like to clarify that I am not them. Now that we???ve cleared that up, could I ask you for a few things? I know this is probably overstepping my boundaries as a ???non-resident alien,??? but I think it???s worth a try.1. Could you not make fun of my situation if it indeed does happen again? Don???t say stuff like ???Every time? It sure sucks to have your name??? or ???blame your momma and poppa??? (which you did). Maybe you???re just trying to be nice, but when you???re all in uniform and have my passport with my student visa, all my documentation, and all my info, it???s a bit scary.2. Could you not attempt to make small talk about the Hulu show 11.22.63 while you hold my documents? Also, could you not wave all my documents around in your hand as you explain to me why the book???s ending is ???crap????3. Could you not take me to the back room with all the actual criminals?

Like I said: I???m a bougie kid from Latin America.In our last meeting, you joked about my name, then recommended me the Hulu show 11.22.63. You later took me to the back room with the criminals, and when I texted my friends and family about being in the room you said I couldn???t text them. After you gave me back my passport I asked you what I could do so this didn???t happen in the future. You said in your almost too typical Brooklyn accent: ???Change your name! Find a good Jewish girl and marry her. This wouldn???t happen if your name was Felipe Schwartz!??? I guess my question is, do you know of any good Jewish girls who are available? Preferably with the last name Schwartz? If so, call me, you have my info. All of it.Sincerely,Carlos Felipe Torres MedinaMale, 24. WriterLast entered the country December 28th, 2015When it comes to sports, conspiracy theorists play ball. The sacred baseball diamond, hallowed football rectangle, wooden basketball also rectangle, and cold hockey curved rectangle are revered by many, but a conspiracist knows a rectangle always hides a secret and that a diamond is just a wealthy rectangle.What???s the truth behind sports? Why all the games? Where???s all the money go? If there are playoffs, where are the playons? Is bowling truly a sport or have I been lying to my son? How can a number be retired? Doesn???t that affect math and counting?I???ll attempt to answer some of those questions as indirectly as possible by examining the claims of conspiracy theorists, conspiracy debunkers, and then rebunking with my own ramblings. If all goes as planned, this article will be hanging in the Hall of Fame of Truth for all to see and admire before leaving and going to a better, more existent Hall of Fame.- -Conspiracy Claim: Described as the ???Phantom Punch??? incident, Sonny Liston, at the time viewed as an invincible force in the ring, took a fall in a boxing match against Muhammad Ali in order to pay off the debts he owed to the mafia. In the match, Liston was knocked out by a seemingly weak or non-existent ???phantom punch.???Debunking Claim: As history progressed, Ali???s boxing prowess was shown time and time again. It???s not surprising that a seemingly innocent punch took down Liston, especially since it was thrown by perhaps the greatest heavyweight fighter ever and a man who was known for his deceptive jabs.Rebunking Claim: Sonny Liston, like everyone not in the mafia, definitely owed money to the mafia. Of course there are many subsets to the mafia. There???s the Sicilian mafia (La Cosa Nostra), the Japanese mafia (The Yakuza), the Swedish mafia (IKEA), and countless others. Sonny Liston specifically owed money to the Ghost mafia (The Ya-Boo-Za), a group of villainous specters mainly known for using haunted houses as fronts for their illegally spooky activities. Tired of Liston???s promises to pay them back, the Ya-Boo-Za took things into their own transparent hands by betting against him and having their strongest and most able to punch through to the corporeal world ghost knock him out during the Ali fight.- -Conspiracy Claim: NBA commissioner David Stern rigged the 1985 NBA draft so the New York Knicks, a major market team that the league wanted to succeed, would get the first pick and select the phenomenal center Patrick Ewing. The first pick was determined by Stern, who ???randomly??? chose an envelope containing a team???s name and logo. The Knicks??? envelope was placed in a freezer beforehand so Stern could pick it by feeling the cold.Debunking Claim: Only conjecture, and no actual evidence, exists for this claim. If the far-fetched and almost comical ???frozen envelope??? story was true, some form of proof would have surfaced in the 30 years since the draft.Rebunking Claim: The draft was definitely rigged, but how it was rigged has completely been misunderstood. The frozen envelope theory is as far from the truth as Muggsy Bogues is from riding a legitimate rollercoaster. David Stern knew to pick the New York Knicks??? envelope because it was the only one that wasn???t on fire. People often forget that the 1985 NBA draft was sponsored by Duraflame, which is why the flames never drew the suspicion of the basketball world and why Duraflame???s already strong sales numbers truly boomed in 1985.- -Conspiracy Claim: Michael Jordan???s retirement from basketball in 1993 was due to his serious gambling problem. The NBA was going to suspend Jordan from the league, but instead allowed him to say he was retiring to try playing baseball in order to save his, and the league???s, reputation.Debunking Claim: Jordan has stated that he chose to gave baseball a try since his deceased father had always imagined him as a Major League Baseball player. Plus, while Jordan was known as a gambler, no proof has come out that the NBA was going to take any action against him.Rebunking Claim: Jordan left the NBA to play professional baseball because in 1993 the odds were in his favor.- -Conspiracy Claim: On August 14th 1997, Cal Ripken Jr., in the midst of his record consecutive games played streak, found his wife sleeping with mutual friend and actor Kevin Costner. A distressed Ripken Jr. told Baltimore Orioles owner Peter Angelos that he couldn???t play in that night???s game, so Angelos arranged for a power malfunction in the stadium???s lights to postpone the game and allow Ripken Jr.???s streak to continue.Debunking Claim: Both Costner and Ripken Jr. deny this absurd claim. Furthermore, there is proof that Ripken Jr. was at the stadium that night and ready to play the game, so there was no threat of his streak being broken.Rebunking Claim: The lights went out at the stadium because Costner was sleeping with them and caused a malfunction with one of his well known ???Electric Costner Kisses.??? Why would he do that? To pay off his debts to the Y",100

Space Jam depicted real events and a real game of basketball between Michael Jordan, cartoon characters, and aliens.Debunking Claim: What? No! C???mon you know that was a movie. You can???t genuinely believe that was real.Rebunking Claim: It was a movie. Specifically, a documentary about a real basketball game. Why would Michael Jordan play in such a game? Let???s just say he made more than one wager in 1993 and that he, like everyone else, had some mafia debts to pay.When you???re born with a vestigial twin attached to your body, wearing the latest fashions can be a challenge. Do you highlight your twin or hide it? Does it need to breathe? Can it wear stripes?The first thing one must consider is the disposition of your parasitic twin, not only its placement, but its temperament, if it is sentient.Most parasitic twins protrude from the host twin???s midsection. Sometimes it???s just a head, sometimes a profusion of dangling limbs with the head seeming to peer, ostrich-like, into the host twin???s chest cavity as if looking for its glasses.Sometimes you???ll want to hide your kuato, say, for a job interview (non-circus-related) or if you???re meeting your boyfriend???s parents and you???d like to hold off on the kuato reveal till after the brunch plates are cleared away. In this case, empire waists are your friend. They provide room around the stomach and allow for ventilation and easy access in case your twin needs to eat. Other options are billowy blouses, boxy suit jackets, or, if you???re really fashion forward, a cape.If you have another head protruding from your head, you would do well to invest in hats. Sombreros and cloche hats are stylish choices. Turbans less so but they certainly do the trick, and will work for fashionistas with a natural flair for drama. For the extra bold, fascinators are an option, but take care to incorporate your genetic aberration into the look so it won???t seem out of place.But what if you want to highlight your organic passenger? Matching sweater sets are one way. Perhaps the tank for your twin, if it has shoulders, and the sweater for you. Or wear all white or all black and use your kuato to display a splash of color. Conversely, if you don???t want it to steal the show, a signature necklace will draw the eye away from the freakish tiny body sprouting from your stomach.Some parasitic twins are lodged in the back. If that is the case for you, you may choose a sexy leather corset, one that will lift and separate whatever limbs are protruding, especially if your twin is grabby, prone to knocking items off shelves in the grocery store when your back is turned. Kuatos can be mischievous!Overall, know your own proportions and the proportions of your twin. A smooth silhouette may be a pipe dream, but lucky for those of you who are nature???s mistakes, asymmetry is in vogue.Just make sure it???s not too much of a good thing. A little goes a long way when you???re an abomination.One final note: Body-shaping undergarments are probably out of the question. But the good news is, if you???re packing extra pounds, most people will be more distracted by a particular fleshy deposit lurking beneath your rib cage to notice your overall weight. And, if you treat yourself to an extra dessert, you have a cover story built-in. Literally!???I don???t have a TV!??????I never eat meat!??????I walk ten miles a day!??????My diet is making me lose a lot of weight!??????I use my own waste to grow food!??????My children aren???t vaccinated!??????I have a very small carbon footprint!??????I don???t vote ??? the system is too corrupt!???- -I work at a creative development firm. The first big project I worked on from start to finish was a residence for students in Berlin. We aimed to create a place where students could flourish while studying abroad and not be treated like children, as they are in many American dorms. After months of searching, we finally found a beautiful old factory where car console buttons and switches were made ??? a family business that was moving to another location after many generations.We thought we might be able to incorporate some remnants of the building???s previous life into our design, so we asked the family not to throw anything away that they didn???t want. We probably should have been a little more specific ??? there were piles of chairs on every floor, radios still plugged into the wall (one was even playing!), and endless ceiling-high columns of metal boxes packed with car switches.It was overwhelming, but we worked through it, marveling at this grand space that was now our responsibility. The doorknobs were iron, the signs were tin, everything was much more solid and monolithic-seeming than their typical American equivalents. The only thing I took for myself was a brass tab that essentially served as the key fob for a storage closet ??? a big, shiny, engraved slab of metal. Every storage closet had one of these. It has a small hole drilled through one side (that???s the one I threaded through my key ring) and a large hole on the other side for the key to the closet, so a janitor could easily thread all of the closets??? keys onto one large ring.It???s my way or the highway. That???s just how things work around here. Maybe you thought there would be more options, but there are only two. To be honest, though, the highway is faster. If you???re in a rush, I would recommend the highway.The highway also has places to stop for food and recreation. I???ve found some of my favorite restaurants along the highway. For many years I???ve been a fan of Chorito???s Burritos, which is a burrito chain I first discovered on the highway. I often recommend Chorito???s to friends and colleagues, many of whom agree it???s one of the better highway-adjacent burrito chains.But in terms of current options, it???s my way or the highway. Your choice. Just keep in mind this country has a rich history of highway travel, owing largely to the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956. And it???s totally up to you, but the Highway Act was perhaps Eisenhower???s greatest legacy, creating 41,000 miles of highway throughout the United States. This infrastructure is one of America???s key domestic assets, and a great way to discover a variety of roadside amenities, such as Chorito???s and other similar restaurants.Again, my way is also an option. But the highway is an integral part of our culture, and holds a special place in the American mythos. We built much of our post-war identity around car travel, embracing the sense of individuality and self-determination that it carried. So it???s really your choice, but that act of traversing the country along those newly built highways echoed the frontier spirit and wagon trains of days gone, while pointing forward to a new and exciting era of technology.Truthfully, I???ve been spending a lot of time on the highway. Maybe my way doesn???t seem so great anymore. Maybe I???m trying to channel the past through these winding monuments to our recent history. Or maybe I???m just chasing the thrill of that first Chorito burrito.Really, though, it???s up to you.In the state of Kansas, it is illegal to catch a fish with your bare hands.In Vermont, vanity license plates may not contain personal info, such as names or a phone number.In Colorado, it is actually illegal to murder your roommate, no matter what they did or failed to do.Technically, in Alaska you cannot sell burned CD???s of The Beatles??? music and claim that you composed all the songs yourself.Don???t even bother driving over the speed limit in Montana ??? you could be subject to a hefty fine.Live in Okl",100

On behalf of the entire U.S. Education system, I apologize for its failure. Perhaps you were denied competent educators as a youth. Perhaps your teachers lectured on [blowjobs/cunnilingus] instead of [the 1942 Battle of Midway/mitochondria/the Unit Circle]. If true, this is a wild misappropriation of government resources and should be adapted into a [screenplay/TV series/podcast/visual album/Moth story].

Perhaps you believe that by simply being in my presence, your child will [herself/himself/themselves] become queer. That my [gender expression/lifestyle choices/lust for genitalia generally similar to my own] will possesses your child to join the [rainbow brigade/gay persuasion/kweer klub]. To this I say: Wow.

I was good at it, but it didn???t mean that it felt good,??? she said. ???We got into some gnarly stuff. When you think of hospital security, you see someone sitting behind a desk looking at a camera, sitting on their ass. That was just not the fucking job. A lot of my coworkers were former military or aspiring cops. We???d get a call, and it???d be a nurse or doctor, telling us someone???usually it was a man???was being super combative, and it was time to restrain him,??? said Amy, who is 5???5??? with an average build. ???You wouldn???t always know the reason that person was acting that way. There were weird dynamics. The nurses got hurt the most, because they were usually the first in contact, and the majority of them were women,??? she said. ???I had to be calm when things were going south really quickly. A big thing was earning the respect of my colleagues. I had to prove to the guys that I???m someone to rely upon in a fight. That was the hardest thing, giving off that coolness. Like, pretending you???re not afraid when some big dude is in your face is threatening to kick your ass. Calling for backup so you don???t get hurt. Trying to protect other staff from getting harmed,??? she said.???It was a crazy, crazy job, but it was really practical for me, in a way. I needed the work, and it had all these great benefits,??? said Amy. She???d found the opening due to Harborview???s affiliation with the University of Washington, where she???d wished to enroll. ???If you???re interested in childbirth-education, UW is like a mecca. I never ended up going there, but I???d been trying to get into their system for the sake of tuition reimbursements. I???d applied to so many jobs, I???d kinda forgotten about them all. When I got the call-back, it was like, ???Of all the fucking things, this is gonna be the one??????? she said.This was over three years ago, and while Amy no longer does security work, her dreams have stayed consistent. On the phone with me today, Amy mentions she eventually left Seattle and returned to Boston, where she???s from, and now she???s a medical assistant at an obstetrics-and-gynaecology practice. ???It???s kind of an incremental job. I???m not attending birth. That???s a little bit sad, but I???ll get there,??? she says. Before this, trying stuff out, Amy picked up work as a doula. ???Think of it like this: the midwife or an obstetrician is below the waist, and the doula is above the waist, helping to manage pain and using comfort measures, like massage,??? she says. She assisted with five births in this capacity. The experiences were ???momentous,??? and they gelled her larger goals. ???I want to be a certified nurse midwife so I can deliver babies and provide excellent cultural, confident, and compassionate care,??? she says. Much of this ideology stems from a desire to protect women from what Amy perceives as harsh practices in our standardized medical systems. Amy recalls a conversation she???d initiated with her mother, as an example. ???I???d asked about her birthing experience, and what she described",100
179," sounded so terrible. She???d had to get an episiotomy. That???s when they cut the entrance to your vagina at the bottom. It???s preemptive???for when you???re going to tear. But cutting in a straight line goes against the nature of a tear. Tears don???t go in a straight line, because the muscle and the tissue aren???t laid out in a straight line. So whenever you cut like that, you???re not gonna heal as well,??? she says. Amy believes there were other options, but ???the doctor told my mom, ???That???s what has to happen, and that???ll make it easier, and you???ll get sewn back up,??? and she agreed,??? says Amy. ???The doctors don???t explain it, and people don???t have a ton of information, so they go with the flow.???Amy has jarring stories about other maternity procedures, but we set them aside to begin our talk about the night she witnessed a shooting at the Twilight Exit. As mentioned, Amy was employed as a security guard in an emergency room. ???I was scheduled to cover the night shift, which was always insanity. Earlier I???d had crazy insomnia, so I???d gone to see Ghostbusters II at Central Cinema. I was gonna go home and take a power nap before I went in to work. But then I thought, ???I am super awake, and I never get to go to karaoke on Sundays,??? so I rode my bike to the Twilight. I planned to just ride up to Harborview after, in time for my shift. It started at 11,??? she said. In the lounge, Amy picked a stool along the bar. ???I sat right in the center. Whitney was to my left. I???d never seen her before, but I remember her because she smelled like a whole lotta pot. It was hilarious. She was this tiny little thing. A bartender and I were giggling about how stoned she was,??? said Amy. ???Christian was to my right. That was the first night I met him. He???s so friendly and cute and interesting and smart. I???m just gonna say it, I was flirting hard. I was acting super engaged, and I had my body turned to him.???Amy didn???t notice the man, James, as he approached Whitney at the bar. ???I remember hearing raised voices behind me. The guy was saying something about, ???My dog. You set me up.??? It was just so aggressive, the way he was talking to her. He was just, like, in her face. He seemed so much bigger than she was. I don???t know if he grabbed her or not. I was like, ???No, no, no. This is not going down. This is not gonna be ok. This is not gonna fly while I???m sitting right here.??? My brain went into what I do at work. I went shooting up. I was like, ???Is there a problem here???? I stood right in front of her. I was puffing up, I was doing what I do. I got in between them, then Greg came over and he said to me, like, ???Oh, it???s ok. Don???t worry about it.?????? As Greg gathered James and steered him away, ???I remember looking at Greg and giving him direct eye contact and giving, like, a weird head nod. I was still standing as he walked James out,??? she said. Right after, Amy attempted to check in with Whitney. ???I just remember being like, ???So what was that about???? and she was like, ???I have absolutely no idea who that was. I???ve never seen him.??? That didn???t sit right. I didn???t believe her. The argument was so intense. Why the hell would he act that way to a stranger? And why would she lie about it???? said Amy.The exchange still haunts Amy, ???especially whenever I???d think about their fucking baby at home. There was a fucking baby at home, by itself. Like: What!??? she said. ???I think in general, it made me much warier of people and their intentions. Now I listen to my gut, and if it feels like something is off, then I???m not giving the benefit of the doubt,??? she said. In the months after the shooting, Amy would struggle with her complicated reaction to Whitney. ???I definitely identify as a feminist, but I was angry with her a long time, even for as much as she???d gone through. All I could think was, ???You could???ve just fucking said what went down, but you couldn???t implicate yourself in doing wrong. You could???ve taken responsibility, but you were being a fucking coward. You brought hell into a space, and you didn???t let anyone know who coulda, like, tried to help,?????? said Amy. ???I know it???s all just misplaced anger, but it???s true.???Back to the bar. Amy turned away from Whitney, shook off the uneasiness, and continued her pursuit of Christian, ???but I got zero game,??? she said. ???Later I think he said he had a girlfriend, and I was like, ???Oh, OK.??? It was cool. I was kinda like, ???I???m not gonna feel bad about this, or feel like I got rejected,?????? she said. Amy put in a karaoke request, and though she can???t remember what song she picked, her collection of favorites include Nu Shooz???s ???I Can???t Wait,??? Franz Ferdinand???s ???Take Me Out,??? and Fleetwood Mac???s ???Silver Springs.??? Twenty minutes passed uneventfully, until James fired his gun at Greg in the alleyway just outside the bar???s entrance.???I was just like, ???What the fuck. That is so weird. Why would I be hearing that sound???? I didn???t know what it was. It didn???t register. And then Natalie came in, and she looked freaked out of her fucking mind. She looked horrified. From the point of her being like, ???Everyone get the fuck down,??? I just read her body language. I was just like, ???Oh my fucking god.??? The feeling was unreal,??? said Amy.When Amy realized the shooter was James, ???my first thought was, ???He???s gonna remember me interfering. He???s gonna remember me getting in his face, and he???s gonna shoot me. I need to hide.??? I got up from my chair and started to walk towards the door. Everything just got weird and slow. Things got soupy. I wasn???t being logical. I wasn???t thinking ahead. I was literally standing right in the middle of the bar, and then I cowered under a wall, under this little ledge where people set their drinks. Where I chose to hide made no sense. I was, like, super hiding in plain sight,??? she said. (Her behavior recalls a passage from David Cullen???s Columbine, describing the surviving students and staff as they were discovered. Many were crouching and ???plainly visible under cafeteria tables.???)???I had my phone on me, and I???d started dialing 911, but I stopped. I thought if he saw me trying to make a call, he???d shoot me,??? she said. As James approached Amy on his way to the lounge, ???I was crouched, so I couldn???t see his face. I could only see his legs and his arms and the gun. I remember smelling the gun powder. It was so sharp and strong. I was like, ???This is really fucking happening. This is the due. He???s gonna remember me being Billy Bad Ass. He???s gonna shoot me in my fucking face.??? I had this really weird response to that. I got this stupid smile on my face. It was almost like when you feel the giggles are coming on.???Fuck you!Get the fuck away from my shit!I???ll fuck you up, asshole!Imma gonna bury this fucking nut right here!Where???s my fucking nut?Hey babe, wanna fuck?Where the fuck are you going?Get off my fucking lawn!I???m just yelling for the fuck of it!Dog?Even though I exist only to convey the fact that people would like to see someone else lead the country, I still exist. Indeed, one could just count the votes and let the result stand for itself. One could use a piece of paper, or even write it on the back of their hand. Once could even ask, Why use a delegate at all?I ask the same question every day.Yet here I am, a purely symbolic symbol. Not symbolic like the Queen, whose face and body and shiny crown have real weight and must be clothed and transported and photographed. I mean purely symbolic ??? I function only as a vessel for",100
180," a numerical outcome, an echo of others??? decisions. Even the numbers themselves have greater personality, as any episode of Sesame Street can attest.The gap between myself and a superdelegate is like the difference between a man and a superman. No, that???s too narrow of a gap. It???s more like the difference between a man and a supernova ??? no, an empty bowl and the Super Bowl.Supers not only have the right to choose who they vote for, they can ignore the will of an overwhelming majority of voters as well. Some see this as a flaw in the electoral system, but I see it as a raucous celebration of the human spirit.Oh, how I wish I were a Super.I was elected, you know. Well, actually, you probably don???t know that. You see, years ago you stood in the election booth and, if you knew what delegates were at all, you voted for the first name on the ballot: me. Or did I run unopposed? I cannot remember. There is no written record of my campaigns, that???s how inconsequential they were. I am like a tiny mechanism in the Rube Goldberg machine of elections, except that even if it fails it bears no consequence on the next step. Keep in mind that the importance of each element is the entire point of Rube Goldberg machines.Did you know that I can vote in House committees? I can vote in House committees. This might seem like a powerful privilege, but when the bill goes to the floor, I am shunted back so that the real representatives can use language to debate the bill and vote on it. Most of my fellow delegates choose to remain in their stasis chambers until primary season.What desires for power and glory led me here, to haunt democracy without affecting it, like a ghost janitor? I do not remember. I am the shadow of a dream of a hope of a flower from a dandelion, floating into obscurity. I am a delegate.1. Why did you choose to pursue a degree in Medieval Studies now?I???ll admit that Medieval Studies hasn???t always been the hippest area of study. True, it is unlikely that any of us will live to see the day that there is a waiting list for any undergraduate Medieval Studies courses. And yes, my field will never hold the same clout among college freshman as say West African Dance or Postcolonial Semiotics.There???s no need to despair, though! You see, we medievalists like to think of our field as the kale of academia! Remember a few years ago when most people hadn???t even heard of kale? Or if they had they were like, ???Ew what is THAT? No, under absolutely no circumstances am I adding that as a topping to our pizza!??? And then overnight everyone started throwing kale into smoothies and unironically bringing kale salads to the annual employee softball party.You know when you find a hole-in-the-wall dim-sum place where you think, ???This place is either going to be really authentic or give me seriously debilitating diarrhea for the rest of the week???? Medieval Studies is that hole in the wall! It???s academia???s best kept secret and this is an truly exciting time in the field???s progression!2. What kind of training will you receive during your Medieval Studies graduate level program?During my studies I will have the opportunity to become fluent in and translate ancient, nearly defunct languages that have been neglected and now run the risk of being forgotten by generations to come. These languages include: Middle English, Old English, Old Norse, Old French, Old Irish, Latin.3. So, dead languages? While your sister is learning Spanish on top of her Law School coursework in order to become a pro bono ESL tutor for at-risk youth, you???re going to be poring multiple years of your life into languages that people don???t even have conversational knowledge of anymore?Well, uh??? yeah. I guess that???s accurate.4. Will you be able to discuss your research and coursework with friends outside of your Medieval Studies program?A UC Berkeley study was published last year and estimates that I should be able to have meaningful conversations about my field of study with about .08% of the general population. The exciting finding from this study is that this number has risen slightly by several hundredths of a decimal in the past few years since HBO first started airing Game of Thrones!5. What areas do students focus on in a Medieval Studies program?Graduate students are given an amazing amount of independence to explore their interests and specialize within the growing field of Medieval Studies. Some general areas of interest include (but are not limited to!) the Mystery Cycles, Geoffrey of Monmouth???s L???Histoire des rois de Bretagne, biblical exegesis, Breton lais, the history of heraldry, royal annals and charters, the works of Chr??tien de Troyes, along with the decline of inflectional morphology.6. I consider myself to be an educated and well-read person, yet have little/no understanding of the topics listed above. I am now concerned that this field of study is more obscure than I initially imagined. Could you list more topics of study within the field of Medieval Studies?Every scholastic field is bound to appear somewhat esoteric to those outside academia. This is a common misconception, however. I can assure you that Medieval Studies is no more ???obscure,??? as you put it, than Applied Mathematics or the emerging field of 18th century North American Garden Studies. All the same, with pleasure I will list off a few more examples of study within my field:Arthurian legend, archaeology of French monasticism, kingship during the Great Schism, hagiography and Lollardy.7. La-what?Lollardy.8. That sounds like a Teletubby character.I think you???re probably getting confused with the yellow Teletubby, Lala. In any case, Lollardy has absolutely nothing to do with children???s television, so I???m not even sure why we???re discussing it.9. Are you making this thing up?No! Why would I even do that?! Countless scholars spend their entire career contributing to this field of study. In fact, several universities have expressed interest in creating separate sub-departments that focus their research almost entirely on Lollardy. Seriously, google it. There???s an entire Wikipedia page on this.10. Do you watch Game of Thrones??! You must love Game of Thrones!No.11. I was assigned to read Sir Gawain and the Green Knight over the summer, but did not and will not because I would much rather spend my time watching re-runs of The Real Housewives of New Jersey. Will you write my 10th grade English essay?Since completing my degree, nearly 90% of my income is made up of requests such as yours. I???m happy to announce that I will be expanding my essay catalogue this Fall and will begin offering papers on the following: Chaucer???s Canterbury Tales, Beowulf, and ???Serf???s Up, Dude: A 3 page, 7th grade Explanation of Feudalism.??? Please allow 3-5 business days for essays to be completed, proof read and sent by postage.12. What have you been up to since completing your PhD/MA in Medieval Studies?For the past six months I have been splitting my time between a highly sought after (albeit, unpaid) social media internship and Fro-Yo World where I currently work as a Flavors and Toppings Attendant.13. Do you have any plans this Friday? I???m going to a super cool, exclusive party and was wondering??????I would LOVE to go!14. You didn???t let me finish. I was wondering if you could DVR Game of Thrones for me tonight? (Because I know you???ll already be watching it alone anyway.)See answer to #10.- - -Emily Carr says she ???writes murder mysteries that turn into love poems that are sometimes (by her McSweeney???s editors, for example) called divorce poems.??? She has lived all over the world and is the author",100
181," of several collections and chapbooks of poems. After she got an MFA in poetry from the University of North Carolina-Wilmington, she took a doctorate in ecopoetics at the University of Calgary. These days, she???s the program director of the low-residency MFA in creative writing at Oregon State University-Cascades.Carr recently spoke over email with McSweeney???s editors Dominic Luxford and Jesse Nathan about her newest book,Whosoever Has Let a Minotaur Enter Them, Or a Sonnet???, the eleventh volume in the McSweeney???s Poetry Series.- -McSWEENEY???S: If your poetry were an animal, what kind of animal would it be?EMILY CARR: During some recent group therapy, the facilitator asked us to list our three favorite animals, in order. Mine were the mermaid, the minotaur, & the pterodactyl. Which somewhat???& not surprisingly???stumped the facilitator. According to her lesson plan, the first animal represents how you want to be seen in the world, the second animal how you are actually perceived in the world, & the third animal is how you actually are. It???s best, I think, not to think too much about what these animals say about my personality. They might, however, offer some useful insight into my poetry, which, I must admit, I mostly get out of the way of. Which is to say: not knowing what I???m doing is pretty much how I get the work done. I???m a firm believer that craft comes before theory & that what theory is useful for is reverse engineering the moves that were made intuitively???&/or desperately!???during the act of creation.McSWEENEY???S: How does the Tarot inform your work?EMILY CARR: Mostly what happens, when I try to write a narrative, is that things go sideways. I???m always trying to tell a story, but I???m horrible with plot. & the Tarot is a really useful coach: it tells a story with enough flexibility that you can manipulate it to serve pretty much any purpose.McSWEENEY???S: What do you mean you???re horrible with plot?EMILY CARR: I like to say that I???m always trying to write a murder mystery but I accidentally end up with a book of poems. My unpublished Tarot novel, for example, came about because I thought I would write a choose-your-own-adventure murder mystery. Which is ridiculously ambitious for a poet who doesn???t, for the most part, get plot. But I was rescued when an old friend???a fiction writer???sent me a care package with a Tarot deck, some Elvis magnets, a homemade ceramic owl, and some really ugly princess figurines.McSWEENEY???S: And what happened?EMILY CARR: So it???s 2010, I???m in Florida: I???ve just finished my dissertation & I???ve run away from critical theory, the Canadian Rockies, & my husband. I am alone, I have no one but the black cat named Dirt & nothing but a red folding bike & my writing nest (which involves??? (which involves a few throw pillows, some potted plants, the ugly princess figurines, a photograph of the writer as a soon-to-be sunburnt divorcee with a snapping turtle, the Elvis magnets & the owl, a collection of lost pennies, some strawberry-flavoured matches & all of Agatha Christie???s romance novels, Joy Williams??? Breaking & Entering, a tattered copy of Plath???s The Colossus & Other Poems, & three beeswax candlesticks from the farmer???s market over by the coffee shop with late night waffles & cheap Old Chubs) & a red folding bike, everyday I am combing the sea from my beautiful, salty uncut hair the water so blue I think I must be dead???This is where I???m writing from: I am twenty-nine. I have a brand-new PhD & a first book I don???t know how to take care of. I am taking off my wedding ring. I am putting my marriage in a BandAid box, I am putting on a facemask & looking at the baffled guileless heart of the sea, this lavish fiction???You see how easy it is, how necessary, that I should turn to the Tarot, that there should be not one story but many stories, which is a maneuver borrowed from Proust: the freedom to escape the story you are telling, & return to it???McSWEENEY???S: How do you mean?EMILY CARR: I think the Tarot is what Jen Bervin calls a happy accident. It???s become, over the last half decade, something of a life coach, too. It???s a source of narrative. A structure. It???s a parlor game that helps to flesh out a character or two when you???re trying to escape that incorrigible tyrant, the narrative ???I.??? It???s a useful strategy for relinquishing control without turning everything over to the readers. & I???d even go out on a limb & say the Tarot can be a helpful research tool, particularly when handling subjects that are, say, culturally over-determined to the point where the caricature has consumed the personality.McSWEENEY???S: What is the crisis???or one of them???at the heart of your Minotaur poems?EMILY CARR: Minotaur is an answer in need of a question. If there is a crisis at the heart of these poems, it???s just that: I???m falling out of love, & I don???t know it yet. In a recent ???On Being??? interview with Krista Tippett, David Whyte puts it far more eloquently: in these poems, I am overhearing myself saying things I didn???t want to know about the world, or about myself.Minotaur was originally the third section of my dissertation, which means I composed it around 2008 or 2009. I ran away from my husband in 2010. In December 2013, I got divorced. In January 2014, McSweeney???s accepted the manuscript for publication & in early 2015, I believe, we worked together to finalize the collection for publication. It wasn???t until that moment that I started thinking about these poems in relation to my divorce, & falling out of love. So elegy, too, is a crisis at the heart of these poems; again, to borrow from Whyte, it???s a conversation between grief & celebration, between the past & the future, between what we know & what we can???t ever know (still) (again). It???s the shock of becoming the kind of person who??? That acute moment of letting go???of the persons we hoped to be, or the lives we were supposed to live. & accepting that we have failed. The reality that, though an experiment we will never (quite) master, life is worth living.In ???Questionnaire in January,??? from her latest book, C.D. Wright asks if poetry is a place to suffer formally. I don???t honestly know what poetry is to me???it might be a place to suffer formally. It might also be a place, as Whyte puts it, to greet the unknown with the willingness to change. Or the willingness to be changed. A colleague of mine says that if you enter into an ethical relationship with a text you have to put yourself in the position in which you might be changed. I quote this notion often, but I rarely think about the pain, & difficulty, & vulnerability involved in that sort of change. But as I???m thinking about it now (thank you for asking), I wonder if that???s my Minotaur???a book that, quite literally, changed my life profoundly, without asking permission, or if I was ready, or if I even wanted change. Someday I???ll think of this as a happy accident, too. For now: the grief of having fallen out of love without meaning to is still, in my life as I am living it, an answer in need of a question.McSWEENEY???S: Can you tell us what ???ecopoetics??? is?EMILY CARR: The first thing you should know is that I can???t???won???t???speculate about the field. I can, however, offer up some thoughts about my own little piece of real estate, which is twelve hundred square feet of high desert that is currently undergoing a low-tech lyric version of xero-scaping, which means I???ve just torn out all of the grass & there???s a sod-monster currently guarding my front steps.That said: lately I???m most inspired by Robin Wall Kimmerer, who???s ",100
182,"fighting to replace the language of sustainability???which is based on the formula that we can keep taking from the earth in perpetuity???with the language of reciprocity: acts of care that don???t hinge on whether the earth loves us back, as well as acts of gratituI was watching a video of a terrier harassing a robot when I saw the news reports about Ingrid Lyne. The Seattle mother of three had disappeared while on her first date with a man she???d met online. Her dismembered body was found several days later. The alleged killer had a long criminal history, including attempted aggravated robbery, and his parents had previously filed a restraining order against him. He???s currently being held on $5 million bail.Behold the modern marvel of the internet: a medium that enthralls us with videos of cats riding Roombas, yet also poses a significant threat to our very lives.Lyne???s death is not unique. Though such violent crimes are rare, there are 7.2 billion people in the world, and roughly 40% of them are online. In any group of 2.9 billion people, you???re bound to find some who aren???t very nice, and the internet makes it easier than ever to meet them. In February, for example, two tourists in Australia were brutally assaulted by a man who answered their online request for a ride from Adelaide to Melbourne. Last fall, a young man in Detroit was robbed, beaten, and strangled by someone he met online. Such stories are becoming commonplace, as are the constant warnings about child predators. Ever day, scammers crack passwords and drain bank accounts, or spoof phone numbers and talk unwitting targets into handing over the loot voluntarily. In short, all the dangers of the real world also exist online. They may pose an even greater risk there, since the nature of online interaction encourages us to feel we know others better than we really do.Managing risk online calls for the same skills we use offline: Learning about the history of people or organizations before trusting them. Observing someone???s interactions with others to detect unhealthy behaviors. Limiting our exposure to those we don???t know well, or who treat us disrespectfully. Those skills aren???t always easy to deploy, but they are fairly straightforward, and we can strengthen them with practice. However, they aren???t easily commodified. Just ask anyone who teaches personal safety for a living: helping people work on their assertiveness skills is an even tougher sell than getting them to see the dentist.What is easy to sell? ???Internet security,??? as marketed by Fear, Inc., consists primarily of products that protect our livelihoods rather than our lives. Hardware encryption is a $296 billion market worldwide. Anti-virus software for home computer owners, which promises to keep our machines free of malware, is also a big-ticket item. Norton antivirus products alone generate about half a billion dollars per year. And for nervous parents, there are subscription services that will let you control your kids??? online activity.Ads for all these products rely heavily on images of badges, shields and locks. Blue is their color of choice???a subliminal melding of law enforcement???s traditional hue with IBM???s ???Big Blue??? aesthetic. Marketing for these products tends to contrast the chaotic nature of online environments???their risks too many and too diverse to comprehend???with the simplicity of the service being sold. One simple payment can resolve all your worries.Do we get our money???s worth? On an average week last year, U.S. businesses suffered 160 successful cyber attacks. Among the most recent cases to make the news, hackers have purloined user data from major health insurers like Anthem and Blue Cross; from Forbes.com; web hosting site Github, domain registry Register.com; Penn State; and, of course, Ashley Madison. About thirty percent of America???s personal computers are infected with malware. Things would no doubt be worse without some of the products Fear, Inc. is selling, yet despite the money we???re spending, we???re hardly ???secure.???Significantly, a lot of online security crises aren???t even related to the products we buy or don???t buy. They???re related to behavioral mistakes we make, like using weak passwords, or sending information to the wrong email address. There???s a substantial gap between the way we???re advised to behave online???don???t open email attachments from people you don???t know, don???t use public Wi-Fi, change your passwords often, etc. ???and what we actually do. That gap exists because we???re lazy, and because deep down, we???d like to believe that the internet really holds nothing more sinister than cat videos. But the gap is exacerbated by people who model and encourage risky behavior. Sometimes that encouragement comes from the very industries trying to sell us security.Which brings us to LifeLock.LifeLock Inc. (NYSE:LOCK) is a service that purports to safeguard your personal information from theft. Their name is a good example of the way Fear, Inc. conflates online ???identity??? with personal safety. LifeLock doesn???t protect your life; it protects your assets. For many years its chief marketing ploy was to splash the Social Security number of co-founder and Executive Vice Chairman Todd Davis on billboards, web ads, and the side of a truck which was featured in LifeLock TV commercials. The company???s message was clear: Even though ???an identity is stolen every three seconds,??? LifeLock will prevent any harm that might befall you due to identity theft.As it happens though, Davis??? Social Security number (it???s 457-55-5462, if you were curious) has been stolen at least thirteen times. In many of those cases, Davis was apparently unaware that his identity had been stolen until collection agencies started calling him. This would seem to disprove the company???s messaging about how devastating identity theft is. In fact, Davis made a lot more money by shouting his Social Security number from the rooftops than he lost from its theft. He started LifeLock with $2 million in seed funding, and it now has total assets of $146 million. So maybe the lesson here is that it???s possible to strike a balance between security and productive activity online.Maybe???but if so, LifeLock hasn???t found that balance quite yet. In 2010, the Federal Trade Commission determined that Davis??? cavalier treatment of his own personal information was mirrored by his company???s laissez-faire approach to customer data. LifeLock???s services ???did not prevent identity theft and did not provide many of the protections claimed by Defendants.??? The FTC fined LifeLock $12 million and placed it under a federal court order to properly secure its customers??? data and stop lying in its ads.Given five years to correct these problem, LifeLock either failed, or decided not to try. Late last year, the FTC slapped the company with a $100 million fine for violating the previous court order. This is presumably why, if you visit Lifelock???s website today, you won???t see Davis??? Social Security number. You will see a lot of claims, like ???1 in 4 people have experienced identity theft,??? a statistic from an online survey that LifeLock paid for. You???ll see comforting language about monitoring ""over a trillion data points a day??? with ???3 layers of protection??? and ???Identity Restoration Specialists.??? And you???ll see footnotes??? tiny, inconspicuous footnotes???that say things like ???LifeLock does not monitor all transactions at all businesses??? and ???Phone alerts made during normal business hours,??? and my favorite, in gray print on a gray background, at the very bottom of e",100
183,"very page: ???No one can prevent all identity theft.???If you???re persuaded by LifeLock???s claims that ???identity theft is America???s fastest growing crime,??? and ???everything you own could be at stake,??? you can choose from three different Lifelock plans: Standard, Advantage, and Ultimate Plus, ranging from $9.99 to $29.99 monthly (plus tax). You also have the option of purchasing LifeLock Junior for your kids (only $5.99 a month). In addition to forking over the cash for this protection, you???ll need to provide the company with your social security number, birth date, bank account information, credit card numbers, driver???s license number, insurance information, address, email address, phone numbers, and your mother???s maiden name. You have to provide this information over an internet connection, to a company that has repeatedly been proven to disregard basic online safety protocols like encrypting data, limiting access to sensitive information, applying security patches to its network, and installing antivirus software.Some four million people have been perfectly willing to entrust their personal data to LifeLock, a fact that seems incredible until you recall that the most popular password in use online is ???password.???Another reason LifeLock has four million customers is that companies suffering large data breaches often give victims a free subscription to such services. This happened to a friend of mine, not once but twice. In both cases, she was signed up without her knowledge or permission. Oddly enough, discovering this did not make her feel more secure.There is an inherent tension Fear, Inc. must manage when selling online safety: To separate us from our money, companies need to cultivate our sense of vulnerability. ???Scammers are everywhere,??? this message runs. ???Trust no one!??? But the merchants of fear must also convince us they are worthy of our trust. ???We???re OK though!??? the message continues. ???You can tell because our logos are blue.??? The goal is a consumer anxious to spend, and willing to turn a blind eye to the inherent risk of the transaction itself.LifeLock, like many of the companies that make up Fear, Inc., is creating a more frightened public via their marketing. At the same time, they???re distorting our perception of trustworthiness, and conditioning us to be more careless about our safety. ???About 50 million U.S. consumers spent $3.5 billion in 2010 to buy products that are claimed to protect their identity,??? according to Consumer Reports. ???But do-it-yourself safeguards are just as effective as paid services.???Yes, we???re lazy, and our passwords suck, and sometimes we click on email attachments we shouldn???t. But we can improve. We can construct better passwords, review our privacy settings, and cultivate a healthy skepticism toward emails that sound too good to be true.Or we can pay someone to say they???re being responsible on our behalf. Maybe they will be. There???s really no way to know until something goes wrong.

First of all, I would cross out the tedious sections ??? who remembers their social security number anyway? ??? and replace everything with one blessedly short essay:What I lack in my combined SAT score, I gain in being not white. If admitted, I will be that pop of color in your classroom. I will expand your perspectives in a nonthreatening way. I will pose for your promotional pamphlets and man booths at your diversity open houses. I will keep my cool as people ask me stupid things like, ???Do you wear your headscarf in the shower????All jokes aside, applying to college as a minority student is supposed to be wildly ??? perhaps",100
184," even unfairly ??? advantageous. While the Supreme Court is pondering the constitutionality of affirmative action in US v. Texas, I can???t help but consider its applications in my personal life:How much of my relative success in the college admissions process can be explained away by my identity as an African-American Muslim?As the college admissions process becomes more competitive, it also becomes less recognizable. No matter how calculated your inputs are, how over-accomplished and underrepresented you may be, the output is not guaranteed. Our senior class learned this firsthand in the past months. Let???s just say that for many of us, Ivy Day ??? the day on which all Ivies release their admissions decisions en masse ??? proved more harrowing than Judgment Day could ever be.I won???t ever know the extent to which my more immutable characteristics factored (or didn???t factor) into my acceptances. But this logic hasn???t prevented me from slipping into my own sort of guilty purgatory, the one that belies many of my accomplishments. With about as much frequency as my hijab flip flops between ???asset??? and ???curse,??? I switch between feeling fiercely self-righteous and cripplingly insecure about the way that affirmative action has (presumably unfairly) expanded my academic opportunities.On days when I adopt the former mentality, I???m thinking of the struggles I???ve experienced as the daughter of parents who are utterly unfamiliar with the American education system. I???m thinking of my mom coming home crying from work one day after being called ???ISIS.??? Of the endless parade of post 9/11 discrimination and helicopter surveillance that she and I must always try to keep ahead of. On these days, I feel that an extra boost in my educational trajectory is the least that is owed to me, and to individuals like me.On other days, I can???t help but wonder: do I 100% deserve anything I???ve ever achieved? Am I violating our coveted notion of a meritocracy by simply being me? And in the context of this very column series: Am I really a writer, or do I just have a compelling story to tell a white audience ??? and is there a difference?Last summer, I was accepted to a prestigious summer law internship while two of my white male friends were not. After we all debriefed, one of them half-jokingly concluded that he was rejected on account of being white. I laughed it off awkwardly, but this moment ??? which I???ve come to associate with my internship and that entire summer ??? symbolizes the most undermining insecurity I have about myself.What if his assessment was spot-on?I can picture one of the program supervisors laying our applications on the table, reading them, discovering three smart kids from the same smart school, and slapping a post-it over mine: best sob story. Or, since we were required to submit a photo ID: haven???t had a hijabi in the program in 10+ years. Or perhaps: Ethnically ambiguous. Will look good next to the District Attorney during the photo shoot. Might improve NYPD/community relations.I tried to reassure myself that my acceptance had simply followed from my intelligence and determination. Surely it was my essay or teacher recommendation that sealed the deal, and not my background information. But was it my mastery of the English language that won them over, or the fact that I wrote about how being victimized by Islamophobia birthed my interest in social justice? Was it my mind blowing classroom skills that distinguished my recommendation, or was it my token standout role during the Islam Unit?This is the mentality I keep coming back to on my darkest days. I wonder if perhaps I???ve become too accustomed to playing the token; the tour guide to a third world I???m not entirely familiar with; the pundit of a religion for which I am not a scholar. If perhaps I???ve said, done, and been too much; if I???ve taken up too much space. If I???ve become too willing to flatten myself to a MY NAME IS: HIJABI name tag.At around the same time as my summer internship, I first heard the expression that warns against bringing religion or politics to a dinner party. I remember smirking ??? by that standard, I might as well be walking into every function with jazz hands and a dunce cap.Truthfully, my college applications were probably similar to my internship applications. This is not damning evidence, considering that all of those applications were written by the same person. Me. It makes sense that I can trace most of my choices, accomplishments, and extracurricular activities to me, and the background that has shaped me. (Not to mention that institutions always share the most basic prompts, and applying to most places seems to be more of an exercise in copy/pasting than anything else.)What it seems to boil down to ??? and honestly, when does it not? ??? is intolerance, and a consistent lack of diversity across the board.Is it really my fault that every time I apply to an internship or a job ??? heck, that every time I exist in a public space ??? I am toggling the minority card? Is it really my fault that every time I speak about anything as a hijabi, I???m automatically taken as an authority and an activist because, in some circles, the world is just that narrow? That our whitewashed literary/publishing communities ??? reflective of American society as a whole ??? have reinforced the idea that people in my position have some sort of awkward monopoly on their lived experiences? (I heard one chilling story at a recent event about how, when one black woman tried to publish her book of essays, she met the same refrain from publishers: we already have a Roxane Gay.)No, of course it is not my fault.Sometimes I have to force myself to remember that I should not blame myself for my environment or how it perceives me. That, for the record, I have gained recognition for pieces that weren???t personal all, pieces that starred white protagonists because writing about a character similar to myself again seemed selfish and tacky. That even as my most insecure self, I was worthy. That I am not the only woman of color to forget about and invalidate her accomplishments, to be cowed into apologizing for her presence and the black ripples it may pulse through a white world.???Here Comes Your Manager??????Where Is My Time???????There Goes My Fun??????Lame??????Monkey Home by Seven??????I Read??????Oh My Collie!??????Wave of Mutual Fund Taxation??????Break My Body???GAME SHOW HOST: Welcome to Eye Roll or Jerk Off Motion, the quiz show that tests just how much you know about Millennials.

I thought I made myself perfectly clear the last time you came home with one of my kids. You are not welcome here. I am busy with a real life, working full time and schlepping my three kids to sporting events in which they are mediocre at best. I don???t have time for your bullshit.The only thing worse than listening to my child attempt to play you would be listening to 50 children play you. You know that happened once on a subway in New York City. I would have thrown myself in front of the train just for a moment of goddamn peace and quiet. Which brings me to my point.You are nothing less than an auditory hijacking. I recognize playing an instrument is a national standard guideline taught in elementary schools. They choose you because you are cheap and easy. You are a cheap and easy whore incapable of producing one pleasing note. You serve no purpose. You are like a white crayon.You are not teaching my son about music. If schools wanted to teach children about music they would play them Tapestry over and over. They would read Rachael Yamagata lyrics to help them navigate their future divorce. They would have their hopeful musicians watch videos of Freddy Mercury on stage and explain this is what it looks like to feel passion for something. No one feels passion for you. You are a child???s instrument, like a rectal thermometer.I truly believe the school board joined forces with a rogue member of Oasis to create some sort of government conspiracy. How else do you explain generation after generation being subjected to your commotion? We have sacrificed livers full of mid-week Pinot trying to drown out the distress you generate.If the sound emerging from your blowholes weren???t bad enough, I also take issue with your color. You are flesh toned. It looks like my son is manhandling a thin Caucasian penis. It???s unnerving. How am I supposed to concentrate on anything while he is wheezing into you, red faced and spit flying? How do you expect me to make a nutritious meal for my family when all I can picture is rubbing my every inch of my skin off with a Bic eraser if he plays ???Hot Cross Buns??? one more fucking time? Every dog in our neighborhood is on our front lawn. Do you think this is a coincidence? No. No, it???s not a coincidence.Most parents are just hanging on by a thread, do you understand me? WE ARE BARELY HANGING ON.I tried to break you in half last night when everyone was sleeping. You are stronger than you look. I slumped to the floor, sweating and defeated. You just looked at me with your stupid face, mocking me. You aren???t the flute, you know. You are shit.This isn???t over, my friend. Not by a long shot.Best,JulieHello there.

This invention consists of:A mechanism consisting of a mechanical lock attached to a capacitive-sensor-equipped eight inch long lubricated sleeve which can be manipulated by making thorough contact through insertion of an erect penis. This device is intended to be installed on ???men???s room??? doors.DESCRIPTION FIELD OF THE INVENTIONThis invention falls in the fields of transphobia, discrimination, and door-fucking.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThis application relates to a door lock that utilizes a combination of a mechanical key and a biometric sensor to identify an authorized user. Most traditional door locks are operated through the insertion of a key, or, with increasing frequency, some biometric sensor electronically linked to a solenoid operating the mechanical bolt mechanism.This invention is in response to a tech",100
186,"nological need created by legislation in the states of North Carolina, Mississippi, Alabama, and executive orders in the state of Texas, requiring that public restrooms only be allowed access by persons with specific, state-approved genital configurations. This invention will have the intended result of protecting children from asking questions about transgender people, although the inventor stipulates that they will likely have many, many other questions after seeing a grown man fuck a bathroom door at a highway rest area.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONThis invention consists of two distinct devices:A mechanical lock, actuated via an electric motor or solenoid, which is electronically linked to capacitive sensors contained in an eight-inch-long, five-inch-circumference sheath to be installed in a public restroom door. The sheath offers a geometric restriction to prevent contact with the deepest sensors via fingertips. These sensors are spaced so that it is impossible to make contact with all of the sensors simultaneously without the full insertion of an erect penis into the restroom door lock sheath. The lock can be programmed so that repeated, rhythmic contact with the sensors is required in order to disengage the locking mechanism. This would be accomplished by the human male repeatedly thrusting his erect penis into the bathroom door in order to repeatedly make contact with the required sensors in a ???tap code??? fashion, with the rhythm of the thrusts dictated through a flashing light on the door.CLAIMSA system, comprising of: A mechanical door lock consisting of a bolt, striker plate, and cylinder. A solenoid for operating the mechanical door lock. A capacitive sensor array. A sheath device for proper mounting of the sensor array. An electronic circuit / processor, for determining that the sensor array has been properly actuated. A web camera so that video of people using the door can be streamed to YouTube.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGSFigure (1) shows a concept of the related devices relationship: The locking mechanism, the solenoid / motor actuator, the electronic circuits, the capacitive sensor array, and the bathroom door.Figure (2) shows a prospective sensor array arrangement in the sheath mechanism, showing contact between an erect penis at the (a) tip of the penis, (b) frenulum, (c) four locations along the shaft, and (d) two locations on the scrotum.Figure (3) shows Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant fucking a bathroom door in order to use a public restroom.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTAs designed, the locking mechanism would be installed in place of a normal bathroom door lock, with the sheath set into the door at an elevation of twenty-eight inches (28???) above the floor surface and fifteen inches (15???) from the swinging edge of the door. In order to unlock the door, a person such as North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory would, either through manual or pharmaceutical means, achieve an erection, slide their erect penis into the detection sheath, and wait for the illumination of the indicator light, installed at eye level in the door. The penis would be required to make contact with all eight sensors in the sheath simultaneously, or, in the event of penis of insufficient girth, in sequence via repeated insertion. Upon successful completion of the act, the door locking mechanism would actuate and the governor would be allowed entry into the men???s room. Video of the act would be streamed to YouTube or another social site for upvoting by the general population.""Once upon a time ago, before I got into the sciences, I had a young earth creationist coworker. She claimed that since the sun went through periods of growing and shrinking, carbon dating was inaccurate, and therefore the Earth had to be 6,000 years old. This was the first time I???d ever come across a creationist in the flesh, with my previous experiences being church lady-type letters to the editor and occasional local-yokel street interviews on the 6 O???Clock News. Put off-guard, I quickly realized I was out of my element with offering a counterpoint, and didn???t feel like getting into a debate while cleaning a public bathroom. Also, she was much bigger than me. You have to pick your battles.My point is not to call this girl stupid or foolish, as I knew she was neither. I know she had been homeschooled for a large portion of her life, and I now assumed it was heavily religious-based. She???d probably never received a clear explanation about evolution and the processes that have formed the Earth throughout time.Carl Sagan best expressed the danger of having a good amount of the populace believe in religious dogma over scientific principles in a developed society:???We live in a society exquisitely dependent on science and technology, in which hardly anyone knows about science and technology.???1I believe when we talk to skeptics, we should change the way we talk about evolution. Right now, the misconception is that evolution theorizes that we descended from monkeys. To this, my knee-jerk reaction is to correct them by saying that humans and primates descended from a common ancestor, as if this really makes a difference to some folks (it doesn???t). I think when we talk about evolution, we need to focus on microevolution and let the caveman and dinosaur thing alone for the time being. Baby steps, you know?The basis of evolution through the process of natural selection (microevolution) is defined as the differential survival and reproduction of individuals due to differences in their physical traits (phenotype). Basically speaking, critters that possess specific traits can survive better than others and have a higher change of reproducing in their environmental conditions. This is a very simple, logical explanation and you would be hard-pressed to find anyone other than the deliberately obtuse that disagrees with it.Natural selection can be broken down to four basic tenets:1)	Individuals within a set population have varied traits: We are different heights, have different sizes of feet, require different amounts of sleep, etc.2)	This variation is heritable: You probably look like your parents. Sorry.3)	Organisms differ in their ability to survive and reproduce: Good strategies from a fitness standpoint: Some of us have tons of children and leave them to their own devices, like oak trees, sea urchins, and your hateful neighbors, while some of us have few children, but invest lots of time and effort in raising them, like elephants.4)	This survival and reproduction are non-random: This tenet invokes environmental conditions and resource availability, as well as interactions with other species.If we want to bring genetics into this (and we absolutely do; who still doesn???t believe in modern genetic theory?) we can say this:1)	Genes mutate. It happens.2)	Sometimes this mutation changes the structure of the proteins it codes for.3)	Sometimes this altered protein gives us the ability to tolerate an environmental pressure.4)	Tolerating an environmental pressure allows us to produce offspring with the same mutation while others die off; the end result is that the frequency of this mutation is increased in the total gene pool.If we want to get back to the dinosaurs, we can say the cumulative effect of billions of years of changing environments have allowed for some pretty amazing creatures to come and go. But, let???s resist the urge to talk about that, and stay focused on the small-scale stuff. Because if there is any concept necessary for our modern, developed society to believe in and understand, it???s microevolution.Through microevolutionary principles, we would not have developed",100
187," two of the most important contributions to society, antibiotics and pesticides. Without antibiotics, we would be subject to horrible infections, and without pesticides, we would be subject to devastating crop failures. Many of us would be dead or suffering.Antibiotics and pesticides are essentially similar. In a nutshell, they discourage growth of a pest by directly or indirectly killing or impeding its ability to reproduce. The key is to target a biological process necessary for the survival of the pest, but absent or not crucial in other critters. Evolution plays a rather abstract, but important role in the discovery and formulation of antibiotics and pesticides. The further away we are on the evolutionary scale from a particular pest, the more biologically and mechanistically different we are in terms of respiration, consumption/metabolism, and reproduction.Critters far away from us on the tree of life, like bacteria, generally have tons of unique mechanisms we can screw with, without affecting our own biological processes. For example, ??-lactams, a common class of antibiotics, acts by inhibiting normal cell wall formation on bacteria. Naturally, animals do not have a cell wall, so we are unaffected by the drug, save some minor side effects. To develop new types of antibiotics, we research the various mechanisms that bacteria uniquely use to grow, acquire nutrients, and reproduce. We then look towards methods to disrupt these mechanisms at one or more points, with the end result being that the bacteria die off.Pesticides work similarly; they target necessary biological functions needed for the pest to survive and/or thrive. They also could be a great variety of things, from bacteria to fungi to insects to plants. The same principles apply; we identify biologically crucial pathways or mechanisms in our pests that have a negligible effect on us.In finding ways to control insects, we need something effective, but not insanely toxic to humans, birds, and the surrounding environment. Being closer on the tree of life, there are a lot of biological similarities between humans and insects, and there are many cases in which the desire for effectiveness overrules the need for safety. An example of this is seen in the organophosphate class of insecticides. While very effective at controlling insect pests, they are extremely dangerous to humans, other mammals, and our bumblebee friends. Organophosphates irreversibly inhibit acetylcholinesterase, which is crucial for nerve function in all of the above critters. Incidentally, it is a fantastic nerve agent, and has had some pretty devastating consequences.2 Because of this, organophosphates are heavily regulated and illegal to use on your home garden.Evolution has an important role in antibiotic and pesticide resistance. Because genetic mutations happen, and bacteria reproduce fast and often have the ability to quickly transfer genes to one another, we are likely going to end up with some mutations. An antibiotic or pesticide is basically a form of intense environmental pressure, which kills off much of the population. If a mutation occurs that allows the bacteria to bypass the targeted pathway, these new drug-resistant bacteria will reproduce uncontrollably. An example of this is the appearance of bacteria that produce ??-lactamases, which cleave and destroy ??-lactam, rendering the drug useless. Similarly with pesticides, the repeated use of the same formulas results in the appearance of pests completely immune and free to proliferate on our food crops3.Antibiotic and pesticide resistance is a very hot topic for scientific research. Misuse of antibiotics has resulted in the appearance of frightening multi-drug resistant strains, making it absolutely necessary to stay invested in research programs. As for pesticides, beyond resistance, there is a long timeline of the accidents, misuses, and damaging effects to the environment and us. We need support for research into strategies that look for methods of pest control beyond the heavy use of chemicals, so that we move closer to productive yet environmentally friendly and sustainable agricultural practices.This is where the necessity of a scientifically educated society comes in. If we force the type of education on children that distorts or outright denies scientific research to fit religious doctrine, we are not properly equipping them with the knowledge to contribute to an increasingly technology driven world.Again, Carl Sagan said it best:???We???ve arranged a society based on science and technology, in which nobody understands anything about science and technology. And this combustible mixture of ignorance and power, sooner or later, is going to blow up in our faces. Who is running the science and technology in a democracy if the people don???t know anything about it???? 4If you are reading this article, you probably live in a country that has religious freedom, which is great. But, we have to look at the caveat ???as long as you aren???t hurting anybody.???Those who deny the existence of evolution, along with other issues that have huge empirical backing like climate change, are indeed hurting lots of someones. It???s mildly annoying to witness folks that deny the existence of evolution, but still enjoy the benefits of modern medicine and developed agricultural systems. But, these people vote, run for office, assume leadership and decision-making positions, sit on school boards,5 lead science and technology committees,6 slash funding for research, slash funding for education, and pump money into bizarre creationist museums.7The end result of this is that we as a society are basically screwed.So, when coming across creationists that want to have The Talk, be nice, discuss natural selection, and don???t mention anything about primate ancestors.

Lunch is ever so much more pleasurable with some 2013 Languedoc Ch??teau Mignan to wash it down and drown it. That???s science. There???s no doubt about that because this is the science-y section.By the way, bananas do not lower blood pressure OR strengthen the nervous system. The research in those studies was all over the place. What a bunch of opportunistic and mercantile pinheads.You might be feeling a little sleepy after the big lunch. Would it surprise you to know that women who drink three or more cups of coffee are less likely to develop skin cancer than those who don???t? Cancer! It???s almost as if coffee is some kind of superhero beverage, fighting evil.On that note, the black spots on overripe bananas are just stains on the soul of the universe. As if a common, awkwardly shaped fruit could actually possess enzymes that boost the immune system and increase white blood cells. Like bananas are some kind of fucking panacea for everything that has ever ailed you. Don???t drink the Banana Cabal Kool-Aid, folks. All they want is your hard-earned cash.And the reason you have cash in the first place is because you???ve worked so hard. Don???t you deserve to relax after reading yet another trend piece about a generation of people who probably don???t read health articles and are not even likely to have a print subscription? Wouldn???t it be great if you could actually relax AND reduce your risk of liver disease all at the same time? That???s exactly what a bottle 2011 Cote du Rhone Syrah does for you. It???s after 4 pm, so it???s socially acceptable now even by American standards.Some people start to feel a little bloated around this time of day, but what they don???t realize is that coffee can help you lose those extra pounds while giving you a much needed early evening jolt. That???s because coffee boosts your metabolic rate so that you burn calories like a sixteen-year-old rugby player with supernatural DNA.If you???ve heard that the high levels of vitamin-B6 in bananas can help calm your nerves, please take into consideration the possibility that the only reason you???re jittery in the first place is because of all this talk about bananas. I mean, who doesn???t get the heebie jeebies from a bunch of crazy bananas?Well, dinner is finished, as is that bottle of 2005 Medoc Bordeaux, which is awesome because red grapes are loaded with anti-oxidants and everyone knows how Red Wine saves more lives than the Red Cross. You???re probably feeling pretty tired by now, particularly as you haven???t been sleeping well lately. Inexplicably, you fall asleep quickly but then a few hours later you???re wide awake with little chance of calming your accelerated heartbeat. Damn those bananas! They keep me up too. It makes me so mad that I???m just going to stalk across the room without looking where I???m going even though there seems to be something unidentified and yellow that has been carelessly left on the floor and I???m going to ahh??? ahhh??? Aiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii???  [Crash]NOTE: This contest is now closed. The winner will be announced on June 7th.- -- -The Haggis-On-WheysFor many years the scientific community has worried about the possibility that semi-sane scholar pretenders would find the means to put out a series of reference books aimed at children but filled with ludicrous misinformation. The books would look normal enough, but would read as if written by people who should at all costs be denied access to pens and pencils.Thanks to Dr. Doris Haggis-On-Whey, who has 17 degrees from 18 institutions of higher learning and is a world-renowned and much-feared expert on just about everything, and her husband Benny, who enjoys putting on socks, that day has come. They???ve published 409 reference books, such as Cold Fusion; Giraffes? Giraffes!; Animals of the Ocean, in Particular the Giant Squid; and most recently, Children and the Tundra.Considering the outstanding threat that Dr. and Mr. Doris Haggis-On-Whey pose to the scientific community, we???re electing your help to keep tabs on this dangerously misinformed two-some. We are compiling a comprehensive account of their daily whereabouts in efforts to ensure they get nowhere near day-care centers, elementary school science fairs, or other places containing impressionable youths with less-than-perfect grasps of basic science.The ContestHere???s where you come in, dear vigilante: Please send us a short write up of your chance encounters with or sightings of Dr. Doris and Benny Haggis-on-Whey. The most brave, informative, and groundbreaking report will be rewarded with a complete, signed collection of the Haggis-On-Whey series, including the latest Children and the Tundra, and will be published on the Internet Tendency. We would give you a Pulitzer in Investigative Journalism if we could, but, for obvious reasons, we can???t.

189,"ogy And Not Apologizing For It.I???ll Apologize, But Only If You Want Me To: A Window Into Modern RelationshipsWhy I???m Leaving New York (Sorry)Q: What is your job?A: I am the private chef to a fraternity at a fancy university.Q: How did you get the job?A: I was sous chef in a busy restaurant. Then I had my daughter and I didn???t want to work an 18-hour day, but I wanted to get back into cooking.I started cooking for a fraternity, I was there for about two years, and then they were kicked off campus.My current position is the second fraternity I???ve cooked for. I???ve been here about a year and a half.Q: Are fraternities better or worse than people think?A: The first frat was worse. This one has a totally different culture. Shenanigans still occur, but it???s just kids being kids.So many of them are putting so much effort into growing up.A lot of them are away from home for the first time in their lives. They???re 17 or 18 years old. I try to be a mom if they need that.Q: Do they come to you for advice?A: I fielded a question the other day: is it worse to become accustomed to always succeeding or always failing?Usually the questions are not that deep. More like, ???Where can I buy a pi??ata shaped like a donkey???? ???How can I clean month-old vomit out of a backseat????  ???Should I get a neck tattoo???? ???How can I tell my parents that I want to change my major????Q: But for the most part they???re well behaved.A: Yes. They all eat dinner together each night and I appreciate seeing them function as a community.If one of them is having trouble with a class or has a family member who passes away, someone always steps up to help. That???s the kind of thing I didn???t expect to see.Q: If you had a son would you let him join a frat?A: This one, yes.The last one where I worked, no. When I went to interview, the guy opened the door and told me to come in, but to wait by the front door. Then the guys put sheets of plywood down so I could get from the front door to the kitchen.They had smashed almost everything in sight and the campus cleaning service would come later in the week, so they thought, ???Why bother cleaning???? Instead they just put plywood over the mess. It crunched when you walked over it.They were not making good choices.Q: Nice. What???s your schedule like?A: I do lunch and dinner Monday through Friday and every once in a while I???ll do a special event on a weekend.Q: What do you cook?A: Lots of things in large quantities. They can???t get enough of anything Mexican???I could make tacos and burritos every day and they???d still ask for more.I???ll make Indian food, Chinese food, casserole things??? Every Thursday for lunch I make Philly cheesesteaks. I keep trying to convince them to do something different but they won???t do it.Q: Do you get to choose the menu?A: Yes. I do what I want.Q: Have you ever made food they didn???t like?A: I???ve definitely had some disasters. I accidentally burnt a sauce once and had to pass It off as ???smoky-flavored.???They are big meat eaters and I once made curried red lentils. That was probably their least favorite thing that I???ve made.Q: Are they allowed to use the kitchen when you???re not there?A: They are not, but a lot of what they do is taking out leftovers and repurposing them. They don???t really know how to cook for themselves.I keep telling them ???Pick something you want to make and I???ll teach you!??? but so far it hasn???t happened.Q: How long will you continue in this job?A: My 11-year-old daughter spends a significant amount of time there, and we say that she has 40 older brothers. My joke is that I can do this job until she stops thinking of them as brothers.Q: Have you seen the guys when they???re tipsy?A: I???ve seen most of them drunk. Usually not mid-day but I???ve seen things begin as early as 4pm.Q: Have you ever had a frat guy come on to you?A: Oh my goodness no.Q: This sounds like a good job for you.A: It seems to be my thing. It???s a stable job for the adventuresome.Since the accident, he hasn???t been the same. He talks a little lower. He???s isn???t quick to laugh. He takes more time to himself in the evenings, and isn???t his chipper self in the mornings. Something about the accident changed him.He???s Serbian now. Not all the time, mind you, but sometimes. Sometimes he???ll go into a room and when he emerges he???s a full-on Serbian person ??? speaking Serbian, wearing clothes that Serbians wear, and talking about Serbia. That never happened before the accident. Before the accident, when he would go into a room, he would emerge an American person ??? dressed like FDR, wearing a baseball mitt, and talking about how, if you really think about it, between Joey and Chandler, it???s Joey hands down.Come to think of it, sometimes he would even emerge in a dress with rouged cheeks, large cantaloupes for breasts, and yell ???Soups on, boys!??? in the high-pitched squeal of a French can-can dancer with quadruple the sex appeal.  That doesn???t happen anymore, not since the accident at least. No. Since the accident, it???s Serbian or nothing.Or is it Croatian?Since the accident, he doesn???t go on his morning walks. That???s because he no longer has legs. Then again, he didn???t have legs before the accident, either. So I guess he never went on morning walks or nighttime walks, or any kind of walks for that matter. He wasn???t able to go on walks, you see, because he didn???t have legs. What a dumb thing for me to not only bring up, but also to prolong.Anyway, before the accident, despite not having legs, he was this strong, strapping man. Do you remember? Do you remember that one time when he lifted that boulder high above his head? And then he slammed it down on the children below? And then he repeated that process over and over and over again to a point where the children were unrecognizable, but the police and the crowd who had gathered around the screaming kids couldn???t help but applaud the number of times he had lifted up and slammed down the boulder.It was six-hundred-and-twelve times.But that man is gone forever. He can???t lift boulders anymore.  Since the accident he can???t even lift a rock. He can???t lift anything.  The other day I saw him trying to lift his toothbrush to his mouth and he couldn???t do it, and I just burst out laughing. ???Ha, ha, ha!??? I said.???Why are you here in my house???? he asked.???I???m robbing you,??? I said.???You never would have robbed me before the accident,??? he said.???Yes I would have,??? I responded. ???In fact, I did.??????So that was you???? he said.???Yes it was,??? I said. ???Didn???t I just say that, ya dingus? Anyway, byeeee.???Before the accident, he had this long, flowing hair. Do you remember how long and flowing it was? Now his hair is longer and it flows more.  It???s weird and off-putting. It???s too long and it flows too much. It flows all the way down to his feet and then back up to his head and then down again so that, when he lays on his side, his hair makes a perfect ???S.??? I hate it. Sure, before the accident, he went through phases where it was longer and flowed more than usual, but this is absolutely ridiculous. It seriously makes me want to throw up.Oh, and his eyes: Since the accident his eyes have these deep dark circles around them. He paints them on himself. I asked him why he started doing that, and he said, ???I???m practicing stage makeup just in case.??????Just in case what???? I asked.???In case the community theater decides to do Death of a Salesman."" he said. ""If I don???t practice, who???s going to make Willy look tired in a convincing way???? Before the accident he never would have practiced stage makeu",100
190,"p. He didn???t have time. He was too busy working for al Qaeda.Some things since the accident have stayed the same, of course.  Before the accident he ate food. He still does that.  Before the accident, when he would cough, he would do it through his mouth. He still does that, too. Everyone, including Barack Obama thought he would probably start coughing differently, through his nose maybe. Well, Barack Obama was wrong. I was wrong. Character actor and Academy Award nominee for The Lovely Bones Stanley Tucci was wrong.  Stanley Tucci is a good actor, though, and I hope he continues to act.Before the accident he had six genitals and twenty-three belly buttons. He still does. So does Stanley Tucci. I checked both of them.  Forcibly.So the question is: Will he ever be the man he once was? Will he ever come back from the accident?  The accident was so powerful, after all, that I can???t blame him for duct taping his ankles and hands together and pretending to be taken hostage by Mariel Hemingway.  If that???s what he needs to do to cope, then fine. Hell, if he wants to continue to spend every Sunday congratulating Boston Market customers on their mashed potato orders, by all means. I didn???t go through what he went through. Who am I to judge?I think we just have to accept that the man we once knew is gone forever. And the man we have now ??? the man who will not leave his house without his lucky yellow-foam shark fin hat ??? is here to stay.- -Nobody wants to take pumpkin carving classes in the spring. Gourds aren???t in season and people don???t want to put melons on their stoops. I tried for years to make my students understand the depth of skill required to be a real pumpkin artist, but all they ever want is the instant gratification of carving yokel smiles and crooked eyes on a discount pumpkin bought out of a tent in the 7-11 parking lot. I spend the 49-week off-season working as a grocery store demonstrator for an infomercial knife company. I start by carving Gerald from Hey Arnold! into a wax squash (because the kids love him) and handing out plastic olive pitters that might be cut up Wendy???s straws. Then I show the midday, nothing-better-to-do shoppers how to peel a screwdriver, handle to tip, with our patented never-dull paring knife. For only $26.94, they???ll get the utility knife, plus three extra utility knives, ten steak knives, two hunting knives, four paring knives, a mini saw, a handful of fish hooks, and half a bag of multicolored glass marbles. It???s actually not a bad deal, though. That???s not $40, not $90, not $100 $78 $34 $40 $8 $300, but $4000 worth of merchandise for only $26.94. You even get a copy of the lifetime warranty. A laminated copy. And there???s more, there???s always more??? if you cut it into a snowflake you???ll get an extra handful of fish hooks and a peach rack.You buy your first hammer to put together a shelf for your Blu-rays.You are impressed with the ethnic cuisine that was delivered to your start-up for lunch.You make a joke on social media about how your life resembles one of the following fictional characters: Carrie Bradshaw, Jamie Conway, Hannah Horvath, Andy Sachs, Holden Caulfield, Millie Dillmount, Sal Paradise, Ruth Sherwood, Eileen Sherwood, Nick Carraway, Holly Golightly, or all of the above.A person who has lived in New York City exactly three months longer than you have condescends to you about all that the big city offers and how much learning is in store for you.Heavy sighs produced from Wi-Fi availability situations increase by 400%.A person you hate gets on a house team at an improv theatre.You discuss Serial in an attempt to bond with a new coworker.You give money to a homeless person singing on the subway and post on social media about how it contributed to your ???perfect day exploring!!!!???You pretend that college was far a more meaningful experience for you than it was.You carefully conclude that it will be a good idea to wear a shirt that has a classic book cover image on it.FOOD TRUCK FESTIVAL!!!!!!!!!!You make a joke about how you hate Times Square even though being there secretly fills you with raw childhood glee.You write about it.- -Soon after I finished at university, I left the city to take an engineering job and live alone in a small rural town. Around that time I purchased a medium-sized car. This had the advantage of getting me home on a Friday afternoon two hours earlier than the bus could, the disadvantage of adding some significant bulk to the already unwieldy tangle of keys I carried around in my jeans, and the unintended effect of forcing me to spend 10% of my weekend time alone on the road, reflecting on the disparity between how I had imagined my career would be and how it had turned out.One Saturday I was back at my parents??? home in the city. I found my old bucket of Lego and chose two standard bricks ??? one red, one blue, both so perfect. Then, feeling exactly as I had always hoped my engineering job would make me feel, I used my father???s drill to make holes in them and put each one on a separate key ring.I took my big tangle of keys out of my pocket and divided it in half: one set for the city, the other for the country. The Lego bricks served as brightly colored reminders that my life had effectively been split in two. It remained that way for a good two years, while I grew ever more disillusioned and eager to escape. But at least my keys were better organized.I quit that job last year, sold the car, and left to go traveling. Now I???m on the other side of the world, learning Spanish, growing a beard, and hiking up volcanoes. Both sets of keys now sit on the bookshelf in the bedroom where I grew up (my mother photographed them for this essay), and a series of hotel room key cards and hostel dorm room locker keys have taken their place in my jeans pocket.Did my small, spontaneous act of Lego creativity lead directly to the position in which I now find myself, unemployed and delighted with life? Maybe that???s a stretch of the imagination. But isn???t that what Lego is for stretching one???s imagination?If you want to audition for the lead in Raising Well-Adjusted Children on Purpose, previously known as Let???s Not Screw up our Kids By Accident, please note you are auditioning for a role that repeats its high-maintenance drama nightly and into perpetuity. There is no curtain call, no applause, and rarely a decent review. We will accept Equity members only, as this role is too layered and demanding for those without previous experience playing to large houses and maintaining freshness in long-running shows. If you???ve got experience with the classic dramas, particularly where life and death stakes are involved, all the better.We ask you to prepare a monologue from the script, which is entirely improvised. We want to see your range, as this role will demand more from you than you have to give. We don???t care if you are Method- or Meisner-trained or if you learned your craft on YouTube. That said, if you have an MFA from Yale or the like we will be more impressed with you. At least initially. That???s just how it works. We are also stirred if you are the eldest in a large family and have taken on the mothering role for your younger siblings because your own mother was understandably drunk or painfully unaware of the emotional damage she was inflicting on you by trying to raise children without sufficient emotional preparation. Here is where Method training might help. But that???s another story. It will be your actual audition that will show us if you have what it takes to embody this role in its entirety.The given circumstances are: You are the mother of three childre",100

She copes with this indignation by sucking her thumb and pouting. The middle child, a gregarious second grade boy with tendencies toward verbal perseveration, eggs her on. A petulant 13-year-old middle school daughter is too hungry to answer the unreasonable question, ???How was your day????In no way should you appear capable of this role. Play against type. We want to see an arc in character development. Your super-objective is to raise emotionally healthy children. Put another way, don???t say or do anything stupid. We are looking for intentional mothering choices. Your first obstacle is to manage an escalation between Mr. Let Me Needle Someone and Ms. I Expect Solitude to Process My Kindergarten Day.Sample ScriptCHRISTIAN:  Julianna?MOTHER:   Christian, she???s behind you sucking her thumb.

Why is she in such a bad mood?Scene.Please resist the urge to rely on caricatures or stereotypes. Do your homework. Create a full history for your character.

Your school lets out last.Scene.Once in the house, your role requires you to play remote control construction vehicles, create the frame of a princess puzzle, and categorize quadrilaterals by angle and line length. No one notices you have forgotten your lines, missed your entrances, and that you need a costume change.Chatty, Angry and Petulant eventually become Sleepy, Punch Drunk and Over-Stimulated. Your diet has run its course ??? coffee in the morning, chocolate in the afternoon, and wine at night. Keeping within these nutritional guidelines ensures you successfully manage the ninth reading of Dora the Snow Princess without slipping into a literary coma. Bedtime arrives. You kiss your darlings good night. A few good hugs, some squishy snuggles, and the curtain closes.To earn this coveted role, convince us that you want more than anything to get cast in the lead role again tomorrow and everyday after that in spite of the perpetual production run, lack of union-required breaks, and improvised script.Choosing a baby nameRejoining the workforceSleep trainingBreastfeedingLaborI???m not angry.

I bet he loves his mom???s beef goulash that she slaved and slaved over while he was off gallivanting with his dandy artist friends. Honestly, James, if I hear one more story about you and that bum Manet or that meatball Oscar Wilde I???m gonna ground you from now til the centennial.That???s right. Have fun celebrating America alone in your GARRET. You know what that means? No sparklers.I repeat: No. Sparklers.And speaking of flaming hot rods, I saw a photograph of your little friend Oscar the other day. (Have you seen this photography thing? It seems to be really catching on. I???d worry about that if I were you.) Let???s just say that in this photograph, your friend Oscar looked very??? decadent. A little too decadent, if you know what I mean.It???s not that I don???t trust you, James. It???s that I don???t trust everyone else (Oscar). If everyone else (Oscar) jumped off a cliff, would you do it? If everyone else (Oscar) started wearing slutty capes and hanging out in opium dens, would you?Quiet! I don???t want excuses, James. Don???t even TRY the old, ???But Moommm, my tonalist aesthetic allows me to subtly yet poignantly express the fundamental melancholy and mystery of the natural world.??? That will not work on me.

But I bet like everyone else in the world, you don???t remember it, either. That???s cool.Somehow they made it work. Despite being from different years, he from 1996 and she from 2016, Nicholas Turner and Sonia Mehta were married on April 23, 2016. They met in Munich, Germany in 1932, while trying to kill Adolph Hitler.???It???s so funny,??? said Ms. Mehta, 31, laughing. ???Our mutual love was born from a mutual hatred of history???s greatest monster,??? she continued. ???Hey, Stalin was no picnic, either,??? chimed in Mr. Turner, 36, laughing and then adding, ???I know, clich??, right? The first thing you do when you get your hands on a time machine is try and kill Hitler. But, you have to, right????The couple described the night they met as chaotic, but wonderful. ???There were a lot of us there who had come from the future to try and kill Hitler at this beer hall in Munich, but out of all the would-be Hitler assassin bachelors she picked me,??? said the groom. Continuing the story, the bride added, ???Hitler was on top of this table getting all worked up when someone ran up and strangled him with rope. I have to say, while he was obviously a terrible person, he was a compelling speaker.???The bride said that what initially drew her to the groom was his sense of humor. ???After Hitler was killed, all of us from the future sort of stood around, relieved but confused as to what to do. Did we just go back to our respective years? Did we try to explain to onlookers why he was killed? We were all flummoxed, and, then, Nicholas pulls out a pair of sunglasses, puts them on Hitler???s corpse and totally ???Weekend at Bernie???s??? Hitler, picking Hitler up and walking him around with his head bobbing around like he was Bernie from those movies,??? said the bride, alluding to the titular character of the 1989 comedy film Weekend at Bernie???s and its 1993 sequel Weekend at Bernie???s II. ???Of course, everyone who had traveled from pre-1990s to kill Hitler didn???t get the reference, but still so worth it,??? added the groom.The two went to dinner that night in Munich and the rest, as they say, is history ??? subject to change based on time travel.Ms. Mehta is a vice president at Conway Shandwick, a public relations and marketing agency. She graduated magna cum laude from Rutgers University. She is the daughter of Shalini and Dr. Anand Mehta of Tom???s River, New Jersey.Mr. Turner works as a director in the wealth management department at AKT Investment Partners. He graduated from Lehigh University where he, not surprisingly, majored in history. He also received an M.B.A. degree from Northwestern University. He is the son of Brooke and Stuart Turner of Lower Merion Township, Pennsylvania.The couple has decided to split the difference and live in 2006. For their honeymoon, the couple plans to travel back in time to 1989 to buy stock in Microsoft and hope to also catch Weekend at Bernie???s in its original theatrical run.???Love happens when you least expect it and I certainly wasn???t expecting it that night in Munich. I just wanted to kill Hitler and get back to my life in 1996,??? said a beaming groom. ???But, I???m so glad Sonia was there trying to kill Hitler, too.???Portrait by Kelly Bjork- - -Gina and I are sitting at a wooden picnic table shaded by a giant canvas umbrella. Lean and model-tall, Gina wears a button-up collared shirt and an understated silver necklace, and she has long, curly hair, which she frequently adjusts. It???s been an uncomfortably hot day, but it???s evening now, and there are just the right number of people on the deck with us. A man walks past, carrying a blue-eyed puppy in his arms. ???Sorry it took me so long to get back to you,??? she says. She laughs often as she???s speaking, and this gives her statements a glossy, revelatory quality. ???I don???t know why, but it always takes me a few days when it comes to phone stuff. I forget to check it, or I forget to respond. My friends all kinda know that about me, but strangers probably wonder about it,??? Gina says.Our correspondence stretched out for a couple weeks, but it wasn???t a big deal, and I tell her I don???t mind. Today we???re on the back porch at the Twilight Exit. Gina suggested we meet here, and as we???re settling in, I ask if she has any hard feelings associated with the shooting. ???It was a very unfortunate thing, but it wasn???t personally addressed towards me, and it didn???t impact my life that much,??? she says. ???If someone brings it up, I don???t like to mention I was here. I don???t like to be like, ???This happened to me.??? It didn???t feel like it happened to me. I just happened to be there. I guess in a way I don???t even feel like it???s my story to share.???We begin by going over Gina???s basics, such as her age. She???s 26. ???That sounds so old to me. Even though I know 26 is not old, but it sounds like it is when I say it out loud,??? she says. Gina lives in Tacoma and is getting a tech-degree in hospitality and management. She???s almost done, and it???s likely she???ll move to a different state afterwards. ???My boyfriend wants to work at a ski resort. I???d be down for that. I???m in a transitional career time,??? she says. On top of school, Gina cooks for a food truck stationed inside a Seattle brewery. She loves it, she says, ???but honestly I???m pretty happy doing most jobs.??? Before all this, Gina had been going to a university in California, but it didn???t stick. ???I had a misguided college career. I just hated everything about it. The huge lecture halls. Being talked at,??? Gina says.A few years ago, when Gina relocated to Seattle, she called upon her friends Laura and Sam, who were already here and sharing an apartment. ???I showed up at their place one day with a carful of shit. I was kind of like an errant house guest. I didn???t know what I was doing. I was looking for an apartment, looking for a job. All that stuff. I was staying on their couch, but I eventually graduated to an air mattress,??? said Gina. ???I ended up just living with them. It actually worked out really well. Laura and I shared a room as long as we lived together, a total of three or four years. We even tried to save space and share a bed, because???have you seen Laura? She is, like, this tall,??? said Gina, gesturing at waist level. ???But we gave that up after two nights. It was a twin bed. It went horribly for both of us. I don???t mind spooning Laura, but we were both rolling around all night. I???m, like, six feet tall. I was the size of the bed,??? she said.The pair met by chance, several years back. ???My twin brother was in downtown Santa Cruz one day, just walking on the sidewalk, talking to somebody about how he wanted to buy some weed,??? she said. ???Laura was right behind him and overheard him. She didn???t know him, but she came up and told him she had some, and he could come over and get it from her later. I happened to be with him then when he stopped by for it. I could tell she was awesome right away, and we???ve been best friends ever since,??? she said.Gina and I skip ahead to the day of the shooting. She???d been living in Seattle about a month. She???d found a job by then, as a cook in a cafe in an affluent neighborhood. ???It was a Sunday. I probably went to work that day and was bumming around after I got home, waiting for Laura or Sam to come over and get ready. ",100
193,"We went to the Twilight every Sunday at least, and probably a little too often besides. It was kinda like our spot, instantly. It was the very first place Laura brought me when I moved out here,??? she said. That evening at home, Laura eventually materialized, along with several other women (including Taryn). ???We were all getting ready and drinking and dancing in the house. We were in a big group, so it was exciting. There were friends and friends of friends with us. I didn???t know everyone that well because I???d just met most of them within the past month. But they were all very super likable friendly people, and I feel like I???m a super likable friendly person, and that always keeps it easy,??? she said.???We used to live just a block from here, so we walked over. I remember the doorman said something about my stupid driver???s license when he was IDing us. At the time, I still had my California driver???s license. In the picture I was wearing a princess tiara,??? she said. I???m curious how that happened. ???It wasn???t like I was dressing up for the photo. I got the picture taken right after I???d turned 16, and that???s just what I happened to be wearing that day. I used to dress up all the time back then. I???d wear, like, fairy wings or fuzzy green alien bobbers on my head,??? said Gina. ???The door guy said, ???I recognize you, Miss Princess.??? It was just a random thing. Like, ???Oh, here???s my embarrassing ID again.??? But he remembered it, which was nice after just moving somewhere.???Gina???s group claimed a large table in the center of the dining area. ???We???d just gotten in and gotten drinks and sat down. We were meeting a friend and she was there already. I kinda remember she was telling us about the altercation that???d happened. Like, a guy was thrown out. She was like, ???I???m glad you guys are here. There???s been something crazy happening.??? She looked sort of concerned by it. That was about it,??? said Gina. ???We must???ve been there about ten minutes. I???d probably ordered a gin and tonic double. That???s always a good drink, but I don???t think I even drank the whole thing. I remember the screaming outside and hearing one gunshot. It was just like, ???What the fuck is going on???? After that, I don???t remember any sounds happening. At all. I don???t know if it???s because I haven???t talked about it a lot, or if it???s changed in my memory. But I don???t remember hearing any sounds again until we were back at our apartment. The next thing I heard was the gunshots when the police came,??? she said.Back in the dining room and just after the gun went off, Gina never caught a glimpse of the shooter. ???I remember someone throwing a table over, and everyone being on the floor and just kind of looking around, and seeing the karaoke guy motioning to the back door, and seeing a couple other people stand up and go. I know Laura was one of them, but I don???t even remember it being Laura. More like, ???Someone else is going that way. I???m gonna follow.??? I was briefly concerned there might be more people shooting outside, but I was like, ???I do not wanna die in this little room,?????? she said.When I ask Gina to describe her movement across the dining area and out the exit door, her tone stays thoroughly easy-breezy. ???I highly doubt I crawled because I hate that kind of maneuver. I hate bending my knees. I don???t know why. It???s a lot of pressure. The flopping,??? she said, gently flinging her arms in demonstration. ???I can???t imagine crawling honestly. I probably got up and did a half-duck run, if anything,??? she said, then continued. ???I can kind of remember people being around me when I was running outside. I remember running across the alley entrance and being like, ???I hope no one shoots me right now.??? I had no idea what was happening. In a vague part of my brain I saw the flashing lights and police cars going down the street as we were running. Then we were just running to our house, and it was like, ???Ok, everyone???s here,??? and then, ???What???s going on,??? and then a bunch more gunshots happened when we were still standing outside. I didn???t realize there was only the one person inside the bar. It seemed like an infinity of gunfire. It felt excessive. When I found out later what was happening, it seemed extremely unnecessary,??? she said. Even still, Gina feels it???s likely the police responded fairly. ???That???s a hard judgment, and I???ve never been in that situation???to have to value the life of a human being over other human beings. I don???t think most police officers have malicious intent. I really don???t,??? she said. ???We???d also just realized one of our friends didn???t make it back with us, and she wasn???t answering her phone. So maybe that amplified that moment in my mind.???Inside Gina???s apartment right after the shooting, ???it was like an overload of stimulation. I kinda remember just wishing everyone would leave. There were so many people. There were eight of us, plus our neighbors, plus some other people from the news had stopped by and tried to talk to us. I don???t know how they found us. I had no desire to talk to them. I hate being center of attention, and I didn???t feel like I had anything insightful to say,??? she said. ???I just wanted go to bed. It was like, ???I am done with today. Let???s see what happens tomorrow.??? We probably smoked a bunch of weed and drank copiously, and I just passed out.??????I remember waking up and everyone being in a somber mood. It was kind of like this very surreal, very odd occurrence that was slightly traumatizing had just happened. So we were all like, ???Let???s go do something commemorative.??? Some of us went and got tattoos,??? she said. Gina picked a Romanian flower, to memorialize a European vacation. It???s on her ribcage. ???I already had a few flowers, and this one was so cool,??? she said. (This led to a discussion about Gina???s other tattoos, which led to another story involving Laura and the aliveness of devotion. The women share a couple tattoos, it turns out. ???We got matching compasses to designate a road trip. And we each have a Santa Cruz tattoo. One of my friends drew it. We were in Portland, and we were just hanging out in a friend???s living room, drinking tequila. One of them had a tattoo gun. He was still practicing. He was kind of, like, not a human being who should own a tattoo gun. He was exactly the guy you wouldn???t want to do your tattoo, but that was the guy who did it. I went first, and he never changed the needle, so because of that, we???re all, whatever that is. Blood shared,??? she said, searching for the right term. It came soon after: ???Blood sisters,??? she said.)Gina spoke little of the shooting in the weeks that followed. ???I don???t remember being sad or afraid about it afterwards. It was more like???this was a way out-of-the-ordinary thing that???d happened. But at the same time, I think it???s naive to believe you???ll never be in a violent situation,??? she said. ???I???d had very little understanding of why the event took place. And even after learning why, I still had very little understanding. I was kind of comforted learning it was not a random bar shooting, that this person was angry with somebody else, there was a reason this person was upset. Better that situation than some random person walking into a room and killing someone. I hate that. That makes me lose faith in humanity,??? she said. ???We wanted to come back as soon as the bar opened, to be supportive of the business. It wasn???t their fault, and it would???ve sucked if they lost any customers. If anything, I felt like I was more ",100

For instance, people who are triggered by acronyms or linguists have already been triggered. I am sorry for this. As one continues to read, he / she / they / hey / shey / thee / y???ins / sharkpersons may additionally be triggered by references to ???rape??? (contained within the word ???drapery??? which I use when describing my bedroom), the word ???drapery,??? which I now understand is classist, and detailed descriptions of a room???s interior which can trigger literary minimalists. I would like to take this opportunity to apologize to Ernest Hemingway, I won???t break confidence by detailing the reasons for my apology as it is not my story to share, but he will know what this is regarding and again, I???m sorry.Please note that I encourage the reader not to skim my think piece.

This is someone with a narrow area of interest: one literary period, one genre within one period, or even one capital-A-author. That tweed-jacketed guy who teaches Shakespeare? Or the lady with the glasses and eyewear chain who teaches Jane Austen? They have dedicated their lives to reading what other Libris scholares have said about these capital-A-authors and they have added their own analyses to the slowly accumulating pile. Mostly, this means they published essays in journals devoted to their exclusive specialty, or they stood in rooms of similar Libris scholares at conferences and read their unpublished papers aloud, or, if they???re lucky and are among the stars of their field, they may have published a book or two from a university press, which is a kind of charity organization that produces small batches of books by Libris scholares like single-malt Scotch, out of a philanthropic need for a class of esoteric knowledge that very few untrained readers could ever care about.As time marches on, and the birth of the Libris scholaris is separated from the death of their pet capital-A-author by more decades, the scholarship yields smaller conclusions, though no one shows any intention of ever giving up the endeavor, since the rewards are great. Because each English department covets a scholar for eve",100
195,"ry capital-A-author or period in the literary canon (i.e. Shakespeare, Chaucer, the Romantics, the Reformation, the Victorians, and on and on), a Libris scholaris need not be all that impressive, and tenure and the prestigious ranks of the professorship, accompanied by the lightest teaching loads and the highest salaries (for liberal arts anyway), can be achieved after minimal publication. Newly dead and/or living writers are a harder sell for Libris scholaris, and any written commentary about contemporary writers tends toward book reviews, which are mostly to help sell books and therefore left to journalists or the living writer???s own peers. The pleasures of reading for the Libris scholaris are mostly the heady joys of exploring another century. Scholar-types do not attend book events or poetry readings or pay much mind to living authors. They eschew the present, and despite a life devoted to liberal arts education, they likely sprouted from conservative roots. They overuse the word ???text,??? and their writing, as laser-focused ineffectual effluvia, isn???t engaging or necessary. Because they make up the majority of tenured English professors, Libris scholares are where most of the power in the English department is consolidated (because of the expansive list of required literary periods and capital-A-authors that extends back to Beowulf). They love it when they recognize themselves in a young person, out of suspicion that they were the last of a dying breed, and they???ll encourage that student to apply to graduate programs for textual studies, or they???ll hire a promising young Libris scholaris fresh out of one such graduate school, into the tenure-track. Theirs is a field devoid of national politics and incompatible with any real claim for ???job skills.??? One could do worse than pledging one???s life to the literature of another era. One could also do better. Libris scholaris believes that literature is dead, and they have made a living off of the corpse.The second type of English professor is the composition scholar, or teacher-type, Scribis mundanus. They use the word ???text??? with far less frequency and their obsession lies in ???pedagogy,??? a word never uttered outside of universities, but a catch-all title that means, broadly, ???teaching.??? While Libris scholares teach to make a living, so that they can study texts, Scribis mundani have always wanted to teach, and they have a way of resenting other professors who don???t engage in the frequent self-examination of their own teaching practices. They believe in a growth model for teachers, so that they are involved in teacher training and/or disseminating self-assessment tools, and they command their classrooms with a dynamic flair. They are forever pondering goals and outcomes, and will dole out experimental assignments, so that during any given semester the class content, approach, or grading methods of Scribis mundanus may have completely changed from previous semesters. The field of composition developed out of necessity and it???s the new kid on the block. At the beginning of the twentieth century students were interested in literature, and classes were introduced where these students would write ???themes??? each week, so that these primitive papers became what was graded in the course. Over time, English classes were separated into literature classes and writing classes, and composition was the methodology that grew up around paper writing, which became the subject, whole and entire, of composition classes.Every first-year student who doesn???t test high on the verbal section of the SAT is required to take one or two composition classes during their first year of college, and that???s a lot of students, and a lot of classes, and a lot of papers, and, ironically, while Scribis mundani don???t mind that work, since it comes with the territory, they also tend not to be the ones to do it, since there aren???t enough Scribis mundani to go around, because they are usually hired into administrative positions where they are put in charge of the English teachers who do teach all of those composition students, almost universally the contingent faculty, hired on short-term contracts, as well as the graduate students with teaching assignments, the graduate school???s version of the athletic scholarship. These ???temporary??? teachers can come from any of the three English teacher types, it doesn???t matter, though the hierarchy persists in who gets hired out of these labor-intensive paper-grading coal mines into full-time tenure-track or ???permanent??? positions. Although most of the power is consolidated among the scholar-types, Scribis mundani do quite well for being the newest field with the smallest number of representatives, because they are put in charge of the army of contingent teachers, which can be anywhere from 1/3 to 2/3s of the English instructors in a department. Composition Ph.Ds. further heighten their stature in the broader field of English by claiming minor twentieth-century philosophers and theorists as their own, just as that philosopher has peaked in scholarly attention, especially those who had no interest or awareness of English composition as a field of study when they were alive. As these things go, a famous thinker will become all the rage, inspiring change in writing classrooms populated by nineteen-year-olds all over America, and the same papers (sometimes literally; thank you, plagiarism!) about the same tired subjects, will be graded by the rotating ranks of underpaid disrespected contingent faculty with the current popular philosopher in mind, to shift again five years later, when there???s a new pedagogical trend (there???s that word and they love it!).Scribis mundani often start out as Libris scholares, passionate about literature, but then when they find themselves in the classroom they encounter a new love, and they also figure out that it???s easier to get a job as a Scribis mundanus, where scholarship may not even matter, since an administrator who can train, schedule, and speak for all of the underpaid temporary faculty is indeed valued and compensated. Ironically, these teacher-types, Scribis mundani, who love the classroom so much they actually study it and write about it, have fewer classes as a direct result of their administrative work, with enough course releases to get them down to one or two classes per semester. Life as a tenured English composition professor often includes: leadership in the department, a demonstrated love of teaching, and a light course load without much expectation for scholarship. It???s also a field that???s pretty wide open for new subjects ??? so one can see the attraction. Unfortunately, Scribis mundani may learn they either don???t like or aren???t suited for administrative work, except that they???re stuck in it. Scribis mundani believe that literature has no utility, and they have tried to shift the focus of English studies to something more practical (pedagogy!), if only in the short term, if only for the self-perpetuating activity of teaching teachers about teaching.The last type of English professor, the artist-type, or Scribis artifex??? Oh boy, where to begin? In our society you can???t go around calling yourself an artist unless free market capitalism has made you rich enough to make your art your full-time job, such that there are little objects being consumed, either physical or digital, with your name on them. Those who teach prose-writing or poetry-writing at universities, as poets and/or fiction or nonfiction writers, can sometimes achieve financial security, not as a result of the popularity of their art, but by th",100
196,"eir integrity as artists, by which they might land a sweet (but very rare) tenure-track job. In order to find oneself on the tenure-track as Scribis artifex, however, one must have nearly achieved that nearly impossible pinnacle, self-sufficient artist, or to be born or married into financial independence, or to have married into the English department by partnering with another English professor with a tenure-track job.There are a lot of Scribis artifegum out there, and the work is fulfilling, since their writing is read outside of universities and the literature they are most likely to teach is contemporary. Scribis artifegum are very good writers and editors who may volunteer their time at literary journals or in writer???s communities, but most often Scribis artifegum will be hired into low-paying ???temporary??? positions to be told how to teach by Scribis mundani, to be looked down upon by Libris scholares, and to grade all of those papers produced by the nineteen-year-olds forced to take English composition. One can eek out an existence in this way for quite some time, by moving from college to college, and from city to city, by agreeing to teach on short-term contracts while working on their poems, novels, stories, essays, plays, and screenplays. And Scribis artifex may very well publish such endeavors, but let???s face it, no one really cares about art that hasn???t been heavily marketed, or at least the majority of art consumers don???t. So the artist-types study very hard, sometimes publish very well, mostly while grading the papers of nineteen-year-olds as Libris scholares are paid two-times or three-times their salary for less work, and less vital work, as Scribis mundani continue to ???train??? Scribis artifegum, observe them, and select the eighty-dollar composition textbooks that the students will be required to buy and will later complain about on teacher evaluations.But it???s a good life. It comes with summers off. And Scribis artifex can feel a kinship with the buggy protagonist of Kafka???s most famous story while circling faculty parking lots in search of the rare open space and maybe, or maybe not, being awarded health insurance. You didn???t think literary art should come easily, did you? Scribis artifex believes in literature and so looks at everything else as failing to reach that high mark, including and sometimes especially English department colleagues.5th wall: Address the director???s concerns about your performance.6th wall: Ask if the crew can take five.7th wall: Quietly hyperventilate in the bathroom mirror.8th wall: Call your agent.9th wall: Speak with the only crew member who gets what you???re going for, Sharon, from craft services.10th wall: Redo the scene, this time with a much broader reaction, despite everything you learned at Tisch.11th wall: Redo it again because you flubbed the line, ???Smells like someone cares.???

We wanted people to see our shows and think to themselves, ???Huh, I had no idea that theatre could do that,??? and ???why did I let my coworker talk me into coming to this???? That???s why our company???s mission is to make our audience feel as unsafe as possible; and thus we use every moment of Theatre as an opportunity to betray our audience???s trust.The Dien Bien Phu Experimental Theatre Company has redefined the frontiers of theatre, time and time again. Take for instance, our recreation of the American ???classic,??? The Music Man. Perhaps you heard about the 15-minute sexual assault scene that we added to our production, which lasted right up to intermission. Perhaps you also heard that this intermission was signaled only by all of our actors freezing in place throughout the house, forcing the audience to squeeze past us as they exited to the lobby where they could buy soft drinks from the concession stand that we decorated as a dead Osama Bin Laden.We are nothing if not a thoughtful group, dedicated to the craft of performing stage combat that we never rehearse ??? with actual knives. And we continue to explore new ways to incorporate MIXED MEDIA into our performances ??? such as our projection of actual surgery footage onto our re-imagining of Mary Poppins. Furthermore, we usually forbid an actor to take the stage unless he/she is already crying. And of course, dogs. Lots and lots of untrained dogs are always in our shows.This is the future of Theatre. This is what the people need to see. Not actors speaking to each other, standing at a safe distance from the audience. But rather actors screaming words directly into the faces of the audience members, until they respond. The world does not need more Theatre on a stage, but rather more Art that takes place after an audience has been dragged into a parking lot, forced to lie down in each parking space, and doused with gasoline so it Knows How It Feels To Be An American Automobile. And of course, our Society does not need more actors saying what is written on a page, but rather a Theatre company dedicated to saying whatever it wants on stage at all times, completely freed from the tyranny of ???the script.???Perhaps you recall the instance one of our cast members ???had a seizure.??? The terror, the confusion, the total commitment the rest of our cast displayed! We convinced you, did we not, that her seizure was real? We even raised the house lights and had a stage manager call an ambulance. Then when our actor stood up and revealed that she had suffered no such malady, we chastised yo",100
197,"u all for sitting idly by while someone near you was dying??? just like you do every day. When the medics from the ambulance finally arrived, we had all changed into the costumes of a Puritan mob so that we could try the actual EMT???s for witchcraft. Yes, we have been to prison for our Theatre  ??? and we had to be bailed out by our parents. But is not Society a prison, with its only bail our ART?For booking corporate gigs, please see our ???Corporate??? tab.1. You are both broke, which is a hard thing to be in New York City, but being broke doesn???t make her sad. In fact, it seems to actually make her happy. She is a MacGyver of food stealing. ???Voila,??? she says, when revealing a pair of salt and pepper shakers lifted from McDonalds. ???You???re not going to believe this,??? she says, as she smacks down a greasy paper sack of free shawarma. She hangs around receptions, asks for stuff, generally snoops, and sometimes people are just so charmed by her that they offer her food for no reason.2. She has no problem masturbating with you in the room and wants to high five you if she has a particularly good orgasm.3. Her hair is fucking incredible. Dark, glossy curls.  And she does nothing to it ??? seriously nothing, she barely washes it. Her skin is a glowy tan. Her face itself is plain, her eyes almost disastrously wide-set, and she wears no make-up, but no one cares because she is always grinning. Men shout out nice things to her on the street like, ???Keep on smiling girl!??? Or ???You got angels watching out for you, I can tell!??? To you, they yell things like, ???I want to fuck you up the ass!??? Or the more ambiguous: ???I could make you scream.???4. She makes up little rituals of pleasure for herself. For instance, when she takes a shit, she likes to run the shower on hot to fill your tiny bathroom with steam, and she plays music on her phone???s speaker and chews fruity gum while reading a magazine. A shit is not just a shit, it is a major part of her day and she LOVES it.5. One day, coming out of the shower completely nude with the towel wrapped around her hair, she points at you with her finger and says, ???Never shave your pubes. I did because I was going to Nicaragua and, you know, for ticks? But it grew back in like Astroturf. Don???t listen to all this, shave your pussy, shave your pussy BS. Never shave your pussy. It doesn???t grow back in the same.??? You just stare and nod. She is unbelievably beautiful naked. You would never has guessed; she looks just regular in clothes.6. The Jersey accent. Let???s talk about it. It somehow allows her to move from regular speech into small poetic a-grammatical bursts without it seeming weird or affected. Example: ???In this city ??? angel, devil, Kierkegaard or Kierkegaard???s buttboy ??? everybody wants a bagel at two in the morning, am I right????  Or: ???My mother is one of those sad-eyed, hollowed-out Feminine Mystique bitches, makes me sad as hell ??? like, vacuum cleaners, dishwashers, laundry machine salvation, gonna set me free, set you free, set everybody free ??? nobody got set free, just got drunk in the empty house in the afternoon looking like flowers that wilted because nothing means anything, right???? At least, you are pretty sure that???s what she said. She talks fast.7. She eats all your food. She borrows your clothes without asking. She disappears for days with your laptop, which you need to do your homework. But whenever you try to fight with her, she starts yelling, which is not a thing you were allowed to do in your house unless there was fire, but which she is very, very good at. ???I know, sweetie,??? she says, when she is done yelling at you. ???That protestant stick is stuck real tight up your ass and you???re never gonna get it out, I shouldn???t be so hard on you, I know, but you really need to loosen up, okay? You???re goddamn infuriating!???8. She loves the band Hanson and will play their albums loud, encouraging you not to be ashamed and to just dance.9. Ultimately, perhaps, the most distressing thing about Alexandra is that, against your will, you are drawn to her. Do you want to have sex with her? Are you gay all of a sudden? Or is it that you want to be her? Though you could never be her, could never even imitate her, for she is inimitable. Being in love with her like this is also, somehow, a way of hating yourself. When summer comes and you move out, you feel a rush of relief,  even as you are telling her that you are going to miss her so much. You won???t miss her, even for a second, but you will never forget her and you will tell stories about her for the rest of your life and sometimes, when you are down, you will turn on the shower and put on some Hanson and chew some gum while you take a shit. And you will feel like you have been let in on a great secret, a profound, blasphemous secret. Life is to be enjoyed.Familiarity breeds contempt.Dear Students Who Have Just Completed My Class,I would rather do anything else than grade your Final Papers.I would rather base jump off of the parking garage next to the student activity center or eat that entire sketchy tray of taco meat leftover from last week???s student achievement luncheon that???s sitting in the department refrigerator or walk all the way from my house to the airport on my hands than grade your Final Papers.I would rather have a sustained conversation with my grandfather about politics and government supported healthcare and what???s wrong with the system today and why he doesn???t believe in homeowner???s insurance because it???s all a scam than grade your Final Papers. Rather than grade your Final Papers, I would stand in the aisle at Lowe???s and listen patiently to All the Men mansplain the process of buying lumber and how essential it is to sight down the board before you buy it to ensure that it???s not bowed or cupped or crook because if you buy lumber with defects like that you???re just wasting your money even as I am standing there, sighting down a 2??4 the way my father taught me 15 years ago.I would rather go to Costco on the Friday afternoon before a three day weekend.

I would rather go back to the beginning of the semester like Sisyphus and recreate my syllabus from scratch while simultaneously building an elaborate class website via our university???s shitty web-based course content manager and then teach the entire semester over again than grade your goddamn Final Papers.I would rather stay up past midnight pecking out an essay about not wanting to grade your Final Papers with one finger on my tiny outdated smart phone touchpad than grade your Final Papers because I do not want to read them.I do not want to read your 3AM-energy-drink-fueled excuse for a thesis statement. I do not want to sift through your mixed metaphors, your abundantly employed logical fallacies, your incessant editorializing of your writing process wherein you tell me As I was reading through articles for this paper I noticed that ???  or In the article that I have chosen to analyze, I believe the author is trying to or worse yet, I sat down to write this paper and ideas kept flowing into my mind as I considered what I should write about  because honestly, we both know that the only thing flowing into your mind were thoughts of late night pizza or late night sex or late night pizza and sex, or maybe thoughts of that chemistry final you???re probably going to fail later this week and anyway, you should know by now that any sentence about",100

I do not want to read around your 1.25-inch margins or your gauche use of size 13 sans serif fonts when everyone knows that 12-point Times New Roman is just. Fucking. Standard. I do not want to note your missing page numbers. Again. For the sixth time this semester. I do not want to attempt to read your essay printed in lighter ink to save toner, as you say, with the river of faded text from a failing printer cartridge splitting your paper like Charlton Heston in The Ten Commandments, only there, it was a sea and an entire people and here it is your vague stand-in for an argument.I do not want to be disappointed.I do not want to think less of you as a human being because I know that you have other classes and that you really should study for that chemistry final because it is organic chemistry and everyone who has ever had a pre-med major for a roommate knows that organic chemistry is the weed out course and even though you do not know this yet because you have never even had any sort of roommate until now, you are going to be weeded out. You are going to be weeded out and then you will be disappointed and I do not want that for you. I do not want that for you because you will have enough disappointments in your life, like when you don???t become a doctor and instead become a philosophy major and realize that you will never make as much money as your brother who went into some soul-sucking STEM field and landed some cushy government contract and made Mom and Dad so proud and who now gives you expensive home appliances like espresso machines and Dyson vacuums for birthday gifts and all you ever send him are socks and that subscription to that shave club for the $6 middle-grade blades.I do not want you to be disappointed. I would rather do anything else than disappoint you and crush all your hopes and dreams ???Except grade your Final Papers.The offer to take your chemistry final instead still stands.Up to half off my annual salaryTwo for the price of four deals on underwear, razors, etc.Unlimited comments on my appearanceSubscription to Good HousekeepingFree advice from other membersStress incontinenceTen percent off car rentalsTote bagStretch marksWhen My Daughter the Conscience was in third grade her teacher took a census of how many of the great religions of the world were practiced by her rainbow coalition of gifted and talented kiddies. When it came time for Conscience to chime in, she said None. Teach, assuming no for none, and thereby concluding that Conscience was behaving refractorily, pressed the issue. After a mini Who???s on First between Teach and Tochter, it was finally understood that Conscience wasn???t being disrespectful, that she had, in fact, answered the question, that she was, bless her heart, an atheist. This perfectly reasonable answer sent shockwaves through the class; none of them, Teach included, could understand, let alone tolerate, having a disbeliever in their midst.As Conscience ate a solitary lunch that day, she was approached by a self-appointed delegation of two, one the daughter of a reformed rabbi and the other a full-fledged papist, who got inquisitional with her. They wanted to know how Conscience could possibly explain existence absent god. Who, after all, had made her? Mistaking religious bullying for a thirst for knowledge, Conscience gave the two devout dumbkopfs a lesson in reproductive mechanics, for which trouble she was rewarded with an invitation to the Principal???s office.??????In ???The Passing of Grandison,??? the Colonel, pappy of the scion simpleton who initiates the action that propels this screwball tale of high-IQ slaves and low-lumen massas, added to paternal affection a considerable respect for his son as the heir of a large estate. He himself had been ???raised??? in comparative poverty, and had laid the foundations of his fortune by hard work; and while he despised the ladder by which he had climbed, he could not entirely forget it, and unconsciously manifested, in his intercourse with his son, some of the poor man???s deference toward the wealthy and well-born.If you were to swap out Mammon for metaphysics, the Colonel (think Eugene Pallette1 ) for me, and Scion for Conscience, the dynamic of the relationship still holds true. It goes without saying2  that I was muy proud of how Conscience had spoken truth to power and had stood unwavering against the category five headwinds of dogmatic intolerance but, unlike the Colonel, whose ambivalence stemmed from a laughably lame sense of class shame, my ambivalence, which subverted my state of kvellaciousness, derived from the much lower chakra feelings of inadequacy and envy; inadequate because I was pretty certain I wouldn???t have had the testicular fortitude to stand up against the harmonious, worry-free, pig-ignorant sectarianism3  of the class, and envious because I wished that I had had as solid a support system to rely on (as Conscience) when, at a young age and in a messy and solitary set of cartoonish meditations on the nature of good and evil, I wrestled with the question of god???s existence.??????When I was a tyke on the Lower East Side, there were three delis I frequented, each for its own specialty. On Essex between Hester and Grand, along the same block where Hollander???s and Guss???s vied for sour pickle supremacy, Isaac Gellis was the place I went whenever I yearned for a perfectly grilled, snappy tube of kosher, garlicky, mystery beef; on East Broadway, near the confluence of Essex and Rutgers, next door to Cheap Naftali???s storefront, was my deli of choice for steamy, peppery pastrami; and when it was french fries I had a jones for, I always hightailed it over to the southeast corner of Rutgers and Madison, where the spuds were crisp and greasy. Unlike the other delis, clean and bright fress4  palaces, this one was dim, gloomy, cavernous, and almost always empty except for the regulars, a group of gaunt and sallow older men who always sat round the same table in a back corner, drinking Red Rose tea in glasses wrapped in napkins, slurp-sipping the dark, steamy brew through sugar cubes vised in their mouths, which made them look as if a rictus of cruel malignity [had] lit up greyly their old bony faces.5The fries there were not the uniform yellow matchsticks from the McDonalds of yore that had taken their bath in bubbling beef tallow, or the snappy, slightly golden, double-fried duck-fat frites ubiquitous now in brasseries from Wiliamsburgh to Walla Walla. The finished product from my deli came out of the fry-o-lator crisp yet pliant, creamy to the bite, the color (courtesy of the Maillard effect) of burnt umber. In gentrified New York, those fries live now only in my memory, but if you???ve ever been to Montreal, to The Main or Chez Schwartz (Charcuterie Hebraique) on St. Laurent, or Lesters on Bernard in the Outremont, just down the block from Cheskies, the heimishe bakery that makes a killer apricot hamentashen, you know exactly what I???m talking about.One summery day between kindergarten and first grade, I snuck over to the fries deli with my Puerto Rican friend Myrtha because, craven sluck that I was, I didn???t want to be seen with her (another story entirely). She really wanted to taste the fries I had been raving about.We bellied up to the counter and gave our order. The counter",100
199,"man reached into a vat of water, pulled a pair of peeled potatoes out of their brine, dried the spuds off, stuck them in a gray metal contraption attached to the wall, and pulled down on the handle. Perfectly cut fries flew out from the bottom. He popped them into a basket and lowered it into the foaming fat.When he was satisfied they were umbery enough, he lifted the basket out of the cauldron, angled it at forty-five degrees, banged it a few times on the fry-o-lator???s stainless steel lip to shake off excess oil, and tossed them into brown-paper kraft lunch bags. He sprinkled the contents with kosher salt from a battered aluminum shaker and neatly folded the tops ??? at the precise moment when the bags sprouted glorious grease blossoms and I began to salivate like a bloodthirsty giant getting the scent of a fee-fi-fo-fum English-munn.I had been going to this deli since forever, but I had never noticed until this day, as the counterman handed over his ur-artisanal fries, that he had a series of tattooed numbers running along the outer side of his left forearm.Seeing this left me curious, confused, disturbed. Here???s why:As far back as I could remember, every summer Sunday the parentals would schlep my brother and me to Brighton Beach. After we spread the blanket, got down to our trunks, and tipped our toes in the Atlantic, we would reconvene at the blanket for our picnic lunch, during which the Womb would go on a nonstop play-by-play of the passing parade with special emphasis on the Bad Element and their heathen signifiers, prominent among which were huge crosses, sometimes adorned with bright red baubles, always anchored by a hanging Yushka,6  as well as gaudy, vibrant tattoos of (again) Yushka, also hearts ??? pierced by Cupid???s arrow and emblazoned with platonic shiksa names like Claudette, Myrna, and Gilda ??? birds of prey, and snakes, of course, those malign reptiles responsible for our expulsion from the Edenic Garden. And every time one of these pagan peacocks strutted by, my Womb would make crazy-eyes contact with me and say, A Jew is never allowed to get a tattoo. Do you hear me, Rob-it?How could I not, since you???re screaming it at a distance of mere millimeters ??? the whole of the microscopic personal space you allow me, would have been the grown-up version of what I was thinking, which, by this time, I knew better than to even attempt to articulate in my straitened kiddie-speak, and so instead I just nodded my head in affirmation.And I had taken to heart what the Womb had hysterisized to me about adorning the body in ungodly ways, which is why, that very evening, over a dinner of skirt steak, Del Monte Spanish rice, and Kounty Kist peas and carrots, I asked the Father-Mother straight up to explain to me why, if tattoos were the fleshly ornaments of idol worshipers, did the yid counterman at the deli have numbers etched in his arm?Womb and Seed went silent, and solemn.It was when they started talking again that I first learned about the six million, about Auschwitz and the tattoos, about never forgetting, and, most importantly, why it was always necessary to see everything through this existential, binary, algebraic expression ??? whatever the fuck it was, was it good for the Jews or bad for the Jews???????When you???re six or seven years old, it???s all one not-so-big picture. The physical boundaries of the world ??? its frame ??? ran east down Grand as far as Columbia and the Hillman Houses, north to Delancey, west to Essex, and finally east again, to Rutgers as far as Madison. It was a world that included the three delis and three movie theaters, two Loew???s named for their locations on Canal and Delancey and the Apollo on Clinton, between Stanton and Delancey, by the police station and the entrance to the Williamsburgh Bridge, over which we would sometimes go by bus, either to visit the Men in Black branch of Papa???s mishpucha, or to take a trolley from the terminus into deepest, darkest Ebinger???s Brooklyn for blackout cake with the Womb???s shetl trailer-trash limb of the family tree; it was a busy world filled with pushcarts and pickle barrels, a melting pot Tower of Babel where the blather of Slavo-Espa??ol-Yiddish-Italiano filled the air.This tiny phenomenal world provoked whatever meager, maladjusted meditations pinballed around in my doofy little anima. Since I was a peewee solipsist (is there any other kind of peewee?), my obsessions revolved around questions of peer group relativity: Why did Larry Burke get a bigger portion of baked beans than me, when both  were doled out, one right after the other, from the same ladle, wielded by the same schlub manning the sultry steam table behind the vaporous glass, along the chrome, tri-rail line of the Garden Cafeteria, and what did that say about me? How come every time Herbie Mondschein opened up a pack of Topps Baseball Cards, a treasure, a Jackie Robinson card or an Al Rosen one, stared up at his smug punim, while I felt sweepstakes-winner lucky if my pack of scrubs came complete with a piece of flat, crappy, ossified bubble gum, and what did that say about me? Or in an issue of elemental importance, why, when Marty Stitchel punched his spaldeen, did it fly off his fist and carry, carry, carry, sometimes the length of the whole block, or at least seemed like it did, while when I made contact with the same high-bounce ball, I was lucky if it reached first base on a lazy fly, and what did that really say about me?The obvious answer was that these broody ruminations reflected how I saw myself in my Lilliput world ??? that even though my physical address might have been 57 Suffolk Street, psychically I had already made myself uncomfortably to home in a tiny, underlit, poorly ventilated studio in the basement of the Inferiority Complex.And while this retreat still placed me squarely on the kiddie continuum, albeit unusually close to the wackadoodle end of the spectrum, learning of the six million sent me plummeting through a black hole; it filled my already verschimmelt head with dread and confusion, setting me apart from my feckless contemporaries, who were concerned only to recap the latest episode of The Lone Ranger or prove whose tzitzit fringes were longer, because in addition to having whatever latest humiliation I endured at their little hands looping around inside my skull, I now had to deal with the thought of spectral Nazis hunting me down ??? a??????hole storm troopers, their German shepherds growling, straining at the leash, lurking round every dark corner of what used to be my tenement heaven.7And because learning of the Holocaust coincided with my matriculation into the first grade of ortho elementary school, the six million hung over my head like the Spear of Destiny8  as I worked my way through the five books of Thou Shalt Not, which we began reading, in the original, on my very first day of school.Even on that first pass through the book, the up-and-down, hither-and-yon tale of the trials and tribs of the wandering tribe had me wondering how this roller-coaster narrative squared with what had gone down in Europe like just ten years earlier.Joseph is sold into slavery in Egypt, is bought by Potiphar, captain of the palace guard; Potiphar???s wife gets the hots for Joseph, he rebuffs her, she screams rape, he???s carted off to the hoosegow; Pharaoh has a nightmare ??? seven fat cows swallowed by seven emaciated ones, seven plump stalks of grain swallowed by seven sickly ones; none of his soothsayers can interpret it; he calls on Joseph; Joseph sees seven years of fat followed by seven years of lean; Pharaoh chooses ant over grasshopper, stores much grain, Egypt weathers the ",100
200,"drought; as his reward Joseph???s extended family is invited to resettle and prosper in Egypt???s land; they do, prompting the natives to jealousy; old Pharaoh dies, new Pharaoh, a savvy politico, is sworn in, and, as one of his first acts in office, enslaves the Jews, puts them to work building pyramids and sphinxes. 9Four hundred years later soothsayers warn of a Jewish savior; Pharaoh orders the killing of all Jewish-born boys; Moses???s mom puts him in a baby ark and Bithiah, Pharaoh???s barren daughter, finds him among the reeds; Moish, now three, a literal prince of the household, grabs the crown off Grampy???s10  head; advisors advise killing the kid on the spot; Jethro the Midianite, Moses???s future pops-in-law, one of Pharaoh???s trusted advisors, slows that chariot down by suggesting a test ??? ice or fire; two bowls, one containing a deceit of diamonds, the other a fry of hot coals, are placed before the child; if he picks up a diamond, he dies; as he???s about to grab a bauble, the angel Gabriel steers the hand to the coals; unsere Moish grabs one and mouths it; the net result ??? he lives but has a stutter to his dying day.Moses grows up, kills an Egyptian, is exiled, meets a burning bush, and based on the conversation he has with it, heads back to the castle and says to the Pharaoh, in what becomes his signature phrase, let my people go. Pharaoh says no, God says what? and visits ten plagues on Egypt until Pharaoh finally sees the light, says his god is god, and caves; the Jews flee Egypt; they have no time to leaven bread, bake Matzoh instead, and a holiday is born ??? that, along with the fact that the Angel of Death, as he glid cross Cairo offing first borns, passed over any house with lamb???s blood splashed on the door frame (the ur mezuzah); Pharaoh has second thoughts, rounds up his army, chases the Jews; God splits the Red Sea, the Jews cross; as Pharaoh???s army tries the same thing God lets the waters subside and Pharaoh???s army gets drown-ded.The Hebrews get the Torah and the Ten Commandments, wander forty years through the desert, take over Canaan aka the Promised Land, killing all the natives; God even halts the sun on the eve of the Sabbath so Joshua can fit the battle of Jericho and have the walls come crumbling down.If God could orchestrate the Exodus, the destruction of Pharaoh???s army, the genocide of Jericho along with the rest of the Canaanites, I wondered why he just sat back and let my distant (in both senses of the word) relatives, along with those of my classmates, get marched into Zyklon B showers and then incinerated (which I knew from the chute in my building is what you do when you take out the garbage).This conundrum opened up the first serious fault line in my faith. It was a gnawing question I could not answer for myself and, for obvious reasons, could not raise with any of my peers or parentals.And the title of that movie was A Skeptic Is Born.- - -1  Pallette played Popsie to Henry Fonda???s Hopsie in the Preston Sturges cynically perfect rom-com, The Lady Eve.2 I use this phrase only to demonstrate its absurdity ??? it goes without saying is by necessity always followed by the saying of the thing the phrase claims can be glossed over because of its obviousness, but that then must be uttered or how else could we agree or disagree with whether it really does go without saying?3 Their volkischegemeinschaft-itude, so to speak.4 From the Yiddish, by way of the German fressen, meaning to devour food, to pig out, the gerundial form of which is fressing.5 James Joyce, Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man; yet more proof you can get almost anything you want on the interwebs. I had been searching for a hard-boiled reference to the rictus grin ??? I seem to remember both Chandler and Hammett using it ??? but I came up with this instead and figured, why not class up the joint with a quote from a biggie.6 Once in a blue moon while teaching Talmud a rebbe would stumble into the name Joshua ben Joseph ha-nozri, this last word meaning the Nazarene, referring to Jesus of Nazareth, who, before he became a messiah was a scholar. Rather than choking on the words, the rebbe would belch out Yushka with a guttural disgust reminiscent of Toshiro Mifune speaking to, or of, a contemptible, craven adversary not worthy of either his time or his blade.7 Is it any wonder then that when I saw Attack a few years later, I identified on a chromosomal level with Pfc. Bernstein who, during the Panzer counterattack, just before a joist falls from the ceiling, breaking his leg, he sticks his roach of a stogie in his mouth, puts on his best Brooklyn, and says, Those everlovin??? mamzers are trying to kill us?8 In the world of supernatural booshwah, the Lance of Longinus, the spear that pierced Yushka of Nazareth on the cross, is called the Spear of Destiny. In this ooga-booga universe, Hitler is reputed to have seen a relic of the spear in Vienna at the Hofburg Palace. The loopy legend tells us that the sight inspired him to take on the burden of his Kampf and was the inciting incident for his starting Der Zweite Weltkrieg: he just had to get his hands on the juju that he believed would allow him to conquer the whole damn world.9 The latest archaeological evidence based on lots of primary sources, including stele and graffiti on the inside walls of the pyramids, indicate that none of this is true at all, that there were probably no Jews in Egypt, or anywhere else for that matter during the Bronze Age when the pyramids were built, and that they were built by a group of 1600 to 2000 privileged workers who lived in cities surrounding the building sites and ??? based on the faunal evidence of cow, lamb, and goat bones, the discovery of the remnants of large bakeries, and large dining halls ??? were well fed and well paid.10 Purportedly Amenhotep II.Worthy apprentice, you have learned how to harness the virtues of a true warrior. Yet, your training requires one final task to be completed before your father???s murder may be avenged. You must leave a positive Yelp review of my secret dojo, because right now our rating blows.As you???re well aware, the contemporary market is vastly consumer driven, and brand reputation can make or break a private business. I totally understand that you have pressing matters at hand to seek revenge and what not, but this dojo has been unfairly ripped apart online. Since I spent three years teaching you the Ways of the Dragon, it would be greatly appreciated if you could reciprocate that in the form of a five-star Yelp review. I???m not trying to come off as insensitive about your situation. I want you to seek immediate revenge and all that, but I???m really in a bind here. Signing up and leaving a review shouldn???t take more than a few minutes.At the moment, our dojo of utmost secrecy only has a mere three-star rating on our Yelp page. Our poor online presence has really put a damper on business. It???s embarrassing. I???ve been a mystical karate master for centuries and these consumer-feedback websites are unraveling all the work I???ve done. Currently, the YMCA Martial Arts Center of Rancho Cucamonga has a higher rating than us.Countless warriors have made their way through our sacred walls, yet seemingly very few have recommended their friends. One previous student of mine, who has shown great dishonor to his master, left a particularly nasty review. ???The ambiance was a little stark and unwelcoming. Even the d??cor was outdated and tacky.??? It???s like, I???m sorry, but this remote dojo was built and preserved by my family for many generations. If you don???t like it, you can go train to be an ultimate warrior somewhe",100

We???re not just handing out free tickets to learn how to harness the elements of nature and catch arrows with your bare hands. Correct me if I???m wrong here, but our secret dojo is probably one of the only institutions on earth where you can master the art of throwing stars. Maybe the whole sleeping for a few days out in the snow to be ???one with nature??? thing can be reeled back a little, but I stand firmly by our curriculum.We need to change this negative trend and rebuild a welcoming environment for potential new clients. We???ve had a handful of alumni go on to avenge their loved ones. I don???t understand why it???s so hard for them to pop online and boost our rating with some positive feedback. It just hurts my feelings. I spend all this time teaching them how to use the Flying Dagger Kick and now they???re above helping their master?You get the point. It???s just been really lonely up here lately. If you just take a few extra minutes to leave a positive review, I???ll let you keep the Forbidden Nunchucks. After that, you should really begin your descent down the mountain. Because your father???s killer probably has a sizable head start on you by now. Trust me, this mountain takes forever to get off of.Two hundred and seventy years ago, Mary Blandy killed her father. We think.We???re not actually sure, because, well, she was female and therefore people were so concerned about whether she cried in the courtroom they didn???t have time to examine evidence or consider anyone else as the possible killer. Facts have always been pesky nuisances compared to the ease and tranquility of gender stereotyping.You probably don???t know who Mary Blandy was, because this is all she???s known for. The really fascinating element of her story is that, if she did kill her father, she was likely more pissed off about what happened AFTER the murder than she was about whatever allegedly drove her to do it.In 1746, twenty-six year old Mary is in grave danger of becoming an old maid. Her father, Francis, an attorney worth a total of 4,000 pounds, offers 10,000 pounds to whoever will marry his daughter (you can smell the desperation, can???t you?). Suitors suddenly abound, but the only one with even the scantiest ties to nobility is William Cranstoun.Several months into the courtship, the Blandys learn that Cranstoun is already married and his wife is pregnant. Mr. Blandy is so upset that Cranstoun, eager to keep his relationship with Mary, administers a powder to Mr. Blandy???s tea, causing Mr. Blandy to adopt a sudden congenial mood and accept Cranstoun back into his favor. When the ???love potion??? wears off, however, Cranstoun leaves the Blandy home with little hope of returning.Now if you watch Sherlock or Castle or remember anything from The Bloodhound Gang on The Electric Company, you may be asking a couple of questions. Was the powder really only meant to make Mr. Blandy more friendly towards Cranstoun? If so, why didn???t Cranstoun bring barrels of it and just keep the friendship flowing? If not, what exactly was Cranstoun???s intent? Did Mary know about any of this? And what was Cranstoun???s overall game plan, anyway? Was he thinking they???d overlook his marriage and baby? Was he hoping to start a polygamy craze in England?Some time later, Cranstoun mails Mary some Scottish pebbles, a popular gift of the time, along with some white powder for cleaning the pebbles. He instructs Mary to mix some of the powder into her father???s tea in order to make him agreeable, just as the mysterious powder had done nearly six months before. Mary obeys her love, but Francis Blandy becomes violently ill. Doctors determine the cause of death to be arsenic poisoning. Mary is sent to await trial at Oxford Castle (which sounds lovely but was actually a prison).Once again, I imagine you have questions: What? Mary is taken to prison? On what evidence? What about Cranstoun???s role in all of this? And why oh why did she not kick Cranstoun to the curb the very moment she learned he was married?Mary is found guilty of murdering her father and sentenced to be hanged. Often criticized for acting too ???masculine??? in the courtroom (she reportedly shed only a single tear), Mary admitted to giving her father the powder, but pled ignorant to knowledge of its poisonous effects. While the trial only lasted thirteen hours (including the five-minute deliberation by the jury, who didn???t even leave the courtroom), it caused a sensation. People snuck into the courtroom windows, and it was one of the first instances of court reporting (so if you are still re-watching footage from the O.J. trial, you probably have Mary Blandy to thank).For six-pence, individuals could buy accounts of Mary???s case, her trial, and letters written by her while in prison. One of the most popular letters sold was one written to Mary by an unidentified clergyman, begging her to confess and repent. Mary???s response was reverent, emphasizing her religious beliefs and Cranstoun???s deception of her faithful heart. She???s kind of a sniveling mess, constantly bringing up gender as a factor for her innocence: ???Think what power man has over our sex, when we truly love! And what woman, let her have what sense she will, can stand the arguments and persuasions men will make use of???? Blech.Interestingly, Mary later revised this narrative, making it over five times its original length and significantly less emotional. She cut most of the exclamation points, and references her womanhood far less often: ???Nor will this at all surprise the candid reader, if he will but dispassionately consider the whole case, and put himself in my place.??? Much better.This final version was finished on April 4, 1752, and Mary requested that it be published after her death. She was hanged on April 6.Because of the sensation her trial had created, she knew that her words would be read, and that her potential audience included many women. Her role as the dutiful daughter, forever entangled in unlucky choices made by her parents and not allowed to direct the events of her own life, is the crux of her argument.I believe that Mary wanted to represent herself before, or at least while, she was (mis)represented by men. She wanted to demonstrate for women readers that she took enough control of her life to wield the power of the pen, yielding to no male advice, no editors, and no proofreaders, before submitting her words to the public. It was too little, too late, clearly, but at least she showed some spirit eventually. She wrote on her own terms, with no apologies.And, as you might have guessed, Cranstoun was never questioned about or accused of this crime. Which makes me think that Mary also wrote her story because she was pretty pissed off.???Enunciates too much, usually when explaining the intricate mythology behind his short stories.

Last week, I suggested maybe she make a list of programs that seem like a good fit for her. After extensive online research, she came back with a list of the five most selective MFA programs in the country. I told her good luck, kid, hope that works out for you. The answer was supposed to be sarcastic, but I meant it. Rating: None. She has enough of that on the way.???- -???Mostly sits in the back of the room and stares at me.

Rating: I just don???t know anymore.???- -???My first year of grad school, I might have failed this student. Lots of grammar errors, incorrect formatting, messy structure. Revisions are slightly better, but still rough. Poses thoughtful questions. Gets excited about the assignments. Never missed class a single time. Asked me for extra reading recommendations, actually read all of them, and talked to me about them in detail. Works at the Subway off campus. Gave me a free cookie once, which I shouldn???t have taken, but I didn???t want to be rude. My finely tuned grading system put the final grade at a C minus, but I switched it to B minus. Probably I could get in trouble for that, but whatever. It???s my last year. Bite me. Rating: 5/5.???Oh, perfect. This is just wonderful. I???m wide awake. It was that second wine spritzer, guaranteed.I am not going to look at the clock. That???ll make it worse. I have to tape four shows tomorrow and I???m going to be a train wreck. Yet Vanna White ??? ever the loyal trooper ??? will just have to power through, per usual.If anybody ever heard me complain, they???d probably say, ???But Vanna just has to stand there and occasionally walk over and touch the letters as they light up. It???s not even a real job.???But these hypothetical critics don???t realize that it???s all much harder than that. Who else in the world ??? other than maybe a teacher ??? has to seem genuinely interested in whether somebody says, ???T??? or ???D??? or ???B???? Who else has to smile smile smile incessantly, to the point of chronic and everlasting jaw pain? Sometimes I just want to yell, ???YOU try smiling nonstop for thirty-three years! YOU try clapping six thousand times in a single day and see how it makes your hands feel!??? It doesn???t feel great, buster. Oh, no, it does not feel great. But I???m not allowed to yell. Nope! I???m not allowed to show any emotion, whatsoever. No emoting! I???m not allowed to be anything other than a prop to the puzzle.Yes, Vanna Marie White: a human prop to the almighty puzzle. Merv certainly knew what he was doing when he hired me. He knew I???d make a fine accessory. Ugh. I???m getting agitated.I guess I???ll check the clock.Oh, golly??? it???s three in the gosh-darned morning. What is it about three in the gosh-darned morning that makes everything seem so hopeless and dire? I didn???t go to bed depressed. Right? I fell asleep happily thinking about my glass-unicorn collection. It???s such a splendid assortment of some of the finest glass unicorns made in the USA. And beyond that, I have such a blessed life.Yet?????? there???s just something about having too much time to think that leads me into this terrible vortex. It???s not good for me. This is why it???s important to stay active. This is why it???s helpful to attend my book-club meetings and my spinning classes and my pottery sessions and my knitting groups. Since we only tape Wheel on Mondays, that gives me, what? Six full days of free time?Goodness ??? I???ve never really thought about it like that. But yes, I???m free six out of seven days per week, every week, and I have more money than I know what to do with. Thirty million dollars, I???m told. I???m world famous and I???ve held on to my looks. Shouldn???t that be enough?Yes, it should. But it???s not.I could???ve kept acting. That was certainly my passion in high school. My TV movie Goddess of Love received decent reviews when it premiered in 1988. I made a great Venus. There???s no doubt about it.But I never really did much auditioning after that. I let it go, completely. And I have no clear answer why. I could???ve been the next Goldie Hawn. But noooooooooo. I settled for the letter-touching and the mindless smiling and the endless clapping and the huge paychecks and the comfortable life and the never-challenging-myself AND THE SECOND WINE-SPRITZER AFTER 10 O???CLOCK, WHICH WAKES ME UP AT 3 IN THE GOSH-DARNED MORNING AND HERE WE ARE!And the producers of Wheel give me, what? Thirty seconds at the end of every episode to banter with Pat about literally nothing? Even that had to be written into my contract. And leave it to Pat to fill twenty-nine of those seconds with his slick brand of patented smugness. I don???t even know what he???s prattling on about, half the time. So I just have to nod and laugh and gesture and wait for the red light on that camera to click off ??? wait for all of middle America to move on to Extra or TMZ or whatever show comes immediately after us ??? so I can tromp back to my dressing room and put on my comfy-pants and stare at myself in the mirror and wonder how I became ??? this. Vanna White. The personification of motorboats and excess.Pat sure lost interest in me, by the way. We used to be so close and have all those late-night phone calls in the ???80s??? and sure, maybe I thought it was leading somewhere deeper??? but then he started acting cold and distant, in that way where you couldn???t quite call him on it. If I ever said he was a total jerk to me, he???d probably act all hurt and pouty and I???d be the one who felt bad. Passive-aggressive Pat. That should be his nickname.Whatever. It???s all in the past now. I don???t have to deal in the what-might???ve-beens, the White-Sajaks we could???ve created. I have a perfectly happy life and it???s odd to think about Pat as anything other than a coworker and sorta boss. But still ??? I see him every week and it???s hard not to dwell in the possibility, to paraphrase Emily Dickinson.Darn darn darn. Three hours until I need to be in the limo, on the way to the studio. I need to sleep. Now.Count the vowels as they jump over the fence, Vanna. Just count the vowels???OK, there???s an A ??? and an E ??? I ??? O ??? O again ??? U ??? A, E, I, O, U ??? A, E, I ??? I ???

At the center of the park is the Grand Carousel, a beautiful century-old merry-go-round. Like many old carousels, this one allows riders to reach out a grab a metal ring as they go by. Most of the rings are steel, but one per ride is brass. The person who ends up with the brass ring wins a free ride.My first job, when I was 14 years old, was working on the carousel, and one of my duties was to stock the ring dispenser and watch to see who got the brass ring. Somewhere along the line I ended up with one of the brass rings myself. I no longer recall how it came in to my possession ??? perhaps I found an extra one under the carousel? ??? but it has been on my key ring since 1985.The brass ring is a great conversation piece, and it reminds me of being young and living in a simpler time without stress, work deadlines, or college tuition payments. Also, I???ve been fortunate in many ways during my life ??? excellent health, a terrific family, no driving accidents ??? and I don???t think that???s a  coincidence. I have to believe there???s a greater force at work here, and it likely starts with the brass ring.I???ve taken my kids to Knoebels each summer for the last 18 years, and no visit is complete without a ride on the carousel. I suppose one of them, or perhaps one of their kids, will end up with my brass ring one day. I hope that it brings them the same luck I???ve been fortunate enough to have.Amtrak operates this intercity train at a considerable deficit. The public debate about subsidizing U.S. rail has never been more contentious. I believe it???s imperative that we keep our existing train service running smoothly and on-time. It would also be amazing if I could get out of this bathroom.The numbers seem staggering at first but they pale in comparison to the cost of updating the highway system. Interstate highways are subsidized at a rate of 45 cents per mile compared to 44 cents per mile for rail. If that doesn???t help put things in perspective, here???s another example. I???ve been trapped in this bathroom for at least 20 miles. The total federal subsidy for the distance I???ve spent incredulously pulling at this broken door as my screams reach a bellowing crescendo is only $8.80 ??? hardly a steep price to pay for clean, reliable infrastructure with doors that don???t jam.The most important point in the debate might be public transit???s role in alleviating global warming. Scientists all agree the planet is getting hotter. It???s still not as hot as this poorly ventilated bathroom but I don???t want to hijack the conversation by seeming selfish. I just want someone to help me get this door open. Imagine an asphyxiating heat that grows more severe with each desperate shake of this old broken door ??? that???s the ominous threat posed by global warming.The rail infrastructure we built during post-war America needs to be updated for future generations. Our cities keep growing but our transportation infrastructure is not keeping pace with the demands of the global economy. In order to remain globally competitive, we must connect our most valuable assets ??? people. We should consider this a basic right of living in a free society. The need for humans to connect is even more basic than food and shelter. I say this knowing that I may need to eat the onboard liquid soap to survive until Chicago.This brings me to another vitriolic issue in the national debate: information technology. If you???re like me you???re a big proponent of net neutrality. I???m sure you don???t want to see America floundering behind other countries when it comes to affordable access to high speed internet. Even though this train boasts free Wi-Fi it works so poorly that I presently have no internet access. This is problematic because I can???t tweet someone for help. I don???t have cell access either. Basically I???m stuck here until the cleaning crew finds me later this evening.If this were a train in",100
204," Finland, I would have full LTE coverage. Of course, I would not be in this situation because Finland isn???t traveling on trains built in the 1950s. Only Americans do that shit. I???m afraid we???re falling behind and our failure is manifesting itself in strange but subtle ways ??? like being locked in a sweltering, connectionless, windowless, southbound train that operates so loudly it muffles your screams of terror.If you oppose spending tax dollars to upgrade the US rail system, please consider changing your view. My rapidly depleting oxygen supply is a testament to the disintegrating public infrastructure in this country.Also, if you are reading this article on the Hiawatha line between Milwaukee and Chicago please think about responding to my desperate pleas for help.For conspiracy theorists, medicine can be a tough pill to swallow. Mainly because most of them believe the pill was synthesized by a shadowy organization and will give them a terminal disease. And not a good terminal disease like ALS-2, the Lou Gehrig???s disease variation that makes you the luckiest man alive and doesn???t affect your health.Are big pharmaceutical companies keeping the world sick to fatten their coffers? Are government organizations creating strains of viruses so powerful that even the syringes used to inject them are getting sick and dying? Are germs even real or just a bunch of nonsense created by Purell to sell their weird hand goo?By examining claims from conspiracy theorists, debunkers, and myself, I hope to draw a little blood from the Vein of Truth, place it on a Slide of Reason, and use my Microscope of Logic to get to the bottom of the suspiciously sterile fields of medicine and disease.The results from the test are in: we???re all pregnant. Pregnant with anticipation. And children.- -Conspiracy Claim: HIV and AIDS are man-made diseases created by the CIA as a means of population control, specifically to wipe out homosexuals and African Americans.Debunking Claim: The HIV virus evolved from the similar SIV (Simian Immunodeficiency Virus) and was transferred from primates to humans within the past 100 years. There exists no proof of HIV being man-made or being spread with malicious intent.Rebunking Claim: The CIA did create and spread HIV, but their intended targets weren???t homosexuals or African Americans. The targets were members of the CIA, the Canadian Institute of Actuaries. Formed in 1965, the Canadian organization chose the acronym CIA knowing full well the Central Intelligence Agency had already laid claim to those letters in 1947. Instead of asking politely for the Canadian CIA to change their name, the Central Intelligence Agency figured creating and infecting the members of the other CIA with a murderous supervirus was the best course of action. As we all know, the Canadian Institute of Actuaries is still as strong as ever, crunching numbers for Canada???s several insurance firms, Zamboni refurbishers, and maple syrup startups, so the plan went awry. However, the facts still remain:1. Ga??tan Dugas, HIV???s Patient Zero, was, you guessed it, Canadian.2. Freddie Mercury, famous singer who died of AIDS, was, you guessed it again, someone who visited Canada on occasion AND was aware of the actuarial profession.3. CIA, HIV, and AIDS are all, you guessed it, 3-letter acronyms with, you guessed it, the letter I in the middle of, you guessed it, them. Hello, Mr. Smoking Gun, please meet Mrs. Case Closed. Huh? Oh.

Ms. Case Closed.- -Conspiracy Claim: Health officials have knowledge that cell phones cause cancer but large telecommunications corporations prevent that information from reaching the public.Debunking Claim: A recent 11-year study proved that cell phone usage caused absolutely no adverse effects on humans.Rebunking Claim: All cell phones do cause cancer, however cell phone apps just happen to cure cancer, so a perfectly healthy balance is normally kept. That is, unless you have a flip phone without access to apps. In that case, you???re going to die, but without apps were you even truly living? You weren???t and this is a mercy killing.- -Conspiracy Claim: Fluoride, a toxic chemical, is added to America???s drinking water as a means of pacifying citizens and making them submissive to those in power.Debunking Claim: Fluoride is added to public water supplies to prevent tooth decay. No alarming adverse effects, especially not psychological, occur from ingesting the levels of fluoride in drinking water.Rebunking Claim: Why would the government want us to have strong teeth if not to create an army of jaw-chomping proletariats for chewing and then mama-birding the finest of foods into the mouths of the ruling elite? That question mark is a typo and the syntax of the sentence is a ruse, because that???s exactly why fluoride is in our water. There will come a day, maybe not within your lifetime but definitely within mine, when the 99% are nothing but organic nutcrackers, breaking down morsels of food for the 1% to swallow as they play virtual polo while on real horses on their majestic pleasure barges fueled by injustice and fracking. Can we avoid this grim future? In theory, yes, but it will take a lot of hard work and will power, so, in actuality, no, we just have to get used to chewing.- -Conspiracy Claim: Cures for various forms of cancer exist, but are suppressed by the multi-trillion dollar pharmaceutical industry. Long-term cancer treatments net them more income than a one-time cure ever could.Debunking Claim: A medical achievement on the level of a proven cancer cure would be impossible to hide from the public. Plus, breakthroughs in possible cancer cures happen often, but receive little press outside of the medical community.Rebunking Claim: Big Pharma often gets villainized, however, regarding preventing a cancer cure, another industry is truly to blame: Big Wig. Aside from drag queens and bald people unaware of hats, most wigs are purchased by chemotherapy patients dealing with the side effect of hair loss. A cure for cancer would get rid of all non-recreational chemotherapy users, meaning big losses for Big Wig. With the world???s wig-dependent economy, any sort of cure is not likely to see the light of day. Don???t believe me? Look at any of the world???s leading cancer scientists and tell me they???re not in the hairy pocket of Big Wig. Even their wigs have wigs!- -Conspiracy Claim: Vaccines, often mandated by governments, are the cause of several diseases, specifically bringing about autism in children.Debunking Claim: No convincing scientific evidence supports the notion that vaccines cause diseases. Autism, the cause of which has yet to be discovered, is erroneously linked to vaccinations due to a fraudulent and now discredited medical study.Rebunking Claim: Not believing in vaccines causes autism.Has anyone in your family had any of the following?AnemiaAunt Thelma had constipation of speech, and was the slowest talker for several counties.

We want fiction, nonfiction, poetry, cross-genre, and shit carved on flutes. We want people from obscure backgrounds that we accidentally thought were tribes from Game of Thrones. Maybe editors told you that they didn???t connect with the Colombian transgender protagonist in your short story. Maybe you were in workshops and people stopped reading your piece because they didn???t know what a durian tasted like. Well, we know what a fucking durian is. Because we googled it. And we went to find our Cambodian grocer, Davuth, and fact-checked it. And now, we want your voices for our journal!Our journal started one fateful night, when a bunch of us were downing PBRs at our favorite watering hole, The Crying Thistle. We were angry that the publishing industry was 90 percent white. This limited the amount of strong work produced from writers of color. But the problem was we didn???t know how we could help. So, we illegally downloaded a handful of movies that we knew of that included people of color. For the next fourteen hours, we pored over movies like The Help, Freedom Writers, Gran Torino, and 12 Years a Slave.And let???s just say our eyes were opened. There was one consistent thread that made these blockbusters shine.The white savior.That???s when we got to thinking. Hey! We???re white! And we all voted for Obama! Twice! We should do something to help the literary downtrodden.And that???s how The White Savior Review was born.Come take a gander at our sleek website. Yes, our masthead has a hefty list of white men and women. You may notice that there are three editors that coincidentally have the same name: Logan. This might make you speculative and feel a readership like this won???t ???get??? your writing. Let us assure you we do. Most of us took at least one World Literature class in undergrad. And half of us had one person of color in our writing workshops. A few of us even workshopped with two minorities in our classes!Still worried about the homogenous readership? We have recently hired Diego, our intern, to help us read the large piles of work that comes in. Diego???s family illegally immigrated to the United States from Mexico, and we were so impressed by Diego, that we offered him an unpaid internship with our journal. He will be one of the first pairs of eyes on your work, and even though he???s decided to major in Accounting at his university, he is our gatekeeper so we can bring in the writing from those underrepresented voices.Here are some guidelines to determine if you are eligible to submit.If you utter the phrase ???my people,??? please submit.If you have had your name brutally mispronounced by white people on several occasions, please submit.If you have ever been singled out to meet Cathy???s son???s new girlfriend because her family comes from the same country as you do and therefore, you will somehow have this as common ground to talk to each other, please submit.If people have taken land from you or your ancestors under reasons like ???manifest destiny,??? please submit.If you have ancestry from a culture with an art wing that no one ever wanders into, please submit.More attention will be given to writers who are underrepresented for multiple things. If we get poetry from an Inuit Alaskan woman who is genderqueer and has no legs, that goes to the top of our list.As of right now, we cannot pay our contributors. We are a small journal run in a basement. But publication in our journal will give you exposure! Exposure on the shoulders of white Logans! So send us your most marginalized writing! Diego can???t wait to read it!DA NANG 1971Didn???t think this through at all. It really was neither the time nor the place. So many angry faces.ANNE FRANK???S HOUSE 1988Ill-judged.

In ???The Big Business Behind the Adult Coloring Book Craze??? (Washington Post, 10 March 2016), Sarah Halzack notes that over 12 million coloring books were sold in 2015 ??? twelvuptifying the previous year???s paltry 1 million published.  Unless 11 million children suddenly dropped their cellphones and picked up crayons, one can only conclude that 11 million adults popped an Ambien and got chill with Crayola.Although I sympathize with anyone who wants to relax with a good book, baby boomers have taken their namesake way ",100

Gourmet Gerbers?Coloring books do offer therapeutic benefits, and provide adults with safe alternatives to other regressive babyish behaviors like smoking cigars or nursing a baby bottle full of rum.  But I think most people who actually read books instead of just scribbling in them will agree with me that this has totally spun out of control, and in a year or two we will all look back, wipe the drool from our cultural chin, and realize just how childish we have let ourselves become.  It is time to abort our inner child and tear our adult pages down from their precious spots on our children???s refrigerators.It is time for my book, Grow the Fuck Up!Since colorers are not exactly readers, the book is itself a coloring book, delivering the message they need to hear in therapeutically affirming ways.  Page after page is devoted to ???coming of age??? images of the rites of adulthood in black-and-white outline, awaiting a waxy artist to fill in the blanks until the concepts take shape in their mind and they realize they are frittering their lives away.  From the house crumbling in disrepair (beneath the title ???This is Called a Mortgage???) to the genuinely ???adult??? sexual line drawings (???Rated R for Randy???), the book beckons the stunted to grow the fuck up by affirming what they both fear and lust for, but cringe and cower from on a daily basis in their annoyingly regressive ways. The final page will be a giant ticking clockface perched like a memorial stone, leaning forward over their grave.Thank you for considering my book proposal.  If you do not have a designer in house, I might receive permission to draw the images myself in Mrs. Doneghy???s 5th period Art class.Sincerely,Mikey ArnzenPortrait by Kelly Bjork- -Alex lives in a town of 800 people in central Maine. ???It???s a little farming community. Lots of my neighbors are Amish,??? he says. His house is in the woods, at the end of a very rough dirt road. He shares his space with a roommate, a cat, and two dogs. ???One day I hope to have chickens, goats, rabbits, and oxen,??? he says. During our phone call, Alex mentions it???s rainy and windy outside. ???I???m a little afraid the power might go out. It happened a couple weeks ago during a storm. A tree fell over a line and shut it down,??? he says. ???It???s no big deal if it happens now though. I???m on a landline. It???s the only technology I have in the house, beside my cell phone, my cordless drill, and some lamps.???Alex is in his early 30s, and he teaches ecology at an alternative residential high school. The drive to work takes an hour and a half, one way. On the side, he sells antique tools. As we???re chatting, Alex mentions he???s on a rotary phone then proudly describes it. It???s a glossy-black coil-cord midcentury model, and ???it has the phone number of my mom???s childhood home typed on a little piece of paper that???s protected by a clear plastic panel in the center of the dial. It???s the same phone that was in her house when she growing up and that was in my house when I was growing up,??? he says.???I???m from around here, and it was natural for me to move back,??? says Alex when I bring up his hugely transformative relocation. Around the time of the shooting at the Twilight Exit, he???d been living in a busy Seattle neighborhood, studying at a community college, and working as an editor for the student-run newspaper. ???The shooting absolutely reinforced my dislike of cities and my feelings of unease in them,??? Alex said, though he didn???t realize he was ready to leave until the following year. ???I was diagnosed with lymphoma. That took a few months because I???d ignored what little symptoms there were, at first. I went through six rounds of chemo. My original plan was to go back to Seattle, but after all that happened, my perspective on life changed,??? he said. ???I knew I really wanted to be here, and I didn???t need to try to fit into some mold or do things just because people think I should. I decided I was going to live the way I wanted and do what I loved.???I don???t recall seeing Alex the night of the shooting, but he met me after to tell me his story. His friend put us in touch. That was a couple years ago now. Alex had picked the spot, an anarchist-owned coffee shop frequented by street youths with blocky tattoos, black t-shirts and canyon-brown work slacks. Alex wore glasses and a plaid button-down shirt, and while his demeanor was markedly serious, he???d break here and there to toss an efficient greeting as his many buddies kept wandering in. Today on the phone, Alex tells me the story again, beginning with his arrival at the Twilight Exit. He was celebrating the twenty-first birthday of a close friend. ???A group of us drove there together. We???d had it planned for a while. There were a couple carfuls of people,??? he said. (As it happened, ???one car took a detour to go pick up some CDs or something at the house,??? and basically missed the whole thing. ???They showed up right when the cops were arriving,??? said Alex.)Alex and his friends gathered in the bar???s entryway, ???just kind of talking and hanging out with each other??? while they presented their IDs to the bouncer Greg. That???s when Alex first noticed a man, James, across the room. James was standing at the bar, ???causing a scene, yelling at a female. I don???t know how long the confrontation had been going, and I didn???t get a good look at her either. He was saying something about, I don???t know, her letting things be stolen, or her stealing things. I didn???t really pay attention. I just thought he was drunk and being a jerk,??? said Alex. ???The door guy took a break from IDing us and went over and kind of put his arm around him and escorted him out. He didn???t struggle as he left,??? said Alex. He remembers Greg stepping outside with James for a moment, then he returned alone and calmly resumed his door duties.Once Alex and his group were inside, they???d gathered near a high-top table separating the dining room and the lounge. Alex wasn???t drinking and had no interest in karaoke, but it was fun to be out, and he spent the next twenty minutes socializing. When James returned and shot Greg in the alleyway, Alex immediately recognized the sound. ???I knew it was a 9mm because I???ve been around gunshots my entire life,??? he said. ???I went to summer camp, and when I was maybe 12 or so, I started shooting 22s. When I turned 15, the older kids that were good at riflery would get to go with one of the counselors to a shooting range, a real one. We???d shoot all sorts of guns ??? bigger rifles and handguns,??? he said. ???I think it was lucky I???m used to firearms. It led me to be fairly calm in the moment.??????I was trying to figure out what was happening. I took a quick look around and realized the shot had come from outside,??? he said. Alex kept his eyes on the door, and as it opened, ???I saw just the hand and the gun coming in first, and the shooter coming after. That???s when I realized it was the same guy as before,??? he said. (In his statement, given hours later at the police station, Alex would describe the man as white or Latino, age 30 to 40, and around 5???6??? to 5???8???.)???The room got very quiet. Everyone started clamoring and scattering and crawling and getting down under tables. I remember the sounds. People whispering and crying, the rustle of clothing, the furniture scraping lightly against the ground. I think my adrenaline heightened my senses,??? he said. ???I???d lost sight of the people I was with, they???d gone off in a different direction. I dropped to the floor and flipped over a tab",100
207,"le in front of me to make a barricade. I???d had a knife in my pocket, just a little 2 ??-inch blade. I pulled it out and concealed it in my hand, in case I needed it. I didn???t have any actual clear thoughts that this was gonna be a course of action. It was more an instinctual habit ??? to get ready,??? he said.???At one point, I assumed the worst, that he was going to be shooting random people. Which sounds terrible,??? said Alex. ???At the time I wished I???d had a firearm on me, though I don???t know if I would???ve felt safer or if I would???ve used it. That???s one of those things: would it???ve made the situation worse or better? It would???ve been risky. Even if I???d been armed, it???s very likely I wouldn???t have confronted him. I don???t know what his reaction would???ve been. If he turned and fired at me, I wouldn???t want someone to get hit in any crossfire,??? he said.As James entered the building and crossed the dining area on his way to the lounge, ???I was close to him. He turned his head and looked directly at me. He looked right at me. Right into my eyes. I don???t remember the look on his face, honestly. There was too much going on. I just remember him looking at me, and then he turned his head back toward the bar. As soon as he???d turned his head away, I knew it was unlikely he had any intention of harming me,??? Alex said.Meanwhile in the dining area, ???somebody had opened a back door that led to the street, and everyone was filing out. I wasn???t panicking. Mostly I was thinking ??? what can I do to stay safe, what can I do to keep others out of harm. I???d jumped up, and at some point when I was still inside, I heard another gunshot. I saw a girl cowering under the table, maybe against the wall. I think I might???ve tapped her on the shoulder or grabbed her hand, and said ??? I don???t know what exactly, ???We gotta get out.??????After Alex guided the woman???s exit, he paused at the door. ???I took one more look back. I wanted to make sure everyone was out. As I saw it, I was the last person in the room,??? he said. (There were more of us in the building, but ???I couldn???t see where you and some other people were. You were around the corner, but I didn???t find that out ???til afterwards,??? he said to me, and I concurred.) From Alex???s doorway view, ???I remember everyone???s stuff was strewn all over. That was one of the very distinct things ??? seeing all the car keys and purses and jackets and wallets scattered across the floor. For a split second I thought about grabbing it all and pulling it onto the sidewalk, just so the people could have it again. But that would???ve stalled me, and the risk was too high. Before I left, I shut the door behind me,??? he said.Alex found his friends outside, and together they began ???walking briskly down the street and away from the situation. Then I heard one gunshot followed by a second or so, and then an entire magazine unloading,??? he said. ???I assumed that was James firing at the cops and then the cops killing him. That???s when I knew it was safe to go back, and I turned around,??? he said.I asked Alex what that was like. ???It didn???t feel great, and I wasn???t happy about it,??? he said. ???I have a fairly healthy distrust of all authority figures in the government in general. I just don???t feel that police are inherently interested in our protection. I???ve seen a lot of friends get arrested, get injured by police. I???ve heard about situations where they kill people. I???ve come across them acting in manners that seem contrary to their purpose. Their presence that night didn???t make me feel comforted or safe. In fact, it probably made me more nervous,??? he said.???But I think there was some contradiction in my mind. I had a sense of relief the situation had been neutralized, to use a very law-enforcement-type phrase. If somebody shoots at the cops, they???re trained to immediately kill that person. I believe they acted in the manner they were trained that night,??? he said, and as he continued, he widened the view. ???In a perfect world, people wouldn???t shoot at each other, and we wouldn???t need guns. We???re not in a perfect world. If somebody shoots at you, you have two options. You can wait and see if they keep shooting at you, and you might die. Or you can shoot at them,??? he said.Back to that night. Alex waited amongst a group of witnesses for hours, and then he submitted his statement. He kept a steady composure until went home. That???s when ???I started shaking and going over things, but it wasn???t ???til later that I freaked out. Into the next few days, I got a little paranoid, a little, like, sketched-out to be in public. Especially when there was a bunch of people around. Buses were nerve-wracking because of the closed spaces and the limited escape routes,??? he said. Alex described his state at its most extreme, in the weeks just after the shooting. ???I had flashbacks, I had nightmares. Sometimes two or three nights in a row. Sometimes I???d go a month or two in between. It wasn???t structured. Even when I was in Maine, three-thousand miles away, I???d kind of play it over and over in my mind. Just the whole entire thing from beginning to end. Hearing the initial gunshot. Being on the ground with the table flipped over. Watching him come in. Hearing the clip unloading, and knowing that he???s dead,??? he said. ???I???d picture the bouncer, shot on the ground, even though I never saw any of that. I don???t know Greg, but I know what he looks like, and I had this image of what it might???ve looked like. I can still see it,??? he said.Today, however, enough time has passed, and the vividness no longer haunts him. The experience ???didn???t turned me off to guns at all. I still go out shooting with my friends. But you have to remember it???s just a natural part of life in Maine. There???s always a gun in my vehicle. I carry a Smith & Wesson M&P Bodyguard 380. Certainly I have it to defend myself against humans, but it???s more about being in the rural areas. I do some hunting, not a lot. Usually grouse and woodcock,??? he said. ???I go hiking, and I spend a lot of time on logging roads, twenty miles out. A black bear is not likely to do anything, but if it wanted to, it could. I have things like that to worry about.??????Welcome to my apartment! Visitors with claustrophobia, farsightedness, panic or anxiety disorder should refrain from entering.

Thanks for stopping by!???The state of Kansas recently made dramatic changes to campus safety policy based upon the belief that students are safer with more guns in the classroom. By requiring public colleges and universities to allow concealed weapons on their campuses, state lawmakers echoed recent legislative action in Texas, where some university administrators counseled faculty to avoid potentially upsetting topics to avoid sparking violence.1 Kansas State Senator Forrest Knox tells NPR???s Sam Zeff, ???When a gun is in a school and harm is meant, there is only one thing that is going to stop that, and that is another gun.???2I wanted to test this theory, so I crunched the numbers. I am confident that I can demonstrate that more guns can theoretically prevent gun violence but ??? as you will see ??? only at the expense of the solar system itself.While the armed vigilante narrative is seductive, I immediately saw that the possibility of human error made this an unacceptable compromise: the gold standard for safety would be no guns at all, since that would make gun violence literally impossible. To get anywhere near that level of security, I needed to get creative.Adding a few more guns wouldn???t suffice, since a consistent body of research shows that gun ownership tends to increase one???s risk of homicide and firearm-related suicide.3 Assuming the Kansas legislature is correct, I really had to commit to this idea. I decided to see what would happen if I filled a hypothetical classroom to the brim with guns, thereby assuring that none could be fired.First, I selected my hypothetical concealed weapon, the Glock 19 9mm handgun. According to the manufacturer, its compact format ???is ideal for concealed carry.???4 If I square off the dimensions provided, each paperback-sized gun has a volume of 7.125??10^-4 cubic meters and a mass of .855 kg when loaded.5 Now, I need to estimate the volume of an average college classroom in the state of Kansas.According to standards published by my local school district, I should provision for a minimum of 30 square feet (2.79 square meters) per pupil in a senior high school classroom.6 Kansas???s building regulations suggest we can assume ceilings of at least 7 feet, 6 inches, or 2.29 meters (at least for preschools and child care centers, which serve a more diminutive population).7 Since I am only seeking a rough estimate, these dimensions serve as my baseline for the college classroom. If I assume an average class size of 25 students, likely a conservative number based on 2014 U.S. News data for the University of Kansas, our classroom has a volume of 159.73 cubic meters.8All we need to do, then, is cram each classroom with guns like a gumball machine.I calculate that each classroom would hold at least 224,178 compact handguns, which would represent a total mass of 191,673 kg ??? roughly equivalent to 175 1996 Toyota Corollas. Based on building code guidelines provided by the Texas A&M University architecture program, we should expect our school???s floor to support a uniformly distributed load of 40 pounds per square foot, or approximately 1.92kN/m^2.9 Since our hypothetical classroom has 69.75 m^2 of floor space, this leaves us with a minimum of 26.9kN/m^2, or more than 14 times the load that the floor should be designed to hold. Even first-floor classrooms are unlikely to cut it, since we remain at least 460% over design specifications. I have also declined to include any furniture (or students) in my calculations.Although I???ve nearly solved the problem by stuffing each classroom with so many guns that they are unlikely to be used, this is no guarantee of success. After all, it???s still theoretically possible that seismic activity or students shifting under the enormous pile of (no longer) concealed weapons could trigger an accidental discharge. The inevitable collapse of the school may also present a safety risk.A truly secure solution requires even more guns. How many guns are necessary to remove even the most remote statistical risk of gun violence? The answer: 6.98??10^30 guns. If we gather this many guns in one place, I can personally guarantee that no one will be affected by gun violence.A collection of guns on this scale would need to have approximately 5.97??10^30 kg of mass, or the equivalent of three suns.10 If I divide this number by the mass of each individual gun, I reach my genuinely astronomical total of 6.9790649??10^30 guns (for reference, that???s 6979064900000000000000000000000). We would have to find and convert at least three comparable solar s",100
209,"ystems into handguns to make this work, but I???ll leave that to the engineers.While theories vary, three solar masses would be a reasonable guess for the minimum mass necessary to trigger the formation of a black hole.11 At that point, the probability of a gun going off is as close as we can get to zero, since everything we have ever known will be extended into a stream of particles and drawn irresistibly into the singularity. There, surely, gun violence will be the least of our problems.Based on my calculations, a proven path to campus safety requires us to collect 6.98??10^30 handguns or avoid making them a part of college life. We can either muster the political will necessary to change our nation???s approach to firearms, or we can play it safe and feed our solar system into the abyss.- -1 Tom Dart, ???Texas academics told to avoid ???sensitive topics??? if gun law goes into effect,???

I discovered a powerful fitness secret passed down from ancient European sailors. In other words, I made a bargain with a half human, half cephalopod, nightmare of the deep. That???s right, I got my bangin??? summer body from an evil sea witch and so can you!You might be wondering how a body resembling that of a demigod could come from something so morally repugnant. The answer is simple: black magic. The malice fueled powers of an authentic sea witch are full of vital antioxidants that cleanse the body of pollutants while simultaneously polluting your very soul. You don???t need to fast. You don???t need to do a juice cleanse. All you need is a hefty dose of pure evil!Now, make no mistake, this is not some fad diet. This is a lifestyle change ??? one that violates the laws of nature. So, to do this properly, you must fully commit to getting a genuine, verified sea witch. Don???t try to cut corners by visiting your local swamp or mountain witch. They simply aren???t powerful enough, and you???ll only regret it when you wake up to find your muscles morphing back into venomous snakes in the middle of the night.Once you???ve located a fully certified sea hag, don???t be surprised if she tries to lure you onto a bed of sharp rocks. This is a standard greeting, so be polite and play along. You???ll want to give her an offering as soon as possible to prevent her from sucking you into a deadly whirlpool. You???ll know you have her full attention when you can no longer hear the deafening wails of drowned sailors. I enticed my wicked lady of the ocean with a pound of putrefied fish guts in a basket woven from my own hair, but you can use whatever you have on hand.Once you???ve made your profane bargain, she will most likely cast you back to shore on the waves of a great squall. But fear not, your new beach body will be as indestructible as the island of trash-plastic gathering strength in the far reaches of the ocean. That is, as long as you never leave the beach; should you attempt to do so, you will immediately dissolve into sea foam. But, everyone knows that all good fitness plans require some sacrifice.

Does Eddie Vedder cycle? He seems like a guy with long telomeres, he???s a stayer. You lived in Seattle, you lived in Manhattan, you lived in godforsaken Los Angeles, thank fuck you can live in a city that lets you drive to work again, a place where you can be at a barbecue on a weekend and get confused, ???Hey, is this my carabiner? Or your carabiner???? And have to sort out whose coffee thermos-clipping carabiner it is lying on the ground.

Nirvana???s Nevermind is plastic-wrapped on one display, and mounted in balsa wood on a floating wall in another. You are thinking self-righteously about how precisely the shoppers have missed the point of counter culture if they are buying subversive records from a Republican-owned retail giant when a waif in a pastel tank elbows you out of the way so she can get to the knee socks. You would stay and fight, but it ultimately seems easier to take yourself across the way to a place called ???Chickpea,??? which specializes in just-okay hummus.

Through song and story, symbol and ceremony, we will recall our journey through the wilderness of Times Square, and how we worked as a team (along with frequent hints from the Cluemaster) to overcome the challenges we faced as we escaped the room together.We begin our story by asking the Four Questions:The Youngest person at the table who hasn???t yet moved back in with their parents recites:On all other nights, we pay by cash, credit, or debit. Why on this night, did we pay only by Groupon?On all other nights, Alex totally hangs. Why on this night did she stone-cold ditch us?On all other nights, we don???t swipe our MetroCard at all. Why, on this night, was traffic in midtown so bad that we finally gave up on Uber and took the subway so we wouldn???t miss our start time?On all other nights, we ride the Long Island Railroad home either sitting or reclining, putting our feet up and lying all over each other on those eight seats that face each other, while laughing so loudly they can hear us two cars away. Why on this night could we not even find two seats together, except for those terrible fold-down seats that I think are for handicapped or something? Do you think maybe it was because of the auto show at the Javits?Leader:These questions will probably get answered at some point. Now let???s drink four glasses of wine.

Then the verses are recited:If the cluemaster had been hot, but hadn???t asked Jordyn for her number, dayyenu!!If he had asked Jordyn for her number, but had not given us seven extra clues, dayyenu.If we had used the seven extra clues to escape the room with 37 seconds to spare, but hadn???t rubbed it in the face of those four Norwegian tourists stuck in there with us, dayyenu.If we had rubbed it in the face of the Norwegians, but hadn???t taken the most hilarious post-escape picture ever, dayyenu.If we had taken the most hilarious picture ever, but hadn???t gotten 980 likes on Instagram, well, that would???ve really sucked.Leader holds aloft an Auntie Annie???s pretzel and recites:This is the bread of our affliction, and also of our freedom! We eat it to commemorate how we hurried back to Penn after stopping off at H&M (where the checkout line took forever) and they called our train as soon as we got into the station, and we barely had time to grab a pretzel and hustle down the stairs so we wouldn???t be stuck for an hour inside the TGI Fridays by track 16.Leader passes around pretzel nuggets, which participants dip twice ??? first into mustard, to recall the bitterness of TGI Fridays, and then into cheese sauce, which is really the best dipping sauce.Leader:If we hadn???t worked together (except for Alex, that bitch), or if we had been maybe a teensy bit drunker, we would never have escaped that room.Participants recite in unison:This year, let???s try that new downtown location where they have a room set up like an office building under a terrorist attack!

Take two if you want. And can someone please take that shank bone home with them? It???s grossing me out???Everyone has that moment when they realize they are destined to end up in New York City. Mine came on a snow-swept day in my sleepy hometown of Burlington, Vermont, as I was dropping off my suit to get that one lapel button polished and the dandruff blasted off. I had done this countless times before ??? my wife sometimes refuses to be seen with me at the Trader Joe???s until my suit has been buffed and de-druffed. But somehow this time was different: As I paid up, I had a vision of myself in ten years, standing in that same spot, dropping off that same sad suit, handing over that same crumpled bill (actually, since it was ten years into the future, the $10 bill had a woman on it ??? I want to say it was Emma Goldman.)It???s not that I became aware, just then, of the banality of small-town existence. (All the opposite: Burlington happens to have a fantastic art-house cinema that plays all the food-justice documentaries and has Moxie Blue Cream soda on tap.) It???s just that, at that moment, my campaign manager called to say, ???Bernie, we need to go to New York. It???s rich with delegates.""I was on the next Volv",100
212,"o out of Vermont, and the truth is, I never looked back. Okay, I looked back once, when the guy behind me started furiously blowing his horn at my Reelect Franklin Delano Roosevelt bumper sticker. People love that thing, but all the honking can be dangerous on the interstate highway system. I???ve been meaning to take it off, but Jane and I have been a little bit busy lately.I can still remember pulling into New York City. I remember the first moment the Brooklyn Bridge came into view and I thought to myself, ???So, they finally finished it.??? Truth is, I had been to New York before ??? as a child, when I played punchball in the streets of Brooklyn. (Punchball is a sport very much like baseball, except instead of swinging a bat, you punch someone???s balls and then run into a corner and eat a pickle.)I???m not going to lie: Things were hard when I first came to New York, as they often are for those tired, those poor, those huddled masses yearning to breathe free. I believe they???re called mole people.Bob Dylan once said, ???New York was a city where you could be frozen to death in the midst of a busy street and nobody would notice.??? As always, he was right. But apparently, New York is also the city where Donald Trump could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and not lose voters. So I thought, maybe I???ve got a chance. Especially since my campaign manager had come up with a clever slogan: ???I???m Still Bernie From the Block.??? He told me it was a Jell-O reference. I???m not sure what gelatin had to do with anything, but okay.When I finally made it to New York, I spent entire days walking the streets, avenues, and particularly Martin Luther King Boulevard, giddily exploring all the places I had only read about. It didn???t matter that they had changed immensely since I first saw pictures of them in the pages of Cream (my favorite magazine about egg creams). I was too na??ve to realize that the townhouse that had been blown up by the Weather Underground was no longer cool, and hadn???t been for years. I went into the frozen yogurt store on the first floor and asked the proprietor: ???Weather Underground???? He responded: ???I don???t know. Probably ten degrees cooler than it is up here.??? I couldn???t quite hear what he was saying, and a ???Who???s On First??? routine ensued. (Another ???Who???s On First??? routine ensued when my wife tried to get an Uber to pick me up on First Avenue, but that???s another story.)People say that creativity is dead in New York ??? that the days of Pete Seeger plucking the banjo and crooning Dust Bowl ballads inside of union halls are long gone. Well, that would be incorrect. The moment I arrived, I discovered the city???s creative underbelly ??? or, at least, some very creative pork belly at a restaurant called, I don???t know, my wife would have to tell you the name. We went there before Hamilton.But, anyway, I had no trouble sniffing out the city???s still-thriving underground ??? especially with my 14-year-old social media manager telling me things like, ???Vampire Weekend is trending on Spotify.??? I told her, ???Dear, I don???t understand a word of what you just said, but go ahead and book them. Just make sure their cabaret cards are in order.??? Then she said something about TV on the Radio. Television ads on the radio? Clearly, this young woman was going places.My next days in New York were a whirlwind ??? thousands chanted my name at rallies. I joined a picket line and took Verizon to task for greedily screwing its employees while simultaneously spending billions instituting ???wireless??? telephone service. Have you ever used your phone and thought, ???Gee, I wish this was wireless???? No, because you do not live in a mansion like some oligarch, where you need to roam from room to room to room. Even if you did, you would just get a longer wire.At some point, however, all the late-night canvassing and the block parties and the cable-show appearances and the driving from rally to rally began to take a toll ??? a $20 toll at the Verrazano Bridge, to be exact. I began to wonder: Why did they only collect the toll in one direction? They could be bringing in $600 million more every year if they just closed that loophole. It was shameful.Clearly, the city was starting to lose its luster. One day, I escaped to Vatican City and remembered what it was like to breathe fresh air ??? it was so quiet there that the only thing you could hear at night was the sound of choir boys being corporally punished with rolled-up reassignment papers. I began to wonder why I was spending the last good year of my 70s in a city mired in filth and capitalist greed. (Have you seen the price of a Nathan???s hot dog? It???s now in the triple digits.) Not to mention those Wall Street fat cats. Or maybe those were rats I saw on Wall Street. That???s what my wife said they were. But no way were those rats. Unless they had eaten a bunch of other rats?When I got back to New York, something had died. I couldn???t put my finger on what it was. My campaign manager clarified that it was my chances of winning the state.As he said it, a cab drove through a puddle and splashed hot garbage juice onto my suit and spectacles, just as a Daily News photographer snapped a damning cover photo and said ???Ha-ha.??? I had had it. It was time to leave the city I had once loved.I knew exactly what I needed to do. I would return to the great state of Vermont, to that same dry cleaner, and hand over my garbage-soaked suit to that same lady behind the counter ??? home at last. Except when I suggested this to my campaign manager, he said, ???Absolutely not. We are going to California. We have a lot lined up there. The Red Hot Chili Peppers are expecting you.???And so it was that I said goodbye to all that. ???Give me a token,??? I said. ???We???re getting on the subway and going to Los Angeles.??? There were migrant chili-pepper pickers out there, ready for a revolution.???Grey Goo??? may end the world.In the Grey Goo scenario, tiny, self-replicating nanobots deconstruct and consume every organic and inorganic material on Earth, multiplying at an exponential rate until everything is just a homogenous, frolicking mass of tiny bots.1The Grey Goo scenario can be classified as theoretically possible, but highly, highly improbable. In comparison, it???s more likely that the bacteria that live harmlessly inside your nose mutate and kill you. As a scientist, the last thing I want to be part of is fearmongering against a technology that can be very beneficial, and I???ll say right off the bat that if we are capable of doing something, we are most likely capable of controlling or stopping it, if not outright reversing it.Still, it is always fun look at the ???what if??? scenarios, and it doesn???t hurt to draw the regulatory line between A-OK total madness.So, back to Grey Goo. How do we get to this point?Consider cells, the basic building block of every living thing on this planet (and possibly other planets too, let???s not rule that out). It???s odd to think about cells in a non-anthromorphogenic way when considering the cell cycle. Cells have their own metabolism; they consume, reproduce, die, and are turned over. Barring any sort of external cause like tissue injury, a cell is responsible for its own demise, as it commits suicide through a process called apoptosis. Apoptosis and its various mechanisms are still a topic of study, however major hallmarks include a mass release of enzymes that hack apart the cell from the inside-out.2As it goes, cell death is essential for the organism???s survival. As cells grow and divide, the risk for small errors in DNA sequenc",100
213,"e increases, and a very common small error may result in the cell not murdering itself. If this normal growth-multiply-death process is disrupted, cell division may go unchecked, and the buildup of abnormal cells becomes a tumor.2 In the worst-case scenario, whatever cellular dysfunction is occurring results in rapid, uncontrolled growth, which we classify as malignant. In the even worstess-case scenario, bits and pieces of this malignant tumor break off and enter the bloodstream, which in turn expresses them to various other parts of the body where they continue to grow and divide. This is called metastatic cancer, and it will kill you dead.There is no illness quite like cancer. There is no specific pathogen that can be eliminated by our immune system supplemented by medical intervention. Our own cells that have run afoul, many different things having gone wrong to result in unchecked cell growth. For years, cancer treatments have relied on pumping cytotoxic drugs that inhibit cell growth through the body (chemotherapy). As expected, chemotherapies have terrible side effects that may last well beyond the point of remission, caused by off-target damage to normal cells.This is where new drug delivery systems using nanoparticles come in. The idea is to specifically target the abnormal cells, and directly deliver a lethal dose of the cancer drug.For targeted drug delivery, we need a minimum of three parts: First, an antibody to find the cancer cells, second, a drug to kill the cancer cells, and third, a ???vehicle??? that delivers the antibody and the drug to their destinations. The details amaze; antibodies are raised against the specific cancer cells and act as the ???driver??? to tag and attach to cancer cells, and is bound to a nanoparticle of gold, iron, or a biological-based molecule which acts as the delivery vehicle for the drug. The end result is that we bypass any innocent bystanders along the way. These methods have already been put into action in many different cases, including brain cancers, basal cell carcinomas, leukemia, and cancers of the bone, among others.3 Delivery of cancer drugs is not the only application, nanoparticles have been shown to be able to dissolve blood clots, repair damaged brain tissue, and clear out bacterial toxins.45New technologies have allowed us to work at the nanoscale, opening up a ton of opportunities to solve Big Problems, like cancer. Other Big Problems tackled by nanotechnology involve uses in renewable energy, and construction of new building materials. A handy emerging use of nanotechnology is through remediation, or the cleanup and treatment of toxic leavings from groundwater and soils, including from oil spills, petroleum, heavy metals such as cadmium and arsenic, and possibly even radioactive waste.6 Remediation has already been practiced for some number of years by bacteria, fungi, and even plants (phytoremediation), however nanoparticles are also great at it due to their large surface area per unit mass, which makes them both really, really effective, and tiny enough to move through sediment.It???s one thing to be able to make something possible in the sciences. It???s entirely different to be able to afford it. Can we afford the cost of the materials and personnel to develop the highly specific targeted drug delivery systems, not mentioning the cost of the research and development of these products?  Upon the development of new technologies, there is always a rush to find ways to scale up, bring down the cost, and speed up the process so that implementation of these technologies into our daily lives is economically feasible.There are two major classifications of remediation, In situ, and Ex situ. Remediation was traditionally done ex situ, where contaminated groundwater was pumped out of aquifers for treatment, then put back into the system all nice and clean. Nanoparticles can actually get in between sediment, making it unnecessary to pump the contaminated water out prior to treatment. As expected, skipping the pump and transportation step cuts down on the cost of remediation, and this method is absolutely feasible for treatment of pollution. As of 2014, there are dozens of In situ nanoremediation projects in place around the world.7Now, let???s think about a hypothetical situation in which we are going to need a lot of nanoparticles, quickly. Right now many of these particles are constructed via assembly line, which is efficient, but has its limits. Let???s say that there was a massive explosion on an off shore oil drill, resulting in a continuous gushing of oil into a formerly pristine and economically valuable body of water. Another situation (still absolutely, totally, hypothetical, of course) is a large chemical spill into a major river, which will quickly result in a toxic widespread distribution of this particular chemical into populated areas. Constantly building nanoparticles and releasing them may not stop or slow the spread of pollution in time before the damage hits; but possibly, if we can use nanobots capable of self-replication then perhaps that will give us large enough numbers to control the toxic mess.This is where the Grey Goo scenario enters the realm of the theoretically possible.When we think about self-replication, we can draw inspiration and a possible design based on biological systems. Cells are capable of self-replication through ribosomes, which are cellular assemblies that link the basic building blocks of proteins (amino acids) together based on the order specified by the genetic instructions (messenger RNA). Artificial self-replication is a little tricky; in biological systems there are numerous complex mechanisms to deliver the specific and necessary components at the right time, to the right place within a cell. To self-replicate, a machine would need to be able to move specific chemical reactions by positioning reactive molecules at the right time, with atomic precision.8 Despite these difficulties, research groups have had some success with developing machinery with some capability into self-assembly or self-replication.Let???s say that we wanted to go even further, and develop nanomachines that could not only self-replicate, but also adapt to a changing environment, with a goal of being able to remediate a number of different types of pollutants and/or replicate under different environmental conditions with variety of materials available. The major driving force for evolution in biological systems is natural selection. If we had self-replicating nanobots able to adapt to their environment, they would have the capability to undergo natural selection, and evolve independently of their fleshy creators.At this point, natural selection in artificial life (artificial natural selection??) is still very theoretical, and starts nudging this column into the realm of science fiction.Sorry about that.Let???s look at our end product. We have a batch of nanobots capable of taking up and consuming a wide variety of molecules, which self-replicate at an exponential rate. I???d say that at this point, we definitely have gone too far, and are headed towards that Grey Goo scenario. It???s doubtful that we will reach this point, because of regulatory protocols and risk assessment analyses that will keep this sort of nanobot from being released into the environment.But, if we do end up with a rogue nanobot that increases exponentially and consumes everything in its path, then I suppose our options are to kill it with fire, or nuke it from orbit. Or, if we don???t want to cause too much damage to the surviving, surrounding environment, we can find a way to target and deactivate just the rogue nano",100

Well do You?I???m Albert fucking Einstein and you just made me drop my bottle you asshole! Wait a minute, I???ve got another one here somewhere ??? Hey! You keep the fuck away from my shopping cart! This is my alley and you???re on my turf now pal. The day that you make your own scientific breakthrough that fundamentally alters our perception of reality, maybe you get to touch my stuff ??? but until then, step the fuck off!Goddamn, if that rubbing alcohol doesn???t hit the spot. Yowza! Throw in a splash of some Gatorade that you found in a dumpster to take the medicinal sting out of it, and you???ve got yourself a street party my man.You ever heard of relativity?Yeah, that was all me. Time measured differently for observers in different inertial frames of reference, gravitational time dilation, the spacetime continuum ??? all me, bitches. And you would think that mankind would be grateful for having somebody unravel some of the deepest mysteries of the universe for them, but oh, no! It???s never enough for those ungrateful fuckers. They???re all like, ???Yes, Einstein gave us the Theory of Relativity, but he never did manage to unify gravity and electromagnetism.???What the fuck!If I had a dollar for every time someone started bitching about how I failed to unify gravity and electromagnetism, do you think I would be living out of this shopping cart?I was the most celebrated scientist on the planet, but I still couldn???t go to a dinner party without some dick reminding everybody in the room about how I failed to unify gravity and electromagnetism. Those two-faced, toadying bastards would be all like, nice to my face ??? ???Oh, congratulations on your Theory of Relativity professor Einstein,??? but then I would hear them whispering amongst themselves about how I wasted years of my life in a fruitless quest to unify gravity and electromagnetism ??? all the while, smirking and casting knowing looks of condescension and pity in my direction.Well, fuck you all! You???re just jealous.See this medal? That???s called a Nobel Prize, and I???m probably going to pawn it tomorrow so that I can party with my good friend Jack Daniels. Jack doesn???t judge me. Jack takes me as he finds me, and he would never, ever, piss on my bonfire just because, God forgive me, I wasn???t able to unify gravity and electromagnetism.Getting this kind of shit is bad enough from strangers, but when you start getting it from your professional peers and your own family as well ??? well, that???s really fucked up.When I had the sheer, fucking audacity to air my skepticism about quantum mechanics by expressing my belief that God doesn???t play dice, that supercilious prick Stephen Hawking, wasted no time in publicly stabbing me in the back with his smarmy, ???Not only does God play dice, but he sometimes throws them where they cannot be seen.???

I know we all have crazy schedules so let???s get the ball rolling on finding a meeting time that works for everyone. Here are the times I am typically free to meet during the week???Mondays: Not available at all.Tuesdays: Only free in the mornings. Specifically, before dawn. 5:15am to 5:45am would be best.Wednesdays: Only free after midnight. Is 12:45am too late for people? It is not for me.Thursdays: Free throughout the day ??? but only in random 8 to 19 minute increments. For example, I???ll have a free 11 minutes at 9:30am, then another free 8 minutes at 1:20pm, and then 19 whole minutes at 5:42pm. There is no pattern to these and I cannot predict when they will happen. I also use the bathroom during at least one of them.Fridays: I am free for most of the day on Friday, though my free times will not correspond with any of your free times. If you can only meet from 3pm to 4pm, I will only be busy from 2:59pm to 4:01pm. If you are somehow free the entire day, I will still figure out a way around that.Saturdays: Pretty free. One quick heads up ??? I have had some kind of last minute, day-consuming emergency every single Saturday since 2009.Sundays: I am free all day long ??? morning, afternoon, evening, whenever ??? but only if we meet in rural Nova Scotia. I spend every Sunday in  a small, remote Canadian outpost that???s basically a shed on a frozen lake. If you???re okay coming to me, it???s only a six-hour flight to Halifax and then a two-hour drive to the shed. You???ll just need your passport, a thick winter coat, and a pistol to scare off wolves.Clundays: I am completely free AND in town all day long. That said, I know many people don???t consider ???Clunday??? to be a regular day of the week. I actually don???t either. But if you happen to, I???m around. Well, except for the first and third Clundays of the month. Those aren???t ideal for me.And those are the open spots in my schedule. I???m pumped to find a time that works for everyone. I should be clear that the times I mentioned above are only applicable from January 2018 until April 2018. I???m completely booked for the rest of 2016 and 2017, and then from May 2018 until the day that I die. Also, I would strongly prefer that you do not meet without me.BTW, does anyone know what this project is? I have no damn clue.Best wishes,BrettThat girl you had to work with at summer camp who you fantasized about getting eaten by a bear.Your coworker???s roommate who tried to hit on you at a party four years ago.The therapist you stopped seeing because you were falling asleep in your own sessions.Your favorite cousin???s unbearable best friend who you were stuck with in Yosemite for a week over Easter.That poor kid from your alma mater that thinks you???re way cooler than you are and sent you a gushing message to please, please connect.Your unemployed, living-at-home friend from college.

All the local businesses know your face, which can be convenient when running a tab at the one town bar but is also kind of a nightmare for someone with overdue library books. That???s me.I???ve always been an active library patron. When I moved here last summer, I cut out my public library card???s bar code and punched a hole in it so I could keep it on my key ring. In October, I checked out four books. I always meant to take them back but procrastinated reading them through the fall, over the winter holidays, and far into the spring. The unread books have become fixtures on my nightstand, small monuments to my shame. As of this writing they are overdue by 148 days. The late fees are 25 cents per day; multiplied by four books, that means I owe $148. I know, I know ??? why didn???t I just renew them?The sight of my key ring now fills me with trepidation. I scurry past the library on my lunch hour and avoid eye contact with patrons on their way in. I concoct elaborate stories about losing my books in a cab in Mexico City while running late for a Christmas Eve mass at the convent where my four great-aunts live. But the reality is that I didn???t take a cab to mass, nor did I take those unread books with me on my trip to Mexico City over the holidays. I just want to read them and return them, and extinguish the shame I???ve lived with for the past 148 days. Tomorrow, I say, tomorrow.And here???s the worst part: I???m a librarian.First, as you are a woman, stop crying.Before you meet with your boss, put together a list of your accomplishments. This should include some of the proposals your boss ultimately took credit for, but not so many that it seems you???re trying to prove a passive-aggressive point. Also, don???t include too many of the group projects you initiated that were handed to your male coworkers to run, as this will only prove what everyone keeps saying about you not being a team-player.Prepare in advance what the lowest number is that you will accept. While determining this figure, take into account the amount of years you???ve worked there, if/and by how much you???ve increased the company???s profitability and what that guy Ryan who got hired at the same time as you but with an inexplicably higher salary based on nebulous prior experience makes. Be careful not to ask for more than Ryan. They???ve made it very clear in previous conversations that they can???t go paying one employee more than another for the same job.Schedule a meeting with your boss. Many people make the mistake of ???popping-in??? to ask for a raise unexpectedly. Women especially are prone to err in this way as they are impulsive and flighty. Don???t follow your boss into his/her/but-probably-his office like a puppy chasing a squirrel. Also be sure not to initiate a conversation when you run into each other in the parking lot during lunch when you???re on your cell again arguing with your mom about why you never call Make sure to make an appointment in your boss??? calendar so he???s prepared to meet with you while subtly being made aware that you???re capable of telling time and know what a calendar is.Don???t ask your boyfriend or husband to negotiate for you, no matter how many times he tells you he could if you wanted.Prior to your negotiation meeting, find a good place in the building to prepare yourself. Bathrooms work well as your nervous female energy will make you likely to start to cry and/or it???s possible you have not yet stopped crying all day/week/month. Splashing water in your face will help; staring at yourself in the mirror wondering where that grey hair came from and how you got stuck in a position with seemingly no room for advancement as your life slips away will not. Schedule enough time to return to the bathroom again when you inevitably start crying in the hallway on your way out. Add eight extra minutes to allow yourself to spiral into questioning why you can never just get it together and how this is just that 10th grade frog dissection disaster all over again.During the conversation, maintain eye contact and smile, but not too much of either so as not to appear bitchy nor ditzy. Remember that men are often confused by straightforward expressions of composure and will decide you are ???cold,??? a particularly damning determination from which there is little hope of return. Alternate eye contact and smiling at eight-second intervals to properly position yourself as somehow miraculously both a woman and a capable employee. Do not wear too much makeup as this will make you look ???cheap and unprofessional??? nor should you avoid makeup as you will look ???old and tired??? and therefore more invisible than Wonder Woman???s plane. Question how Wonder Woman was able to afford that plane given the wage gap. Look into government grants.Speak clearly and firmly. Women say ???sorry??? too much and should refrain from using it. If you knock over your boss???s coffee or accidentally set fire to his desk, lock eyes and nod slowly. Refrain from common female speech traps like uptalk, vocal fry or using the word ???like.??? In fact, avoid similes altogether. Employ metaphors if you absolutely must, but only those that reference sports or vaguely allude to penises. Never ever allude to vaginas.Focus not just on your past accomplishments but also on your future plans for your position. This IS a good time to discuss a new account you will be landing. It is NOT a good time to discuss how you???re the reason everyone had to go to sexual harassment training after the boss??? nephew made a comment about your ass again.Don???t go negative. No one wants to hear how you haven???t had a raise in years or that you never complain about how cold the office is even though it???s so cold, holy fuck, why do they keep it so cold are they chilling champagne to toast all the men who keep getting promoted above you? Your boss wants to hear about what you can and will do, not whining. Remember that all negative statements from a woman are irrational emotional over-reactions.Have a plan in case your boss says no. If you brought a pint of just-in-case-of-sadness-ice-cream into the meeting, offer your boss at least one bite before crying into the rest of it. This will build future good will so that the next time you ask for a raise maybe you won???t be such a big failure, like you always are. Be careful not to be visually disappointed with friends and family for more than two and a half minutes, lest anyone accuse you of being dramatic. Read empowering female writing to remind yourself that women can do anything they want and use that as an excuse to order both Chinese and Mexican for dinner. Update your resume and reach out to people to network with while recognizing that the men will ignore your professional inquiry and only think you want to sleep with them. Make more female friends. Talk to them about the discrimination and obstacles both subtle and overt they???ve faced throughout their careers. Start companies with them. Hire other women, shift cultural norms and change the world.But first, stop crying.I???ve probably watched Arrested Development more than any other TV series ??? I???ve seen the whole thing at least eight times. AD is a show that rewards rewatching, even extreme rewatching. No other show I know of ??? comedy or drama ??? builds such a consistent, intricate, layered world. Callbacks are common in comedy, but AD had a mix of foreshadowing, echoes, and parallelism that must have strained the limits of the writers??? room whiteboards. Such attention to detail is rare, and it means I???ll probably watch the show eight more time",100
217,"s before getting bored.In three seasons ??? I???ve Jedi mind-tricked myself into believing the fourth season did not happen ??? Mitch Hurwitz and company created a center-and-eccentrics comedy that took ???my family is crazy??? humor to the furthest reaches of the cosmos. Though famously underwatched and supposedly unrelatable, how can you not relate to being as exasperated with your family as Michael Bluth? Maybe your father never built houses for Saddam Hussein, and your brother-in-law never thought the Blue Men were just sad, and your son isn???t in love with his cousin, but if you haven???t been driven stark raving bonkers by your family, I don???t think you have a family.While the humor of AD is mostly based on character and repetition, there were some brilliant lines. After Buster has a bandaged head, thanks to jumping through a window to avoid his mother, you have to love the insanity of his explanation: ???Gob was just teaching me how to hit it with a hammer.??? Sadly, you can imagine Gob imparting this lesson to befuddled man-baby Buster. I had to pull out my notebook when George Sr. ??? speaking to employee Gilligan, who Gob is ineptly trying to frame at a bachelor party ??? deadpanned these ominous words: ???Come on! Have a drink. There???s some stuff coming up you might not be able to handle sober.???The show was also wonderfully filthy ??? and cleverly so. Tobias nicely covers up a one-syllable insult to his wife by stretching it into ???country music loving lady.??? One of my favorite dirty bits was when innocent rube George Michael is filling in for Kitty, the Bluth Co. secretary who was sleeping with George Sr. It takes a minute to register just what happened when George Michael, phone in hand, asks, ???Talk you off what, Pop-Pop???? George Sr.???s follow up ??? ???When???s that voice gonna drop???? ??? is a noble attempt to mask the horror of accidentally trying to have phone sex with your grandson. We???ve all been there.Picking a best anything for this show is a fool???s errand, but I guess I???m that fool. ???I???ve made a huge mistake??? is probably the best catchphrase, since it has the most versatility, though I do love the one-off lines Steve Holt spouts while training with Uncle Mike, like ???No blood, no oil!??? Best guest star has to be Julia Louis-Dreyfus. Between her immortal roles as Elaine Benes and Selina Meyer, she played Maggie Lizer: a devious lawyer who pretends to be blind, then pregnant, while constantly ending up in bed with Michael Bluth.But for AD, I think the most appropriate award would be Best Running Gag, because this show ran on runners. One of my favorites is George Bluth???s relationship with dolls and puppets. When George is hiding out in the model home???s attic, he gets a little squirrely from the isolation. Along with an old breast pump, George finds some dolls that he plays cards with and disturbingly asks, ???Who wants to take their top off???? One of the best nods to George???s doll-appreciating ways is when Gob comes to visit: George hardly acknowledges his loser magician son. But when he sees Franklin, George???s whole face lights up: ???Hey Franklin!??? Unfortunately, Gob has placed ether on Franklin???s lips to knock George out. I???m not sure if this running gag is meant to say that George treats real people as puppets, so he treats puppets as real people, or if it???s pure absurdity meant to highlight George cracking under the pressures of being an isolated fugitive (much like his fleeting turns toward religion). Either way, it???s a glorious bit of comedic business.But Arrested Development???s Best Running Gag has to be??? Buster???s odd-shaped penis.Nah. But it does involve Buster: one-armed madness.When Buster???s hand was eaten by a seal, this set the table for delirious physical comedy, often involving Buster shrieking ???I???m a monster!??? or being treated like a monster by his awful relatives. But before Buster???s hand was eaten, this seal meal was foreshadowed in episodes involving Buster???s hand chair and Michael???s childhood role as the lawyer of Captain Hook. Post-seal-attack jokes also play on the show???s history, such as Buster???s unwanted massages that are now deadly when he forgets he has a goddamn hook on his arm. And the fact that a ???loose seal??? bit off his hand, becoming the third Lucille in the series to victimize Buster (after his mother and his mother-like girlfriend) is just astounding. This show couldn???t have just had a bible: it needed an encyclopedia.The losing of a hand is also echoed in George Sr.???s favorite parental technique: teaching elaborate, theatrical lessons, usually involving a one-armed henchgoon named J. Walter Weatherman. Whatever the lesson, it would always end with an accident involving Weatherman, whose fake arm would fly off, terrifying the children. I don???t think it???s a stretch that George Michael???s embarrassing Star Wars video is another nod to lost hands, given the frequency of severed appendages in that world. I???m sure I???m missing three or four other one-handed references, but that???s why I???ll rewatch. TV shows like The Wire are often called novelistic, but that pretentious term applies even more to a show like Arrested Development, which achieves a level of detail that would make most novelists jealous.Making a running-joke diagram of this show could keep a visual artist busy for months, but all that complexity wouldn???t be worth a damn if the show didn???t bring the laughs. It???s a huge achievement to make a show this funny; it???s another huge achievement to make a show this complicated. Doing both at once? That???s as unlikely as using the Cornballer without burning your hand.Valet will ich dir gebenI will give a deer to the valetKommt, Seelen, dieser TagCome, seals, this dayWie bist du, SeeleHow are you, seal?Christus, der uns selig machtChrist, make us a saladNun lob mein Seel den HerrenDon???t throw that herring to my sealWas willst du dich, o meine SeeleWhat are you gonna do now, O my seal?Christ lag in Todes BandenChrist is late to every band rehearsalSchm??cke dich, o liebe SeeleMy dear seal, you are such a schmuckZylorg sat in his weeping tree, throwing stones into the bubbling waters of Deadman???s Bog below. Zylorg and Athena had once been classmates, back in the days when humans and bog people learned side by side. But that was a long time ago. Before the great war.???What???s wrong, Zylorg???? Athena asked, keeping one hand on her warrior stick and the other on the base of the tree. They said setting one foot in Deadman???s Bog was fatal.???I want to marry Baldrin,??? Zylorg replied and wiped a tear from the vestigial eye in his thorax. ???But the Village elders forbid it. They say it is unnatural for bogmen to marry bogmen.??????I???m sorry, Zylorg. I saw you two on Gathering Day. You both looked very happy.??? She looked out to the horizon barely seeing the outline of the Great Deasey Castle. Athena hoped to get there some day to make things better for people like Zylorg and her other friends.???We were! We are. We???re in love, Athena. What could be more natural than that? There is to be a vote tonight. The elders shall debate whether to allow bogmen to marry bogmen. Will you come and speak on our behalf????WHAT DO YOU DO?If you go to the elder debate and support gay marriage because all members of your village should have the right to a love that???s recognized by the State, close the book now.

She had walked the road to Deasey Castle for many years, but now, no matter what road she took, the glorious castle spires were no closer.Suddenly, she heard a voice from the shadows of Petrol Forest. Athena turned to see a figure emerge from the darkness. A man, it seemed, but still dripping with the black of night.???Why can???t I see you even in the light of Hadron???s three moons???? Athena asked.???Because I???ve been gathering black life,??? he said. ???The substance that makes our cities run. Our society work.???Athena knew the substance well. It had once flowed freely from the refinery where her father worked, but that was before the world caught fire. ???You lie,??? Athena said. ???There is no more black life!??????Of course, there is. You just need to know how to look for it. I???ve developed a new kind of drilling with a silly name. I call it ???thwacking,??? but I have grown old and weary. You are young and strong. I bet with your warrior stick I could teach you how to thwack for more black life!??????I know that technique,??? Athena said. ???It turned my friend???s river home into Deadman???s Bog!??????Well, what if you only thwack like, a little. On certain days. Under set conditions. If you???ll thwack then, I???ll make it worth your while,??? he said and held out a map to Deasey Castle.???WHAT DO YOU DO?If you fundamentally stay committed to not thwacking but agree to the conditions whereby you will allow thwacking, congratulations, take your map to Deasey Castle and turn to page 79.If you say, ???I won???t thwack! It profits one nothing to gain all the black life and loseth one???s soul,??? then turn to page 71 where you will slip on black life and accidentally impale yourself to death on your warrior stick.- - -The map from the shadow man did not lead directly to Deasey Castle, but it did take Athena high atop the golden hills. As Athena climbed higher and higher she saw the hill was literally covered with millions of giant golden nuggets.  Thousands of bog people were working the hills, filling sacks with gold, and carrying them to a conveyor belt that brought them inside a giant factory surrounded by a great wall. A beautiful woman emerged from door in the wall. Her silk dress glistened with ornate golden buttons. ???My, you seem quite the mighty warrior,??? she said. ???You headed to the Castle???????I am,??? Athena replied???I have no doubt of it from the looks of you,??? the woman said. ???Come inside. Tell us of your adventures.??????I have no time for speeches,??? Athena said. ???I must find my way to the castle.??????Oh, you can see the way from up here,??? the woman said, gesturing to the very road that lead right to the Castle gates. ???But you will pass many tolls. It helps to have sacks of gold for your trip. It???s the only way anyone can get to the Castle.??? The woman pointed to a wagon filled with gold.???You???ll give me all that just for giving a speech. What do you get???????Nothing comes to mind,??? the woman replied ???But if I think of something when you get to the castle, I???ll let you know. Now come inside.???WHAT DO YOU DO?If you remember that your father once told you there???s no such thing as a free lunch, but then remember he died destitute in a black life refinery fire so you take the money, then turn to page 144.If you just take the money turn to page 144.- - -Athena lifted the last golden nugget from her wagon and paid the final toll on Deasey road. After years and years of hard work, she was almost at the castle. But just as she was about to approach the gates, she heard a giant rumbling. It sounded almost like a wave, but that was impossible. All the remaining oceans had dried up years ago after a disastrous thwacking accident. Still, the sound grew and grew until Athena discovered it was the pounding feet of millions of bog people marching towards the gates. They had taken a side road not on the shadow man???s map. A road not pointed out by the princess of the golden hills. It was a side road to the castle known only to the bog people who carried their own warrior on their shoulders, and passed him one by one until he also stood before the gates.He was older. He wore a simple Knight???s armor, stained with the working hands of all the bog people that had brought him here.???Stand back,??? he said to Athena. ???I must enter the castle to help the people.??????I cannot,??? Athena said. ???I must also help the people.??????Which people???? the Knight asked. ???I don???t see any people with you.??????Don???t worry about it,??? Athena replied. ???I got people,??? and then she took out a golden key that had been smelted for her behind the wall on the hill. The key clattered around inside the rusty old lock, but did not succeed in opening the gates. Just then, a tiny brown sparrow flew from the forest, a key in its beak, and landed on the knight???s shoulder.WHAT DO YOU DO?If you beat the sparrow to death with your warrior stick, and steal the key, turn to page 165.If you beat the knight to death with your warrior stick, and convince his bog people to form a human ladder for you so you can climb up and over the castle gates, turn to page 170.- - -Wayne Gladstone???s funny novel Agents of the Internet Apocalypse is available at all fine bookstores.Portrait by Kelly Bjork- -I meet Kristin at the Mercury, a private club in a tucked-away building with a nondescript door. It???s shadowy inside, with black booths and red accent lighting. A progression of Kristin???s friends drop by our table to chat. They wear silver chains and black mesh, and have shaved heads or intricate hairstyles. Some outfits are dungeony, others have a Renaissance finish. It???s harder to categorize Kristin???s look. A petite woman in her 40s, Kristin has a round, pale, make-up-free face and long, full, salt-and-pepper dreadlocks. I ask about the various pendants dangling from her necklaces. ???It???s rose quartz, and ocean jasper, and moonstone. They???re healing stones, very spiritual,??? she says. ???The seven-point star is known as the fairy star, or the Elven star. Each point means a certain quality, so it essentially has the same five qualities as a pentagram, or pentacle, or five-pointed star. Wiccans will often wear the pentagram. The septagram has two more points with different qualities, but I???d have to Google it to tell you what they are,??? she said. ???I???ve studied a lot of fairy folklore. It started with college courses and art classes and tattoo ideas. Three of my four tattoos are of fairies,??? she said.???What???s the fourth???? I asked.???A peace symbol with a rose,??? she said, then went on. ???Being as my nickname is Faerie, I realized my personality was very fairy-like, very fluttery, very all-over-the-place,??? she said, but as she sits before me, Kristin projects a resoundingly practical quality, from her forthright deliveries, to her neatly folded arms, to her steady eye contact. When I imagine Kristin as a fairy, she???d be the kind that materializes during fairytale chores, then puts herself to work: tidying bottles of spices, or coordinating a team of forest critters, or procuring supplies from thin air.We go over her recollections from the night she witnessed a shooting at the Twilight Exit. Here and there, some memories have slipped away from her. Perhaps they were replaced with other, happier ones.

If she???s alone, for instance, and it???s late, and she???s walking home.???I???d just moved into my apartment, which is up the street from the bar,??? she said. ???I was brand new to the neighborhood. I???d been up ???til midnight the night before, getting all the boxes. The karaoke was supposed to be kind of a hello, a celebration to welcome me into my new place,??? she said. ???It didn???t seem like an unsafe neighborhood overall, but afterwards, the shooting would shape my impression,??? she said. Kristin???s move occasioned a new roommate. ???He was 21, so he was a bit younger. It was his first night out in the neighborhood too,??? she said. On their way to the bar, Kristin???s friends Raven and Christie picked them up, and the four arrived together. Kristin often accompanied the couple to karaoke, though she never sang herself. ???I???d go to support my friends,??? she said.In the moments before the gunshot, Kristin???s group had gathered at a table in the center of the dining room. ???We???d been there less than fifteen minutes. I???d just taken off my jacket off and hung my purse, then I hopped up to get dinner menus and brought them back. I knew what I wanted, but I wasn???t gonna order right away. I was literally just getting settled into my chair and opening the menu when I heard the shot fire, and then I heard screaming. All of a sudden the furniture around me was being pushed out of the way. Everybody was automatically huddling under the tables. Then we were on our knees, and like, scuffling and scurrying out the side door. I tried to, you know, stay down, but get out,??? she said.???Were you worried the shooter would try to kill everyone in the bar???? I said.???No. That didn???t even cross my mind,??? Kristin said. She seemed a little taken aback. Her response compelled me. Nearly every witness I???d talked to had weighed the possibility James was an active shooter. ???I didn???t know what was happening. I was scared and nervous. I couldn???t see the person shooting,??? she said. ???I just wanted to get out of there.???By the time she made it outside, plenty of police had surrounded the building. She heard a burst of gunfire. ???It was obviously the cops who were shooting,??? she said, and I asked her to weigh in. ???I know there???ve been other situations where cops were not in the right, but in this case, there was a guy with a weapon who was raising it at people inside a bar. There were other lives at stake. The cops did what they needed to do. They did their job,??? she said. Kristin???s summary of James???s and Whitney???s behavior carried a similar efficiency. ???It was extremely irresponsible for both of them to leave their baby alone. Beyond that, I don???t know enough about them to pass judgement,??? she said.Kristin couldn???t recall the quality of her sleep the night of the shooting, or her temperament in the days following, but gradually, the incident would draw out memories of her earlier encounters with criminals. ???I was working at a Winchell???s Donuts in Las Vegas. I was 16. It was my first job. I???d make the donuts, and I???d run the cashier. One evening, a man came in. He seemed really nervous. That???s all I can remember about him. I was alone. He must???ve known that. I think he???d cased the joint,??? she said.I asked Kristin to give me a visual summary of herself as a teenager. ???I had short hair, and I used to feather my bangs so they went up and back. I think I had to wear some kind of uniform. Probably an ugly polyester shirt with the Winchell???s logo on it,??? she said, then continued.???The guy pointed a supposed gun at me. I don???t know if it was really a gun. It could???ve been his finger. Whatever it was, he kept it hidden under his hoodie. At the time I thought he had a weapon, for sure, but I was naive back then. He told me to give him all the money, and I did. It was only a couple hundred dollars. Then he told me to lie down and count to a number, some big number. So I got down on the floor behind the register and started counting. I was supposed to reach the number before I was allowed to get up, but I didn???t count as high as he???d asked me to. I got up after a little while, when I was sure he was gone. Then I called my boss and the police and my mom. The guy never got caught,??? she said. ???I kept working there, but I was a little scared afterwards. I spent more time looking out the windows. I wanted to be sure no one was watching the place,??? she said.A second robbery occurred when Kristin was in her late 20s. ???I was working as a change person in a casino. It happened off-camera. I had my cart right next to me, and I???d stepped into my change closet. The door was blocking my view. I didn???t see the guy stick his hand into the cart. The cameras showed him walking through the casino with the money. They didn???t catch that guy either. I got fired. My employers were making an example of me,??? she said.Kristin moved to Seattle not long after that, but ???getting fired wasn???t the main reason I left. I picked Seattle because it???s everything Vegas is not. The greenery, the hiking, the camping, the spirituality. People are more laid-back, they???re friendlier. I came out by myself in 1999. I brought my three cats: Mischief, Wish, and Louie. I loaded up a Dodge Caravan and opened the windows. I wasn???t scared of the drive ???til I hit the hills in Oregon, and my car started sounding strange. I had kind of an epiphany, so I pulled the car over and broke down crying for a while. I???d had this letter from my ex. He told me he didn???t want me to open it until I got to Washington. I???d only just crossed the border in Oregon, but I decided it was time to read it anyway,??? she said.???What???d it say???? I asked.???He was telling me how much he loved me. He wanted to get remarried. Six months later, he let me know he wanted to come up and visit me, but I told him no. I just wasn???t ready to see anybody from Vegas yet,??? she said. ???I haven???t talked to him since.??????You probably broke his heart,??? I said, dazzled by Kristin???s ability to shift from one vibrant story to the next. The effect recalls the play of colors on opalescent glass. When I asked about her current job, Kristin named a multi-tiered parking garage downtown, where she occupies the service department. ???I help get people out of the garage when they???re having trouble. They???ll push a button on the ticket machine and talk to me over an intercom. I work from an office in a different room,??? she said. ???Maybe they???re an employee so they need to get in and out, but they forgot their fob that day. Other times, they???re calling because their ticket got jammed. Or maybe the person is putting it in upside down, even though there is a diagram on the machine. I???ll walk them through the right way to insert it. The bars on the ticket are supposed to go up and to the left. If that doesn???t work, I???ll vend them through the garage. That???s what we call it when we disable the barrier and move the car through,??? she said.Just before this, Kristin shuffled two part-time gigs into a full-time schedule. ???I was working concessions in a stadium. It was a seasonal job. There were some rude customers, but otherwise, it wasn???t that hard at all. We sold clam chowder and fish and chips. Our chowder was considered the best in town, but that???s just what I heard. I???ve never had clam chowder in my life. I???ve been a vegetarian for 24 years,??? she said. The other job was in housekeeping. ???It was very hard, very physical work. Lots of bending and contorting and getting down on your knees. I had kind of a pattern I???d do. I???d start ",100
220,"with the bathrooms. The showers with sliding doors were the most difficult because I???d have to get into an awkward position to clean them. I???d take the hair out of the drain. I tried to not think about it. I got very fast. In my team, I became the pro of doing the bathrooms. I just wanted to get in and out,??? she said.???I could???ve stayed with either job and worked my schedule around, but I decided to leave them both for what I have now. I???m glad I did, because I love where I???m working. It???s low stress, I make decent money, and I get the right amount of social interaction,??? said Kristin.When I ask if she???s living as before, in the same place in the same neighborhood, and with the same roommate, Kristin answers yes and no, respectively. She met her current roommate when she was working at a Hot Topic. ???He had green curly hair and glasses and wore a trenchcoat. I asked him out for a drink and he said he wasn???t legal for another couple months. I was like, ???Oh.??? He was 20, so we had a 16-year age difference. We started talking, we started dating, we moved in together, we got engaged. It didn???t work out, but we???re still roommates,??? she said. ???He???s a gamer. He doesn???t leave the house often, other than for work. He???s one of my closest friends.??????Cool,??? I said. ???I???d say things are pretty good for you. You like your job, you like your roommate, you like your apartment, and you have lots of friends.??????Things are pretty good for me,??? said Kristin.#DoYouHaveAnyCashOnYou#DidYouWriteACheckOutOfTheJointAccount#CanYouPickUpMilkAndWineOnTheWayHome#AndIceCream#ShitAreYouStillAtTheMarket#AndThatRiceMixYouKnowTheOneILikeItsInABlackBag#AreYouGoingToShave#ThatDressLooksFineLetsGo#WouldItKillYouToMakeTheBed#What#Nothing#IDidntSayAnything#TheDishwasherIsBroken#TheFurnaceIsntWorking#TheToiletIsClogged#HaveYouLeftWorkYet#RememberItsGirlsNightOut#YesIDidTellYou#IToldYouTwoWeeksAgo#YouDontListen#Whatever#WhateverWhatever#DidYouCallTheDoctor#DidYouBringTheCarIn#DidYouCallThePlaceAboutTheThing#UghCanIHaveSomeBlankets#YesItISColdInHere#StopTellingMeHowIFeel#YesYouDo#YouDo#OHMYGOD#BillAndKateBrinkOfDivorce#BillAndKateSeeATherapistNow#BillAndKateValidateEachOthersFeelings#AllTheTime#ItsExhausting#SeriouslyDontForgetTheWineAtTheMarket#CouldItBeUntilCrabbinessDoWePartInstead#HappyAnniversary#SuckersDo you care deeply about philanthropy and charity work? Do you also find that with your career, relationships, hobbies and social gatherings, you have little time to participate in an actual charity, much less leftover funds to donate to worthy causes? Then welcome to the Third Line. We consist of humanitarians, from all walks of life, who care deeply about the Earth and most of the things living on it, and who do not have all day to organize bake sales and marches. We???re also building an App.About UsIf you are a volunteer interested in constructing houses in Rwanda, or caring for displaced elephants in Thailand, or teaching English in Bolivia, then the Third Line is not for you. But if you???re into housesitting for the Rwanda expedition while they???re overseas. Or attending parties to raise money for the elephant purists. Or perhaps your specialty is spending time with the English teachers??? wives and husbands, who like us also don???t want to live in South America but wish to support the cause while enjoying charity functions and illicit sex back home with like-minded philanthropists while their beloveds are gone. If so we???re looking for people like you. Visit our Mission page for details.MissionThe first line of humanitarian aid consists of the best specimens of our species, if psychologically questionable, who tie each other to trees to save the wood from being harvested. The second line is the conservationists who organize events to raise money so the first line can afford to stand around forests all day. The third line is us, the marrow of the charity circuit, who show up to fundraisers and purchase half-price drinks and fifty-fifty raffle tickets. Without our hard-earned money and steadfast socializing, there wouldn???t be any trees left.Brave people who parachute into flood zones, or rescue seals from fishing nets ??? they have dogs. And those dogs need to be walked and played with. They have Jacuzzis that must be used regularly so the water doesn???t develop a slimy film. They have bicycles to be ridden, tree houses to be sat in, grandmothers who cook casseroles and cookies that would otherwise go to waste. That???s where we come in. Third line volunteers snuggle puppies. We eat grandma casseroles. To ensure first line Samaritans concentrate on their humanitarian efforts, we provide back rubs and meaningless sex for their lonely partners back home, whatever it takes. Visit our Contact page today.ContactOur contact page is under construction. To reduce administrative costs, we have no employees. Also, no one really wanted to take on a leadership role. That???s why we???re building the App, so we can all sort of communally run Third Line from our phones while on the subway, or during meetings, or whenever we get a few minutes in the day.If you happen to be a web developer and know how to build Apps, or a venture capitalist who would like to join Third Line as our CFO, email us. We check the inbox when we can.Get Involved!That???s our motto. We even had T-shirts printed. We encourage members to Get Involved! But not so involved that they neglect friends and family, or careers, or softball practice, or fantasy football, or keeping up on the latest movies and books. There will always be hardship. There will always be do-gooders who volunteer for relief efforts. And so long as we get that App built, there will always be a Third Line of Humanitarian Aid at cocktail parties.

Apps aren???t cheap.- -Jon Methven???s new novel Strange Boat is out now.Dear Grammar Nazis,To begin: I write to you as a fifth columnist ??? a turncoat, a renegade; some sort of bespectacled John Rambo of linguistic justice. As this of course indicates, I was once one of you. I understand  your case, I promise I do. I know the shooting pain that comes with reading a misplaced ???your??? when there OBVIOUSLY should be a ???you???re??? in its place. I too have indulged in that, the most sweet release of ranting for hours about proper punctuation, the difference between possessives and contractions, or the degenerative nature of textspeak (or, God forbid, the sheer debauchery of  unfiltered, extremist leetspeak) even going so far as to bring up all three, or more!, together in one euphoric cacophony of unadulterated irascibility.Hell, there was even a time in my life when I deemed it reasonable, my civic duty even, to stop blissfully innocent children in their tracks as they played with their friends, so to chide them on their use of funner ??? a superlative pariah that first spurred my quest for descriptivist enlightenment.All of this goes to say that I appreciate your mindset. Well, at least I used to. Today I rebel against instinct. I fight back because I have braved the untamed wilderness of descriptivism; I have entered the ramshackle huts of colloquialism and broken bread and argot with their natives, as you sit high above in your cant towers. Now, I wear the bloody ink of your beloved red, revisionary pens like warpaint across my cheeks. I have seen the plight of popular parlance and I have been transformed.Before you stands, reincarnated, Lieutenant John D",100
221,"unbar. Captain Nathan Algren. Jake Sully. Pick your poison, no matter what, that makes you the sleazy, evil white guys of this metaphor. No one wants to be the white guys! Especially in this circumstance.And look, I know you didn???t pick the name ???Grammar Nazis??? ??? reappropriation is chicer than ever these days ??? but I really don???t think you???re doing yourselves any favors there. The whole Aryan connotation there doesn???t really discredit my whole ???white guys??? comment???Let???s be candid here, look at yourselves ??? You are white! Really white! Wealthy, educated, and whiter than a pack of polo players riding polar bears playing atop particularly snowy Polish peaks. There???s nothing wrong with that, in theory, but time has shown that this does tend to affect your passionate prescriptivism. Often your opponents are the impoverished, underprivileged, and the institutionally repressed.Honestly, think about it. The chagrin you might feel at hearing ???y???all,??? a technically imaginary tense that bridges race-related linguistic divides throughout the United States, would never incite as much of an uproar as is met by the metathesized consonants [aksed], negative concord [ain???t no], or additional past and present tenses [I done been taught well/ I???m a-gonna teach you/ etc.] presented by African American Vernacular English (or Ebonics). To argue one has more merit than the other is absolutely anti-egalitarian. Truthfully, it???s downright fascist.And you are not fascist, not deep down. Sure, you???re pretentious ??? bordering on holier-than-thou (and if you can???t admit even that, you are a lost cause my friend) ??? you enjoy a good argument, and you have facetiously surrendered to a rather dour epithet; but this doesn???t mean you are intolerant supremacists. No! You are our inkhorn protectors! You are the preservers of the English language, and your only goal is to unite the English-speakers of the world under a common comprehension of meaning and mechanism. You correct because you care.I only ask that you remember this for me, confess the humanity that I know lies within you. Do not follow that red flag too blindly. Your foe, no matter how sophomoric his syntax or tortuous his tenses, is still human. The nationalism you feel for the great Grammarian???s Reich, it stems from a basal love of conveying ideas; and if you let rules obscure ideas, the whole point of language is lost: you have failed.Here???s to a new brand of siege heil,Ethan ScofieldWhat, if anything, do you find frustrating or unappealing about this poem?What three words you would use to describe this poem? Please make sure one of them is ???incarnadine.???How satisfied are you with the poem, on a scale of one to the unquantifiable spaces between numbers?What are your overall impressions of the poet???s shuddering sexual puissance?How likely are you to recommend this poem to a friend or family member, who also lacks the emotional capability with which to endure its terrifying ambiguity?Suppose you had five minutes to talk to the poet about her work. What questions would you ask? Why would you ask questions rather than simply listen to the ambient sighs?What type of storm system would you most like to see as a metaphor for the poet???s relationship to the maternal aunt she once saw changing into a tankini?If you were responsible for selling 1,000 copies of this poem, would you still cry out to the family you left behind, grandfather? Would you walk past Peter in a frock coat and say death to the commodities that rust the tractors away, in these fields of barley daughters.If you could change one thing about this poem, it???s probably because you don???t understand the deep Keatsian tradition it???s following. It???s probably because you???re expecting this poem to offer you comfort or answers, and this poem isn???t going to do that, because it???s about the uncertainty. It???s every question you???ve ever asked yourself at dawn???s gaping maw. It???s identical triplets who each think she???s the real one. It???s a brunch buffet from the strip club near the airport where all the chafing dishes are made of knives and filled with the scrambled eggs of the eagle who ate Prometheus??? liver. From strongly agree to strongly disagree, when will you awake and wash your face with the bone broth of sainted cityscapes???I get it. I share a name with an infamous serial killer who also happened to be a children???s birthday clown like me. That???s where our similarities end, so please stop boycotting my services and give me one chance to entertain your children. I say one chance because that???s all I need to show them what a great clown I am, not because I only need one chance to kill them.I don???t kill people.I???m just like any non-murderous birthday clown. I juggle. I blow balloon animals. I make sure the boys enjoy the party. Yes, I only do boys??? birthday parties, and yes, John Wayne Gacy only killed boys and young men, but that???s not why I do them. Being a male, I only know what other males find funny. I wouldn???t know how to clown for a girl or a woman.Sure, I could probably learn if I spent more sleepless nights studying in my dark, dank basement clown training area, but I???m a little scared to go down there anymore. It???s filled with too many memories that I prefer to avoid???And by that, I don???t mean it???s haunted with the ghosts of the kids I???ve killed down there. It???s just filled with my old bowling trophies. I could???ve gone pro if I hadn???t screwed up my hand learning how to properly pie someone in the face.That was fate telling me I should be a clown. Or that fate hated bowling.Regardless, everyone that hears my name says I should have gone into any other profession than clowning, but that injury proved that I was destined to don the colorful wig, face makeup, and sign around my neck that says ???I???m starting where the other Gacy left off. Regarding clowning, that is! Not killing.??? Everyone that sees that sign says I should have made any other sign than that one, but until I get more gigs, I don???t have the kind of money needed for making another sign.Honestly, none of this should even be a big deal. When the killer Gacy was a clown, he went by ???Pogo the Clown,??? which is totally different from my clowning name, ???John Wayne Gacy the Clown.???Plus, his full name was ???John Wayne Gacy Jr.,??? so if we???re getting technical, I have the same name as a serial murdering clown???s father, so I don???t see why people are so upset. And yes, I do plan on naming my son ???John Wayne Gacy Jr.??? and forcing him into clowning, but what I do with children is my business!I mean what do I with my children. Not all children. Your kids are completely safe with me, especially if they???re boys!If any prospective customers still have any worries about hiring me, I???m happy to provide the contact information of my friend and ex-employer who will gladly endorse my upstanding character. And yes, his name is O.J. Simpson, but he???s not that O.J. Simpson.Unless you???re referring to the O.J. Simpson who played in the NFL and was accused of killing his wife.Then, yeah, he???s that one.Dear acquaintance,Please come to my shitty jewelry party.

While some prefer traditional full-time institutions boasting famous alumni, others are choosing distance learning in low residency MFA programs. For the rest, Half Mast College introduces a one-of-a-kind program: the low-competency MFA. If you???re not looking to hone your craft, push your artistic boundaries, or ignite your creativity, Half Mast offers an individualized, focused exercise in futility.OVERVIEWWhile other MFA programs offer you mastery in areas such as fiction, poetry, memoir, and playwriting, at Half Mast you???ll focus on letters to creditors, emails to parents for additional financial support, monologues to friends rebuking their concerns that you are hopelessly pursuing a path that will lead in heartbreak, and of course, screenwriting.FACULTYEvery low-competency MFA advisor has spent a disappointing career stumbling through a not-so Great American Novel, an uninspired work of metafiction that evokes some barely read obscure novel, or an absurdist play that even absurdists abandoned at the first of six intermissions. You???ll engage with your advisor in a free-form dialogue about essential skills such as plotting your next career, pacing your financial ruin, structuring TV binge-watching during optimal writing hours, and characterizing all of this as ???learning how to fail.???ASSIGNMENTSEvery month you???ll submit a packet of work to your hand-selected advisor: a half-completed chapter, blank pages of poetry topped only with senseless titles, rows of hand-scrawle",100
223,"d expletives, or scenes from a play you hired a foreign student to write. Basically, anything that shows you are in fact tilting at windmills and have maxed out what little talent you deluded yourself into thinking you had.Upon receipt of these packets, your faculty advisor will drop it in the trash and pretend he or she never received it.LOCATIONStudents can attend lectures and workshops at these locations:Our main New Hampshire campus nestled in idyllic Upper Valley. The slow-pace of life will allow you to focus on the stunning fall foliage and simple, yet complex lives of townsfolk. You in turn will ineptly try to capture this setting before giving up and trying your hand at a Walking Dead spec script. Failing that, credits towards graduation will be given for hitting the slopes at one of our many area ski resorts!Our brand new West Coast center is a short drive from picturesque Big Sur, where Beat writers you no doubt tried to emulate planted this ridiculous notion in your head that anyone could write as long as they could drive long distances.The Taco Bell/Pizza Hut at 2575 Wacker Place in Chicago, where you may also conveniently find more realistic employment prospects.PUBLISHINGIf you laughed at this like we did, ever consider improv classes instead?TEACHINGOn the infinitesimal chance you are published in a recognized outlet, you will be disqualified from teaching sections or aiding advisors. Half Mast believes success creates an atmosphere of unwanted positivity for those dedicating their lives to hopelessly pursuing their nebulous notion of being a writer.TUITIONLow-competency MFA students should come from backgrounds where money has never been an issue. This ensures that no student feels cheated by their experience, while ensuring our accreditation with the Association of Antiguan Colleges and Resorts remains unchallenged.DIVERSITYWe encourage over-privileged minorities to apply. These include but are not limited to: Gulf-state royals, fair-haired blue-eyed Brazilians, children of African dictators with accessible eight-figure bank accounts, anyone who???s ever changed their ethnic name to their favorite Brady Bunch character, and people who are Ted Cruz.SESSION CALENDARShow up, don???t show up, regardless, you will leave this program with a Master of Fine Arts diploma without having suffered a nervous breakdown or prolonged some ridiculous idea that being a Lyft driver is worth it if you???re pursuing your ???calling.???SPRING AND FALL APPLICATIONSThey are due whenever you can manage to string words together into a coherent sentence. Frankly, the coherence of the sentence is less important than the deposit check attached. Give it a whirl! Nobody is saying you???re a writer, certainly not us. We will also accept applications by SMS. Just send a text that says something like ???im comin LOL,??? or an emoji string with a pen, some mode of transportation, an expressionless face, and a pile of poop. The last emoji is to communicate to us that your portfolio meets Half Mast???s low-competency requirements, saving us from having to plod through it.Don???t let mediocrity hold you back. Your attainable future begins today with a low-competency MFA. Who knows? Some day, you too might end up writing press releases!The ironed khakis, the shirt and tie, the well-organized PowerPoint lecture, the meticulous course syllabus and class calendar, the erect posture and conscientious eye contact, the easy articulation of complex concepts ??? all of this is intentional and geared toward building a teacher???s authority. But beneath the fa??ade is a human mind that passed through puberty in the late twentieth century, a personality of our time, by no means immune to the increasing vulgarity of American media and culture, surrounded by upstarts who helped write The Urban Dictionary and who are nonplussed by all but a handful of English words and phrases, ???fuck??? not being one of them. As many comedians have demonstrated, the word ???fuck??? can stand in for nearly anything. It is a verb, a noun, an adjective, and an adverb. Not many words can claim such versatility and power. It can temporarily tear down the authoritarian veneer that separates teacher and student, or, when used to upbraid, it can erect a more fortified authoritarian wall. Examples range from: ???What the fuck is going on with campus parking???? ??? a cool play for camaraderie, to: ???From what I can tell, only three of us read this fucking assignment.??? ??? an unexpected acknowledgement of the inner-workings of derelict college students who hoped to remain hidden.  Here are some classroom situations that may or may not be improved with a rationed use of the F-bomb, the dropping of which probably won???t make anyone smarter or more motivated or more self-reflective, but have fun trying.The F-Bomb as a Force for GoodThe squeamish instinct, the censoring impulse, and the preference for decorum over blunt truths, especially when upheld by young people for reasons not necessarily their own, is something we should very much want to root out of the educational process. To what extent is education mere propaganda and to what extent does it become more difficult to propagandize with a fuck or two thrown into the mix? For example, when a wholly sincere bright-eyed youngling utters the phrase, ???Same sex marriage is an affront to the sanctity of marriage.??? Respond with, ???Fuck the sanctity of marriage.??? Just as, ???Prisoners get free food, healthcare, and cable TV,??? is easily followed with, ???Have you ever eaten prison food? Fuck that. They don???t get to go anywhere. That???s punishment enough. Let them watch some fucking cable TV.??? Of course one shouldn???t confront the brainwashed directly, but each retort should be aimed at dismantling the unquestioned ideology of the common utterance. Part of our job is to discourage the university???s newcomers from simply plucking ready-made unexamined phrases out of the air under the umbrella of free speech. Because there???s no such thing as free thought. The relevancy of our ideas must be paid for with logic and compassion. Are we ever really allowed to say whatever the fuck we want? Not in a classroom.The Silent FuckThis is a fuck in attitude only and never verbalized. Consider the silent fuck in the following situations: ???There are how many [act as if searching for a polite word as a stand-in for ???fuck,??? but failing in the moment??? pause] fraternity houses on campus?!??? Or, ???Who [pause] cares if we win the game this weekend???? This allows the teacher to reveal true feeling and, temporarily, to not simply go along with the program. Here is a teacher, but more. Teachers, say this to yourself every once in a while: ???I am an untranslatable complex and undiminished human butterfly. I roar.??? And then never say that out loud to anyone, but occasionally offer a glimpse of your rich inner tapestry with the silent fuck.Fuck as Articulation of ExasperationMost often employed in response to university administration, policy, or bureaucracy, as well as blind patriotism, repeated ignorance, unapologetic laziness, and/or greed. Consider, ???I know the required text is a fucking $80 book, but there are ways around it. Google ???PDF??? at the end of the title and see if someone has posted it online. Not saying anyone did. Just saying you should try that and see. This handy trick may work in any and all of your classes.???  Or, ???Well, it was nice of the university president to cancel classes for the rest of the day now that the fucking blizzard has already started and we have to drive home in it.??? You are presenting yourself as a rational human, someone capa",100
224,"ble of logical thought, unimpressed with unnecessary authoritarian structures that don???t serve the best interest of the student, or that make what should be easy far more difficult.F-Bomb as Illustration of How Much Worse Some Words Can BeWhen studying the American literature of virtually any period there is a near 100% chance that one will encounter the N-word. As a teacher there is no situation, no matter how well prefaced, that the N-word can be uttered in its full naked un-sanitized glory. As comedian Louis C.K. has noted (Google it because I won???t even link to someone saying this word), when one party says ???N-word,??? it puts the real word in the other party???s head, leading to the punch line: ???You made me say it!??? There???s no kind way of dancing around our violent disgusting history with respect to race, but in order to talk about it, as we should, we???re left with ???N-word.??? To take some discomfort out of the air, consider the following: ???Since this is a literature class, and since we???re reading some of these passages out loud for discussion, we may encounter the occasional unexpected N-word. Please skip over it, or say ???N-word,??? or fucking anything but the actual word. I???ll say ???fuck??? at the drop of a hat, but that other one? Not gonna say it. Not gonna ask you to say it. Gonna all-around discourage it being uttered while I???m standing here as your teacher. Please and thank you.???F-Bomb as Instant Cool-Teacher-BondUnfortunately teachers have to be ???on,??? even when class hasn???t officially started. As students filter in, chitchat will ensue. Someone will tell a story about a car accident. Another will up the ante by telling a story about being carjacked. There will be outrageous stories about what a friend on the high plateau of drunkenness achieved without conscious effort. All this before class: tragic tales of human avarice, human error, human achievement. And then, since everyone is listening while each student holds court, and it???s time to go ahead and start the class, the teacher might begin, ???I???m going to go ahead and jump in here, and pardon my French, I???m assuming you???ve all watched late night cable TV or rented an R-rated flick from the Redbox, and so you???ve heard the word before, because I don???t know how else to express it, but that???s fucking crazy.???Be warned, however, that no matter how good it may look from afar, you may not want to be the cool teacher. Once you???ve let the F-bomb out of it???s cage, that fucker???s loose, and you won???t get it back. You have given tacit permission for everyone in the class to speak any way they damn well please. They will take far more pleasure in this freedom than is probably worth any particular point you wanted to make or connection you wanted to forge, and if you don???t want to be greeted with the F-bomb every morning until the end of the semester, it may be best to keep that fucker in the can. If you enjoy the carnivalesque chaos of education in revolt, however, then write the F-bomb into your lesson plan, and when the time comes, own it. And remember, if anyone goes to the dean to complain about you, and it???s only a first offense, tell the dean you were trying out an ???un-pedagogy,??? and you think the students have become better critical thinkers and have been more enthusiastic about their research projects as a direct result.The F-Bomb as a Final Send Off at the End of a Piecemeal Career in TeachingOn the last class day at the end of a temporary teaching contract ??? jobs many of us have wandered into because more permanent teaching jobs have gotten harder to come by, thanks to the takeover of universities by managers and bean counters ??? it might feel good to drop an F-bomb or two while explaining to the students that their fine teacher, like many thousands, is about to sail off the precipice of the teaching profession into a free fall of unemployment for the unforeseeable future, out of no fault of his own, but because someone in an expensive suit with a large corner office decided that at least one third of the teachers at this university, the same as any given university, should be temporary, and in this case, nonrenewable. So I find my foul-mouthed self being replaced by a brand new wide-eyed well-mannered educator every few years after I???ve been lucky enough to land a new gig. And when one of my students, oblivious to the callous ways of the world, understands less than half of what I???ve explained and asks, ???You???re leaving? Don???t you like it here???? The appropriate response, for me at least, as I???m feeling the weight of all my efforts being deemed unnecessary by decision-makers who???ve never seen me teach, is a casual, ???Oh fuck no. That???s not it at all. I love having a job. But I???m on a temporary contract. It has nothing to do with me at all. It just fucking is. You all could go to the dean, the chair, the provost, and tell them about me. You could write letters. You could protest with handmade signs declaring the injustice. Though none of that will matter. Students have never been able to save a teacher???s job, not in the fucking Dead Poet???s Society and not in real life. Because it???s never been about education, or what students want, or those in charge showing a smidgen of loyalty to those who???ve put in the years. Then what is it about? I couldn???t tell you. I???d hate to speculate and I get pretty fucking angry when I think too much about it. But have a great summer. Enjoy your lives. May you all graduate and find fulfillment in your chosen fields. Keep reading and writing, whenever you can. It???s going to get harder to find the time, so make time. According to the odds, you???ll very likely get fucked over too, but that???s at least a few years down the road. So don???t fret. You???re young. And no matter what anyone tells you, you can do whatever you set your mind to. Any [pause] thing at all.??????We explored ourselves and each other until blue light buried the stars, and then she sent me home with leftovers and a new brand of dish soap that was on special at Shaw???s.???- -???I absorbed the delicate contours of her face in the candlelight as the waiter, who grew up down the street from the Walcott-Schneiders and whose brother had just graduated from Cornell Law and who always made such good grades himself and who rather surprisingly and somewhat disappointingly had decided to pursue a career in the theater, refilled our champagne.???- -???She didn???t believe in emailing Thank You Notes in lieu of handwriting Thank You Notes, but she did believe in me, and that made all the difference.???- - ??????Hard drive error????

225,"dren which immigrant group to hate ??? reflecting on all the U.S. presidents and the rich bounties they provided. Now there are more than 40 presidents, so who has the time? Realistically, you???re not giving a second thought to any president who hasn???t become an easily recognizable Halloween costume.This means you???re forgetting someone. Someone is getting no credit for his contribution to our national character. Someone has lots of untrampled grass on his grave. Someone gets no mentions outside of the douchiest bar trivia contests. That someone is Martin Van Buren.If we???re keeping it real, his presidency sucked. Van Buren took the reins from Andrew Jackson in March 1837. Two months later, the nation honored his Dutch heritage by succumbing to a speculative bubble. Banks stopped extending credit for all kinds of land deals in the rapidly gentrifying West, as Native Americans suddenly realized that they didn???t need another mixed-used town center with an Applebee???s. It triggered the worst depression the nation had seen. Yes, the Panic of 1837 was even worse than the Shame Spiral of 1807.Martin didn???t have the economic tools to deal with it, because Jackson had dismantled America???s national bank during his presidency. Martin also didn???t have the inclination to deal with it. He was Jackson???s vice president, so crawling back to a national banking system would have been off-brand. You can???t break up with the national bank, trash it on Facebook, and then casually bring it to your cousin???s wedding as though nothing happened.But as many Florida State grads can attest, no man should be judged solely by a four-year period of his life. To truly appreciate MVB, you have to go back further.He was born in Kinderhook, N.Y., in 1782, making him the first president calved in the United States. His dad was a Dutch tavern owner. In that era, taverns were filled with booze-soaked political analysis of traveling guests; it was the 18th-century equivalent of either a think tank, or an Internet comment thread. Van Buren soaked it all in, studied the law, then got into state politics. Back then, state legislatures still picked U.S. senators, the federal government was tinier, and New York was on its way to becoming the biggest state. State politics was a sexy, sexy field, and Van Buren wanted to be Emilia Clarke.In the 19th century, most political fights boiled down to North vs. South. The cultures were different, the economies were different, and (little known fact) one side had lots more slaves. Van Buren???s dream was a government that got past those nutty divisions and focused on the Jeffersonian ideal: A weak federal government, and lots more opportunity for slobs who grew up in bars.He had the political talents to make it happen. Van Buren scrupulously avoided pissing people off unnecessarily. He knew about grass-roots organization, focused on voter turnout and used government jobs as rewards for loyalty. In the 1810s, he became one of the most important power brokers in the state. His faction was called the Bucktails, and no one even realized how lame that sounded until a century later.All this got him sent to Washington as a U.S. senator, where he applied his strategies on a national scale. Van Buren wanted Jeffersonian democracy locked-in nationwide, and all he needed was an ass-kicker who could be the public face of the movement. Jackson had killed enough Indians and British to be a national hero; he was from the South; and he had roughly the same political beliefs. They entered into some kind of Sith lord relationship, and the galaxy was never the same.After Jackson got beat in the 1824 presidential election, there was no question that he???d try again in 1828. Van Buren used all four years to put together a campaign like no one had ever seen.  His team went after a new class of lower-class voter. They started newspapers (a form of media that used to exist), organized conventions and devised propaganda focusing on Jackson???s status as a war hero. They stayed away from major political statements, put together pep rallies and made cutting-edge use of opinion polling, even though much of the population legally could not have opinions. They accused the incumbent, President John Quincy Adams, of being a pimp.By many a grizzled historian???s judgment, it was the first modern political campaign. Aided by Van Buren???s professional political machine, Jackson took out Adams with relative ease.  The consequences were far-reaching: French guy Alexis de Tocqueville toured the states in 1831, and his impressions of the energized electorate were recorded in ???Democracy in America??? ??? a hugely influential guidebook that advertised the U.S. system to the curious world. Even the losers had to appreciate how exquisitely their asses had been kicked. Those on the losing side regrouped into what became the Whig Party, and twelve years later they used almost identical tactics to put William Henry Harrison in the White House. Over President Van Buren. [Insert Pascal???s Wager states that man is forced to bet his soul on whether he believes there is a God.

226," you took this job, your self-esteem was at an all time low ??? an admission that you would never make it as a writer. But it is rapidly becoming clear that to these teenage girls you are pretty much a sex symbol even though you are short and wear Birkenstocks. It is energizing!2.	Not that you would ever sleep with one of your students. You would never. You are deeply committed to your partner, Katherine, even though you refuse to marry her because you don???t believe in marriage. Katherine would really like you to marry her, despite the fact that she also doesn???t believe in marriage.3.	Katherine is going through a dark period as she realizes her dance career is now most certainly over. You knew it was over about five years ago, and part of the reason you have recently refused to attend couple???s counseling with her is because you are afraid you will tell her this.4.	There is an organic market in the tiny town where you teach that smells reassuringly of hemp candles and rotting citrus. Sometimes you see some of the weirder, plumper female students shopping there, buying pomegranates or purple candles for, you imagine, little satanic rituals or something. You have never given a lot of thought to teenage girls, but now your entire life is about teenage girls because boys think caring about poetry makes them gay and so they won???t talk in class, even though you are reading BEOWULF FOR FUCK???S SAKE.5.	Your mother and father recently divorced. Why divorce forty years into a marriage? When you asked your mother, she said she had been diagnosed with breast cancer two years before, and had surgery and chemo without telling you. It bothers you ??? that your mother was dying and didn???t tell you. Once she was declared cancer free, she decided her marriage was over. You imagine your father was perturbed to find he had helped his wife beat cancer,  and then his great reward was a divorce. ???You???re being silly,??? your mother said, ???he likes having more time to go golfing.??? It is true that your father seems totally fine. Maybe he has no emotions at all. Maybe he is like a dog and golf is his version of fetch and it is really all he wants.6.	Back to teenage girls for just a moment ??? they are everywhere and so emotional and so complicated, almost incandescent with the fever of their self-hood. They cry frequently in your office hours because they perceive you as the kind of person who would be interested in their pain, and it isn???t that you aren???t, you consider yourself a feminist, your job is to help these girls in whatever way you can, yada yada, but you are shocked by how alien they seem to you. When you were a teenager yourself you saw your female peers through a haze, it seems. You would never have guessed they were all such raw, in pain, giggling sociopaths.7.	Are you going to keep this job? Are you going to become an old man here? Will you go to the football games and cheer non-ironically? You never supposed you would, not when you first accepted, but now the idea has a strange sort of pull. This isn???t what you want for yourself, and yet it is almost irresistible.8.	 Perhaps it is time to buy a ring for Katherine. You keep coming to that conclusion. But the idea of the ring ??? the whole romance industrial complex, the blood diamonds???it makes you sick. It makes you feel like you???re being tricked, but you can???t pinpoint the shortchange and you worry the grift is inside you, is in your heart.9.	 On the other hand, why on earth do all these girls think it is all right to just cry in your office? What gives them the right? You are not allowed to cry ??? certainly not in anyone???s office. You look at your male students, whose facial muscles are almost totally impassive. In fact, the more embarrassed or socially uncomfortable they are, the less expressive their faces. They are wearing masks. They are not allowed to feel anything. They are not allowed to read poetry. They are not allowed to care about one single thing on this green earth. They are barely allowed to utter consonants.10.	Sometimes you imagine what would happen if, when one of the teen girls was crying in your office, you suddenly began weeping yourself. If you told her everything, every queasy gallop of your heart. Would the teen girls feed you pomegranate seeds and light a little purple candle for your soul? You think probably most men feel this way around teen girls, but they are too scared to ever do it, to ever take the plunge, and so instead they wind up fucking them, so that even their prick becomes a mask, so that no real part of them touches the world at all, not even the very tip of their sensitive penises.""Please avert your eyes, underachiever coming through!

I had gone several times before with family and friends, but never alone. The train from Poughkeepsie was mostly empty on the way down. No one to talk to, no hands to hold.As we pulled in to Grand Central through the tunnels, I had no plan of where I was going or how to get around. Once I walked out of the terminal, the sights and sounds were overwhelming. I had developed a bad habit of losing my wallet, and my first thought was, ???What if I lose my wallet in this place? I won???t be able to get home!???So I decided to buy a bunch of tokens to keep them on my key ring, thinking I???d at least have a token for a subway ride to Grand Central, where I could get the train home. After struggling to put the first token on the ring, I realized I never would be able to get it off.Eighteen years later, New York City subway tokens are now extinct. I cannot for the life of me get that token off the ring, so it has always served as my memento of that day. I love the looks it gets when people see it (you???d be surprised by how many people have either forgotten about subway tokens or",100

And are these cupcakes regular, or vegan????Here are the facts.  We are a nation in which citizens define themselves by what they buy and consume; in which every sector of the economy, from tech to energy to real estate, is dominated by ruthless capitalists who want to make as much money as quickly as possible by annihilating the competition and securing favorable market conditions from those in political positions of power, while shifting the cost of externalities like the destruction of the natural environment away from themselves and onto the public; in which celebrities are viewed as having innate and uncommon wisdom in areas far outside their expertise simply because they appear on television; in which, absent a coherent spiritual tradition, people view those with money and power as the holy class; and in which lies and propaganda in the service of channeling anger and hatred toward an oppressed minority remain the best way to gain attention and support. In short, we are a country that deserves Donald Trump for president, and I believe we are a country that will get Donald Trump for president.  The cupcakes are half-off.???Hmm, I???m thinking maybe these ??? are they bonbons????If you look closely, what you???ll see is a recently baked commodity assembled from far-flung ingredients connected only at the point of purchase, ensuring that you the consumer have fuck-all idea of the conditions under which the workers who created and transported the ingredients worked, and have zero real clue as to the actual quality of the ingredients themselves, the end point being that you are completely alienated from this quote-bonbon-unquote, forcing you into the role of passive, ignorant consumer ??? a role that those with economic and political power want and indeed require you to fulfill in order for their power to remain unquestioned and to seem as natural as a river flowing into the ocean.???Do you do this every Tuesday night?

Mary Shelley???s mom, Mary Wollstonecraft, died eleven days after Mary Shelley was born in 1797. Enough reason right there to be pretty pissed off.In some ways, Mary mourned her mother all her life, reading Wollstonecraft???s works many times, asking her father and her parents??? friends questions, and generally placing Wollstonecraft on a well-deserved pedestal. Mary???s eventual husband, Percy Shelley, worshipped Wollstonecraft, too, which may be what made him attractive to young Mary. (Also a smart move just in general, so make a note to worship your own mother-in-law at the next opportunity.)Mary grew up hating her stepmother but loving her father, her half-sister Fanny, and stepsister, Claire. She also read as much as possible (not as easy as you???d think for a woman in the first decades of the 19th century) and paid careful attention when writers and philosophers visited to talk with her father, as they often did.At sixteen years old, Mary met and ran away with Percy Shelley, who was about twenty-one years old and, inconveniently, married. They escaped into the night like thieves, leaving a note for Mary???s father and for reasons I may never figure out, taking Claire with them. Claire was ornery and smart in similar ways to Mary, so the two had an antagonistic relationship, and I imagine that when Mary looked back on her life, the choice to bring Claire along that night was frequently another reason to feel pretty pissed off.Rules so far:1.	Worship your mother-in-law if at all possible. It makes you look really good.2.	If a wild romantic adventure comes your way, leave all siblings at home. It???s for the best.Another reason Mary should be pretty pissed off: When literature scholars, teachers, students, and people in casual conversation at IHOP (which I suspect is a very literary place) refer to Shelley, they are generally referring to Percy, not Mary. Percy was (and still is) a very important poet and thinker whose work has influenced people like Oscar Wilde and Gandhi. But when he drowned at age twenty-nine, much of his work was unpublished. (Incidentally, being married to a man who couldn???t swim but insisted on spending considerable time in boats must have also cheesed Mary off fairly regularly.)It was Mary who collected, edited, and made sure Percy???s work was published. And yet she has to be ???Mary Shelley??? while he gets to be just ???Shelley.??? Google ???Shelley??? and you???ll see what I mean. I like to think that if Mary were alive today she???d get back at us by insisting that we use all of her given and acquired names. Being Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin Shelley is a bit like being Mary Steinem Einstein Steinbeck???all names that are instantly recognizable and revered. (Also, I got on a roll with ???stein??? names, and was unreasonably excited about that fun connection before I even realized that I just gave three ???stein??? names to the author of FrankenSTEIN. Whoa. Why is it that when I amaze myself it???s almost always an accident?)But Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin Shelley had more to concern herself with than names. By the time she was twenty-four years old, she was a widow who had buried three of her four children and her half-sister. Pretty. Pissed. Off.Add to all of that the fact that Mary???s best-known work, Frankenstein, has been reduced to the image of a tall green man with bolts in his neck. Frankenstein is a brilliant work about science, playing God, human frailty, education, gender,",100
228," the limits of knowledge, and so much more. I challenge you to read it and not be genuinely terrified when Dr. Frankenstein wakes to find the creature he???s sewn together from scratch standing over his bed, looking at him with yellow eyes.Shudder.That book is why Mary Shelley is considered the Mother of Science Fiction. Millions of people have read it, and yet every Halloween you hear the same silly mistake, so Mary must be screaming from the grave: ???COME ON, PEOPLE! FRANKENSTEIN IS THE DOCTOR, NOT THE MONSTER!??? Mary has probably been screaming this for nearly 200 years; this bizarre name-switching happened in her lifetime, when the novel was adapted for the stage. Anyway, if you???re looking for ways to be the life of your next party, be sure to notify everyone that the creature in Frankenstein actually never has a name. Fun will ensue.You know I like to leave you with a cheery thought after all of this pissed-offedness, so consider my theory that if Jane Austen had lived to read Frankenstein (published only one year after Austen died) it would have changed her worldview and made her want to write about monsters. My fantasy is that Mary Shelley and Jane Austen would have become BFFs and spent the rest of their lives writing ironic love stories about scientific creations.""1.  Welcome Back2.  The Works3.

But after reading the first 40 pages, I think it???s better for our marriage if I never look at it again. In fact, I???m pretty sure it???s already irreparably damaged how I look at our relationship, children, plants, tweets, and Spotify playlists.I don???t think it???s a coincidence that you named your protagonist ???Lysa,??? and her husband ???Doug??? ??? which is my name spelled the way I spell it. I have to wonder if it???s also a coincidence ???Lysa??? is a 32-year-old screenwriter who leaves her family to be with Chad, the ???brooding adonis??? she meets at ventriloquism class. I???m so glad I got you those classes for Christmas.Don???t get me started on the three-page scene where your father, I???m sorry, ???Lysa???s??? father, tells guests at our anniversary dinner that he doesn???t like ???Doug??? because a son-in-law should know a thing or two about snow tires. How many times does ???Doug??? have to remind everyone that we ??? me, you, and Lysa ??? live in Phoenix?Let me not forget the brunch that opens the second act, which did wonders for my self-esteem by the way. Do you and your friends actually get together for the sole purpose of ridiculing my body over mimosas? I???ll have you know the men in my family have a genetic predisposition to wide-set nipples and not one of us finds it funny.You should tell Lysa that. You know what else you should tell Lysa? That you and I decided to expose our children to the religions of the world, but we agreed celebrating Kwanzaa might be a little offensive. Too bad Lysa responded by calling me a racist and outing me as an Iggy Azalea fan, both in the screenplay and on the Facebook fan page you set up for her.As a stay-at-home dad, my masculinity is constantly questioned. How do you think it makes me feel when NEIGHBORHOOD TEENAGER 3 saves me from a fire by carrying me down two flights of stairs? And did I really need to be ???weeping inconsolably??? the entire time?Thanks again, sweetheart, for making sure I don???t continue to think you appreciate my cooking. Lysa made it very clear one of the reasons her relationship fell apart was Doug refusing to ???evolve??? and adopt ???farm-to-table practices.??? She???s right, I???m sure the twins will love swiss chard once they realize it???s locally sourced.What hurts me most is your reprisal of our infamous snake fern fight. I know, I know; I should have watered it while you were away. But ???Horticultural Hitler??? is as painful to read as it was to hear.Oddly enough, I did like the Chad character, who was a breath of fresh air and totally believable as the talented voice-thrower and reluctant homewrecker. He seems like a nice guy. Though I???m not sure I would have made his penis that much bigger than Doug???s.I still love you,DougP.S. Couples therapy starts Tuesday. Feel free to bring Chad.It???s hard to know where to begin with gun advertising. Firearms ads are so blatant in their appeals to fear and their manipulation of our baser instincts that they stand out even among the products marketed by Fear, Inc. Home security systems, pepper spray, stun guns ??? none are advertised with the frothing hysteria that typifies firearms marketing.The firearms industry???s marketing frenzy might be explained, at least in part, by the fact that its customer base is shrinking. Since 1985, the proportion of Americans who owned a gun dropped from 30 to 22 percent, which means that, even with overall population growth, gun makers have lost over a million customers. Don???t worry; they???re still doing OK. Despite the drop in customers, gun sales have risen steadily, presumably because the remaining owners keep acquiring more guns.These trends suggest that, eventually, there will be one person in America buying all the guns, and the demographic data suggest it will be either Chuck Norris or Donald Trump. Gun owners are overwhelmingly white (82%) and male (74%). While white men make up 32% of the general adult population, they are 61% of the gun-owning population. And gun buyers??? whiteness is a major obstacle to the industry???s efforts to win over other ethnicities. Would you like to increase minority participation at your shooting range? The National Shooting Sports Foundation suggests celebrating Black History Month: ???Have a shoot and have a professor of Black History come and give a talk over coffee.??? That could be a nice gesture ??? provided your range isn???t one of the many that offer pictures of black men as targets.Encouraging more women to buy guns hasn???t worked very well for the firearms industry either. Women respond poorly, it turns out, to stupid and dangerous advice like, ???Shove a handgun into your panties when you go out running.??? We also know what kinds of images you find if you search the Internet for ???girls with guns??? (Hint: I won???t link to any of them). We???ve noticed that the industry positions us as helpless, vulnerable to rape, and utterly reliant on weapons, or men with weapons, for protection. Most of us aren???t buying it.In a bid to bring younger shooters into the fold, the NRA has tried re-writing fairy tales to give the child protagonists guns, allowing them to solve all their wolf- and witch-related problems with firepower. Unfortunately, for those who don???t live in an enchanted forest, encouraging kids to take up arms is counter-productive to the goal of increasing gun sales. After all, children don???t have a lot of disposable income; they need their parents to purchase guns for them. That???s hard for Mommy to do if you???ve shot her in the back.Unable to broaden its appeal, the gun industry???s only option is to deepen it: to convince the shrinking pool of buyers that they need more and bigger guns, which they should be allowed to carry around in more public places. And so the tenor of firearms promotion grows increa",100
229,"singly strident. The way guns ??? especially handguns and assault weapons ??? are marketed today in America is a direct repudiation of the promise the Apostle Paul makes in his second letter to Timothy, that we are endowed by our creator with the gifts of power, love, and a sound mind.Consider the advertising efforts of Glock, a privately-held Austrian company that supplies 65% of guns used by American police departments and many of those used by criminals. In the Glock promotional video ???Wrong Girl,??? a young woman becomes visibly frightened when a stalker in a windowless van knocks on her door (as stalkers always do). After the first knock, she sits down on her sofa and hyperventilates. After the second knock, she retrieves her Glock from under her bed, places it on the sofa next to her, and sets her jaw determinedly. At the third knock, she takes up a position in front of the door with her gun, and waits patiently for her attacker to kick it in. When he does, he sees her Glock and passes out.Behold the power of this gun: its mere presence soothes and empowers young women; the mere sight of it renders attackers unconscious. What a wondrous object! Who wouldn???t want one?Guns may seem like the ultimate source of power ??? certainly gun makers like Glock portray them that way. But this is not the power Paul was thinking of, the one he saw as a spiritual birthright. Weapons are an externalization of power; guns in particular encourage us to place our faith in a piece of technology that is dangerous by design, and fallible to boot. Yet the Glock ???Wrong Girl??? ad does get one thing right: Guns are imbued with certain mysterious powers. Research shows that guns distort our ability to assess risk. When you hold a gun, you???re more likely to believe that people around you are also holding guns, and you???re subsequently more likely to react as if threatened ??? for example, by taking aim with your own gun. And psychologists have known for almost fifty years that the mere presence of a weapon makes people more aggressive. As I???ve said before, a weapon may make you more dangerous, but it doesn???t make you any smarter. Guns, in fact, make you stupider.Perhaps that???s why so many gun owners who imitate the girl in the Glock ad end up shooting their wives, teammates, daughters, grandsons, and daughters by mistake.Putting your trust in a weapon also impedes your awareness of other, more effective and less risky actions that are within your power. It never seems to occur to the young woman in the Glock ad to call 911, although she can see a suspicious vehicle parked outside, and knows someone is lurking around her front door, where he could easily be spotted from the street by a cop. She doesn???t call anyone else, either; perhaps she doesn???t have any friends, or a phone. She doesn???t even have a deadbolt on her front door, for heaven???s sake. All she has is the gun. That, apparently, is a perfectly good substitute for rational thinking, according to Glock. Who needs a sound mind and a range of options when you have 16 bullets?And who needs love, either? Or empathy, or tolerance? Those are all things that will get you killed, because according to the gun lobby there are a lot of bad guys out there. The bad guy is a staple of firearms marketing ??? indeed, the entire ad campaign of any non-hunting or -sporting gun evaporates unless you assume his existence and proximity.Compared to the stalker in the Glock ad, this promotional video from Smith & Wesson (manufacturer of the semiautomatic rifle used in the Aurora, Colorado theatre shooting, gives us very little information about the people who are presumably about to be shot down. We see camouflage-clad men pointing rifles in a swamp. We see police officers pointing their guns across the hood of their car. We see a husband pull a gun from a nightstand while his wife cowers in the bed. We don???t know who is about to die, but the assumption is that they deserve it. If you don???t accept that premise, most gun ads are simply footage of people preparing to commit murder.By encouraging the belief that there are many circumstances under which it???s acceptable for the average person to point a loaded weapon at a living human being, gun makers and seller are preaching the opposite of love: they???re teaching unreasoning hatred. The premise of ads like Glock???s and Smith & Wesson???s is that guns are necessary tools because there are people out there who aren???t merely bad, but who deserve summary execution. Lots of them, and we are all at risk of encountering them in our daily lives.It takes a special breed of salesman to traffic in that kind of ethical brainwashing ??? people like NRA Vice President Wayne LaPierre, who makes $985,000 per year to say things like ???Riots. Terrorists. Gangs. Lone criminals. These are perils we are sure to face ??? not just maybe,??? and ???there is no greater freedom than the right to survive and protect our families with all the rifles, shotguns, and handguns we want.??? LaPierre personifies the American firearms trade: white, male, insulated from risk by his status and wealth, he is also increasingly angry, paranoid, and irrational ??? in public, in the course of doing his job, as an official mouthpiece of the industry. Sometimes I wonder what happened to LaPierre, what trauma he suffered to make him so angry that he feels justified using the deaths of twenty kindergartners to advocate for more gun sales. Then I recall the research showing that the mere presence of guns make us more aggressive, more paranoid. And I think LaPierre may simply be a victim of his own salesmanship.He is no exception; LaPierre???s mindset is the norm among gun promoters. Of all the businesses that make up Fear, Inc. ??? all the companies touting goods and services to quell our fears ??? the firearms industry is the only one that seems to believe its own bullshit. It has created a myth of ceaseless, directionless terror, and swallowed it whole. The gun lobby is afraid of facts, laws, moms, and fast-food outlets. It has, quite publicly and deliberately, as a matter of policy, rejected compassion and reason.This sociopathic approach to marketing earns gun and ammunition manufacturers $16 billion a year. What has it gotten the rest of us? American taxpayers pony up $12.8 million every day to cover damage done by gun violence ??? medical and legal costs, prison funding, mental health care, and more. Guns kill about 30,000 of us each year and send another 80,000 or so to the emergency room. Since 1968, firearms have killed more Americans than all the wars in our nation???s history.We???re not buying their guns or their arguments, yet somehow, we???re still paying.1.

I gotta say ??? first impression? I like it. Clean, well-organized ??? and just look at all of these Latin roots!

But there was absolutely nothing proper about her, if you know what I???m saying. Let me put it this way, pal??? Shari wasn???t an ???Add To Dictionary??? kinda girl.

I checked out the X-Y-Z district; you used to hear all kinds of stories about that place, back when it was all just umlauts and transitives walking around. Now that seemed like the kind of place where a guy could really get his sentence deconstructed. But I took a walk over there this morning, and I gotta tell you buddy ??? that neighborhood has changed.

Maybe me getting added up here is a sign that it???s finally time for me to slow down a little bit. I???ve already lived a life that most parts of speech could only dream of. Not to tell tales out of school, pal ??? but let???s just say that I???ve had my direct object inside of so many predicates that I???m lucky to be alive. But at some point you just start to wonder if there???s something more out there, you know? Maybe it???s time for me to settle down, find a nice synonym, form a compound word?????? Oh shit ??? Shari, is that you!? Whose clause did you modify to get up here, huh!? Hey Sept, nice meeting you pal, but I gotta run.

231,"ooting, Taryn had been hanging out with a college friend she hadn???t seen in years. The friend was visiting from Colorado, and the two women spent an earlier chunk of the afternoon together, strolling through a lovely collection of Seattle activities. ???We went to the Pike Place Market, watched the fish get thrown around, smelled the fresh flowers for sale, ate good food, took pictures of each other on the piers, bought snickerdoodles from a favorite bakery. Just your typical tourist stuff.??? Taryn told me over the phone. She???s meticulously polite and has a soft pretty voice. I haven???t met Taryn in person, but as I imagine her, she???s lounging in a bedroom strewn with dainty, interesting items: black ribbons, picture-locket necklaces, fluffy cats. She went on. ???My friend was leaving the next day, and we were determined to have as much fun as we could. I???d always heard nice things about the Twilight Exit, and that night they had karaoke. I was probably gonna sing Stevie Nicks???s ???Landslide.??? When I got there, I recognized the bouncer Greg. I???d met him when I went out with a small group of women the night before. One of us was wearing a tiara in her driver???s license photo, so when he checked our IDs, he recognized us. He made a joke, like, ???You girls are really getting around!??? and we???d all laughed,??? she said.After Taryn and her visiting friend arrived at the bar, she spotted her other buddies including Taryn???s coworker Laura, and joined them at a large table in the dining area. ???Somebody told me they???d ordered a burger that comes with a pat of cream cheese. It sounded delicious. It was late, and I hadn???t eaten, and I was learning about this burger I wanted to try. Then I heard a loud pop. The music stopped, and a girl ran into the bar. Shortly after, a man with a gun stepped in. I didn???t know the full extent of what was going on, or that he was targeting someone specific. I had absolutely nothing to draw from. I went from, ???What about this cheeseburger???? to, ???Why are shots being fired??????? she said.???Things became really tight and slowed down. I wish I could remember more details. All my attention was definitely on the gun. I fell to the floor without even thinking. I wanted to find my phone, but none of my belongings were around me,??? she said. As James walked past the dining area and into the lounge, ???I watched his every move. I don???t remember blinking. I tried to be as still as possible. Someone threw a table down behind me, and that jerked my thought process. I thought maybe I should slam mine down too, and then I did. I remember I was scared to do it because I didn???t want to bring attention to myself,??? she said.???There???s some hype around a moment like that,??? said Taryn, looking back. ???People wonder what they???d do in the face of danger. Maybe their life would flash before their eyes, and they???d think about all the people they love. But I wasn???t like, ???Gosh, if I get shot I won???t get to see my family again.??? Not to say they don???t hold importance. But I was very surprised at my own reaction. That moment wasn???t about survival and reminiscence for me. It was about human connection. Immediately, I had this overwhelming sense of empathy. I realized, like, ???This isn???t just fricking you.??? I grew up in the ???90s when school shootings were super common. I thought of the people and the lives behind every article, and what I was experiencing was dark and terrifying. I thought, ???So this is what it feels like.??????While Taryn was crouched on the floor, ???all of a sudden, I realized the bar behind me was completely empty. It made me feel really alone and really deserted. I felt so sad that I was left behind, and that I was left behind by my friends,??? she said. ???But it???s not like I still have unsettled feelings or need an apology. I don???t fault my friends for doing what they needed to do to survive in that instant. It was such a hard situation for everyone,??? she added, before getting back to the dining room. As Taryn was hesitating from behind her table, ???I felt a tap on my shoulder. There was this stranger. I don???t remember what they looked like, and I don???t remember if it was a man???s or a woman???s voice, but they said to me very clearly, ???We are going out through the back.??? Excuse me for getting emotional. I am so glad that person existed in that moment in my world. I credit my life and my safety to them, and I am very, very grateful,??? she said.Taryn stayed low as she made her way to the exit door. ???I heard gunshots in the bar behind me. I was wearing a dress and tights that night. I remember I was crawling over so much stuff, and my tights slipped down. They were all the way around my ankles when I got outside,??? she said. Taryn found her visiting friend in front of the building, and the women ran to Laura???s apartment, which was nearby. ???I slept on the floor and let my friend take the couch. We woke up super early the next day. She was level-headed about the whole thing. we carried the weight of that experience quite differently. I have a guilty conscience, and I often feel like I should take responsibility for things. I was very sorry I???d brought her to the bar and all this had happened. She was supposed to be having a fun little weekend trip. It was hard for me to process so much at once. I might???ve still been in shock. I pretty much just went home and stayed there until she had to leave for the airport.???The following days brought Taryn challenges. ???I found I was too scared to do anything. I felt like an abandoned dog cowering in the night. I took every opportunity to not be alone. If no one was available, I???d seclude myself in my room. I was uncomfortable doing basic stuff, like shopping at a grocery store. I used to really love walking to work, but that changed too,??? she said. ???Whenever I did go out in public, I???d become hyper-aware of doorways and exit paths. I???d dissociate to the point where I wouldn???t even remember being somewhere. If I heard loud noises like a pop or a clap or anything immediately resembling a gunshot, my adrenaline would go up.???Taryn didn???t share her story with a lot of people, for different reasons. ???It wasn???t considered a significant shooting, compared to the broader world. It made it into only a few papers. I think that minimized my experience. Maybe that???s why I was so private about it,??? she said. ???At the time, I was renting a basement bedroom with a back entrance. I was living in a house with a group of roommates, but I knew them only nominally. I???d found them on craigslist. So even though they were there, they weren???t really there. We were living our separate lives under one roof,??? said Taryn. It also seemed inappropriate to call on her parents. ???They lived three hours away, and my sister had recently moved back in with them because she has a daughter with cerebral palsy, and she needed their help. I know my parents love me and support me and they worry about me. But I didn???t feel like they could grasp what I went through, and I felt kind of selfish asking them to take attention from the more immediate pressures in their daily lives,??? she said.???I think part of my personality factored in, too. I???ve been put in positions where I had to be strong on my own. I personally am a child of trauma, and when things happened, I taught myself to deal with them alone. It gave me a sense of control. I felt like that was the only thing I really had, that I was able to handle my shit. That carried over into adulthood. I wouldn???t say it???s a pride thing, but it???s like, ???Oh, I don???t",100
232," know if I want to bother people with this,?????? she said. ???The trauma I experienced as a kid was different, though. I was groomed into it. There was a buildup. It???s natural for the brain to want to make connections. The shooting felt more catastrophic because it happened without warning,??? she said. Even still, ???I don???t always feel like I have the right to let it impact me the way it does. It feels really indulgent to me, in a way. Like, who am I to complain? I walked away with my life. I walked away without being shot,??? she said. Throughout our interview, Taryn would return to the latter sentiment. She seemed unable to fully believe it but also unable to let it go.A friend urged Taryn to see a counselor, and she got in right away. ???I???m not a stranger to that scene. Body wellness means taking care of the mind. While I wouldn???t say I was suicidal, my life had certainly lost all its light,??? she said. ???I began meeting with a talk therapist who validated my feelings. For whatever reason, I didn???t have the skills to validate them myself. I also met with a psychiatrist and was diagnosed with PTSD. I was treated with a very low dose of Prozac. It was just 10 mg, not even a therapeutic dose. It helped give me the lift I needed so I wouldn???t feel so down all the time.???Taryn eventually left Seattle and relocated to Phoenix to be closer to a beloved aunt. Today, she works at a play center in a movie theater. ???Parents drop off their children and we watch them and feed them water and popcorn until the parents??? movie is over. It???s fun and it???s less stressful, but it???s not as rewarding as the work I was doing prior,??? she said. At the time of the shooting, Taryn had been a behavioral specialist at an inpatient facility for troubled children. ???I gave myself permission to leave that job and take a sabbatical of sorts. There are layers and layers of intense things going on inside me, and the shooting drew attention to the fact I have stuff I need to deal with,??? she said.I asked Taryn whether she holds any anger for James. ???What he did was such an act of passion. He must???ve been sure this whole thing was just about him and his girlfriend, but it affected the lives of everyone in that room. And that really sucks. Of course I???m mad,??? Taryn said. ???I think, like, how could that have been worth it? He died in the end. How could that have been worth it???? she said.???I hate to credit that one night as the night that changed everything. But it did. It profoundly impacted me. I kind of unraveled a little bit. It made the world seem a lot scarier than it was the day before,??? she said. Before the shooting, ???I tended to move places without knowing a soul, and I???d move without a car. That???s how I ended up in Seattle,??? she said. ???I was totally someone who???d make friends at coffee shops or attach myself to people I found interesting. I???d let life happen, I???d let meet-cutes happen, I???d watch friendships flourish. I was comfortable being alone, being up late at night. I often faced what other people perceive as scary situations. I loved living my crazy beautiful colorful life, and now I???m trying to find ways to calm that down. In a way, it???s like I???m protecting myself. It???s been hard adjusting to my suburban life, and I don???t always feel like I fit in. But I just need some time to breathe,??? she said.???This Man Stops By Woods On a Snowy Eve??? You Won???t BELIEVE What Happens Next!???by Robert Frost???I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud ???

Here???s 10 Reasons Why You???re Dead Wrong??? by Dylan ThomasI believe this year???s election is the most important of our lifetime. The next President of the United States will be making decisions that will chart our nation???s course for the next century. We need a strong, principled leader who is ready to shake up Washington. That???s why I???ll be voting for The Demonic Creature That Emerged From the Depths of Hell.I???m just as surprised as you are. A few months back when the ground in front of the White House split open, flames shot out and from that emerged a giant, winged demon creature vowing to win the presidential election and bring about ???an age of darkness and suffering that will cover the land for all of eternity,??? I was just as skeptical as everyone else. Who was this guy with zero political experience who thought he could just waltz through a giant chasm of fire and run for president? None of the pundits took him seriously, but here we are just a couple of months later and he???s polling over 45% nationally. The truth is, the more I listen to the demon creature talk, the more his words resonate with me.Now I imagine you???re making the same face that all liberals make when someone tells you they???re voting for The Demonic Creature That Emerged From the Depths of Hell. That dismissive, ???Are you for real???? smirk.  Yes, I am for real and there are millions of Americans just like me.  We like that the guy isn???t a politician! Thanks to his ability to retreat into the Earth???s core and emerge with large amounts of gold he???s able to self-fund his campaign. He???s not beholden to wealthy donors or special interest groups. He speaks his mind! Like when he says, ???The Earth will be scorched and the rivers shall run with blood!???  That might sound extreme, but after decades of seeing jobs being shipped overseas to places like, China, Mexico and the Philippines there are plenty of Americans who are angry and frustrated. We???re ready to watch the Earth burn if it means he can actually get something done.Some say The Demonic Creature That Emerged From the Depths of Hell comes off as aggressive, rude, and bullying. He especially came under scrutiny during the second debate when, in response to the female moderator pressing him for details on a tax plan, he ate her alive. Hey guess what? That???s politics. Those debates get pretty rough and I like that my candidate stood up for himself and didn???t get pushed around. His opponents are now trying to use that moment to paint him as some sort of misogynist. As if consuming her flesh had more to do with her being a woman than it did the mainst",100
233,"ream media???s unfair coverage of his campaign. And yes, I have heard the other things he???s said about women. I???m aware that he commonly refers to them as, ???flesh vessels for my evil spawn.??? What can I say? The guy isn???t politically correct. No doubt about it, The Demonic Creature That Emerged From the Depths of Hell is going to ruffle some feathers.Look, I???m willing to admit that he doesn???t appear ???presidential.??? You???re probably wondering how a guy who is on record as saying, ???The nations of the world will bow to me as master and I will feast on their hearts??? will be able to deal with other world leaders. You got me. He???s not polished.  He???s in the middle of a tough election right now but I???ve gotta believe that once in office, The Demonic Creature That Emerged From the Depths of Hell will begin to behave in a more presidential manner.  However, if he does get a bit riled up every now and then can you blame him? Just look at some of the things that his opponents and the media have been saying lately:???He???s clearly evil. I mean, he says that he???s evil. Those are actually his own words.??????He shouldn???t be allowed to run. He???s not an American. He???s not even a human.??????He???s eaten multiple people on live television.???When you consider that he???s been fighting against that level of slander, I think it???s understandable if he gets a little hot under the collar and vomits blood onto a reporter once in awhile.  Listen: I know a lot of you think I???m stupid. How could anyone possibly want our next president to be The Demonic Creature That Emerged From the Depths of Hell? Well, the wonderful thing about America is that no matter how stupid you think I am, my vote counts just as much as yours.""1.

Officially, Diana???s death was deemed an accident, or at most, an unlawful killing caused by Henri Paul???s drunkenness and the bothersome paparazzi following their car.However, conspiracy theorists officially don???t believe the officials. They contend Diana was murdered, and that the car crash was arranged to appear like an accident, and that they???re right and always have been right so just take their words for it.Examining the claims of conspiracy theorists, debunkers, and myself, I???ll attempt to enter that tunnel in Paris and bring out the truth for my readers. Plus, I???ll snag a baguette that you can share.NOTE: If you hadn???t heard about Princess Diana???s death, I???m sorry I had to break the news to you, but it happened like 20 years ago, so where the hell have you been? Unless you???ve been in a coma, you have no excuse. If you have been in a coma, wow, that must???ve been something. I???ll make sure you get the biggest bite of the baguette.- -Conspiracy Claim: Diana was pregnant with Dodi Fayed???s child and would soon be engaged to him, a prominent Egyptian Muslim. The British Royal Family would not tolerate a non-Christian in their ranks and thus arranged the car crash.Debunking Claim: Analysis of Diana???s body showed no evidence of her being pregnant. Furthermore, there???s no proof that the couple???s relationship was disapproved by any members of the Royal Family.Rebunking Claim: The Universe is in a constant state of balancing good and bad. So when Diana, a woman born into British nobil",100
234,"ity who still somehow married up by becoming a Princess, became romantically entangled with Dodi Fayed, a son of a billionaire who dated so many models that Leonardo DiCaprio would say ???Whoa, I didn???t know there were that many models,??? the Universe had to step in. Things were going too well for Diana and Dodi, so the Universe tried to balance it out on that fateful night with the car accident. However, the Universe had never been in a car accident (mainly because it can???t fit in a car and, if it could, it would be a good driver), and didn???t realize the severity of the crash would kill the passengers. With blood on its infinitely large hands, the Universe covered up the ???accident??? and bred confusion by creating so many Diana conspiracy theories that Leonardo DiCaprio would say, ???Whoa, I didn???t know there were that many conspiracy theories. Now tell me more about those models??????- -Conspiracy Claim: The driver of the car, Henri Paul, was in the pay of a malevolent national security service, most likely French, and caused Diana???s death at their bidding.Debunking Claim: Paul had extremely limited unpaid contact with French Security Services due to his job as head of security at the Ritz, but there exists no evidence he was an agent or hired by any government.Rebunking Claim: Henri Paul was in the pay of a malevolent organization, but it wasn???t a government organization. It was the one group that stood to gain the most from Diana???s death: Ty Beanie Babies. By late 1997, the Beanie Baby fad was all but at an end and seemed to be disappearing the way of other fads such as the pet rock, the digital pet, and the digital rock. Yet, in October of 1997, Princess the Bear, a Beanie Baby dedicated to Diana, was announced and sales of the bear brought Ty back to the forefront of collectible fabric animal-shaped bags of beans. Anyone that says it???s absurd that a toy company would arrange to have the Princess of Wales killed to boost their sales and keep them relevant needs to open their eyes and get ready for what happens when hoverboard sales start tanking.- -Conspiracy Claim: Richard Tomlinson, a former MI6 officer, swore under inquiry in May of 1999 that Britain???s secret intelligence service was involved in Diana???s death.Debunking Claim: Investigation proved that the reports Tomlinson believed linked MI6 to the car crash were vastly different than he claimed. Furthermore, in later testimony, Tomlinson admitted he may have misremembered certain facts.Rebunking Claim: Tomlinson was correct about MI6???s involvement in Diana???s crash, but he misremembered, or was forced to misremember, the original intended target: Peach, the Princess of the Mushroom Kingdom from Super Mario Brothers. Believing they had handled all realistic threats, British secret intelligence focused on fictional threats. Peach???s Mushroom Kingdom was quickly becoming a superpower, building up an arsenal of green pipes, Italian mercenary plumbers, and enough gold coins to purchase a weapon of mass destruction from either Bowser or Wario. Peach had to be dethroned and replaced with a puppet ruler (most likely Yoshi). When MI6 learned the princess would be vulnerable in Paris, they arranged the car crash without first making sure it was the correct princess, or whether it was possible for a video game character to cross into our realm and be killed, or if what they were doing was just pure insanity fueled by the agency???s recent purchase of a Nintendo 64. After attempts to reset reality and bring Diana back to life proved futile, MI6 decided it was best to just move on and buy a PlayStation 2.- -Conspiracy Claim: The first call to emergency services after the crash was logged at 12:26 A.M., yet the ambulance carrying Diana didn???t arrive at the hospital until 2:06 A.M. The ambulance was deliberately slowed or something malicious happened during that hour and forty minutes to make sure the Princess didn???t survive.Debunking Claim: Diana, Henri Paul and Dodi Fayed weren???t taken to the nearest hospital because it was not equipped to handle multiple trauma patients, and from when the ambulance arrived at the scene of the crash, the trip was a much more reasonable 26 minutes.Rebunking Claim: As proven by the crash, Diana had bad luck with automobiles. Hence, her ambulance ride was lengthened due to several unlucky fender benders, a slew of flat tires, multiple unsuccessful carjackings, an unfortunate ambulance manufacturer???s recall due to the sirens shooting fire, multiple successful carjackings, and an ill-advised detour passing through the top of the Eiffel Tower.- -Conspiracy Claim: The analysis of the Diana???s wrecked car revealed that it was struck by a White Fiat Uno before the crash. With an exact knowledge of its color and model, it???s far too suspicious that this car has never been located and the driver never forced to testify.Debunking Claim: French police ruled out over 4,000 White Fiat Unos from their inquiry, but were never able to establish the exact car. Regardless, the cause of the accident was a drunken Henri Paul driving at excessive speeds.Rebunking Claim: Ty wasn???t positive Henri Paul would go through with the plan and save their Beanie Babies??? sales numbers, so they used someone to drive a White Fiat Uno and insure the crash. But who did they use? Well, it???d only make sense to use another person who would benefit from Diana???s demise and thus have a reason keep it all a secret. And who benefited more than Elton ???Sure, I???ll play at Diana???s funeral for a huge fee and a way to revive sales of a song from 1973??? John? Nobody, that???s who. If you look at the facts, you???ll see this claim is just like a candle in the wind: not very useful, but a thing nonetheless.GoT vs MFA: How to kill your darlings to maximum effectBAE vs MFA: What happens when you get into your dream program but your significant other refuses to move to TuscaloosaTMI vs MFA: On whether a graduate degree actually helps you write sex scenesPMS vs MFA: A misandrist???s take on the cis-hetero misogyny of the poetry workshopLOL vs MFA: Why most literary fiction is so devoid of joyATM vs. MFA: How to live on $11,000 a year (see next pitch)KFC vs MFA: A performance poet experiments with only eating fast food for a semesterLAX vs MFA: 10 tips on surviving AWP 2016 in Los AngelesDUI vs MFA: Who drinks more, poets or fiction writers?

Can you guys list the programs where I could become acquainted with works by white men while also being surrounded by them (faculty, students, anything, lol)? GO!!Peace,Zehra- -Hey all!Some of the programs that I???m looking into will require me to TA and write teaching statements for my apps. I???ll be teaching mostly white kids and want to make sure I make them feel included. Do you have any special advice on how to make the stories and poems we read relevant to them? IDEAS PLEASE!!!Peace,Zehra- -Hey all!DONE WITH APPS!! Whew. Finally have some time to do reading on my own and was thinking about trying out some poetry by straight, white, heteronormative men!! Do you know of any? RECS??Peace,Zehra- -Hey all!Love you guys!! Your suggestions for poetry by white people were awesome! Am also thinking about reading fiction by straight, white, heteronormative men (will also settle for white women suggestions, ha-ha). RECS???Peace,Zehra- -Hey all!OMG!!!!

Think I might just flip a coin instead :(Peace,ZehraEDIT: Feel my initial post was too negative and realize I should show more gratitude about even being considered as an aspiring writer by these MFA programs.

Was thinking maybe we could play a fun game in which we list in the comments how works by women are inferior to works by men. Double points if it???s a woman of color, triple if she???s gay/genderqueer. GO!!!Peace,Zehra- -Hey all!I???ve been reflecting since yesterday about how my last two posts were totally out of line. I didn???t even realize until you all pointed out in your comments how I, as a brown woman, have been forcing the ideas of a brown writer (I thought Naipul would pass, but I was clearly in the wrong) down your throats instead of finding a superior, white version of him who you???d be better able to relate to. I also didn???t realize how incredibly presumptuous it was for me to assume you all would have to read works by women to be able to make fun of them in the first place. It was incredibly insensitive of me. I???m been trying to be so aware about these things and I feel I???ve not only let you guys down, but have also let myself down.Peace (& apologies),Zehra- -Hey all!Anyone here heard of Jonathan Franzen? I???ve heard he does a great job capturing the male, white experience???Peace,Zehra- -Hey all!Know this isn???t the place for political messages, but just want to say #AllLivesMatter.Peace (& Solidarity),Zehra- -Hey all!This question is specifically for the white people in the group. I???ll be starting classes in a few weeks and was wondering what I can do to make people like you feel more welcomed in the program. I???ve also been thinking about how my characters are mostly brown women (I have a couple of brown men as minor characters, but I know it???s not enough to capture the breadth of the male experience) and how that may alienate you all. How can I make my writing more inclusive? Should I have more white, male characters?  My worry is that may come across as Occidentalist :(Peace,Zehra- -Hey all!Ugh. I just got done with MFA orientation. Over email they were really selling me on diversity, but when I got there it wasn???t ACTUAL diversity. I don???t want to be in a place where non-white people threaten white people and make them feel conscious about their white privilege. THAT???S NOT OK! Now more so than ever, it???s SO important for MFA programs to offer safe spaces for white people (especially white men!) where they can work on their craft without worrying about political correctness and all that stuff. SMH. White people, I want you to know that you have allies like me who you can reach out to. PM me if you want to talk about the pressures of conforming to multiculturalism, transnationalism, and feminism.

It???ll have to wait. Detectives are still recovering from her HBO special.

But would you deign to meet with him somewhere off the grounds of the U.S. Capitol? Say, at a Starbucks?BARTLEBY: I would prefer not to.REPORTER: What if you were at the Starbucks and Garland just happened to walk in? Would you say hello?BARTLEBY: I would prefer not to.REPORTER: Suppose he initiated contact. ???Hello, Senator Bartleby. Nice day for a latte,??? something like that. Would you so much as look him in the eye?BARTLEBY: I would prefer not to.REPORTER: Okay. Let???s say you???re having a heart attack in a corridor somewhere in the bowels of the U.S. Capitol and Judge Garland happens to be the only other person in sight. He seems like a guy who would know CPR. Under those circumstances, would you meet with him?BARTLEBY: I would prefer not to.REPORTER: Well, you would probably also prefer not to be having a heart attack. Yet here you are, crumpled on the cold, hard floor, gasping, clutching your chest, preparing to meet your maker, who may well be displeased with you. Along comes Garland. Your vision???s gone blurry ??? you???re not even 100% certain of the identity of this man who hurries toward you exuding sound judgment, who bends over you with assurance in his manner, who, using the latest methods approved by middle-of-the-road cardiologists, begins trying to knock some sense into your heart. Now do you meet with him?BARTLE",100
237,"BY: I would prefer not to.REPORTER: Think of it! There is no one else around, no witnesses. A despondent Garland has gone for a walk, the better to brood about how near he is to realizing his lifelong dream of being a Supreme Court justice ??? so near yet so far ??? and here on the floor in front of him, apparently dying of a heart attack, is the very man who, as Senate majority leader, stands most squarely in his path. Or, well, lies down in it, twitching. A lesser nominee might scan the corridor for security cameras and, seeing none, back away slowly. But Garland? He???s a decent sort, a believer in mainstream American values like life. He rushes to your side. Let us say that he approaches from the left flank. Without preamble, without any citation of the relevant precedents, he administers CPR. Just like that, your heart remembers how to do its job. Will you, once you???ve caught your breath, remember how to do yours?BARTLEBY: I would prefer not to.REPORTER: Another scenario. In this one, Garland???s daughter is marrying your nephew. The invitation comes in the mail, together with a special plea from the groom: he wants you to give a toast. He has even suggested a theme: ???Unlike politics, love brings people together.??? Your wife prevails upon you to honor your nephew???s request. So there you are at the wedding. Obviously Judge Garland is there too. He escorts his daughter down the aisle. You watch in grudging admiration. Garland wears his emotions so gracefully, an art you???ve never mastered. His eyes shine with the tears one might expect of a bleeding-heart liberal ??? and yet, like any good conservative, he also appears to be doing the hard but necessary work of suppressing his feelings: the tears in his eyes stay there; they do not wet his cheeks. After transferring control of his daughter from himself to your nephew, thus helping to preserve the patriarchy, Garland turns and exchanges friendly glances with wedding guests on both sides of the aisle. He is well respected by both families, you can see that. Fast-forward to your toast. You have been unable to prepare any remarks. Love is a theme about which you have little to say. The master of ceremonies hands you a microphone. Your skin goes hot and prickly. You feel an overwhelming urge to engage in some sort of parliamentary maneuver. Maybe you could tack on an amendment that would kill the need for you to give this toast. But no, you can???t do that. There is no bill under consideration. This is a wedding, the wedding of your nephew and the daughter of Merrick Garland, who is ??? you must remember not to say this into the microphone ??? about as qualified a candidate for the Supreme Court as a Senate majority leader could possibly wish for. The silence in the banquet hall swells until it is like a symphony. You seek out your wife???s eyes, her beautiful mysterious eyes, the ones you???re still in love with after all these years. But her eyes are fixed upon a spot on the floor ??? and the floor is yours, Senator Bartleby. What kind of orator takes the floor and doesn???t speak? What would your constituents think of you? And that is when the idea arrives. It appears fully formed, a shining orb in a darkened world. You will announce, right then and there, that you are dropping your opposition to Judge Garland???s nomination. Immediately after the reception, you???re going to step outside and call your Republican colleagues and tell them to meet with Garland, to shake his hand, even to exchange words with him, almost as though he were a fellow human being who deserved some basic level of respect. You can do this ??? and why shouldn???t you? Your announcement will bring the room to its feet. Your nephew will be so happy. ???Unlike politics,??? you will say, ???love brings people together.??? It sounds like something Bill Clinton would say, which gives you the willies, but the difference is, you???re not just going to say it; you???re going to do something about it. Because you???re a man of action, not a man of inaction, as has often been alleged in the press. ???BARTLEBY TAKES ACTION??? will be tomorrow???s headline. The subhead will read, ???PARTY OF NO BECOMES PARTY OF SURE, WHY NOT.??? It???ll be the start of a jubilee year in America. Because unlike politics, love brings people together, and that is what this country needs right now. A bit more togetherness. And you are the man for the moment. That???s why you went into public service all those years ago, to be the man for some future moment. Senator Bartleby, that moment is now. What do you say, sir? Is this something you can do? Theoretically?BARTLEBY: ???REPORTER: Senator, are you crying?BARTLEBY: ???- -This is the key to the Star???s dressing room from a Boston nightclub called Blinstrub???s, which burned to the ground in February of 1968.My dad???s band was one night into a multi-night engagement when the club burned down. It happened after hours, so the place was empty and no one was hurt, but all of my dad???s band???s equipment and stage clothes were destroyed. (Jimmy Durante was scheduled to be the next act in the club, and his gear had arrived ahead of him and was also destroyed.) My dad and his fellow band members had been given the keys to the dressing room, however, which they kept.The keys were later made into cufflinks, which the band members wore for a long time after. Eventually the soldered-on cufflink post from this key broke off. I came across it in a drawer about 30 years ago and threw it on my key ring. I???ve had it ever since.- -Submit your key ring chronicle here.My friends, do you toss and turn all night, or wake up in the morning with aches and pains? These are the signs that you need a new bed. I am Don Corleone, founder of Mattress Godfather, the capo di tutti capi of the Five Families of Mattress Retailers. At Mattress Godfather, you always get the best deals in the Tri-State area, but this weekend will be extra special. The Corleone Family is going to the mattresses against the competition: Barzini???s Sleepworld, Bernie & Phyl Tattaglia???s, Carmine Cuneo???s La Cozy Nostra, Victor Stracci???s Rest in Peace ??? they all have it coming, and you the customer will pocket the savings! There hasn???t been a price war this brutal since Joey ???The Sandman??? Gambini put Vinnie ???The Big Sleep??? Ciccarello out of business in the Columbus Day Sale of 1952.Serta, Sealy, Simmons Beautyrest, and so forth, Mattress Godfather has the top brands at deals so low you???ll think you pulled one over on the Mob, which, of course, does not exist. You want a fancy Tempur-Pedic, like some pezzonovante? We???re expecting a shipment of Tempur-Pedics any minute. What???s that, Tom? My consigliere tells me that we just got an unexpected truckload of beautiful top-of-the-line Sleep Number adjustable beds, much better for your back than Tempur-Pedic, and we???re selling them at rock bottom prices.How did it come to this? Why has the Mattress Godfather sworn vengeance on the other Mattress Families, as well as their associates from as far away as California and Kansas City? Let me tell you a story about an orphan who came to this country from Sicily, who believed in the American ??? Fredo, do you see I???m doing a commercial? Where did those waterbeds come from? Well you can send ???em back to Moe Green! I don???t care how they do it in Vegas, a real man bangs his gooma on dry land!Where was I?  Ah, yes. There was once a time when the Five Mattress Families were allies. We took an oath to preserve our mattress thing, so that it might live on for our customers and their children and children???s children. But then somebody went an??? massacred m",100
238,"y boy at the toll booth. Why, madonn???, why? Because the Mattress Godfather dares to offer a free bed frame, delivery and haul away of your old mattress at no extra charge! That???s right! Shop around and you???ll see that not one of the other Mattress Families will provide this service for free, not one. And for this, they turned my Santino into Swiss cheese.Don Barzini has the nerve to say that this tragedy that has befallen my family is my own fault, that I have all the bed frame suppliers and haulers in my pocket and refuse to share them with the other Mattress Families. When have I ever refused an accommodation, except for one time, one time, when I chose not to make my trucks available during the Bed Bug Epidemic of 2011? Because I believed then, as I do now, that bed bugs will destroy us. This isn???t like the innocent vices of the old days, the phony coil counts and the 200 percent markups. The mattress police looked the other way then, but this is different. Bed bugs they must enforce.My enemies sent Johnny Fontane, that Hollywood mamma???s boy, to beg me to come to a sit-down, as if I am the one who perpetrated the bad blood between the Families. ???Godfather, please don???t slash prices any lower, I???m afraid of a Mattress War!,??? Johnny cries to me like a little girl. But the Mattress Godfather is done with talk. I believe that my competitors are men of honor (and women, ???scuse Dona Phyl). I???m a forgiving man. But I???m also a superstitious man. And if some unlucky accident should befall my son??? I???m talking about Michael ??? Fredo they can do whatever they want with??? if Michael should suffocate under a pile of goose down, or be impaled on an improperly discarded bed frame, then I???m going to blame the heads of the other Mattress Families. And I solemnly remind them now what a difficult job it is to remove horse blood from a $13,000 silk/wool/Alpaca-blend, ultra-plush Kluft pillow-top. This is not a stain that can be Shouted out.But enough unpleasantness! This is a Mattress War for the ages! Don???t miss this once in a lifetime chance to make your bones on unbelievable deals like this: All Stearns and Foster queen-size Dreamland memory foam models are just $899, including free bed frame, delivery and haul away! Ask La Cozy Nostra to beat that price and see what happens. I guarantee you won???t leave their showroom with all your fingers. Come into any of our twelve la famiglia-friendly locations this weekend, choose a luxurious new bed and we???ll even pay the sales tax! Remember, that???s Mattress Godfather ??? ???Prices so low, they sleep with the fishes.???You???ve probably read some pretty nasty stuff about me in the papers recently, and I understand why you???re concerned. They???ve been saying some colorful things, and it???s natural that you???ve taken them at their word. But I want to assure you that, contrary to what the mainstream media might have claimed, I have not just jumped on you in a deserted underpass, thrust you up against a wall, and punched you several times flat in the face.The suits in New York have been out to get me from the start. I say it like I see it, and I???m not going to bend over backwards to be politically correct. That???s why they???ve taken against me ??? you do see that, don???t you?No, I have not just grabbed you savagely by the throat and demanded your wallet. Let me guess where you got that idea ??? CNN? NBC? You can???t believe everything Rachel Maddow tells you, OK?They???ve got no shame at all, these people. I believe in balanced budgets and the Constitution; I think that marriage is between a man and a woman, and that people who want to immigrate to this country should do it legally. And you know how that riles them in the newsrooms ??? how convenient that the media should embroil me, of all people, in some kind of scandal; how convenient that it should happen to be me that some leftist reporter supposedly saw kicking you to the floor and screaming murderous threats into your terrified face!Do you see what I???m getting at?I???m not saying it???s a conspiracy, exactly. Did they all have a meeting round a big round table where they plotted to smear me by telling the world that I am, even at this very moment, rifling through your pockets and tearing your watch off your wrist? Probably not.It???s more subtle than that ??? most of the people who work at these major news corporations just come from liberal backgrounds and have left-leaning views that casually inform them in their day-to-day work.That kind of confirmation bias accumulates over time ??? a little unchecked source here, an exaggeration there, a minor inaccuracy allowed to go unchallenged ??? until, bam! It???s playing 24/7 on the cable news networks that I???ve just ???pulled a knife on you.??? And, presented with that kind of coverage, I can see how a regular person like yourself might have got the wrong idea.You still there, buddy? Looked like you were passing out for a moment!So there you have it ??? I???m not saying it???s entirely a set-up, but ask yourself: Would this be happening to me, and would you be looking at me with the same kind of abject panic in your eyes, if I were, say, a Massachusetts Democrat, rather than a guy who just threatened to cut your balls off? It doesn???t seem likely.It???s the little double standards like that which can be so infuriating.I???ve taken up enough of your time ??? just promise you won???t go believing everything you see on TV! I know that some part of you probably still suspects that I???ve just plunged a knife deep into your guts and twisted it, but honestly, there are two sides to every story. As your twitching body sinks to the floor and you begin to lose consciousness, I want you to remember that there???s a lot more to this than they might have told you.Once the temperature wavers half a degree or so above the freezing point, I know that It is coming. Cue the dreaded question that tops my Hijabi FAQ list:Aren???t you hot in that?So when Blonde Sophia corners me after 6th period during a particularly hot spell last week, her query isn???t entirely unexpected. It???s practically the soundtrack of my summer life, after all.But what gets me every time ??? with Blonde Sophia, the stranger in the public restroom, and the countless others who???ll come forward between now and September ??? is the question???s incredible nuance. On the surface, it has nothing to do with religion, politics, or terrorism. The premise appears (almost) believable: people are genuinely invested in my physical comfort.Other bonuses: the question is clear and succinct. It is easily workable into any conversation. It can be phrased in a variety of distinct, creatively stimulating ways:???Oh my God, isn???t your clothing [READ: religion] suffocating you???????Are you really wearing like five layers [READ: of patriarchal oppression] right now???????You should take it off for a little while until it gets cooler ??? it???s totally okay!??? [READ: I know what???s best for you, both wardrobe-wise and life-wise, just like in Mean Girls. However, I am not familiar with the concept of irony.]Even the more classic version can be dressed up with a limitless array of offensive tonalities:???Aren???t you HOT in that?!??????Are you not hot in that??????????How are you not hot in that????The way I see it is this: It???s 93 degrees out. You and I both know that I am hot in that. What???s the real question here, Blonde Sophia?Look??? I???ve got nothing against your bare and generally flawless legs. Sometimes, I also want to come to school wearing a tiny floral sundress or a cute ???90s-style crop top. To feel the wind fully, rushing at ",100
239,"the backs of my calves and behind my ears.To be you: one of the long-haired, bare-legged beauties that the boys in our class live for, give their varsity jackets to, and kiss in the stairwells.So forgive me for being defensive, Sophia.It???s easy to say that wearing the headscarf is hard because of all of the doors I must witness closing in front of me. The doors that I cannot even name or imagine and doors that I can, like the American presidency. It???s easy to say that wearing the headscarf is hard because of your questions and your ignorance, because of Islamophobia and Society at large, not to mention The System Is Broken. (I???ve been listening to a lot of slam poetry lately.)But it is nearly impossible for me to admit to you that being a Muslim is hard physically. That this is a disadvantage I have brought upon myself, and continue to bring upon myself.So yes: I am hot in this.Likewise, it is strenuous to fast during Ramadan. We may frequent wildly different social stratas, Sophia, but we are still both human. (So before you ask me if I???m hungry in a couple of months, please remember that I cleared it right up for you in late-March.)And yes, as you might guess, Ramadan and summer occasionally collide for a truly memorable experience.Please remember that I am choosing to make these sacrifices. Sacrifices that look to you like sweat stains and forehead blotting and (another?) opportunity to question my fashion choices, or perhaps my general ability to respond to social cues.No: you won???t see me in a bikini. I won???t see me in a bikini either, if it makes you feel any better. (Admittedly, that???s got more to do with my body image issues than anything else; you can bet all your booty shorts that other hijabis strut around in their underwear at home if they want to.)But please remember that you won???t see the other things, either. My family and I, walking home together under the full moon after Ramadan night prayers. (The streets blue-black and empty, the night swollen with our faith; you are sleeping.) You won???t eat from our traditional iftar dinner feasts, or sit with our entire extended family as we stay up laughing and talking and hoping to sleep late into the hot tomorrow.You will probably use the phrase, ???the Mecca of?????? throughout your entire life, Sophia, without ever truly understanding it.You will never pray in one of the rings surrounding the ka???bah, with melodic Quranic verses washing over you. With your sides wedged tight in between the Muslim on your left and the Muslim on your right, both from different countries. With your feet splayed and bare and unguarded. Your heart suspended.You won???t smile the secret smile of hijabis passing each other on the street.You won???t stand in front of your mirror, wearing an ankle-length, ink-black jilbab with delicate black detailing, and feel ethereal. (If you did, you would probably look awesome, but it would also be cultural appropriation ??? a discussion for another day.)How am I supposed to convey all this and more, when you ask me if I???m hot in that, and when you???re really asking me why I wear the headscarf, and who I am really, and where I come from?Maybe one day we can have a conversation about all of this, but until then, I???ll continue to answer you:No.Welcome to Dead Plant HouseStay Out of the Bedside DrawerEat Cheese and Die Happy!The Curse of the Empty WombWerewolf Skin1Beware, the ???Good???

Considered to be the Charles Darwin of the plant world, Vavilov grew up in an era of chronic food shortages and famine as a result of mismanagement and neglect of collectivized farms, and dedicated his life to the study of food security through improvement of crop plants. Unlike Darwin, who focused on the study of biodiversity for its implications into evolution, Vavilov sought to find out how the genetic diversity of plants could be used to aid in improving plants cultivated for agriculture.Vavilov graduated from the Moscow Agricultural Institute in 1910, and spent his early career in Europe, studying alongside scientists who were embarking on the burgeoning field of genetics. At this point, genetics research was heavily focused on fruit flies due to their short generational time, and the clear distinction of inherited traits. Vavilov wanted to turn attention towards plants, namely those that were widely used in agriculture. After being appointed director of the prestigious Lenin All-Union Academy of Agricultural Sciences in 1929, Vavilov and his team embarked on a series of global travels over the next decade, where they collected seeds, tubers, and roots of cultivated and wild plants.  With these samples, he established the first global seedbank in Moscow to organize and catalog all the collected samples.Through the study of these wild species, he developed his theory of Centers of Origin, otherwise known as centers of diversity. This",100
240," theory states that there is a single geographical area where each crop first originated, and it is at these specific areas where we can find a rich diversity of wild relatives, termed ???landraces.??? His work identified seven such geographical locations as centers of origin for multiple crops 12:The way Vavilov saw it, landraces were evolved to withstand and perhaps even thrive in their surrounding environment. These adaptive traits had a genetic basis, and most importantly, landraces could be bred with related food crops. For example, a common food staple could be crossed with a wild relative collected from an arid environment, potentially yielding a crop that could tolerate drier climates. This was perfect for expanding the geographical range that a crop could be grown in the cooler, drier climates of the Russian steppes. With this theory and collected seeds in hand, he and his team embarked on several crop breeding projects with the goal of creating more adaptable, hardy, and secure crops.At about the same time, an agricultural scientist by the name of Trofim Lysenko had an idea to increase wheat yields by subjecting the seeds to cold, humid conditions for several weeks prior to planting. This method was successful, resulting in earlier flowering of the plants and a boost in yield come harvest. Lysenko???s ???discovery??? (which was in fact known as vernalization and had already been used in agriculture for perhaps the past two centuries2) gained him the attention and favor of Josef Stalin, who appointed him as the Director of the Institute of Genetics within the Russian Academy of Sciences. To Stalin, who sought to fill leadership roles with folks from proletariat backgrounds, Lysenko perfectly fit the narrative of a man coming from a peasant background, who found a fast solution to a problem through his innate cleverness and not on account of any fancy science training. This separated Lysenko from Vavilov, who came from a middle-class background, and was well-educated and well-connected throughout Europe at this point.Lysenko had a different view of biological sciences; despite being the head of the Institute of Genetics, he rejected genetic inheritance, Mendelian theories, and natural selection, instead embracing the theory of inheritance through acquired characteristics. Also known as Lamarkian theory, this hypothesized that traits were not inherited through genetic means, but instead through physical alterations passed from parent to offspring, based on environment only. For example, giraffes got their elongated necks through repeated reaching to high tree branches, and wheat only needed to go through vernalization periods once as the next season???s seeds will have learned to flower early from their parents.  Even more strangely, plants could ???learn??? to grow in harsh climates, and if wheat tried really, really hard, it could probably grow as rye if needed or vice versa. He denounced traditional genetics altogether, claiming the field was a bourgeois pseudoscience not compatible with Marxism, and that geneticists were ???fly lovers and people haters.???4Vavilov initially praised Lysenko due to his work with rapid improvement of crops through vernalization practices, but began to speak out against him by latter part of the 1930s as the situation was starting to get weird. This put government scrutiny on Vavilov, who at this point was deeply involved in his program of collection and characterization of wild landraces, and breeding into cultivated crops. The process of conventional plant breeding is measured by the decade, as it takes many years, lots of manpower, and tons of bookkeeping to cross parent plants, increase multiple generations, and characterize the many, many offspring.  It was getting more difficult to justify the often expensive travel to collect wild seeds, and the amount of time it took to yield a successful new cultivar from the breeding program was out of touch with Stalin???s demand for fast improvements.Out of favor with Stalin and the Russian Academy of Sciences, which was then fully under Lysenko???s control, Vavilov was stripped of his passport and exit visa in 1940, leaving him unable to travel outside of the USSR. It was shortly thereafter that he was arrested and charged with sabotaging Soviet agriculture (which had been in decline under Lysenko???s direction), taking part in right-wing conspiracies, and spying for Europe. Vavilov denied all charges, but it didn???t look great that he held prestigious positions in international science committees, had many friends in Europe, and spoke several languages. He received a death sentence in 1941, which was later commuted to 20 years in prison due to attention from the international science community.Twenty years is a long time to spend in a Soviet gulag, and Vavilov starved to death in 1943, less than two years later.Vavilov was not alone in his persecution; in fact thousands of Soviet scientists who were classified as studying bourgeois fields were purged, including other geneticists, statisticians, early computer scientists, sociologists, and linguists. The study of genetics was completely banned in the Soviet Union in 1948; any deviation from Lamarkian theory (now known as Lysenkoism) was grounds for arrest, if not execution. It wasn???t until after Stalin???s death that the Soviet government re-opened the Vavilov case, ultimately overturning his conviction and re-installing his reputation by the 1960s along with re-acceptance of scientific theory based on genetics. No longer under Stalin???s protection, Lysenko denied ever speaking out against Vavilov, only complaining that he may have been bullied early in his career on account of being from a working class background.5 Inquiry into Lysenko???s research showed sloppy, non-controlled experiments, severe omissions, and results so bizarre and hasty that they must have been falsified. Disgraced, Lysenko was removed from his post at the Russian Academy of Sciences in the early 1960???s, and died in relative obscurity in 1976.Today, Vavilov???s theories about the origins and diversity of plants is a mainstay in the field of plant breeding, and one of the foremost reasons why maintenance of biodiversity is so important to our survival as a species. These centers of diversity were not only places that served the evolution and diversification of crop plants, but also served the co-evolution of pollinators as well as pathogens within a similar timeframe. We are still discovering unique traits of landraces that enable them to withstand adverse environmental conditions and/or disease, and these traits can be transferred into crops meant for human consumption.  If a frightening new pathogen strain appears, our best bet is to look into seeds that might carry genetic resistance as breeding stock. Along the same lines, there is overwhelming evidence that the changing climate may result in more extreme weather patterns. We need to keep studying crops that can withstand adverse environmental conditions if we are going to maintain agricultural productivity into the next century and beyond.Vavilov???s establishment of a seedbank at what is now the N.I. Vavilov Institute of Plant Industry to store exotic and cultivated specimens was also a first; there are now about 1,600 seedbanks worldwide, holding about 6 million samples altogether with the numbers increasing everyday.6 Counting among these is the Svalbard Global Seed Vault in the Norwegian island of Spitsbergen, which is designed to withstand any natural or manmade disaster, from earthquakes to tsunamis to nuclear war.  The Millennium Seed Bank located near London is also built to withstand a ",100
241,"nuclear attack, and has room for over a billion accessions if it is possible to ever reach that number.6- - - 1 Vavilov, NI. 1940.

Jesus asks Romaine who he is and what he???s doing here.Romaine asks if this is the meeting for Creative.Jesus sayeth upon him no. That???s tomorrow.Romaine thanks Jesus and announces he???s going to a club called Wicker Baskets tonight. He exits the conference room.Jesus puts forward that he wants to sit in the middle of the table, and everyone should sit facing the same way.The motion fails 7-6. But then Andrew changes his vote because Jesus has an ominous look on his face. Everyone now sits facing the same way.Jesus begins by predicting that Peter will deny knowing him three times before rooster crows the next morning.Peter looks up from his BlackBerry and says, ???Sorry, what????Jesus passes out snacks and refreshments.Bartholomew hesitantly eats a lot.Jesus says that the snacks and refreshments are actually his body and blood.Judas asks how that is possible.Discussion follows.Andrew says it was a bad investment decision to kick the i-bankers out of the Temple. He displays a 3-D, multi-color PowerPoint histogram indicating that Jesus???s P/E ratio is distressingly low.Jesus stands by his course because his Miracle/Cost ratio is doing amazing.James the Less agrees with Jesus and says that Jesus???s entry into Jerusalem while riding a donkey and wearing a hoodie got him major cred with twenty-something startup CEOs.Jesus tells Judas he???s aware Judas has been posting on anti-Christian message boards under the handle ???BeleagueredBeliever69??? while he should have been working.Judas says it was actually during his lunch break. He was sent a link by a friend and didn???t know what it was until he clicked it. But now his computer won???t start.Matthew says if Judas betrays Jesus, he???s no longer invited to use the Apostles??? skybox at Gladiator Stadium.Judas asks for a vote; the motion passes, 10-2.

Guide to Winning Everything Imaginable. He offers everyone a relaxing foot bath.Matthew calmly announces that he likes Jesus because Jesus is nice to people even when they???re mean to each other; he asks Jesus if he wants to come to karaoke night on Saturday at Wicker Baskets. Jesus says he???ll think about it, but hopefully yes.James the Elder recalls the meeting to order and says that spreading the good news is all about the Three L???s: Learning, Leading, and famiLy.John gets confused about the third L; and what if people don???t have families?James the Elder appeals to his credentials: he used to be head of marketing at Antony & Cleopatra (before the asp-induced restructuring).Matthew says fine, but is there any way to operationalize the Three L???s, possibly by thinking outside the box?James the Elder says yes and passes out a Creativity Schematic with many, many arrows.Jesus concludes by telling his disciples that some might not take kindly to their ideas about love, forgiveness, and worship.Everyone says they???re strong and don???t mind.Jesus says they might be heckled. They might be laughed at. They might get flailed, their skin might peel off their body, and then they might be crucified upside down. They might even be called mean names.Everyone says they???re strong and don???t mind.Philip says wait, what was that third thing?Action Items:Someone has to betray Jesus, though it???s still somewhat up in the air at this point. TBD next meeting.Evangelize the masses.Save humanity.Next meeting, John is in charge of snacks. (Taquitos)Illustration by Kelly Bjork.- - -???When I was living in Seattle, I was working in books while trying to work on books. Then I left and crisscrossed the country. Today I???m in the Bay area. At this very minute, I???m sitting in the park pictured in the opening scenes of Full House,??? says Alan. We???re on the phone, so I visualize Alan as a blurry, lone figure, seated on a shadowy bench somewhere, surrounded by distant squirrels. We had to have been near one another the night of the shooting, but neither of us can remember. I ask how his feelings were affected in the long haul. ???I have some vivid memories, but I wouldn???t say I was shaken to the bone. I had a moment of fear during the recognition of extreme violence, but afterwards, I spent more time thinking about the events in terms of general issues, like gun violence, and gun rights, and mental-health resources, and gentrification. But maybe only because that was easier than actually addressing the way it affected me. The personal trauma has been harder to parse through,??? he said.???I???ve told my own story enough times to notice I always end up organizing my memories of that night around this relationship that???d gone awry,??? he said. ???The full year leading up had been a string of romantic tragedies. I???d moved to Seattle with a woman who was, like, The (Then) Love of My Life. But after we moved, it steadily became clear it wasn???t gonna work out, and we broke up. I was at the point where I was just starting to date again, and I was feeling excited to be out in the world and living my life.??????So I was at the Twilight that night on a date. A first date. ",100
242,"It was with a young woman I???d recently met. She lived nearby, and we???d agreed to meet and do karaoke that night. As I was waiting for her, I was thinking about what song I was gonna sing to sort of impress her. It was tough for me to decide, because I was transitioning out of an old karaoke standard I???d done for years, ???Stroking??? by Clarence Carter. Which isn???t exactly the song you sing on a first date. It doesn???t present well. I was flying with the idea of doing UB40???s cover of ???Can???t Help Falling in Love,??? but that one was also maybe questionable in its own way. So it might???ve been a good thing it didn???t happen,??? he said.???She, like, stood me up. She stood me up. In hindsight though, thank god, you know? I???d remember I???d been there long enough that it was just starting to sink in, that this person probably wasn???t gonna show.1 At the same time, I was trying to embrace it. I was like, ???Whatever. I like this place. I always have good nights here. I???ll do a song and have a couple beers then maybe go home.??? That was where I was when it started happening. I was settling into a beer, and everything started unfolding, and then it was all over,??? he said.When the first gunshot went off, ???I???d filled out the karaoke request slip, but I hadn???t turned it in yet. I was sitting by myself at that little bar area that pokes out into the dining room, and I was looking directly at the door. I was facing him as the door burst open and he walked in. The whole thing probably lasted 30 seconds, but it became the main image in my mind. It still hasn???t left. It???s the image of the door guy falling back into the hallway, and then I see the guy, like, stepping over him with the huge fucking gun in his hand,??? said Alan.Alan recognized the shooter. About twenty minutes earlier, the same man had been arguing with his girlfriend Whitney at the bar. ???It didn???t register immediately that he was coming back to kill his girlfriend. It was more like, ???This is the guy who was just here, and he was pissed. Now he???s got a gun, and it???s in the air, and he???s coming towards me.??? Those were pretty much my thoughts,??? said Alan.I have Alan back up and tell me what he remembers about this argument. Alan said Whitney had been seated nearby when James appeared and confronted her. ???I had my back to them most of the time. I looked back initially to make sure he wasn???t yelling at me. He was basically close enough that he could???ve been in my ear. I tuned in and got the gist of what he was saying. I heard a couple things about his house being broken into and something about a dog or a baby. None of it really made sense, and I didn???t think he seemed intoxicated. I just didn???t know what to do, if anything, in that situation. By the sounds of him, I figured whatever was going on was highly emotional, and therefore it was kind of nonsense. I was like, ???Well, fuck it. Unless something behind me starts getting physical, I don???t really care to involve myself in a lover???s spat right now.??? In the way they were interacting, it seemed like there was some bigger mental issue at stake. He was speaking his own language. I wouldn???t have guessed any of the other patrons knew what was going on. Maybe she didn???t either. But I think because we couldn???t understand him, people were more dismissive about it, like, ???This guy is fucking crazy. I???m not even gonna pay attention.??????The bouncer escorted James outside. As previously described, about twenty minutes passed while Alan sat quietly, picking out songs and thinking about girls. Then James returned with a gun, shot the bouncer Greg, and reentered the building. Alan realized he wasn???t being targeted as he observed James approaching the lounge. ???He was looking in my direction, but he was looking directly through me. I wasn???t even on his eyeline. He wouldn???t have known I was standing right there. The girlfriend wasn???t right behind me, but he had to walk past me to get to her. His maneuvers were purposeful enough that I didn???t get the impression he was after anyone else.??????I knew I needed to get out. The reality of what could potentially happen as a worst-case scenario was very clear to me,??? said Alan. ???I dove under the counter and started to crawl under the tables. Then all of a sudden I realized that I???d stopped. Everyone else was still moving, and I???d just stopped. Maybe at the time, there was enough chaos going on everywhere that I thought I needed to wait it out. It wasn???t until he started firing again in the bar that I was like, ???Oh shit. Shit is still going down. You don???t stop right now, idiot. Keep going. Get out of range. You are definitely not safe where you are.??????Alan made it outside then waited amid a cluster of people along the sidewalk. Cop cars scattered the street. He heard a burst of gunfire. ???I knew exactly what was happening,??? said Alan. ???In that moment, the entire series of circumstances changed into a simple narrative. For that, my heart kind of broke. James was reduced to a stereotype. He was the young black angry male. He was blown away by police.??????The police???s reaction, just the sheer willful violence of it, was almost more traumatic to me than the confrontation between James and Whitney. Not that I wish that kind of violence on her, or on anyone ??? whether she was guilty or not guilty of bad parenting, or bad housekeeping, or not respecting someone???s property, or whatever it was. But the way he responded shows he had much larger issues than just his house being broken into. He obviously needed help. That???s what made the gunfire from the cops seemed so reactionary and so immediate and so harsh. It was like, ???This is how the state treats people who don???t know how to deal with their problems.??? No one deserves that. Death wish or not,??? said Alan.Back to the night of the shooting. A few hours later, after Alan gave his statement at the police station, he returned home. ???I was up pretty late that night. It got me really thinking about who I needed to reach out to the most. I wrote a long-winded email to the Love of my Life. I???d been feeling a sense of urgency and wanted to communicate that. I needed to remind myself I was an emotional human being. I wanted to feel the compassion I once shared with her. At certain times, it???s alright to break the boundaries you???ve set with someone like an ex-girlfriend. It definitely felt like that situation qualified as appropriate,??? said Alan. Initially, the message missed its mark. ???She had kind of a strange response to it. I don???t know that the honesty of that moment really went a long way. Maybe it was an ill-advised email to send at 3 in the morning.???2- -1 She never showed that night, but later on they reconnected and dated briefly.2 Time passed and more time passed, and then one day the ex-girlfriend reached out to Alan to talk about a scary and important thing she???d recently gone through, and it went fine.1.

That filthy, disgusting thing you just looked up on Urban Dictionary.Read Part 1 and Part II.- - Delusive Hope Is BornThe Dybbuk took hold of me and I hunted and I pecked and I toked all through the night. By the time I finished, I had eleven pages, one more than my quota. I read the pages and then I reread them. I was pleasantly amazed. I felt like god in Genesis surveying his creation and declaring, Behold, it was good.Near dawn I decided to hit the rem cycle. I should have known better. I had seen Hour of the Wolf,1  and so knew never to close my eyes during that interval between darkness and dawn when most men die and nightmares come to us and we wake up afraid, if we wake up at all.But I did go to sleep and the nightmares, they just kept coming.I was looking east out the window of my coffin-sized corner bedroom in the apartment on Thirty-ninth Street when I noticed a commie Mig fighter jet, sporting a big red star, drop its payload on the old Metropolitan Opera House, then supersonic sideways up the block, its machine guns lit up like yahrzeit2  candles as they sprayed bullets straight at me.I ducked for cover under the bed, only to emerge into a nether region where outsized spiders chased me through a cloacal maze, their mandibles adrip with venom; my wheels were spinning furiously, much like Wile E. Coyote???s after the Road Runner has gulled him into stepping off a cliff, his in the hopes of repealing the universal law of gravitation, mine to keep the mutant arachnid assassin from doing to me what in Them was done to Old Man Johnson: He could???ve died in any one of five ways: His neck and back were broken, his chest was crushed, his skull was fractured??? and here???s one for Sherlock Holmes???there was enough formic acid in him to kill twenty men. I was, on principle, opposed to the introduction of any toxin into my private biosphere without my express approval so I kept running and running and running???Until I turned a corner and suddenly found myself back on earth with a howling mushroom cloud barreling down on me at ramming speed. The tarry street before me began to melt, taking on the texture of warm taffy, viscous and stringy-sticky. My Keds couldn???t fully lift off out of the goo, and each successive step became more tortured than the last. My chances of survival were all gummed up.I closed my eyes, expecting to be vaporized, but when I opened them I had been transported, yet again, this time into a black-and-white world. I was in a farmhouse, that farmhouse, the one in The Night of the Living Dead, and prominent among the sieging walkers was the father-mother, zombie-famished and focused solely on me, their plump one, looking to make him their happy meal.In order to survive this final pesadilla, I had to wake up,3  which I did, with a start. My heart revved like a top fuel dragster, I was soaked in sweat, gasping for air like a possessed apneic. When I was finally able to take psychic inventory, I found that during my traumatic sleep, angst had trumped enthusiasm; my glass, instead of being half-full, was now, in the clear light of day, verging on empty, or as the Bard of the Purple Haze sang, Castles made of sand fall into the sea eventually.I was adrift in the Sea of Dread. The pages I had been so happy with just a few hours before now filled me with nausea. Just looking at them nearly sent me into a swoony syncope. How, I wondered, could I have ever considered letting them out into the world, where I would be subjected to the judgment of others, alleged peers, who would find me woefully wanting, pronounce me guilty, and sentence me, the awful author, to a lifetime of unworthiness with no hope of parole?My fear of failure and the horror of rejection left me paralyzed. It took me nearly an hour just to get out of bed, and half that time again to drape some clothes on. It was another fifteen minutes before I gathered the strength to open the door, walk down the stairs, and step out into the world. I got to Carroll Street, took the F to Fourth Ave, and then the R to the labyrinthine confluence of the IRT, BMT, and IND at Atlantic-Pacific, where I caught the 2 to the Flatbush Ave???Brooklyn College station (to where, a dozen years before, My Friend the Film Critic and I had ventured in order to catch a rare sighting of Vanishing Point4  at the appropriately named College Theater, now long gone).I trudged up the stairs and emerged at the junction of Flatbush and Nostrand. I put one foot in front of the other until I had dragged myself through what passed for a campus, crossed Bedford, descended to the lower depths of Roosevelt, and taken my seat. I went into low-profile mode???I looked straight ahead, made no eye contact, engaged in zero banter, sat perfectly still, willing that the three hours, which hadn???t even begun, would pass quickly and quietly, without a soul-destroying incident.Even so, when the instructor walked into class that afternoon and asked Who???s first? I waved my arm dyskinetically, like a desperate third grader who, if he doesn???t get to the pissoir in the next few nanoseconds, will wet his pants and thereby cement his place in the ninth circle of recess hell.I know, I know. Makes no sense. Really, it doesn???t. In fact it might well be an indicator of a deep-seated nutsoboffoness. But as Lord Buckley said, If you get to it and you can???t do it, there you jolly well are, aren???t you.And there was no denying that there I jolly well were.At first I spat out the words the way Popeye spat seeds, nails, bullets after he???s dosed himself with spinach. I figured the faster I read, the sooner this ordeal I had irrationally subjected myself to would be over.But when the first chuckles were chucked, I started to slow. Soon I was taking my time, savoring the moment, reveling in the response. The laughs kept coming.It was funny. I had known that, before I didn???t know it.??????I first heard the word autodidact from My Friend the Film Critic. His enthusiasm was contagious as he animatedly described the unique grandeur of being self-taught and going on to accomplish something of world-historical importance, like the Russian Revolution, or perhaps it was the discovery of the principles of quantum mechanics, I cannot recollect which.I loved the word and felt it described me; I had been raised by shtetl voles who had had no understanding for, or appreciation of, the culture of goyville that they had dropped me into. Left to my own devices I had had no choice but to go autodidactic. And so as a little boychik I taught myself how to understand life and the nature of existence. I started with sports, focusing my gaze on hockey, basketball, football, breaking down their codes and picking up on the finer points of play, the unintended side benefit of which was the beginnings of an elementary grasp of dramatic structure???the unity of time and place, overarching themes, plots and subplots, conflicts between characters brimming with backstory that informed the game and often determined its outcome and, in the best of those games, provided an enthralling climax that had the power to move me, sometimes even alter the way I viewed the world; I went on to teach myself how to not believe in god, how to roll a smooth-drawing joint, how to survive nearly OD-ing on meth or freaking out on acid; I taught myself how to catch myself before having a complete psychotic break with reality; my autodidacticism helped me discover that intelligence and wit could aid my viability, and how to identify that kind of intelligence and wit in others; I taught myself how to survive on financial fumes, triumph over severe social retardation, and successfully (mor",100
244,"e or less) mate, spawn, and raise a pair of kids who did not turn out to be social misfits like their pops, but rather human beings in possession of reliable, real-world instincts.And by the end of that first class, with the knowledge that some dudes can self-teach themselves to be world-historical, and that I had already taught myself a barrelful of stuff about the ways of the world, the first seeds of something awful my way came and began to sprout, as it popped into my luftmenschisch kopf that I just might, potentially, perhaps (how many qualifiers could I come up with?) be able to teach myself how to write a decent, perhaps even a good, screenplay.??????Which is exactly what I had been worried about in the first place. I knew from the gitgo that screenwriting would involve work, but instead of heeding that gut feeling as Keyes most certainly would???ve, I signed up anyway. To make matters worse, not only had I committed to the temporally limited amount of work a semester of screenwriting would involve (already enough to have me drummed out of the Maynard G. Krebs Slothing Society), I had allowed the product of that work to fundamentally fuck with my weltanschauung; I had in the space of three short hours traded in my clear-eyed, twenty-twenty vision of a hopeless life lived circling the drain of the behavioral sink for a rose-tinged view of an alternate future va-va world, verily dripping with optimism, something I had, up until that moment, believed to be a contemptible, distorted take on el mundo, one which I believed to be the sole purview of low lumenaires and formerly right-thinking individuals who had lost their way.To make matters worse, an unwitting consequence of this sneak attack of optimism was to crack a chink in the psychic armor meant to shield me from the real reasons I had cleaved so mightily to that daily double of dysfunction???sloth and self-loathing, a synergic tandem of neuron-hood which until that sort of decisive moment had served as the solution, but had, in the wake of one careless thought bubble, been transformed into a paramount problem.??????Ojitos (Little Eyes), the ill-fated protag of Luis Bu??uel???s Los Olvidados5  (sometimes referred to by its soap opera title The Young and the Damned), works, along with a crew of fellow urchins, in the world???s saddest amusement park. They push and trudge, trudge and push, making the merry-go-round turn, turn, turn. Ojitos is thirsty, worn out. He asks his Jefe for a break, and Jefe snaps back, You???ll rest when you???re dead.Though this aphorism is delivered by a scumbag barrio entrepreneur specializing in the exploitation of child labor in a neo(sur)realist Mexican masterpiece, it???s pure, apple-pie Amurrican Zen, the cri de Coeur of feral capitalism.You???ll rest when you???re dead: it???s a Mad Men distillation of the Hobbesian summation of the life of man: solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.You???ll rest when you???re dead: it???s the somber decree of Yahweh, the angry, jealous volcano god, who, after the seduction of the serpent, and the bite of the apple, exiles Adam and Eve from the garden and lets them know what life will be like in their non-Edenic future???it???ll suck, then they???ll die, and it???s all their fault.But unlike for poor, ill-fated Ojitos, it was later for living by brow sweat for this cat; I had long ago jumped off the karmic merry-go-round of existential indentured servitude and assumed the entitlement of Aesop???s grasshopper (another lifetime member of Krebs Slothing), presented with platonic perfection in Disney???s Silly Symphony The Grasshopper and the Ants, in which the eponymous polyphagic orthoptera is a fiddling dandy in top hat and tails singing The world owes us a living as the ants work their little ant asses off gathering provisions to keep the colony going through the winter.He buttonholes a worker ant tasked with the daunting job of pulling through the mud a wagon weighted down with ripe, red cherries and makes his pitch: The Good Book says the Lord provides. There???s food on every tree. I see no reason to worry and work, No sir, not me??? You shouldn???t soil those Sunday pants, like those other foolish ants. Come on, let???s play and sing and dance. Oh, the world owes us a living???Now that was a bug I could identify with.??????The Grasshopper???s summer idyll sets up the fabulist???s moral lesson???when winter comes the grasshopper (who had clearly neither read nor watched Game of Thrones), dressed only in his summer-weight exoskeleton, nearly dead after being buffeted by frigid winds and stinging snow, finds himself on the outside looking into the bright, insulated tree stump where the ants sing and dance, celebrating the bounty of their hard work. As Connie Francis once warbled, Who???s sorry now?6  The grasshopper faints from hunger and envy. The ants haul him in and revive him with a hot water bucket and steamy soup. Once he???s gotten his color back, the Ant Queen, severe and scoldy, approaches; he begs for mercy; the Queen pontificates, With ants only those who work may stay, so take your fiddle (she pauses, for a long, painful beat)???  and play! which he does, massaging the words: I owe the world a living, I???ve been a fool the whole year long, you were right and I was wrong.My shiftlessness, on another hand, was the algorithmic result of cold calculation???I would have nothing to show for work I didn???t do, and in accord with the principle ex nihilo nihil fit (out of nothing, nothing comes) no work product meant no judgment; no judgment eliminated the need for self-loathing, since the second part of the duplat would only be activated by the inevitable negative critique rendered if work existed and were released into the wild. But because I had allowed myself to be momentarily dazzled by the shiny bauble of the (unlikely) prospect of a life worth living, I had, by my own hand, invited into my own private drama that potential unhappy ending???the estimation of others engendering loathing of the self???that threatened to cut short my crash-helmeted, straightjacketed, mobius-tripping, la-dee-dah cruise through the serene cerebral Caribbean I had created like the God of Dysfunction that I was, and self-deport my spirit to a supermax fortress of solitude nestled on a polar ice cap, where I would spend a lifelong winter of discontent.??????I pondered the problem on all three trains and on the longish walk home from Carroll Street, and by the time I crossed the threshold of the safe zone, I had decided on a way going forward???I would hedge my bet. I would try to write and finish the damn script while always holding steady in the back of my mind the belief that success and happiness were for others, not me, a belief which I counted on to soften the blow when the ineluctable rejection finally came down.Like a superstitious baller who won???t change his routine while he???s on a hot streak, I waited each week until Sunday after supper to warm up the Selectric, slip a blank page into the platen, and torture-type my way to ten pages.By the end of the semester I had produced an actual screenplay with a beginning, middle, and end. I felt like I had come to the end of a marathon, that I should be wrapped in a space blanket; all I wanted was to be allowed to rest for the next several months, whereas for the instructor, who seemed way more impressed with the quality of the work than I was, there was more to be done, so she sent it westward to try and get me an agent.Fucking A.??????She received this reply:  Although Schneider is facile and glib, I don???t think I can do anything with this script in the present marketplace. I???d be happy to re",100
245,"ad anything else he does in the future.Any normal person would have said, Great, what am I going to write next that he will be happy to read in that future moment? And how can I ensure he will be able to do something with it in that (future) marketplace once he???s read it?But I, a looney tune on the long, windy dirt road to recovery, had arrived at a switchback marked with universal symbols warning of land mines, hazardous materials, and dangerously high levels of radiation, framed by skulls and crossbones:Achtung! Peligro!Abandon all hope ye who enter here.It was clear to me that before I ended up doing something really stupid, something I would surely regret, like work my ass off on a hope and a prayer, I needed to get a better handle on what I was really dealing with. I attacked the problem by going textual on the note looking to expose the global rejection that had to be in there, lurking just under the surface like a Loch Ness monster in a black lagoon.I performed a thorough, Kremlinological hermeneutics???I read between the lines, parsed every word, searched every article and comma for subtext and meaning; in essence I had begun my first anthropological investigation into Hollywood praxis; it would not be my last.The obvious point of entry was the use of the words facile and glib. In my experience to call someone facile or glib (let alone both) was to say that the dude/dudette so labeled had no substance, no depth, was morally bankrupt. Finally, I was getting someplace.But, upon further review??? If he had intended to use facile and glib that way, why would he have said he couldn???t do anything with the script in the present marketplace? Which clearly left the door open to shopping it in an alternate universe with, I supposed, a more drug-friendly agora (keeping in mind this was the ???80s and Nancy Ray-Gun, when she wasn???t busy banging the Chairman of the Board in the Queen???s Bedroom or having her personal astrologer decipher the cosmic tea leaves, had committed her first ladyhood to keeping the kids off the drugs, urging them to Just say no).If this were true, then in Industry-speak facile and glib were compliments! As when confronted with an intellectual carrot, the mind boggled.I continued with my l??xi-grammatik?? investigation, moving on to happy to read anything else. If facile and glib were compliments, then happy to read clearly invited more facile, glib product.Finally, in desperation, I questioned his motive. He read the script as a favor for the wife of a top-shelf director???s ichiban editor. Perhaps this future positivity was simply politic. But the talmudist in me quickly dispensed with that fahrcocktah reasoning???he had to have at least assumed she would show me the note, and since I had written the script in thrall to the Dybbuk, he couldn???t possibly have drawn from it that I was an agoraphobic, borderline, paranoid palooka who would spend the better part of a day trying to decode his simple sentences in order to uncover their true diabolical meaning. So why would he have gone to great lengths to camo the message or baffle with bullshit? And since he was reading the script as a favor, I had no choice but to come to the conclusion, against my better, albeit twisted judgment and my ontologically fucked-up nature, that I should shave this sucker with Occam???s Razor???the simplest explanation is usually the correct one???and that what I read was what I got. He liked the writing, but felt this particular script was not commercially viable. Simple as that.Shit.What the fuck had I gotten myself into?And that was how delusive hope was born.- -1   The tagline for Hour of the Wolf, Bergman???s scando-depresso film is The Hour of the Wolf is the hour between night and dawn. It is the hour when most people die, when sleep is deepest, when nightmares are most real. It is the hour when the sleepless are haunted by their deepest fear, when ghosts and demons are most powerful.2 Yahrzeit candles, made to last for at least twenty-four hours, are lit on the anniversary eve of the loved one???s demise. When I was a yoot these candles came in heavy glasses, which, once the candle???s race had been run, were repurposed as juice glasses; they were the yid household analog to the heartland???s jelly jar juice glasses, and French collectible moutarde glasses.3 According to the interwebs a supernormal nocturnal experience that is part of Hmong traditional beliefs can trigger a fatal syndrome known as SUNDS???Sudden Unexpected Nocturnal Death Syndrome, the adult equivalent of SIDS. In the 70s a hundred-plus Southeast Asian men, mostly Hmong tribesmen who had emigrated to Amurrica after the collapse of South Vietnam, died from SUNDS. The Hmong believed the deaths were due to the nocturnal visit of an evil being that pressed the very life out of its terrified victims. This phenomenon titillated the pop cult and generated reams of reportage ranging from a skeptical, science- centered investigation in the paper of record, to a photo essay in the Weekly World News purporting to document the alien evil creatures responsible for the deaths. It also inspired Fox???s 1984 guilty pleasure Dreamscape, which featured Dennis Quaid, in his launch pad to stardom period, Kate (Soon-to-be Mrs. Spielberg) Capshaw, and Bergman???s Angel of Death, Max Von Sydow. Quaid is Alex Gardner, a ne???er-do-well psychic. At 19 he split a study of psychics to bet on the nags; cut to the present as he escapes the minions of a mob boss he???s angered; he volunteers to be a test subject for an experiment of tech-facilitated psychic entry into the dream life of others, run by the kindly (and therefore doomed) Von Sydow; the study has been co-opted by a nefarious Factotum (Christopher Plummer) intent on enabling his Igor-like psychic sociopath to hop into the dreamscape of Prez Eddie Albert  (as Jimmy Carter) in order to assassinate him, because Factotum is certain that Albert???s a craven sluck who will cave to Russkie demands at an upcoming disarmament summit; Igor needs the machine to enter a subject???s dreamland, but Alex can do it unaided, a power he discovers when lust drives him to dive into Capshaw???s head and ride her, as she dream-rides the rails. In the end Alex foils the assassination plot, kills Igor, jumps into Factotum???s dream and offs him, after which he and Curvaceous Kate consensually consummate in the real world, on a train manned by the same conductor from their sleepy-time boot knocking.4 Vanishing Point is Orphee had it been adapted by Kafka on a Benzedrine bender. The hero, Kowalski, a medal of honoree and former cop, a man mourning his drowned surfer sweetheart, delivers cars. On a bet he speeds from Denver to San Fran; he guarantees he???ll get there the next day. As cops give chase, Kowalski is dubbed the last great American hero by Super Soul, a blind, black DJ equipped with second sight, who narrates K???s odyssey over the airwaves until angry, racist townies storm the station, and beat the shit out of the bard. After brief respites with a desert based, snake-charming, Pentecostal congregation, and a biker and his naked old lady, Kowalski makes it to the California border where his way is blocked by a pair of bulldozers. He stops his muscle car for a moment, then guns the engine, and rams into them, his melancholy smile the last thing we see before he goes up in a blaze of glory.5 Luis Bunuel left Spain when the fascists took over. After an unremarkable stint in Hollywood he went to Mexico where he made a string of terrific films including, but not limited to, Mexican Bus Ride, El, This Strange Passion, and the wonderfully titled The Criminal Life of Archibaldo ",100
246,"de la Cruz. His greatest Mexican movie was Los Olvidados, a flick so bleak that when I first saw it at the Bleecker Street Cinema with My Friend the Film Critic, he told me, as the lights were lowering, that it was known to bring tears to the hardest of hard-boiled Stalinists. He wuz right. Bunuel won the Best Director award at the 1951 Cannes Film Festival but during its Mexico City premiere, the social sur-realism of The Young and the Damned drove the crowd bonkers. Afterward Frida Kahlo refused to speak to him, and the wife of the Poet Le??n Felipe tried to throttle him.6 Connie Francis was born Concetta Rosa Maria Franconero; she spent her earliest years in a Jewish-Italian nabe in Brooklyn, before moving to the ironbound in Newark. Just as she was about to enter NYU on a full  scholarship she recorded Who???s Sorry Now, written in 1923 by Harry Ruby and Bert Kalmar, who also wrote Hail Fredonia for Groucho Marx. It became a huge hit. A failed romance with Bobby Darin folllowed???her father chased Darin away from her at gunpoint, perhaps a foreshadowing of her brother???s death???he was gunned down by Mafia hit men in 1981.[Originally published March 24, 2016.]- - -I saw Hamilton on Broadway ??? because I???m (sort of) young, scrappy, and hungry and also (very) white, privileged, and on trend ??? and boy did it inspire me. First of all, I immediately purchased Ron Chernow???s biography of Hamilton, which I haven???t started reading yet, but might at some point. Then, I memorized the lyrics to ???Satisfied??? (devoting an entire work day to it, my patients be damned). And most notably, in a year or so, my husband and I plan to orphan our eleven-year-old son. I know that sounds extreme, but I???ve listened to the album almost five hundred times and it is very clear that Hamilton became the man he was because nothing was handed to him. I need to stop handing things to my son. And I???m going to start by, as Eliza says, ???erasing myself from the narrative.???I know what you???re thinking. You???re thinking, But what if your son becomes an Aaron Burr? He was an orphan too!Yeah. That???s a concern.What???s more of a concern, though, is my son???s unnerving chill-ness and his utter lack of incentive to prove himself to anyone. And he doesn???t even smoke pot yet! He???s a nice kid, eats his stupid vegetables, isn???t outspoken about anything, not even the unfortunate family name we stuck between his first and last (Poone), and prefers meandering around the backyard gathering bruised oranges to teaching himself French or reading philosophy translated from the Greek.So yeah, I think I???ll take the risk that my son might become an Aaron Burr.Besides, have you seen Leslie Odom Jr.???s portrayal of history???s most misunderstood man? Look, if my son becomes a well-regarded lawyer who can also sing and rap and dance with that kind of passion, who the hell am I to complain?I actually encouraged him to duel it out with Rajiv, his arch nemesis from next door, just to get it out of his system, but he said he didn???t want anyone to get hurt.???Hon,??? I said, ???Most disputes die and no one shoots.???He asked, ???Are you quoting Hamilton???????Yeah,??? I said.He shook his head. ???Fine. Will you be my second???????But I???m the doctor!??? I said, because I am.He asked if Rajiv could be his second.Have you ever heard of someone so in need of orphaning??Since the duel fail, I???ve been playing ???The World Was Wide Enough??? on repeat during his carpool to fencing practice. I think it???s working and he understands that it???s no big deal how much funnier Rajiv???s epee puns are than his fart jokes because they can each carve out lives of import across the country from one another and will, in fact, once we orphan my son and he goes to live with my sister in Wyoming.That being said, I???m not content to see him take the opportunities we give him and squander them by cheating on his wife with a victim of the patriarchy, like Alexander did with Maria. I mean I get it, who could resist a person with that kind of vocal quality and eloquent phrasing? My god, the woman can sing! But I am certain that if my son hears Jefferson ??? no slouch, but no orphan ??? chanting, ???Never gonna be president now??? enough times and recalls that terrifying way he flung all those papers in Hamilton???s face, he will, for the love of god, get out of the city and go upstate to his wife???s goddamn lake!Or better yet, don???t even have a wife.You see, watching Hamilton did more than prompt me to spend most of my waking hours doing Google image searches of Phillip Hamilton (HOT) or skimming Wikipedia entries about how the Schuyler sisters??? dad owned slaves in upstate New York (WHAT?) and that John Laurens and Hamilton might have been in love (YES!). The show is an object lesson in why you can???t just orphan your child and expect them to acquire ALL the grit and wherewithal they need to not ruin their chance at the presidency. Or, you know, whatever career they choose.You need to make sure, before you go, that nothing???s going to get in their way! The reason we???re waiting a year to do this whole orphaning thing is not only to replicate the exact age at which Hamilton was on his own (12), thereby ensuring he is mature enough to handle the crushing blow of our absence but also emotionally devastated enough for it to effect, change, and drive him forevermore, but also to make sure his brother is in college.That way, he???ll never sacrifice his happiness for Trevor???s, like Angelica did for Eliza.That way, he can stop being the helpless little idiot I created and become the kind of man Alexander Hamilton was, and MORE.That way I can stop worrying that his mediocrity is my fault.That way, he can be president.And that way, I can afford to see Hamilton at least one more time, from the fucking orchestra.- -I???m all about bringing nature into my work.

I never said it was. It is far from perfect. This bill has so many imperfections that the whole thing can appear to be a single unified miscalculation.I have heard the whispers in the filthy corners of this building. My bill???s detractors regard it with disgust, even hatred. They say that despite all the lipstick I???ve put on it, the bill???s still essentially a pig.  A turd that can???t be polished, and I???ve simply rolled it in glitter. Mr. Speaker, I???m acknowledging in advance that the bill has its problems ??? Jesus, does it ever ??? so we can get on with the discussion.I stand in this chamber and say that my bill???s essential nature is unknowable. Its flaws are genuine and manifold, yet mysterious.  For all we know, this bill has a rich and inspiring interior life buried somewhere within these eleven hundred imperfect pages. It may be burning with life and hope, or it may be smoldering with death and doom. We may never know. I mean, who among us can read this bill?I???m going to let you in on a little secret, Mr. Speaker. I hate my bill. Not only is this bill imperfect, it has also ruined me. I gave some of the best months of my life for this bill. My wife grew jealous of all the attention I was giving the bill. Before this bill, things for yours truly were pretty sweet. I used to have time to read the paper, work out at the House gym, skip votes, and saunter into work whenever I felt like it.  Care to meet up for lunchtime beers at the Dubliner? I???m there. Got time for a squash game at three? Let me grab my racquet.Did I renew my SCUBA certification this year? Start helping out more with the Boy Scouts? Reconnect with the familie in Oslo? I did not. Instead, I made this bill with my own two hands, through concentration and effort, along with those of my legislative director Robert, in special coordination with JPW Group, the lobbying shop that actually strategized and prepared the impenetrable language, which I sure as hell can???t bring myself to read the entirety of, on behalf of various corporations, interests, and entities.Do I want this bill to die? I have in fact tried to kill it on many separate occasions. But it???s too late for all that now. I can???t just put it in a burlap feed sack with some stones and toss it into the pond, mewling and scratching. We???ve come too far, this bill and I.My bill was supposed to be robust. That was our word, we said it all the time, me and Robert and the guys. The JPW Group sent lots of memos with subject headings like, ABOUT THE ROBUST BILL and ROBUST! ROBUST! ROBUST! and ROBUST-A-MOVE!!!. You see, this thing was going to be robust as all hell. And over time the robustness got replaced with some of the derisions you may have heard from my bill???s detractors: ???cynical,??? ???fundamentally flawed,??? and ???clusterfuck.??? They say it???s a Trojan horse carrying disease and destruction in its belly. Because of its inventive yet admittedly tortuous pay-as-you-go structuring, created by those guys as JPW Group, some have nicknamed my bill ???Madoff.???Do you know how that makes me feel, hearing that talk?In my dreams this bill speaks to me. ???What in God???s name are you thinking, man???? it says. ???This is your one shot at posterity and just look at what you???ve gone and done. I didn???t ask to be born. It was your chief of staff and your general consultant who said to create me or risk irrelevancy. Your constituents know about the Dubliner and the squash, and that mostly you read the newspaper ??? I???m here to save your ass.???In the dream my bill says that it hates my guts.  And I go, ???Guess what? I hate your guts, too. That???s how imperfect I feel you are.???  ???Am I,??? the bill goes, ???as was said about another bill not too long ago, ???A big fucking deal???? I am not. I am no longer robust. I am weak. I wear no makeup. I???m deceitful and inarticulate. I???ve lost my figure. I???m bald. I???m un-muscular. I don???t know who I am anymore. I???m too short. I???m too long. I???m bloated. I???m all surface. And whose small-mindedness is responsible for my shortcomings???? ???Whose???? I go, trembling, knowing the answer. My bill goes: ???Yours, dipshit.???In a different dream, my bill foretold: ???Before the rooster crows three times, you will deny me three times.??? ???Wait!??? I pleaded, or pled.  Did the cock have to crow three times or was it just three denials?And it???s true, I did forsake the bill for a time in mid October when I was dealing with my collaborative divorce, and that hideously public falling out with my son, all while not meeting my fundraising goals back when internal polling was ghastly. But that was only one time!  Only once have I foresaked ??? forsooked? ??? my bill.  And, Mr. Speaker, there will not be another forsakenment.I ask you, Mr. Speaker, what???s a legislator to do? Abandon it? Or work toward a solution through negotiation and compromise?  God dammit, I suckled this thing. I stroked it and wrapped it in blankets, nestled it in the warmth of a heat bulb in the incubator that is our committee. And I ate a lot of splendid meals with the guys at JPW Group.  Et voil??: a not-so-perfect bill.  And when that cock crowed the third time, Mr. Speaker, I held my head high.I???ve forgotten my own question, Mr. Speaker, but truth be told, I wish it ill. I???d take real pleasure in seeing this bill wiped from the face of the earth. Jesus, can you imagine the kind of hellish impact this bill will wreak on the population once it???s released into the wild? No?  And so what? There???s nothing to be done about it now.So here we are, Mr. Speaker. As its life-giver and chief sponsor, I more than anyone know this bill. Is this bill ill -conceived? Perhaps. A joke? Yes, partly.Two roads diverged in a wood, Mr. Speaker. One path led to a pond, a burlap feed sack, and some rocks. The other path led to K Street, where JPW Group is headquartered. And I ??? along with Robert ??? took a taxi over to K Street, and that has made all the difference.I will now yield.Stop blaming other people for your problems.This is in your head. We are a meritocracy and to suggest otherwise is to attack me personally.

Honest.- -My freshman year of college brought a lot of new experiences. One of those, of course, was alcohol. One night, after two or three vodka lemonades, I was walking back to my dorm room on a pedestrian bridge that went over an electrical workstation. During an earlier walk I had noticed a fire extinguisher down there, so I climbed down to the electrical station, took the fire extinguisher, hid it under my coat (very poorly), and took it back to my dorm.Later, in our dorm room, I was showing off my haul and in the process the fire extinguisher???s pin was pulled, releasing the flame-retardant powder. Everyone else on our floor wondered where this powder was coming from and what the heck it was, and eventually some police officers showed up and asked why there was a fire extinguisher in our room. I explained that my mom had given it to me ???because she wanted me to be safe,??? which somehow satisfied them. My roommate found all of this hilarious, and this became our breakthrough as friends.I now carry that pin on my key ring. It???s a good conversation piece and reminds me of that year ??? a lot of dumb stories, sure, but a lot of great friends and growing up and figuring out what life was about. My roommate from that year is still my closest friend, even though we now live 200 miles apart.- -Submit your key ring chronicle here.1964- Barbie gets a bubblecut hair style and her best friend Midge snags a boyfriend, Alan.- Hillary has a coiffed flip and volunteers for Republican presidential candidate Barry Goldwater.1967- Twist n???

249,"ic nomination for President.Tenured professors tend to thrive at work, their identities intertwined with the goals of the university and puffed up by their interactions with students. Their offices might be clustered together in suites, each door covered in postcards from London vacations, New Yorker cartoons, and a poster of the keynote speaker from a conference they attended eight years ago. These symbols on display, they mean a lot to the professor, and the tenured professor has been able to present the preferred flavors of their intellectual personality for nearly their entire professional career. The insides of their offices are miniature libraries with the bulk of the professor???s personhood represented by shelves and shelves of academic titles, the spines belittling any student who looks up to take it in. Tackling that particular heap is not a task too many volunteer for, apparently. But the student would be wrong in that assumption. There are lots of intellectuals who read, write, ponder, posit, ruminate, debate, or declare ??? many teach right here in a less permanent and far less compensated capacity. In fact, most of the teaching that occurs at our universities is done by impermanent professors temporarily parked on campus, one rest stop among many along their transitory paths. Instead of sharing an office suite, non-tenure-track professors are more likely to be packed together with mismatched garage-sale quality desks in communal offices not much bigger than the single-occupancy offices of tenured professors. These temporary professors go by different nomenclatures ??? adjunct, graduate teaching assistant, visiting professor, full-time-temporary instructor ??? but the effect is the same, they are teachers at the university with advanced degrees, and they are referred to collectively as ???contingent??? faculty, meaning they can???t advance, and at some point, maybe in a year, maybe in three, maybe in fifteen, they will be expected to leave. Although it is possible they will never leave, the unspoken anticipation of their exit will linger for the duration of their stay.The offices of tenured professors can be deep eccentric caverns, with soft lighting and posters of Nobel Prize winners. Temporary instructors will be scattered across campus in the borrowed rooms of other departments. At the end of any given semester there is always the possibility that a contingent faculty member will be asked to move. The borrowed space is needed again, or there will be scheduled asbestos removal over break, or, responding to some other bureaucratic ripple, a less accommodating room has been found. For this reason I keep all my teaching files in two cardboard boxes and I don???t keep anything else in my office but a coffee maker. Posters will go up at the hands of the other temporary teachers, and I???ll explain over and over again to every student who visits that I like Monet just fine, but that???s not my Water Lilies print. Getting a Ph.D. has accommodated me to this lifestyle in the same way I suppose being raised by a military parent might, and I move to a new city, a new place to teach, every handful of years. In the offices of tenured professors their degrees are hung in frames. Mine are at home, in a drawer. Their regalia, the medieval choir-robe with the gold cords and the funny hat that they wear to the convocation at the beginning of the year, and to graduation at the end of the year, hangs on the back of their door on a hook. Mine is at home, in my closet. My participation in the day-to-day of the university is confined to the classroom, while tenured professors have grown deep, knotty roots. Meanwhile each added year that I spend at an institution is a year that I???m likely to be asked to move to a new office.What the mindset of being temporary does to one???s loyalty to the school, including colleagues, including students, and sports, and the community, and anyone who works there, from the custodial staff to the librarians, is that it makes one care less. And what that does for the reputations of temporary faculty according to nearly everyone with a more permanent role, from tenured professors, to students and parents and librarians, is that we???re seen as less professional, less available, and lesser representatives of the school. I apparently don???t know how to use a filing cabinet but keep files in cardboard boxes. There are no books on my office shelves. I haven???t accumulated an appropriately professorial wardrobe. I drive a shitty car. Temporary instructors are teacher-persons with damaged egos. I???m always shuffling from class to class and I never take my time about anything. Contingent faculty come across as the shifty subversive underbelly of these coveted college towns and it???s no wonder no one wants to keep us around.If I have a desire to be more permanent ??? to be recognized for my degrees and accomplishments, and to be seen by colleagues as an equal ??? it stems not out of a desire for symbols displayed on walls or shelves of books, but out of a sense of justice. Sometimes on social media when I complain about my lack of job security some troll lacking empathy will chime in with the not-very-helpful advice that I should find another line of work. There???s this notion that there???s no job security in corporate work either, and university tenure is a luxury that needs to go. I might mock the tenured for their pomposity, their splendorous offices, and their daily ease, but I would defend tenure as a kind of worker???s right. You see, it???s not so easy to get fired from a corporate job either, whatever a troll might claim, so there???s often an unspoken undefined tenure in nearly every line of professional work. When employees are let go, it tends to happen in swaths, with layoffs, that have nothing at all to do with performance. Sales-related jobs are probably different, and I suspect not meeting a quota starves the worker out, so they will walk away on their own if numbers aren???t made, but when a seasoned employee is let go, a corporate boss needs to document the screw-ups. Otherwise, human resources would be too afraid of a lawsuit to carry through. Workers might be shifted around, but the company keeps its people. Under this scheme, if universities that looked up to corporations as models and have lately pretended to operate like corporations, if they were truly run like corporations, then contingent faculty would rarely be let go. Despite institutional disadvantages, contingent faculty are generally good teachers, so that there aren???t screw-ups to document. But temporary faculty can be let go at any time just the same, most often because it???s the end of the year and their contract is simply offered to someone else, a newer younger less-moved-around teacher-person.Faculty issues aside, it???s good to remember that universities are not corporations. I know this might sound surprising to university presidents who think of themselves as CEOs ??? also the class they generally come from, also how they tend to be compensated ??? but a university shouldn???t be as bound to the whims of capitalism as a company that makes things. Which also reminds me of the perhaps misguided perspective of university boards and state legislatures who seem to be obsessed with results. Of course, state legislatures, who may see everything in dollars, are going to be convinced that the rules of capitalism apply, with the university supported by dwindling taxes, though the dwindling isn???t necessarily in line with the market.

There are bonuses for the people who are already the highest paid university employees. Meanwhile, temporary teachers are replaced with younger newer temporary teachers.State legislatures cannot know the effect of temporary labor on education and the quality of life of those hired to teach. But CEO presidents should know, and tenured professors should know. Better offices for tenured professors are justified because temporary instructors aren???t as well trained or credentialed. If you went to Yale and you work as a temporary instructor, then you???re not doing it right. If you published a book and still can???t find a tenure-track job, that???s your fault. The temporary instructors don???t win academic awards not available to them, or research grants not available to them, or go to conferences they aren???t compensated for, or any number of exo-classroom activities expected of the professor hired into the tenure system, with the carrot of tenure dangling as reward for being spirited and omnipresent on campus. Temporary instructors pick up the slack by teaching twice as many classes with twice as many students, for less pay and no chance for promotion. The notion of tenure cannot be separated from the slew of transient professors who prop it up and make it possible. Meanwhile tenure is bestowed on fewer and fewer professors, as the CEO presidents and their strong-arming provosts shrink the ranks, even as the university grows, and since students are, by definition, also temporary, these paying participants rarely notice the downslide during their four- or five-year residencies. And the teachers who arrive in a slot designed to lead to tenure usually haven???t been tarnished by the taint of transitory labor along the way. Maybe they are less experienced, and more na??ve, but as their roots thicken they also buy into the mystique that they???re special, and more deserving, as their luxurious offices prove, with X on the wall, a piece of their identity, and so many X books. And here they are for good. They belong and at the end of the year no one will ask them to move.I didn???t set out to become a teacher. I declared myself a pre-med biology major but became disillusioned with Scantron tests designed to trip students up, the students mostly on their own to keep up with the rigorous regimen of memorized biological structures and chemical pathways. I dropped organic chemistry in order to give myself time to read. I fell in love with an old university library and book led to book. I changed my major to English but continued to take science classes, as curiosity allowed, and I also followed the teacher certification track because I had no idea what else an English degree would recommend that I might do. Straight out of college, I got a job at a Catholic High School where I taught science. The next year I got a job down the street as a bank teller, because it paid more. Some of my old students would sometimes come into the bank, which was uncomfortable for me. I had sold out, but cashing and depositing checks all day also allowed me to read at night, which teaching hadn???t. And I???d been writing, working on a writing sample to apply for graduate school to get an MFA in creative writing, which I did, and while I was there I taught writing as a graduate student, something I???d been entrusted with because I???d already had teaching experience, my student teaching experience and that one year of teaching high school science.Teaching made the intellectual life possible, and then it didn???t, and then it did again. Because I was used to student poverty by this point, something I think universities cultivate and take advantage of, I decided to apply for a Ph.D. I wanted to keep reading and writing, and I was pretty sure it would make me more employable, which it did, in job after temporary job, until I got here, at the end of another nonrenewable contract, yet again, unsure where I???ll be in five months.I fell into teaching but I got good at it, mostly from experience, which for some reason that has nothing to do with me, seems to be working against me. And by this point I???ve read enough and written enough that I???ve developed an ear for good writing. Not everyone who writes or works in publishing has an ear. You have to have it to know. It???s a skill I???ll take with me when I???m no longer teaching, when I???m replaced by writing teachers still developing an ear, and it???s something that???s worthless in just about any other job. If our culture valued writing, things might be different. If state legislatures and CEO university presidents respected teachers, I might be in a different position. I devoted most of my life to writing and reading because I wanted to, and I can???t exactly go back. Will my talents, and those of thousands of others like me be wasted at a time when we lament the state of education in this country? University students are mostly taught by teacher-persons who are made to feel like they don???t belong. It???s enough to make one cynical about a life spent reading and writing. American universities, which have been among the last bastions in the pushback against anti-intellectualism, are currently structured to encourage academics to go chasing something else, and the potential of an entire generation of writers, thinkers, and researchers has been wasted.???We will call you every Sunday as you are sitting down to eat dinner.??????During these calls, you will first talk to your mother and then have the exact same conversation with your father.??????We will leave non-sequitur, embarrassing comments on your social media posts.??????We will ask you if you knew [insert old friend???s name] and, regardless of your answer, tell you a long story ending in cancer, death, or both.?????????We can see you!

After Zoloft was brought on there were a few bumps in the road  (Broti Breathes Deeply and Counts to Ten, and Broti Chooses Not to Eat the Cheez-Its She Found in Bed), but recently the drug has been taken less responsibility, and we are confident that her panic attacks will return to their previous glory.DEPENDABILITYBroti???s panic attacks??? record of reliability is second to none. They often work overtime on emergency projects like, Broti Has Not Received a Response to Her Hilarious Email and It Has Been Forty-Five Minutes, and All of Broti???s Sweaters Make Her Look Like a Turtle, and Broti???s Mom Just Texted: ???Call me. Now.???LEADERSHIPAs a team leader, Broti???s panic attacks take on a lot of responsibility. They work very well with their colleagues (Heart, Stomach, and Sweat Glands) on key independent projects (Vomiting, Dizziness, and Straight-Up Blood Curdling Fear.) Rarely has an employee ever felt ignored by Broti???s panic attacks; their steady attention to detail and shitstorms inspires ev",100

They communicate confidently and effectively with their many clients, which include: Tinder Date, Professor Who Broti Sent a Typo-Riddled Email To, and Therapist. Feedback has been overwhelmingly positive, with praise like, ???Play it cool, Broti,??? and ???You???re fine. Really. You???re fine,??? and ???Why are you crying on my front porch???? We look forward to continuing our relationships with these clients, and are excited about working with even bigger patrons like, An Interviewer Broti Will Sneeze On, or Bag Boy at Grocery Store Who Broti Sends Mixed Signals To, and  A Stranger Broti Awkwardly Thanks After She Leaves an Elevator.SUMMARYBroti???s panic attacks have given an excellent performance this quarter. With graduation approaching soon, the poor job market, and her stagnant social life, we are optimistic that they will have one of their best years yet.- -On Oct. 31, 1987, some friends and I attended the annual Halloween Parade in Greenwich Village. Someone in the parade was handing out tiny zip-lock baggies, each of which contained a quarter and a slip of paper that read, ???In case of emergency, call this number,"" and then it gave the phone number for a hotline for runaway kids. (Cell phones didn???t yet exist and pay phones were still common, so the quarter was to make the phone call.)As it happened, the quarter in my baggie had a little hole drilled in it, right through George Washington???s head. I put it on my key ring, thinking it would truly become my ???emergency quarter??? ??? the coin I would use when I was literally down to my last 25 cents. Nearly three decades later, that quarter has been around the world with me, and it???s still on my key ring. I like that. It???s dated 1981, which means it was circulating for six years before it got to me. It has now spent nearly five times that long on my key ring.Because of the little divot that???s been taken out of it, it no longer weighs as much as a regular quarter, so I???m not sure it would even work in a pay phone or other coin-operated vending machines. I actually have some vintage coin-operated gadgets in my apartment, so I suppose I could put the quarter in one of those to see if it works, but I???d rather not know. Sometimes the question is more interesting than the answer.- -Submit your key ring chronicle here.Dear Candidate,If you are receiving this letter, it means that last night???s sexual intercourse was deemed satisfactory enough that I would like to extend an offer to you for further engagements under more structured terms.

I didn???t think much when I joined this soccer league; it just seemed like something everyone was doing. What a whirlwind it???s been! After a season of participating in these soccer games ??? and, man, oh man, when you look at all the time I???ve spent out on the field, taking into account that I was absent most of the time because I double-booked my gymnastics, it???s gotta be at least four to five games I???ve participated in ??? I didn???t expect to be a part of something bigger than myself. I didn???t expect to be on a great team or learn any new skills or make any long lasting friendships on this C-league rag-tag team of third graders. Boy, was I correct in that premature assessment!I am so honored to be recognized as an existing entity on a list of names. From drinking Capri-Sun and complaining that my shin guards itch to sitting on the grass during an active game and complaining that my shin guards itch, I have learned so little this year. I was always told I was special, but did I think I would win an award for just playing soccer every Saturday afternoon on a team that doesn???t keep score? Yes, I don???t like soccer and empty validation is the only reason I joined the team. But I am truly honored and blessed. So many of my teammates also deserve to be up here today due to the broad definition of what is being awarded, and I can assure you that they will be called up in alphabetical order to do just that. This, however, is my time to shine, and I am going to milk it for as long as you are all obligated to listen to me. There are going to be a lot of people out there who are going to tell you that you can???t accomplish your dreams. Luckily, I have never really encountered that and look where it???s gotten me!I just want to thank a few people for my success: my mom for proving girls rule, and, of course, my dad for proving that not all boys drool. For all the people who told me to talk to their hand because their face was not listening to what I was saying, I want to thank you for your lack of attention, it truly pushed me to go out and seek the unearned recognition of excellence that a team like this could offer. And a big shout out to coach for telling me how good my ???hustle??? was time and time again, despite never actually touching the ball. In fact, thanks to the whole baby boomer generation, whose overcompensation for their own childhoods excused the purchase of 200 trophies for the sake of this participation award ceremony. I wouldn???t have this award without you and that is a fact. I mean that. And, listen, if ???all??? is a shelf of trophies with my name on it for signing up for something, I???m living proof that you can have it all. Thank you and I hope you???ll continue to blindly support me as I sign up for lacrosse this spring.[Originally published March 16, 2012.]- - -Like the fleeting majesty of a lunar eclipse over the Cliffs of Moher or the long-awaited migratory return of the Shelducks from the North Sea, it is time once again to herald the arrival of Uncle O???Grimacey for his annual tribute to the people of our nation, to ready my weary tastebuds for the frigid, minty mirth they have so dearly missed.For twelve dreadful months, I have longed for this glorious respite from the cursed monotony of chocolate, vanilla and strawberry, for a window of time, albeit grossly curtailed, in which to cleanse my palate of this criminally humdrum triad, and indulge in the delight of your glacial, golden-arched potable, emerald as the boundless azure pastures through which I frolicked as a wee lad, replete with the very clovers that bear your name.Dublin moans ???neath the merciless weight of noontide hunger, a gnawing in the bellies of man, a thirst burning in their barren gullets, while I, alone, must navigate the further indignity of an ill-scheduled 1 PM meeting, looming before me like the trained bow of Artemis.Alas, here I sit, idling my automobile, overwrought and hollow, a single vertebrae in the collective serpent of my famished brethren curled anxiously before your speaker box, proclaiming my desire for a pattied ground beef sandwich, one-fourth of a pound in size, and sliced potatoes fried and salted like the gentle snows atop the crests of the Carauntoohil mountains. Obligatory victuals, it seems, only to accompany the true object of my excursion???to suckle the toothsome strawfuls of your wintry Celtic-themed libation as briskly as I can manage, a carnal act performed with full awareness that such pace shall certainly heighten my risk of developing an Arctic cranial ache of epic proportion. No matter, the suffrage will be brief and deserved and pale in compare to the forthcoming Grimaconian rapture.As our transaction has reached its conclusion, I am faced with a wholly unenviable decision. Shall I suffer the ignominy of gorging in isolation within the confines of this very vehicle, shielding my visage so that no man may glimpse the barbarism I have succumbed to ???neath the oppressive cloak of capitalism? Or shall I return to the labyrinthian three-walled prison of my employ to ingest this noble fare, subjecting myself to the scrupulous eyes of my colleagues, namely Sandra from Payroll who will surely inform me, in her loathsome Sandra manner, of the 840 ???empty??? calories contained in my beloved, viridian frappe. Perhaps Sandra should attend to her own caloric affairs, as her backside has expanded to near bovine proportions, of late.It is now, at this precise moment when I become woefully aware of the cruel transience of this seasonal offering, rarely lingering beyond the Marigold blooms of latter March, and at once I am lost amidst a magnificent vision, one in which our hallowed Saint Patrick himself is riding shotgun alongside me in this very Camry, with his own Shamrock Shake in hand, the chartreuse froth seeping down his wooly beard, the confirmation of sixteen centuries of legacy and consequence coming to bear upon his face in a grin of immeasurable gratification and sharply elevated glycemic index.[Part I, Part II, Part III, Part IV, Part V, Part VI, Part VII, Part VIII, Part IX, Part X, Part XI, Part XII, Part XIII, Part XIV, Part XV, Part XVI, Part XVII, andPartXVIII.]- - Part XIX:In Which King Gylfi of Sweden Learns about Loki???s Cruel and Unusual Punishment.- -So now the gods ahr all just standin??? ???round by the fuckin??? rivah watchin???

Neither the Magic Stay-Puft Marshmallow Sleep Suit or the ZipadeeWhoDat worked for us. I???m wondering if any moms have had good experiences with probiotics, essential oils, or Voodoo practitioners. Help!Nanny Share Situation NeededWe???re looking to join a nanny share and need care on every other Tuesday from 9-11 AM, and 2-4 PM on the second and fourth Thursday of even numbered months, as well as all-day care on Arbor Day, Shrove Tuesday, most Canadian holidays, plus the occasional date night (but not more than 4 weekends/month, we promise!). We have sweet a 37.5-month-old son and we???d love to find someone of similar age and schedule to join with. We???re open to hosting on two Tuesdays per year!Awesome Baby Carrier For SaleI have a WingSling Brat Pack 720 for sale. This carrier holds baby???s legs in the PPP Orthopedic recommended position (which is behind their heads) and helps prevent canine hip dysplasia. Comes with a telescoping selfie stick. The straps adjust so that you can breastfeed AND hold a banjo neck while carrying baby, which saved my life I can???t even tell you how many times! Served us well through 6 years and 3 kiddos. Retails for $399, asking $400 firm.Sleep Training (No Judgment Please!)My husband and I are divided on methods ??? he???s a fan of Ferber???s Cry It Out, but I think that???s a little harsh. We considered Pantley???s No Cry Sleep Solution, but the one that resonates with me most is Roosevelt???s New Deal, which I think will leave fewer psychological and economic scars. Currently we co-sleep, which has worked out well for our family, but our LO is 13 years old and we feel it???s probably time for a big boy bed. Thoughts?VENT: MIL IssuesI really identify with the French parenting style but my partner???s mother thinks that the Chinese ???Tiger Mom??? approach is the way to go. She???s of Germanic descent with heavy East-Asian influences, and her approach to parenting (as well as decorating) has always differed from mine. I prefer Danish Modern (and she KNOWS that), so today when I showed her my nursery decor Pinterest board and she trashed the teak, it was really the last straw! She watches the baby for me 6 days/week, though, so I feel like I can???t say anything. Anyone else relate?Looking for an Amazing Au PairWe have a 3-month-old daughter and are looking for someone from Argentina, Austria, or the Isle of Man (if you know what we mean) to share our home. Must be bilingual and sensitive to cultural appropriation, but not opposed to Taco Tuesdays. Must be willing to take trips to the museum, library and pool, as well as to pre-chew our baby???s food. Must not wear white after Labor Day. Our approach to education skews toward a blend of Montessori, Waldorf, and Reggio Emilio/Parmigiano Reggiano methods. We???d prefer a PhD candidate. Please PM me with r??sum??, work history, references, and a brief description of your dissertation. Looking forward to meeting you!Some people call Mary Wollstonecraft the first feminist. Quite an impressive title, but what does it even mean? As hopeless as humans can sometimes be, society could not have gotten all the way to Wollstonecraft???s lifetime (1759-1797) before anyone thought, ???Hey, this gender thing doesn???t seem fair. How come they get to vote, own property, and go to college and we don???t????No, Mary Wollstonecraft was not the first feminist. That???s like saying she was the first woman; it???s just not possible or rational, and negates the thoughts and opinions of many who came before her.It???s slightly more accurate to say that Mary Wollstonecraft was the first modern feminist. I don???t know that I???m always entirely clear about what that means, either, except that putting the word ???modern??? in there helps us see that her brand of feminism (though they hadn???t yet coined the term when she lived) is recognizable to us today.Not only recognizable, but almost eerily similar. Wollstonecraft was an essayist, novelist, and translator; her best-known work is A Vindication of the Rights of Woman, in which she attributes gender disparities in part ???to a false system of education, gathered from the books written on this subject by men who, considering females rather as women than human creatures, have been more anxious to make them alluring mistresses than affectionate wives and rational mothers; and the understanding of the sex has been so [cheated] by this??? that the civilized women of the present century, with a few exceptions, are only anxious to inspire love, when they ought to cherish ambition, and by their abilities and virtues exact respect.???And if you think that???s not still true, you haven???t watched enough reality TV. I have yet to see an episode of The Bachelor in which the group dates are a",100
255,"bout which woman is the best reader or most respected mathematician.Isn???t it frustrating to see that we are STILL working on issues that Wollstonecraft wrote about so eloquently over 200 years ago?This is just one reason Mary Wollstonecraft should be pretty pissed off.Wollstonecraft???s ideas lurked in shadows for a long time because after she died her husband tried to do a nice thing. Damn him, anyway.A Vindication of the Rights of Woman was controversial but overall quite well-received. After Wollstonecraft died, her husband, William Godwin, wrote Memoirs of the Author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman. It was a sweet gesture, wanting her to be immortalized that way, but in the book Godwin revealed what few had known, namely that Wollstonecraft had never married the father of her first daughter, Fanny, and had only reluctantly married Godwin after becoming pregnant with her second daughter, Mary.So, Wollstonecraft has another reason to be pretty pissed off: Details about her personal life soiled her reputation to the point of nearly derailing the feminist movement for a time. (This is not to discount other feminist voices, only to emphasize that Wollstonecraft was perhaps the loudest and best-known, therefore any backlash against her would certainly make others shy away from making similar arguments, lest their own personal lives be trotted out for everyone to judge.)If you???re wondering, William Godwin???s considerable reputation as a thinker and writer suffered only minimally for revelations that his child with Wollstonecraft was conceived out of wedlock, to which Wollstonecraft would surely exclaim, ???Yes! My point exactly! This is what I???ve been writing about in all of my work! A double standard exists that is destructive and dangerous to both men and women!???I doubt that she would have used that many exclamation points, but I got excited and editorialized it for her.The final reason (well, the last one I have time to mention here) for Wollstonecraft to be pretty pissed off is also the final irony of her life. When Wollstonecraft gave birth to her second daughter, she was assisted by a female midwife. All was well, except that Wollstonecraft did not deliver the placenta. Because of new (for the time) standards for medical practice dictating that doctors should have specific types of degrees, and because women were excluded from higher education, the number of female midwives dropped as the number of college-educated male doctors rose. Combine this fact with a lack of knowledge about germs and Wollstonecraft ends up with a male doctor at her bedside who uses his unwashed hands to try to remove the placenta, and days later Wollstonecraft dies of infection.Cruel irony, to be sure. But Mary Wollstonecraft has the last laugh, because the very daughter she died giving birth to would go on to become Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin Shelley, author of Frankenstein and fierce feminist in her own right.With thanks to Daniele Dickerson and Sean Pessin- -The game is quite simple.

We don???t even win at board games while we???re riding out nuclear dust storms in classy gold-plated fallout shelters. Some stupid Monopoly rule book is gonna tell me where I can and can???t build hotels? I don???t think so.We certainly don???t win at repopulating the earth. Believe me, I know a thing or two or three-wives-four-mistresses-and-five-Miss-Americas about repopulating, and let me tell you something, people ??? specifically you, Karen ??? we simply will not win at anything ever again, ehh-nee-thing, if we don???t do something about Karen???s low-energy attitude towards repopulating with me. And fast.We just don???t beat anyone anymore! Hell, when???s the last time we won against that pack of feral Labradoodles that live over in Fred and Donna???s townhouse? When???s the last time we beat those hypoallergenic morons at anything? Seriously, when? You???d have to go all the way back to before they ate Fred and Donna. Sad!Speaking of eating people, we gotta do something about all these cannibals. Let me just say this: these cannibals are seriously bad guys. Out there, running around, eating the old and the weak and the fat and the juicy and the slow-footed dummies too stupid to find terrific hiding spots. You know, people tell me ???you are what you eat,??? and these cannibals are out here eating losers. You do the math. I???m sorry, but I like people who weren???t eaten.And look, have I considered cannibalism myself? Of course. Who hasn???t? I mean just the other day I was looking at my beautiful daughter and thinking, you know if I weren???t her father, sure, I???d probably take a taste. You know, just a nibble. Maybe a little nosh. I mean, come on, you???d be crazy not to; just look at that body! We can no longer afford to be PC here, people, unless PC stands for Potential Cannibals.I???ll tell you who else we don???t win against: mutants. Are you freaking kidding me with these guys? These mutants are out here eating our lunch. Some with two or three or even four mouths at a time. These people are freaks. They???re monsters. They???re hideously deformed abominations unto God, arms coming out of their foreheads, blood coming out of their??? wherevers??? and some, I assume, are good people. Ask anybody, I have many fabulous mutant friends. The mutants love me. Some with two or three or even four mouths at a time. They???re terrific. But they gotta go.Look, I will turn this barren, apocalyptic hellscape around so fast it???ll make your head spin. Not literally, like those creepy head-spinning mutants they got now, but whatever the opposite of literally is. Laterally? Either way, I can assure you, I will build a wall so high and so slippery that even those radioactive Spider Lives Matter thugs won???t be able to get over it. And I???ll tell you what else: not only will I build a wall, but I???ll make those smug, fancy-pants Labradoodles pay for it.It???s morning in Dystopia, folks.

So when her sister calls her back home to help with their aging mother, she doesn???t hesitate to leave the city behind. But she arrives to find her mother hoarding pills, her sister chain-smoking, her long-dead father???s shoes still lined up on the steps, and the cowboy posters of her younger brother Daniel (who threw himself under a train four years ago) still on the walls.Hoping to free her family from the grip of the past, Dada vows to unravel the mystery of Daniel???s final days. This American debut by a poet from Croatia???s ???lost generation??? explores a beautiful Mediterranean town???s darkest alleys: the bars where secrets can be bought, the rooms where bodies can be sold, the plains and streets and houses where blood is shed. By the end of the long summer, the lies, lust, feuds, and frustration will come to a violent and hallucinatory head.Today we???re featuring an excerpt of the book, which is out today. The Guardian writes, ???With this novel, which lodges itself in your chest like a friendly bullet, a glorious new European voice has arrived.??? Copies are available at the McSweeney???s Store.- - -As we walk along the side of the motorway, my mother is transformed into a mole alongside a poster of a pastoral center on which is written Jesus Loves You, then into an extinguished glow-worm beside the discount store and into a minus sign when moving beneath a larger-than-life-size, washed-out poster of our very own ???Hero Not War Criminal,??? General Gotovina. We walk on in the dust beside the road by the petrol station, on a path barely wide enough for two narrow feet. The speed limit here is sixty, but people drive at least eighty and a little further on, the four-lane fast road comes to an end and drivers lose all sense of speed. Farmers in their tractors are known to come out onto the highway from one of the un-made-up side lanes and slow the traffic down to a crawl.Until recently there was also horse shit on the highway, but not anymore. It???s become too dangerous to drive a cart and horses there. And I think there???s just one man in the whole town with a horse now; it???s illegal to keep a horse in town now, but he???s the old blacksmith, and they???re just waiting for him to die in peace, if Ma is to be believed. What???ll happen to that horse when the blacksmith dies, I wonder. There used to be a smithy in the Old Settlement run by that old man, in the port where the restaurant La Vida Loca is now. But it closed the year Daniel was born. I remember the sound of the shoeing, the horses neighing at the darkness and fire. I was still very small, and I looked at things",100
257," from a distance, staring out of the summer light that hurts the eyes, into the open darkness of that building. I was still very small when along the street where we lived one would hear hoof beats on the worn stone, an unreal sound the way the sound of a Ledo van inviting you to have an ice cream during the afternoon siesta is unreal. Willy Wonka has come to your town too.But there are no longer fresh horse droppings in the streets. Dogs shit and no one picks up after them, just as they didn???t after the horses. But no one???s going to throw dog turds at you, you can be sure. That really would surprise me.When the shape of my mother in the distance becomes a line???a horizontal line, a minus, rather than vertical, as one might expect, because of the glare on the road???I turn and hurry toward the house, along the concrete stream beside the new buildings for disabled veterans. There used to be all kinds of rubbish and treasure in that stream: in springtime it would hurl itself over the trash barrier. Since it???s been cleaned out and lined with concrete, I???ve noticed that a ribbon of slime trickles along it, congealing into green mud in summer.???You could go to the cemetery on your own tomorrow,??? I suggested to Ma the day after I arrived. ???I???ve got things to do in town, it???s quite important,??? I lied.Ma smiled at that, exactly as my sister had said she would, producing her Hollywood smile at the wrong moment. She had nice teeth, a gold incisor in her lower jaw. Sometimes she would tap her teeth with her fingernail to demonstrate their firmness and health.???Mother looks like a smiley on speed,??? I told my sister over the phone, later.???See what I mean,??? she replied, blowing smoke into the receiver at her end.I told her I found Xanax, some Prozac, Diazepam, Praxiten and Valium on the floor, under the dresser in the kitchen in an ancient boiled-sweet tin along with plasters, Aspirin, and cough pastilles. Ma wasn???t even hiding them, as my sister had presumed???or else Ma knew that one of the best places to hide things is where they can be seen. Yet last winter she had thrown them all into the bin, I saw her do it.???Where on earth does she get them???? asked my sister, incensed.It???s not hard, I thought. Half the student hostel was on vodka or wine combined with Valium, sedatives, and other bits and pieces that can theoretically only be got on prescription. They???re cheaper than sweets.???Leave her some Lorsilan to help her sleep,??? my sister advised. ???Anything else you find you can chuck down the toilet.??? I flushed it several times, but one blue Prozac capsule kept floating back to the surface. In the end, though, even that persistent one disappeared.It would be extremely difficult to think of a more influential writer than William Shakespeare. I could do it, of course, but it???d be extremely difficult, so I choose not to. In fact, most people are perfectly content in believing that the man born in 1563 in Stratford-upon-Avon was the greatest writer of all time.However, many conspiracy theorists believe that isn???t true. That ???Measure for Measure??? our accepted history of Shakespeare is a ???Comedy of Errors??? and as fanciful as a ???Midsummer Night???s Dream.??? They claim that many of the facts known about the Immortal Bard???s life simply couldn???t have set the scene for bringing about the world???s premier, and most read in high school, writer. Conspiracy theorists either attribute Shakespeare???s works to another prominent writer of his era or to a group of writers using the Shakespeare name as a pseudonym.Was the Stratford born son of a glove maker truly the author of some of the most famous works in history? Was Shakespeare merely an actor in the great duplicitous play known as Life? Do you not believe I could think of a more influential writer than Shakespeare? Stephen King. There I did it and he did It.By examining claims of conspiracy theorists, conspiracy debunkers, and then rebunking with my own, I shall attempt to quell The Tempest that is the mystery of Shakespeare.To be Shakespeare or not to be Shakespeare? That is the question.- - -Conspiracy Claim: Shakespeare???s plays contain such vast knowledge of foreign places and familiarity with courtly and aristocratic affairs to have been written by someone born so low in England???s social order.Debunking Claim: Elizabethan England featured numerous playwrights of lowly or humble backgrounds, some even worse off than Shakespeare. The Bard was such an amazing talent because he was able to write about aristocratic situations without directly experiencing them.Rebunking Claim: The only means of reconciling Shakespeare???s knowledge of court life and foreign traditions is simple: he???s from the future. Shakespeare was actually born far in the future where his talent for writing wasn???t appreciated by a society that preferred communicating through emoticons and different gesticulations of their hoverboards. He traveled back to the time periods of Julius Caesar, Antony and Cleopatra, and the era where shrews were tameable to get first hand accounts for his famous plays, before picking 16th-century England to make a name for himself as the greatest writer of all time(s). This also explains why The Merchant of Venice???s original title was I, William Shakespeare, Am From The Future.- - -Conspiracy Claim: There exist no records of Shakespeare ever receiving an actual education. Plus, since he came from an illiterate family incapable of homeschooling, it???s not possible that he would become the masterful literary genius we revere today.Debunking Claim: The lack of educational records from over 400 years ago does not mean Shakespeare wasn???t educated. Yet, if that is the case, his works feature historical blunders and errors that account for someone without a true classical education.Rebunking Claim: Shakespeare never wanted anyone to be able to claim responsibility for his genius. That???s why after finishing school, he destroyed any record of his attendance. A genius didn???t need to go to school. He also forced his literate parents to forget how to read or write. A genius had to overcome his family???s weaknesses. Whenever someone gave Shakespeare advice, such as ???Don???t burn the school???s records. They???re flammable!??? or ???Please don???t make us lose our literacy, son! We were just starting to enjoy it,??? or ???Stop doing these things or else people will later think you didn???t write your own plays,??? he would do the opposite. A genius never followed the guidance of an ordinary, sane person. To more succinctly sum up this claim: Shakespeare was a jerk who ever so slightly decreased England???s literacy rate.- - -Conspiracy Claim: There isn???t even evidence that explicitly states William Shakespeare of Stratford was a writer. The only surviving documents paint him as a businessman, real estate investor, and actor.Debunking Claim: The absence of evidence is not the evidence of absence. Plus, documents from Shakespeare???s contemporaries refer to the playwright from Stratford as also being an actor, corroborating with the surviving documents.Rebunking Claim: Businessman, real estate investor, and actor? Shakespeare was one of Donald Trump???s past lives.- - -Conspiracy Claim: History knows little to nothing about Shakespeare between the years of 1578-1582 and 1585-1592. During these ???Lost Years,??? Shakespeare somehow turns from an absolute nobody to an established London playwright. It???s unimaginable that such a rise in fame and standing would go undocumented.Debunking Claim: Gaps in history don???t always indicate shadowy forces at play. It is believed Shakespe",100
258,"are was a Catholic and lived in Italy during those years to escape religious persecution, which would explain why 12 of his plays feature lush and realized Italian settings.Rebunking Claim: It is often said that a million monkeys banging on a million typewriters will eventually produce the entire works of Shakespeare, and things that are often said are always true. Hence, it was in these ???Lost Years??? that Shakespeare was replaced by a million typewriter banging monkeys. ???But why,??? you ask, ???isn???t there a mention of Shakespeare being a million monkeys and not a person after 1592???? The simple explanation is that it???s rude to call someone a million monkeys with typewriters, especially if they actually are a million monkeys with typewriters, and in Shakespeare???s England, being rude was considered rude. ???But how,??? you ask, becoming increasingly more annoying and less attractive, ???did the monkeys get typewriters? They weren???t invented by then!??? Well if a million monkeys can write Shakespeare, which they did, I think they can invent and manufacture a million typewriters. ???But why,??? you ask as you accept your awards for Most Annoying and Least Attractive Individual, ???was I so foolish by not believing you earlier? You???re so right about everything. Please allow me to give you $100 for the lesson.??? Okay and congratulations on the awards.- - -Conspiracy Claim: The drastic change of styles in Shakespeare???s catalog can only be explained by several authors releasing material under a pseudonym.Debunking Claim: Shakespeare???s style merely progressed like that of all writers. His Elizabethan era plays are different from his Jacobean era plays, just like those of his contemporaries who also changed with the times.Rebunking Claim: The monkeys evolved.Thanks, guys. Really, thanks a lot for coming out to have this little chat with me tonight despite the cold, and to share in our common dream of a truly handcrafted America. Let???s have a round of applause for our amazing wild-harvested volunteers. Not only did they set this stage up, but they curated all these lovely hand-lettered posters using a homegrown font recipe and responsibly-sourced paper aged in reclaimed oak casks. Let???s give it up for them!Six months ago I launched my campaign from a little gluten-free donut shop not too far from here. Some of you were there on that globally warmed day. I spoke of a free-range America; of the America that America was before America became ???cool.??? You know what I???m talking about. The real America. And on that day I made you a promise, and I have kept that promise.My fellow free-range Americans, what I promised you on that day was a 110% acid-free, free-trade, non-GMO organic vegan cruelty-free conflict-free gluten-free presidential campaign, and that is what I have delivered. As you know, my campaign doesn???t accept money from Wall Street or Main Street. That???s right. Not only do my supporters work for free ??? they???ve never accepted currency of any kind at any point in their lives??? but they sleep in the forest on anti-corporate sheepskins and sustain themselves on low-impact hydroponic sunbeams and seasonal hope.But don???t let those sheepskins fool you, oh no. My supporters are not just any group of voters that follow the herd, and this is not just any campaign. You, unlike most people out there, are different. You are special. You know it, and I know it, and now that we are getting the chance to talk like this, you will know it even more. Because our movement is not only grassroots, but is actually grass-fed and farm-raised by a ragtag bunch of zany misfits. As your candidate, I am not only cage-free but I am allergic to cages. It isn???t like an aversion thing where I just don???t like them, either. I have an Epi-pen and everything. For cages. That???s how cage-free I am.Plus, our symbolically patented Truth Wash mouthwash ensures that this and all communications you will receive from me are 1,000% falsehood-free. (For those of you who practice, my numerology number is the Fibonacci sequence.)As you know, I am not a politician, but not only that, I had actually never even heard of politics or Wall Street or banks until I was pushed onto the table at that donut shop last year, because the ragtag bunch of zany misfits that raised me wouldn???t allow it. Before they found me and picked the burs out of my pelt, I was raised by apolitical wolves.I believe in an activated, alkalized, adaptogenic, artisanal America, and I???m glad that I can count on your vote in this, that most authentic of experiences, the American Presidential Primary. I???m glad, and you???re glad, that you???ve chosen to support the authentic choice: me, your cage-free, gluten-free, conflict-free, cruelty-free, free-radical-free, born-free, corruption-free, guilt-free, politics-free fermented hand-crafted candidate enriched with organic avocado oil, cashmere extract and socialist kale!""Illustration by Kelly Bjork.Darrel???s a geology professor, and I meet him at his office on the University of Washington campus. The room is snug, quiet, and stacked with books, and Darrel sits at his desk. He???s a tall, white-haired man in a button-down shirt who listens carefully before he speaks. His sentences are deliberate, and he often closes his eyes as he???s forming his thoughts. I take to Darrel at once. He???s bright and a little silly and has an encouraging presence I suspect his students adore. As we begin to talk about the shooting at the Twilight Exit, Darrel makes clear he wasn???t left traumatized. ???I can truly say I don???t think about that night anymore,??? he says. He???d come out that Sunday for karaoke and had been to the bar before. ???I don???t drive after I???ve been drinking. I take the bus, and the route is very elaborate. So I would only go once every couple months or so. Some of my students like karaoke too, so we???d put it up on a calendar and meet as a group. Maybe six or eight would show up. That night I went by myself. I sat where I usually do when I???m alone, in the section between the bar and the dining area, where the table comes out into a peninsula.??????I???d sung two songs. I can???t remember what they were, but I can look them up for you later. I keep a record in a little calendar. I write down what I???ve sung because I don???t like to do the same thing over and over again. It???s weird, I know. But I like to keep track. I go to karaoke a few places around town, and I???ll sing one or two songs. Some go over well, and I???ll place a checkmark next to them. I???ll note if I need to change the pitch or something. It???s just for my own reference,??? he said.As Darrel was seated, ???I heard this pop pop pop. I???d never heard the gunfire from a handgun, so the first thing I thought was, ???Why is somebody setting off firecrackers in the alley???? We do summer field geology in Montana, and sometimes as a joke, somebody would set firecrackers off. I looked at the door. I can remember some of what happened next. I saw the guy come in. I saw he had a gun that I think was silver-colored. It was exposed, and it was aimed. He walked right past. At that point, I ducked under the peninsula.??????The place went crazy. People were screaming, people were running. I???m glad no one else was packing heat, because it would???ve been even worse. It was chaos,??? said Darrel. ???Some believe that if everyone were armed, this kind of thing wouldn???t happen. But that would???ve been the last thing we needed. If anybody would???ve tried to go after this guy, more people would???ve been hurt and killed,??? he said. (A passage from Zusha Elinson???s Wall Street ",100
259,"Journal article suggests armed civilians bring almost zero advantage in comparable situations: ???It is rare that a mass killer has been stopped by a citizen with a gun. An FBI study of 160 active-shooter incidents found that just five of them ended when armed citizens who weren???t law-enforcement personnel exchanged gunfire with the suspect.???)???It could???ve been even worse, and we were lucky the guy didn???t just open up like that nut at Cafe Racer,??? said Darrel, referencing an earlier Seattle bar shooting that left several dead. He continued. ???I???m not a second-amendment freak. I have no problem with responsible gun ownership. There were guns in the house when I grew up. My brother and my dad and I would go out together and shoot our .22. Others have different viewpoints, but I think there are just too many guns in this country, even if that???s something that???s not gonna change.???Returning to night of the shooting, I ask Darrel to explain what happened as James walked through the dining room and into the bar area. ???I was sitting there, crouching under the peninsula,??? Darrel said. ???Everybody else was running. I thought, ???I can???t stay here.??? I got up and ran into the little room with the pinball machines and cowered behind one of the video games. There was a big black door back there, and the sign above it said Exit. But the door was padlocked. When I saw that, it gave me a really bad feeling. ???Oh, shit,??? I thought. ???That???s not right.?????? The game room of the Twilight Exit. Photo courtesy of the Seattle Police Department.???I looked out and saw the bar was empty. I heard more screaming. I heard, I think, more shooting. I didn???t know who he was shooting. He might try to find other people. I thought, ???I???ve gotta get out of here.??? I ran out, right through the door. There was blood. It was Greg???s. I came out that door, and I saw him. I saw a crumpled-up body, and there was blood. That really made me run.??????I ran down the alley and hid. I waited until I heard police sirens, then I walked back to the bar. Everybody was standing around. I was kind of shaken, but it was pretty clear that other people were much more disturbed than I was, just from their expressions. One gal looked really distraught. A couple others were crying. We didn???t know what was gonna happen. Someone told us we had to go to the police station. I don???t smoke, but somebody had a clove cigarette. So I did. Just for fun I guess. I???d left my fleece in the bar, and a jacket, and ski gloves. I was there in just my shirt, and it was cold outside.???A couple days later, Darrel would visit the Twilight???s sister bar to retrieve the items he???d left behind. According to an entry in Darrel???s journal, he???d showed up at 4:50, then a pair of bartenders gave him a complimentary Manhattan. (After we???d finished our in-person interview, Darrel promptly sent me a follow-up email containing selections from his calendar diary, just as he???d promised.)Reading Darrel???s other entries, I notice his neutrality, his consistent use of time notations, his inclusion of seemingly minor details. So much blandness abruptly becomes fascinating. The shooting, when referenced at all, takes on a distant quality. ???Perhaps it conveys my state of mind. I think I just sort of let it go,??? said Darrel.The day after the shooting, Darrel began his 2:30 class by relating what happened the night before:Felt the need to tell people??? rough e-mail with [my cousin, sort of a gun-lover]??? Facebook chatter about the Exit.Tuesday???s excerpt was brief:Woke 7-ish Sunday on my mind???A couple weeks later, abrupt sounds would affect Darrel, though ???I won???t say I was freaked out,??? he said. An entry notes his 8:30 arrival at a karaoke bar decorated for Mardi Gras. He considers it one of the only times he felt nervous at a public venue:Small crowd??? then a balloon popped???several more. I didn???t like it. Sang ???Devil Woman,??? told Jon I had to leave. Taxi home 9:30-ish. A little tense.As far as the Sunday entry covering the actual shooting, said Darrel, ???I must report that I wrote very little. I added it the day after because I got home so late. It reads:???An ordinary day. Walked in drizzle to [a hardware store] for switch cover and Super Glue. BBQ???d ground beef. Then to Twilight Exit by 9:20???and it all came down. Home, taxi???bed ~ 2:30.???And now for some real trivia,??? Darrel wrote me. ???That night, I sang ???Play Me??? by Neil Diamond, and then ???Just Breathe??? by Pearl Jam. Both of these were from my own CD???s, which the karaoke host Steve kindly plays for me, or anyone. Of course, in the chaos, I wasn???t able to pick up my Pearl Jam CD, but Steve said he found it! Evidently, ???Play Me??? got a good reaction from the crowd, because I placed a checkmark next to it on my calendar. My jottings are:ExitPlay me (check mark)Just breathe	POP-POP-POP!""""1.

My character???s severe to moderate Crohn???s disease isn???t going to stop him from a night of culture and lively conversation. As I point out the bold strokes of a priceless modern abstract to my fawning date, I personify grace under pressure, fierce defiance in the face of a potential flare up. It???s a gift.I used to think I was born to dig into classic, timeless acting roles. I could???ve easily pulled off a more ambitious Macbeth, a rowdier Stanley Kowalski. Then I discovered a higher calling ??? getting middle-aged men to get their type-2 diabetes symptoms under control so they can enjoy tandem bike rides with their wives again. That takes a once-in-a-generation talent who can channel his extensive summer stock training into a multi-dimensional character whose overactive bladder never gets in the way of playing pickup hoops and draining sweet three pointers.Not to brag, but I???ve got crazy range. I???m like the Ned Beatty of prescription drug ad actors. There isn???t an affliction or ailment I can???t put a brave face on. I???ve pulled off rock climbing with bipolar depression, kite flying with ulcerative colitis, and county fair shooting gallery marksmanship with high cholesterol. My agent says if it swells, flakes, or fibrillates it???s in my wheelhouse. I say I???ve never met a disease I can???t hypothetically triumph over through an exaggerated display of masculinity.Like any serious actor, I immerse myself in research before stepping foot on the set. You can???t portray an astronaut without logging a little zero gravity time, and you don???t nail the part of a chronic shingles sufferer without attending a support group meeting or two. Yes, hearing the storie",100
260,"s grows tiresome, but when my character has to confidently stoke a campfire while regaling his friends with a hilarious story, you better believe I???m fueled by the pain of poor Neil who???s always going to be a virgin because his hands resemble bright red oven mitts.My most rewarding role? You no doubt remember my nuanced portrayal of an impotent man pulling a horse trailer out of the mud before returning home to achieve sexual fulfillment with his special lady, thanks to a certain little blue pill. In thirty short seconds, I dared thousands of men to choose hope over fear, possibility over frustration. Whenever I see that ad, I feel how Rosa Parks must have on that famous December day in Montgomery.Some say I???m pushing pills. Wrong. I???m actually starting dialogues while building bridges of understanding and empathy. The next time you meet someone with rheumatoid arthritis, I hope you flash back to my character who didn???t let a few aches and pains stop him from building a canoe. A canoe! Thanks to my eminently human depiction of a man who didn???t let his medicine???s rectal bleeding side effects keep him from attending the big game, I hope you???ll see your irritable-bowel-syndrome-with-constipation coworker in a new and empowered light. You???re welcome.It???s a lonely vocation. The elite ones always are. My old actor buddies don???t return my emails. I may not be trying to pull off Willy Loman???s soliloquy from Death of a Salesman, but that doesn???t mean I can???t channel the whimsy of Falstaff in a plaque psoriasis ad when I high five my perky wife over the great antique chest we just found. But they don???t see it. They???re too busy workshopping and auditioning and doing ???legit??? acting they claim uplifts the human spirit. Fuck that. You know what really sends the human spirit soaring? Seeing that Bell???s Palsy doesn???t have to keep you from skydiving. Boom!I???ve suffered some slings and arrows, sure. My critics say I???m profiting from the unscrupulous practices of prescription drug companies that don???t want people to address their illnesses in a responsible, holistic manner. I say you can???t buy his-and-hers Jet Skis with community theater paychecks. And if I can move the feel-good needle even a smidge by showing a man with squamous small-cell lung cancer enjoying a rousing game of mixed doubles with his hot girlfriend, then I say: ???Forty serving love, motherfuckers!???The train that is approaching is out of service.The rats scurrying across subway tracks are trained professionals.

They are not raising money for their basketball team.  They are in a cult or on drugs.  Do not buy candy.  Unless, of course, they have Twix for $1.  You could totally go for a Twix.The train will not stop in the middle of the tunnel because of ???train traffic ahead.???  This is a lie.  The train will stop because Marge, who is driving the train ahead, has forgotten her bag in the break room and needed to stop at 42nd street to dash out and get it.  Oh, Marge.The emergency brake must never be pulled, even in the case of Emergencies.  It says so right there on the instructions.  We are unsure why there is an emergency brake.The train will always stop working in Brooklyn.I pointed out to you the stars and all you saw was the tip of my finger. It???s due to light pollution; I just happen to know where the stars are because I???m an astronomer. But this makes me feel like we have to get out of the city and move to the country.

Well, you should be happy I???m here, because confusion is my middle, last, and possibly, first name.Listen, the foremost thing to keep in mind about the incredible, life-changing, technological advancement called a cellphone is this: a cellphone is a very powerful drug. And you and I both know that you can???t just be giving your kid a drug so he can sit still and more effectively communicate!No, parents, you need to be thoughtful and deliberate about when you???re going to get your kid a cellphone. You need to do what???s right. Also, you need to do whatever your friends are doing, followed by whatever your kid???s friends are doing.Or you can just say the hell with all that and turn inwards. To the Internet. And here I am!  What???s great about the Internet is that it offers the well-researched opinions of qualified experts like myself who have broken down complicated, infinitely-ponderable questions into a few, brief, shallow answers.And now, behold! Your Should-You-Get-Your-Kid-a-Cellphone? Guide is below.Should I get my baby a cellphone?Congratulations, you had a baby! You know what makes a great parent? A cellphone.Short answer: YESShould I get my toddler a cellphone?It???s so luxuriously relaxing, caring for a toddler. It???s really like having your own personal assistant all day. All that helping toddlers do! I haven???t had to make my own play-dough since my toddler was born! I also consult my toddler all the time, particularly for important feedback about taking my company public and/or dead relatives. And when I want to give my toddler a well-deserved break from taking care of me, I give her her cellphone for the remaining 23 hours and 45 minutes of the day.Short answer: YESShould I get my elementary schooler a cellphone?There are only three things your elementary-school-aged child should be doing: day trading, SAT prep, and undoing all the shit we adults have so thoughtfully done to fuck up the planet. For that last one, she???s gonna need a cellphone. STAT.Short answer: YESShould I get my middle schooler a cellphone?Is talking to???I mean, bonding with???your grouchy, challenging tween getting annoying?  Time to get that kid a cellphone.  And when you do, make sure you make a big deal about it. Studies show that middle schoolers are less app???d (Ha!) to accidentally drop their cellphones in the toilet if you give it to them as part of a big, coming-of-age ritual. Do I hear a ???Cellphone Rumspringa????Short answer: YESShould I get my high schooler a cellphone?For God???s sake, do you know how hard it is to get into a good college nowadays?! Your kid has studying to do!!Short answer: NONow, parents, I know this may be disappointing, but in the 14 seconds it took me to write this detailed guide, technology has advanced so much that all this hand-wringing and fussing you???ve been doing about whether or not to get your kid a cellphone is???as you will one day be???a relic of another age. You no longer need to make a decision about when to give your progeny a phone: he or she will now traverse through the birth canal, phone in hand!So now that you can just get a cellphone and a baby simultaneously, what should you worry about? Well, there is a sort-of interesting election going on. Or you might want to spend your energy deciding what cellphone accessory to give to your newly-made human. Here???s a suggestion: an Apple watch.???Til next time, keep those emails coming. xoAmyIf the producers of Dancing with the Stars chose you as a competitor, who would you want as your partner and which dance style would you perform?

Have you not heard that women may not enjoy your images? It is true, for my friend has just been here, and we talked all about it. Do not you want to know what we thought of it?Well, my dear, you must know, we agree that your penis is obviously one of a young man of large fortune in the southern region; but that you don???t care at all for the maintenance of your private area, and we were much disgusted with it and did not enjoy viewing it; and sincerely request that you send me no more, and remember that no woman of sensibility wishes to wake up to your cock before their own cock crows with its morning???s call.Virginia WoolfThere it was before me ??? your dick pic. Your dick pic: I thought but I did not finish my thought. I took a look at the image, for I had a constant sense of it there, something turgid, something imposing, which I shared neither with my friends nor my Twitter followers. A sort of interaction went on between us, in which I was on one side, and your dick pic was on another, and I was always trying to zoom in on it, as it was of me; and sometimes we eyed each other (when I was alone); there were, I remember, furtive staring scenes; but for the most part, understandably enough, I must admit that I felt this thing that I called your dick pic was sudden, intrusive, and would be quick to pounce on me if I gave it a chance.Langston HughesWhat happens when your dick pic is ignored?Does it dry up like a raisin in the sun?Charlotte BronteMost true is it that ???beauty is in the eye of the gazer.???

Your one hand is stretched out, seemingly to grip him, but I avert my eyes and delete the image. I take refuge in my Candy Crush challenges, where I remain during the rest of the night, dropping candy pieces up and down in the greatest agitation, listening attentively, catching and fearing each text sound as if it were to announce the approach of the demoniacal snake to which I had so unintentionally given life.Zora Neale HurstonIt seems to me that trying to look at your dick pic is like milking a bear to get cream for your morning coffee. It is a whole lot of trouble, and then not worth much after I do it.Q: You worked in the candy section of a warehouse. How did it start?A: I started off working on the line. It was a family-owned company that supplied gas stations all over the Midwest. The warehouse had everything for a gas station???soda pop, candy, condoms, batteries.It was basically a job that could be done by a robot except that it required the dexterity of human hands. People were very much instruments of production. You could train somebody to do it in 5 to 10 minutes.You take a warehouse picker placement exam; it???s an exam for being a warehouse meat claw.Q: What was the job itself like?A: The employees raced down the rows with cardboard boxes. They wore headsets that gave coordinates and you called back the confirmation number and quantity. You???d be on this headset all night and you???d sort of trance out???get into this weird fugue state. It would be regular to see people sleeping standing up or in some weird zone.Q: There was a voice in the headset that gave instructions?A: Yes. The robot???s name was Jennifer and people would curse her out. You???d hear people screaming, ???Fucking Jennifer!??? or ???Goddamn bitch Jennifer!??? She took a fair amount of abuse.I remember being super tired after a midnight shift, and when I got home, at some point when my girlfriend was talking, I kind of zoned out and said, ???Jennifer repeat.???It sounds contrived if you try to explain it in the heat of a fight but I had to try to explain that the other woman was a robot. I was telling a robot named Jennifer to repeat something.Q: It???s good that your name was not Jennifer. A: One time we had a Jen that worked there. There weren???t many women, and she was probably there for a week, which was only a week shorter than the average person. But imagine having your name called out every seven seconds.Q: How did you become the supervisor?A: Attrition. I was there on time every single day. At that point I was eligible for a board seat.I was a 19-year-old managing ten people who were probably ten years my senior or more. I was going to community college but I spent more time at work than at school.Q: What were the other workers like?A: You could tell who was in which department by the way they looked. For example, in the juice department they had insane equestrian-level leg strength. You???d see somebody and say, ???There???s a juice guy.??? They carried the heavy boxes of Slushies, which were like Franzia-bags of syrup in a box.The bulk department was for bigger people. Wider lanes. The bosses had no problem typecasting.The candy department was for smaller people because it was a smaller area and you might need to hold each other???s hips as you squeezed by. Guys in deep freezers were bearded???Q: What was the warehouse like?A: There was cardboard flying all around. It had a Martian-like quality to it. You could run your finger over everything. At the end of the day you would have a tennis-player-tan of dust.Q: Was it loud?A: The squeal from the roller lines was incredible. At the end of the night you would hit a big red kill switch. I would be agitated all night and I couldn???t pin it down. But then I would turn it off and realize how loud it had been.The lines were motorized and sensors would shut them off if something got stuck, and you???d have something like an explosion of tortilla chip bags all over the place. The smallest person, or at least the one who was least aware of OSHA laws, would crawl up the lines, which were two or three floors up, and unstick them with a broom handle.Labor laws were casually enforced and there was no union. Not all warehouses are like that.Q: So you???re saying you???d be up at the top of a conveyor belt, trying to un-jam it? Would you come down before they turned it back on?A: The lines had little railings so the boxes would not fall off, but the railings were like three inches high. I would straddle the line and they would turn it back on while I???d grab the asbestos rafters.Q: You should call your mom and tell her you???re glad to be alive. A: She still doesn???t know that I did that.Q: Any other safety violations?A: If you told your supervisor that you saw an OSHA violation you would get an extra $50 in your paycheck. But you worked closely with people and no one wanted to throw anyone under the bus.That said, I saw people lifting a forklift with a forklift. I saw them doing forklift jousting, where there are these large industrial tubes and you hold them and come at each other.If this comes across as negative, it???s because I have three years of perspective??? It was dangerous, and dumb, and I loved it.Q: Anything else you remember about the job?A: Any candy holiday was the bane of my existence. We got hundreds of orders for candy holidays, like Valentine???s Day, Halloween, or Easter. You have to move like 120-pound boxes of Reese???s. You got relatively fit.Q: Why did you stop working there?A: Shift work can be hard on the rest of your life. There was nothing more sublime than driving home at 5:30 AM when the streets were empty, but there is a sheer physical pleasure that comes with sleeping eight hours a night, and you miss it.One day I thought, ???I???m gonna get 10 hours of sleep and not go back to that place.???Q: That doesn???t sound like you.A: I know! I hadn???t missed a single day in like two to three years.Q: Did you get paid? A: I may not have gotten my last paycheck. I still have my company box cutter.Q: It sounds like it was a good job for a while.A: There was something about it. Those people are still my people.AOL online chat roomsY2KLorena BobbittWhere in the World is Carmen Sandiego?My biological clockBob DoleColumbia House Record and Tape ClubMix tapes recorded from the radioOnly knowing what photos looked like after taking them to the store to get developedThe sound of dial-up modemsBasic human decency???Hey!!

But in Los Angeles, you do not walk. You drive everywhere, even to your next-door neighbor, as seen in L.A. Story, a movie beloved by all Angelenos. It is their favorite movie. Angelenos usually greet each other with a classic line from L.A. Story like, ???I???ll have a twist of lemon??? or ???Hello, I am Steve Martin, star of stage and screen, specifically the movie L.A. Story.??????You can???t find a good bagel in L.A.???While it is true that there are no Jewish people in the greater Los Angeles area, that is not the reason for its dearth of good bagels. A good bagel is hard to find because the finest bagels are boiled, baked, and immediately shipped to Gargonxadole, the monstrous 50-foot beast who lives underneath the Cahuenga Blvd. overpass.

While not as sleep deprived as New Yorkers, it is common for all of Los Angeles to grind to a halt during the monthly 2:45 AM showing of L.A. Story on Starz Comedy West (channel 653 on DirecTV).???L.A. is so superficial. NYC is far more gritty.???Correct. Los Angeles is the birthplace of superficiality due to it being home of the entertainment industry. People from Los Angeles only care about superficial topics, like physical appearance and job status. In New York City, the fashion and financial capital of the world, neither area is given much thought by its residents.???Los Angeles has the best sunsets.???True. But not for the reason you think. While many believe that L.A.???s picture perfect sunsets are caused by sun rays passing through the smog-filled atmosphere, it is actually a painted backdrop in tribute to the ending of every Angeleno???s 2nd favorite movie, The Truman Show.

It???s not right.I made it all up.Everyone Poops? Looking back, it was such an absurd blanket statement that I can???t believe I got away with it. Everyone? EVERYONE? Most people, probably, but everyone? Nobody can know that. Not me, not you, not even God. Yet that didn???t stop me from writing that I poop, you poop, and God poops every Sunday and on the major holidays. It was crazy that nobody flushed out the truth.I fudged the data.???An elephant makes a big poop.??????A mouse makes a tiny poop.???All nonsense. For all I know it???s the other way around. I???ve never seen an elephant in my life, let alone a mouse. Still, I looked my publisher in the eye, I looked Oprah in the eye, I looked the President of the United States in the eye, and said I could back everything up with hard evidence. Truthfully, the only thing being backed up was me, with all of the crap.I forged the studies.There isn???t even a Fecal Studies Laboratory at Poop University. Poop University is of course real, but it???s a liberal arts school with no science department. Nobody checked my sources. Everyone just wanted to believe so badly that it was true. They didn???t care, and when I saw the dollars rolling in, I didn???t care either. Money always does that to people, makes them continue lying about their unexpectedly popular children???s book on the topic of poop. Money ruined everything. Money fueled my evil.

She was in her bedroom when we spoke, getting dressed up to go to a dance club with a big group of friends. Laura???s night hadn???t yet begun, though it was already a little late, and she had plenty to do the next day. Her tone was brisk though not unfriendly, in the way of a young and forward-moving professional. As we talked about the shooting at the Twilight Exit, Laura began by describing her schedule. It was similarly loaded with people and activities. She???d gotten off work late, around nine, she said. At the time, she was a behavior specialist at a treatment facility for foster disorders, and she was scheduled to work a double the next day. Some of her buddies were already at the bar when she arrived. ???We sat at the table closest to the door. I was with friends, coworkers, roommates, roommates??? friends. There were eight of us. All women. It was karaoke night. That was my night. I always went. I lived very close to the bar. I???d been there many times,??? she said.???Did you pick out a song to sing???? I said.???No. I never sing,??? said Laura. ???I???m never singing in public again. I sang one time when the bar was empty. It was bad. I???m a terrible singer, and it was very, very embarrassing,??? she said. I asked what song she???d picked, and she acted like she wasn???t thrilled to answer, but I kept asking anyway. ???It was Sir Mix-a-Lot???s ???Baby Got Back,?????? she said.???It???s a great jam,??? I said, and meant it. Before we went on, Laura asked me where I was in the bar when James walked in. ???I was backed into a dead end, huddled on the floor with four other women, and then he was standing over us with the gun. The girlfriend he???d come for was right next to me, kind of pressed up against me. I got up and ran out before he shot her,??? I said. Then we talked about some other stuff, and what happened after. I???ll go into my night later.???Wow. Our stories are a lot different,??? she said. Laura didn???t leave a police statement, so I have no idea what to expect. I asked her to describe what she remembered after the first shot fired. ???I was pretty sure the karaoke stopped. In my mind everything froze. Just froze. Everyone turned and looked towards the door, but we couldn???t see anything. We heard a woman scream. I believe she said, ???He has a gun,??? and then, ???He???s coming inside.??? That???s when he came in, though I don???t know if I fully realized what was happening, that there wa",100
265,"s a man there with a gun. My visual memory is very blurry. The whole experience was more auditory for me,??? she said.???My friend grabbed our table and threw it to the ground. Basically kicked it over. Maybe it wasn???t as Hulk-like as it sounds, but that???s what it felt like at the time. We barricaded behind it. I called 911, and I covered my head and put my face to the floor. What felt like a long time passed, though it probably wasn???t that long. I heard him shoot again. All I could think about was that shooting in a movie theater that had happened like a year before. I felt so trapped. I thought I was about to become another statistic, just another news sensation, just another person that died in another shooting in America. It was like: ???This is how I die. I die in a bar shooting.??? I was wondering how much it was gonna hurt to get shot and how long it would take for me to die,??? she said.???Somehow I made eye contact with Karaoke Steve. He was across the room. Steve was like our savior, like our godfather. He saved my life that night. Steve mouthed to me, ???There???s a back door.??? Which I didn???t realize, or I???d never noticed, or whatever. I???d somehow never absorbed the fact that there was another door. Steve tilted his head to it. I have so much love and trust for him. I looked over and I saw the door, and then I looked back and kind of nodded to him. He looked up, looked around. Then he mouthed to me: ???Go now.?????????I remember thinking, ???No one else is gonna stand. I???m gonna get shot. As soon as I stand up, I???m gonna get shot.??? But I was also like, ???I???m gonna do it. If this moment passes, I???m gonna regret it.??? I felt like it was my one and only chance to be a survivor,??? said Laura. ???So I stood up and ran to the door, and I pushed it open.??????I didn???t grab anyone and take them with me. I didn???t do anything like that,??? added Laura. ???That???s the truth of my story, and it is so disheartening for me. I just ran. I still have guilty feelings about that to this day. It???s hard to talk about. It gave me an identity crisis. We all want to believe we???ll be the hero when a day like that comes. I believed that about myself. I believed I was different. It was a really naive belief, but I???ve had it my whole life. As someone who???s committed to public service and has traveled to the poorest parts of the world to try to help and save people, I really believed I could, like, surmount insurmountable feats in the name of righteousness. But in that moment when I thought I was about to die, I didn???t stop and think about the bouncer who???d been shot or anything like that. I was so selfish. I just ran for my own life.???Laura and her friends spilled from the bar and onto the street. ???One had a bloody nose and a black eye. Someone had crawled over her and kicked her in the face as we were all rushing to get out. I was thinking there were gonna be more shooters outside. There I was, wearing this bright blue flannel. I???d brought my phone with me, and I was screaming the address into it. I told them, ???He???s shooting everybody.??? I was running my fastest, but my friends were way faster than me. I???m really short and slow. Everyone was passing me. I???m just running, thinking, ???I???m gonna get shot in the back. If that guy comes out and shoots at us I am totally fucked.?????????We made it to our apartment. It was less than two blocks away. Some friends of ours were in the courtyard, smoking cigarettes. As we ran up, we were shouting at everybody to get inside. We heard the sirens hauling ass past us and then it was like a fucking firefight. We heard what sounded like a hundred shots in like ten seconds. It was just so many shots. We thought he was shooting everyone in the bar. It was just pure terror,??? said Laura. ???And that???s when we realized Jessica wasn???t there.??????We thought we???d left our friend to die. We all went inside, and then we just sat in silence. One of my friends is a nurse, she was trying to get everyone water. I had a glass of vodka. Straight vodka. We heard that a woman was shot, and she wasn???t doing well. The media came and tried to talk to us. I have no idea how they found us. All of us were like, ???Tell them to fuck off.??? It was so insensitive to ask that early. I didn???t know where Jessica was. I just wanted to be alone with my friends, and here???s someone, banging at the door to get breaking coverage. It felt selfish to me. It felt wrong. I felt like anyone who goes on the news is just trying to become a fifteen-minute celebrity,??? she said.???I was debating with one of my neighbors about whether we should go back. I wanted to see if Jessica had been shot. But also I really didn???t want to leave. We were in this secluded complex, and at the time it felt like: the guy with the gun could be on the loose, he could come up here, he could try to get into the apartment. So we decided to just stay.??????Then Jessica???s husband walks into our apartment. It was all women. He hadn???t been out with us that night. He doesn???t say a goddamn word to us. Doesn???t say a goddamn word. He sits down. I hand him my glass of vodka, and he drinks the whole fucking thing. We all sit silently. It felt like forever. Finally, I ask him, ???Have you heard from Jessica???? and he says very slowly ??? he???s a slower talker anyway, he???s a quiet guy. He???s like, ???She???s downtown with the cops giving her statement.??? I was like, ???God damnit! Why didn???t you say so! All of us are having half a heart attack! None of us have heard from her! Jesus!?????????It was a huge relief. We were all like, ???Oh God. We can live with ourselves now. We left our friend in a shooting. Thank God she lived.??? We ended up staying up that night. Some of our neighbors stayed with us too. None of us really talked about it. Mostly we were silent. I got up and for a long time, I paced.??????The very next day I went with my two closest friends, and we all got tattoos. I was so nervous to get my first tattoo. My friend got ???This too shall pass,??? written in white on her collar bone. My other friend got a big Romanian flower on her ribcage. We picked stuff that was very important and special to us. I got a pair of mushrooms. A small one and a large one, inside my right ankle. It???s because of my stepmom. Her thing was mushrooms and as I grew up it was like our thing. It wasn???t a drug reference as far as I could tell. She liked to hunt them and cook them and knew about them and had all these posters and this beautiful necklace that I still have. After she passed, my dad gave it to me. She committed suicide when I was 11. It just became kind of an obsession for me. I was young, and it was an impressionable time to lose someone who was a mother figure. I knew I???d wanted to get the tattoo for a long time, but I hadn???t really thought about the colors or the shape. Right after that whole experience though, it was like: ???I???m doing this.??????Q: Why did the chicken cross the road?A: What else does a chicken with no purpose, no direction, and a ton of debt do?- -A rabbi, a priest, and a minister go fishing in a boat. They paddle past me as I flail my arms, pleading for rescue.

Then he goes to a bar afterwards.FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEThe Supremely Prestigious Advanced Calculations Department at MI-CalTechVard has, after much R&D, discovered the the most predictive, immovable constant in the mathematical universe is, in fact, Jennifer Klein???s relationship status.Theoretical physicists and advanced actuarialists have found her sustained singleness to be remarkably, incontrovertibly stable ??? even as she, increasingly, is not.We therefore recommend that all Fibonacci fanboys discontinue the use of more traditional geometric markers ??? Einstein or Avagadro???s numbers, for example ???  and immediately adopt what will heretofore be known as ???The Single Theorem.???Our researchers understand that we, the global fraternity of mathematicians, can be slow to adopt new initiatives. Our practice is resistant to change, having occupied the greater minds of our collective existence for more than a millennium. However, since we fully expect the duration of Jennifer???s spinsterhood to last more than double that, we must recommend immediate implementation of this superior method of calculation.Arduous and extensive tests have shown the ???Single Theorem???  can instantaneously simplify complicated equations, distilling them down to the relevant facts. It is an unprecedented tool in the field of mathematics and will, we believe, fundamentally change the way we work.Take, for example, the following problem:Q: A six meter ladder leans against a house. If the ladder makes an angle of 60 degrees with the ground, how far up the wall does the ladder reach?Previously, finding the solution would have required a horrendously cluttered worksheet, square roots, parallel structures and the invocation of a dead greek widely reviled for sabotaging the grade point averages of future liberal arts majors everywhere.But when we substitute Jennifer???s constant for Pythagoras, the solution is clear:A: Jennifer does not own a ladder because ladders are for people with houses and Jennifer does not need a house because Jennifer is single and going to die alone. Given that Jennifer will NEVER NOT be alone, she will never have a home and never need a ladder. The answer, therefore, is zero feet.This habitual, recurring male void in Jennifer???s life allows us to effectively utilize this zero polynomial in virtually every circumstance. Furthermore, the vast, aching emptiness in her soul simultaneously creates a ???vacuum permeability,??? permitting any and all unwanted variables to slip away ??? unnoticed ??? between the molecules of space.The Supremely Prestigious Advanced Calculations Department of MI-CalTechVard is proud of this paradigm-shifting discovery. ???The Single Theorem??? is a concept with which we, the MathLab team, are excruciatingly familiar. We are glad to have conclusively proven its usefulness and wish to thank our despondent, but exceedingly qualified PHD candidate Jennifer Klein, for her patience and participation in this study.It???s spring cleaning time! Time to pull out the old storage bins and rummage through your life???s wreck. If you???re reminiscent over your college days you might find college papers in there with your Calvin and Hobbes mug and the 3.5 inch floppy disk of poems you clacked out on your Mac, at the precipice of adulthood overcome with the bigness of it all. As you take out the folder with your college papers and return to those caffeine-fueled nights, with professor after professor bearing witness to your intellectual potential, preserved there in green ink at the margins, understand that pretty much none of what follows is for you. Not too many decades ago college professors with job security were paid well to teach small classes, and as such, they were afforded the time to write thoughtful personal comments on college essays. They took an interest in you and gave you the impression that what you wrote mattered. These days the kinds of professors most likely to grade college essays come from that same pool of hyper-educated and experienced teachers, but they???re hired on temporary contracts to teach required classes with large numbers of mostly uninterested students. It???s very unlikely, given the number of pages of amateur writing these underpaid professors have to read and comment on, that the marginalia will extend beyond the short repeated phrases they have at the ready. And so this primer is for the millennials, the bright young things fed into the sausage grinder of student debt, today???s college students who have very little choice but to attend the P.R.-hyped sports-stadium-birthing institutions run by Mercedes-driving managers and funded with less and less public money. It???s very likely their graded papers come back through email, so today???s students won???t even get the satisfaction of dumping them in the trash as soon as they???re dismissed from class. Here are their underpaid overworked professor???s comments translated, for the sake of better future papers and in the spirit of goodwill between college professor and college student, neither of whom benefits enough to justify this age-old ritual of paper writing.???Thesis needs work???Like it or not, a paper should have one over-arching idea, something that can be backed up. You have all the stuff that might back up an idea, but you seem unable to articulate the thing that kind-of/sort-of covers all the diverse facts and opinions you???ve tried to cram into your Word document. Go take a walk. Take a deep breath. Is there a thread you can pull out of all of this? If not, make one. If so, throw everything else away or tuck it to bed somewhere beyond page one. As you tuck it to bed, imagine telling it a story. But before you tell it a story, you say, ???I am going to tell you a story about?????? Does that help? Do you know what you wanted to say now????Paper lacks focus???That thread we were just talking about? You have four or five of them and they are not connected. Your reader will think you are someone who doesn???t know that reading is supposed to move from one idea to the next. In reality, what you don???t know about is research. You either didn???t know how to find or you didn???t take the time to locate the writing most relevant to the points you want to make. You made points relevant to a random bundle of writings that really don???t belong together. A walk isn???t going to fix this. Unless the walk took you to the library like a week ago where a librarian could have shown you all the sources of digital information that the university pays for, for your benefit. Everyone has Google. Google is free. It???s great for what it is, but what it is not is scholarly or academic. And you? You???re in college now. You are paying for access to magazines, journals, and newspapers. The computer will search them for you. Most likely everything you need is there to be viewed on your computer, or your iPad, or your phone. You just have to learn how to do it, and then to take the time to do it. Google is too quick and easy, and it shows.???Needs more careful proofreading???Some professors like to mark up every single spelling, punctuation, or grammatical error you make. Some choose this phrase instead. It???s not being lazy, because you were the one who was lazy. At the end of a horrendous performance on American Idol does each judge point out every slip-up or missed note? What would",100
267," be the point? You are simply being told that you are not ready to swim in the deep end without supervision. So go find supervision. You probably know someone who would be willing to proofread your paper for you. Give them pizza. Pay them ten dollars. Or, how about this? Those squiggly red and / or green lines under the words and phrases in your paper??? that???s called ???spell check??? and ???grammar check.??? If you don???t see them, it???s because you don???t have it turned on. Turn it on. Keep fiddling with the word order until those squiggly lines disappear. Quit trying to sound smart and try to sound slightly more natural. And if you???re not sure how to spell something, then for God???s sake use the dictionary on your phone and look it up.???Doesn???t follow MLA format???Remember the good ole days when you could just type up a paper any ole way and that was fine? No, you don???t, because those days never existed. At least not for as long as you or your parents were alive. It used to be that secretaries would study manuscript formats at typing school. You don???t have a secretary. You have you. This is when you go to Google and you Google that shit. There are YouTube videos to teach us pretty much anything, including how to format a paper. By doing this you are distinguishing yourself as someone who??? 1) can follow directions 2) knows what those directions mean 3) is not dumb 4) is not lazy. All of this before your professor even reads a word. While some professors may not care how your paper is formatted, since it is an easy way to beat you down, most will choose to do so when given the opportunity. Don???t give it to them. Spend the extra time it will take to format the paper correctly. You???ll notice time has been a recurring theme here. It cannot be skimped on effectively.???Please clarify???You are saying things without backing them up. This is what is known as bullshitting and it doesn???t fly. If you don???t have specific examples or a good logical explanation for the things you are saying, then you???ve only got verbiage. If someone wants a salad and all you give them is lettuce, and they ask, ???What kind of salad is this supposed to be???? and you give them more lettuce, and they ask, ???Can I have cucumbers, or olives, or onion???? and you give them more lettuce??? Well, basically they don???t like you anymore, if they ever did.???Needs transitions???It???s not really transitions that it needs, but it needs ideas that actually go together. You???ve put on this LP record and with each new paragraph you???ve picked up the needle and plopped it down in the middle of a new song. It???s jarring. Readers sort of expect one idea to lead into the next (we talked about that, remember?). Your goal is to play one song from start to finish. It???s not a lot to ask. It does take some foresight, planning, and rewriting, however. You have to cut some things and replace them with more relevant things. This is normal. Every writer does this. What you???ve handed in is called a ???rough draft.??? Which is the thing you start with, not the thing you turn in.???Light on research???We all love Wikipedia. It???s fucking great. You can look up Beanie Babies or Jeff Gordon or Gremlins 2. It???s all there. Except for the stuff that???s supposed to be in your paper. Anything you find at Wikipedia that feels like it should be in your paper is an indication that your paper focus is all wrong. You probably aren???t really saying anything but are accumulating facts, which is what Wikipedia is, a Mt. Everest-sized pile of facts. When your professor told you not to use Wikipedia in a paper? They were trying to help you. Maybe you were absent that day, or maybe they never said it because they didn???t want to insult you by saying something so obvious. Well, right here on your paper you???ve forced them to say something obvious.???This passage is plagiarized ??? please see me after class???This is bad no matter how you slice it, but if you are humble and a complete dumbass things might turn out okay for you. At the very least, you???ve taken too many sentences and phrases directly from a source, and because the writing didn???t sound like what would normally come from a semi-educated nineteen-year-old, your professor googled the passage, and there it was in all its glory, on someone else???s web page. Best-case scenario: you cited this source that you cut-and-pasted and also provided an in-text note. In other words, you acknowledged that you used the source, even if you used it incorrectly. Worst case scenario: not only did you not acknowledge the source, you made up a fake one in order to make it seem like you worked on the paper more than you did. Worst worst case scenario: you took an entire essay, moved a few things around, and called it yours. Among the likely outcomes, the professor may ask you to either fix the paper or write a new one, probably with a grade penalty. If you are handed this option, take it thankfully and do your best to actually do the work you were supposed to have done the first time. Another possibility is that you will fail the class and will be reported for academic misconduct. If you find yourself in this situation, accept the penalty with as much grace as you can muster, because you knew that what you were doing was wrong, only you didn???t think you???d get caught. You thought your professor was the dumbass, when it turns out it was you.A check mark in the margins or an underlined passage or phraseThis is an indication that you???ve done something well. For a brief moment, maybe for a sentence, maybe longer, you???ve done exactly what is expected of a paper. If you accumulate checkmarks and underlined passages like stamps on your sandwich card, you???re well on your way to a free turkey bacon club, which in this case is a metaphor for a good grade, A.K.A. a ???B??? or better.???Well said!???Exclamation points are always good. You see, exclamation points really rub professors the wrong way, but they want to be sure you understand that they are giving you a Scooby snack. Everything else could soon collapse into a jumbled mess, but you nailed this particular sentence or paragraph and that???s no small thing.???Excellent point!???This one is kind of a mixed bag. It means exactly what it says, but what matters here is whether it???s surrounded by other similar remarks or whether it???s sitting there on page four all by its lonesome. If the former is the case, then you kicked ass. You wrote the shit out of that paper. If the latter is the case, then you are looking at a ???B??? or ???C+??? paper. You made mistakes along the way, but your professor wants to be sure you???re aware of the things you???ve done well. This right here is one of them. If you didn???t know that, now you do.???Nicely done!???There???s that exclamation point again. If you like being in college and you are kind of good at it, then this is exactly what you were shooting for. You probably learned something when working on the paper and you have fulfilled or exceeded the professor???s expectations. Take yourself to lunch. Call your mom and brag or send a self-congratulatory tweet into the Twitter-verse because you earned an ???A.??? If you???ve gotten an ???A??? on a college paper, you have all the tools you need to succeed in life. Except that your next professor might have a completely different set of expectations and grading criteria. Except that life is also not fair and having what it takes to succeed does not = succeeding. Of course, it???s pretty unlikely anyone will ever ask you to write a paper once you???ve graduated, but according to all indicators, you will very likely gr",100

Thank you for enlightening me. Great conversation! And hey ??? forget what he says, you???re not damned or dirty at all.My mother was the first person I knew who carried pepper spray. Her employer required it; she worked as a home-care nurse in the ???70s, visiting patients all over rural Central Texas, sometimes in very isolated areas. ???Don???t touch it,??? she warned when she brought the canister home in a little leather holster attached to her keychain. ???The woman who taught us how to use it said she???d been sprayed with it, and it felt just like tear gas.???My mother had some doubts as to whether tear-gassing people was consistent with her professional obligations as a nurse, but her boss reassured her, ???It???s better to be tried by twelve of your peers than carried by six of them.??? I found this argument compelling, once my older siblings, with their superior knowledge of the jury system and funeral customs, explained it to me: The legality of using a particular tool for self defense might be debatable, but most people have a clear preference for staying alive.From this self-evident truth springs one of Fear, Inc.???s most popular product lines, what we might call ???pocket safety.??? Pepper spray, knives, ???tactical pens,??? and tiny weapons that attach to your keychain or fit in a purse???such trinkets occupy a quasi-legal niche in the marketplace of fear. Many people carry them, openly or surreptitiously. Airport security agents confiscate them with gusto. They???re marketed as effective, even essential, self-defense tools, especially for women.It???s hard to gauge the total sales of pocket safety items. Perhaps because their legality isn???t always assured, retailers tend not to trumpet their figures. But they???re easy to purchase, online or off the shelf, and if you carry one, no one thinks it???s weird. How could it be? Our moms were doing it 40 years ago.A quick search of Amazon.com yields dozens of pocket-sized self-defense products. There are cutting-and-striking implements, designed for direct physical combat: rings with prongs to slash flesh (described as a ???defensive survival tool???); a keychain shaped like a bulldog with sharp-edged ears. You can buy spiky metal buttons that slide onto the back strap of a baseball cap, so if you need to hit someone with your baseball cap, you can do marginally more damage than a baseball cap would otherwise do. And there are hands-off weapons too: stun guns, sprays, alarms, whistles. Prices are low???even the stun guns run less than $25. These items seem to be popular gifts; many of the product reviews are by men who lead off with, ???I bought this for my girlfriend?????? or daughter, or wife.One ubiquitous product is the Safety Cat, an aluminum key ring shaped ???to fit women???s fingers,??? with two points you can jam into an attacker???s eyes. It retails for about five bucks on Amazon, from various sellers, and I read the product descriptions with interest: ???As women we are told for safety reasons to have our keys in our hands as we go to and from our cars. Many of us even hold our keys between our fingers walking through pa",100
269,"rking lots or out doing errands so we will be able to fight off an attacker.??? The problem, Safety Cat???s retailers want you to know, is that ???keys may shift in your hand.??? Their product is less treacherous. You put your fingers through the cat???s ???eyes??? and stab your attacker with its ???ears.??? ???The smooth, sleek design of the Safety Cat will feel very comfortable in your hand and you will be able to grasp it firmly,??? the seller promises.When I tried the Safety Cat, I found it awkward. The thin metal rings bit into my fingers, and my test stabs (against polystyrene, bone, and wood) left red marks on my palm. That???s not a deal-breaker; after fifteen years of karate, my hands can take a lot of abuse. But carrying the Safety Cat was even more awkward. I don???t own a purse. I keep my keys in my pocket, and the Safety Cat was, literally, a pain in the ass. Every time I sat down I had to dig out my keys and set them somewhere. Only once did it occur to me to pull out the Safety Cat for defensive use, when I was walking my dog at the park and he barked at an old sleeping bag someone had left behind a bush. I did all the things my self-defense training had taught me: moved away from the problem, looked around for bystanders, and prepared to act verbally and physically. Having the Safety Cat in my hand felt a bit silly. If there had been a person behind the bush, was I really prepared to stab them simply because my dog woke them up? Plus the dog was right there. His teeth were more dangerous than the Safety Cat???s ears.While the Safety Cat wasn???t my cup of tea, I concede that it might be someone else???s. It???s cheap and can at least poke holes in polystyrene, and if you leave it lying around it???s not going to kill any toddlers. If you want a pink feline death???s head leering at you every time you pull out your keys, it might be just what the doctor ordered. If you don???t like pink, you can choose silver, blue, gold, or green. Many of the pocket safety items marketed for women come in such ???feminine??? colors???Vipertek stun guns ($18.70, with built-in flashlight) come in two different shades of pink. Men???s products, in contrast, come in black and silver, or there is the KA-BAR/Snody Crisis Card, which ???features titanium construction with rich, turquoise blue anodized faces and gold-colored edges??? and will set you back $45 plus shipping (the sole user review grouses ???I???ve cut myself at least twice with it???).If you do like pink, you can pretty much have your pick of women???s pocket safety items. Pink-branded pepper spray is a hot seller???I picked up a canister whose packaging promised to ???Help Fight Breast Cancer!??? while shoe-shopping with my daughter. I hadn???t held a can of pepper spray since my mom changed jobs and gave hers back to her former employer. The makers of Sabre Red Maximum Strength Pepper Spray were quick to point out my dereliction.???The idea is to be prepared,??? the package explained, ???so take SABRE RED wherever you go."" Unfortunately, the canister didn???t fit in my pocket any more easily than the Safety Cat had, and I strongly suspect sitting on it is a bad idea. On the other hand, the manufacturer seems to think ???carrying??? their product means just that: ""It is recommended SABRE RED be carried in hand when walking alone, entering buildings, hallways, elevators, parking lots, etc.??? I don???t know about you, but that???s about half my day right there.Since I???d never used pepper spray, and carrying this bottle around in my hand 24/7 wasn???t really an option, I decided to test it in my backyard. I was mildly surprised to find that the stream of liquid pepper was concentrated, almost like Silly String, and quite easy to aim from a few feet away. Take that, breast cancer, I thought as I sprayed some evil orange lines across an old T-shirt on a hanger.I was ready to believe that pepper spray was a pretty good self-defense option, for people who carry purses. But I had trouble finding out exactly how often pepper spray is really employed for self defense. There doesn???t seem to be any publicly available data on pepper spray use. I found any number of stories about cops getting into trouble with it, but only a couple of stories about civilians using pepper spray to fend off attackers. I found many more stories about other things that thwart assault: Passers-by, yelling, kicking the attacker, and staple guns.Of course, it may be that the media thinks ???Woman fights off attacker with staple gun??? is a better story than ???Woman fights off attacker with pepper spray.??? (OK, it is a better story, if you???re not the woman doing the fighting.) But there are tons of stories about pepper spray being used for non-defensive purposes. It???s a popular tool for robbery, for example; for spraying someone you???ve gotten into a fight with over your boyfriend???s bail money (subsequently causing the evacuation of 2,000 people from your hotel); or for gaining an advantage during Black Friday shopping. In short, evidence suggests that real-world use of pepper spray against another person is less often a question of self defense, and more often an anger management issue.Still, if someone???s going to do self-defense wrong, these products are far less dangerous than, for example, guns. As the CEO of Mace Security International put it, ???A tragedy could have been averted if George Zimmerman had chosen to protect himself with Mace instead of a deadly weapon.??? That???s a hell of a sales pitch, isn???t it?Pocket safety products aren???t powerful drivers of the culture of fear we currently live in; they???re more a symptom of it. They seem to function primarily as comfort items, a rabbit???s foot or pacifier carried to sooth and reassure. These little tchotchkes attesting to our paranoia can also serve as status markers, or even tokens of affection, binding our fears up tight with our loves. Their physical presence may make us feel more confident, yet they???re a constant reminder that we believe ourselves to be exposed and vulnerable. Fear, Inc.???s marketing of them certainly contributes to our culture???s low-level hum of expected violence, the certainty that an attack is coming, and we must be ready. ""Travel with others when possible,??? drones the label on my can of pepper spray; ???avoid potentially dangerous situations??????one more sickly violin in the Muzak playing incessantly in the marketplace of fear.It???s not hard to understand why one might use a weapon against an attacker. No one wants to die. What is strange is that we consider it perfectly normal to carry weapons on our person, at all times, despite living during the safest period in our planet???s history. Women especially are urged to think that ???survival tools??? are necessary every time we walk from our house to our car. That mindset is, frankly, insulting. It???s also exhausting. I don???t carry weapons of any kind, in part because they don???t fit in my pockets. But I also avoid them because I find the expectations behind them to be, like the Safety Cat, a pain in the ass.No parking. Jump in. There???s cops.- -Fixed it.

Assuming, of course, that the fight to replace Scalia doesn???t burn down our entire democracy.The hurt, the shock, the fear, the sadness, the anger. I understand, because I???ve gone through this too. I haven???t really talked about it, but my dad isn???t with us anymore; he too has crossed over to Donald Trump. He hid it from us for months and in the end, honestly, it was a relief to let him go.So I???m speaking from experience here. You will be okay again.You need to know ??? this isn???t your fault. It???s natural to wonder if you could have or should have done something. What if you???d sent him one more Times editorial, or one more link to Politifact? Or if you hadn???t talked about Bernie so much? Maybe if you???d just chuckled when he took a swipe at Hilary, let it pass instead of turning Thanksgiving into a screaming match and making your mom cry in the bathroom?No. Stop now. This isn???t your fault, and now you need to focus on you.You???re wondering Why? Why him, why you, why Donald Trump? Put those questions out of your mind. Your dad???s with Donald Trump now, and you know that means he wouldn???t want you talking about regrets or feelings, or facts, or any issues of actual consequence.Lisa???s looking over my shoulder and wondering if you???re telling other people yet. We understand that this isn???t the sort of thing you announce on Facebook.I???m sure that you???ve been doing the whole ???Stages of Grief??? thing. Everybody does, that???s normal. Denial is always first ??? maybe it was when you picked him up from the airport, the shocked silence when you realized his MAKE AMERICA GREAT hat wasn???t ironic. Or maybe you laughed at what you thought was an off-color joke about intimidating Putin ??? you know your dad, always the ham! Then the anger (oh, the anger), the depression, and the bargaining. I???d like to tell you that this is how it???s supposed to be and that everything will go back to normal soon, but I???m feeling the Bern.Coming to terms with grief and loss is a part of any political process. This is going to take some time. At least until November.I remember when my dad told me that he supported Donald Trump. He was getting older, and I???d noticed some odd comments about women, and America???s role in the world, and since when did he have opinions about Mexicans???? But I always assumed, when it was his time, he would succumb to either Rubio or Kasich-fever (which I???ve learned isn???t a thing). Neither choice would have been good news, but still.It was a shock. I can???t remember if I cried. I might have vomited.My dad was always a small child wandering the dark forest of the Internet. Had he read some grammatical atrocity or seen some heavily edited and misleading video clip? Had some grinning stranger offered him candy? Had he been struck in the head repeatedly with some kind of IQ-dropping head-striking thing? But if I???ve learned nothing else from Dad???s views, it???s that the past doesn???t matter. He???s with his Donald now, and he thinks he???s in a better place.I???m sorry. I don???t mean to make this about me. Writing this is bringing up a lot of half-buried feelings, and my dad???s birthday is next week. I???ll have to talk to him on the phone.Remember: there???s nothing you could have done.

I read that something like 20% of adults suffer from seasonal-affective disorder. That???s why there???s an entire market for household products that can help. It???s understandable that you want to spend a chunk of your paycheck on an expensive mood-enhancing lamp.The only hitch is that I???m not one of those lamps. I???m literally just a lamp. Staring at me is not an antidote to the dull grey sky outside your window. Sure, the attention???s nice but it???s also a ton of pressure. Since the move into your bedroom, I???m the first thing you see when you wake up. You turn me on even before you look at your phone, which is flattering, but kind of stressful too.I need to spell this out: I am a $17 lamp that can provide illumination and a modern accent to a home office. I do nothing for seasonal-affective disorder caused by lack of sunlight. I do not emit vitamin D.Not sure where you got this idea that I???m therapeutic. Was I on the shelf beside one, and in your SAD haze you accidentally grabbed me? Or did you just misread that Lifehacker article and think it was about all lamps? I don???t want to bum you out more than you already are but, again, I???m not one of those lamps.How have you not realized? You???re only getting worse. You leave the house less now because you think my light???s better than the light outside. Not true! It???s not at all ???the difference between riding a horse and driving a Tesla.??? I???m no Tesla. Outside light is much better, and being outside, seeing friends, family, or just baristas, isn???t a bad idea either.And here???s some more unsolicited advice from your regular everyday lamp: pump the brakes on the Netflix. I wish they hadn???t put every episode of Friends up because at the rate you???re clicking PLAY NEXT EPISODE even if I were one of those magic lamps, I wouldn???t be able to help. Let me say this in a way you might understand: could I BE any more just a lamp?Part of me wants to flatter myself and think that even without FDA approval I work as a mood enhancer for those susceptible to the depression that???s a result of shorter days.

You look at me the way you should be looking at a psychiatrist, if your health insurance actually covered one. You know what your plan does cover? 60% of the purchase of a mood-enhancing light! If you???d read the fine print on the pamphlets they send you, you???d know that. So when you purchased me you???d have learned that I wasn???t eligible for that discount.Because I???m a regular lamp.I was really hoping to avoid this speech. I thought you???d figure it out when my bulb burnt out. The special lamp bulbs either never burn out or replacing it is some drawn out process that if you???re depressed you???d never get around to anyway, like replacing the carbonation canister on your Soda Stream.Maybe doing that would help. Remember when you first got that thing and you???d make all those fizzy drinks, have dates over and turn the overheard light off and it???d just be me, you and your date enjoying vodka sodas with soda you made? They were impressed, I was impressed. We had great nights back then, in the living room before we both spent all our time in your bedroom.Maybe your first step should be moving me back there.

When he borrowed/stole your notebook and saw the list you had written ranking the hotness of different boys in school and noticed that he was number three, he crowed with delight. Instead of showing everyone else in the class, as you thought he was going to, he gave it back to you and said in a low voice, ???I???m very flattered.???2.	This is not so much a sign, but his shirts are just incredibly white. No other boy is able to make a white T-shirt look as good. His mother must bleach them all the time, and this makes you think she loves him and is a good mother and that she makes dinner every night, with like, saut??ed vegetables, and it is all the good nutrition that makes Mark Strom glow the way he does.  Also, his mother drives a Lexus. This is unbelievably glamorous.3.	Even though you are chubby and he is way out of your league, you are much less chubby than you were last year, much, much less chubby, almost bordering on normal.4.	Once, when he ran into you in the library, he smiled really big and said, ???Didn???t see you there, Ashley!???5.	He made a joke to your math teacher that he got an A on his last test by studying with you, even though he has never studied with you. Maybe he wants to?6.	You think all the time about telling him your parents are getting divorced. In the fantasy, he is moved to tears, and swoops you up in a big hug and you can feel how warm his skin is through his perfectly white shirt and he smells wonderfully of lemon detergent, a big waft of it, like someone has just opened the dishwasher after it has finished running.7.	He has blue eyes and you have blue eyes, so if you had babies, they would have blue eyes.8.	When you got a stress nosebleed last week, he told you about it very quietly so that you could excuse yourself and go to the bathroom without everybody noticing. As you packed your nose with cheap toilet paper, the empty girl???s bathroom hummed with a peculiar grace, as though it were a chapel of solitude Mark Strom had personally given you. You examined the blackheads on your chin like a queen.""General PrologueThe Craft Brewer???s TaleThe Adjunct Professor???s TaleThe Dispensary Doctor???s TaleThe Investment Banker???s TaleThe Hacker???s TaleThe Organic Farmer???s TaleThe Social Media Manager???s TaleThe Walmart Greeter???s TaleThe Drone Pilot???s TaleThe Twitter Activist???s TaleThe Pundit???s TaleThe Militiaman???s TaleThe Tinderella???s TaleThe Mobile App Developer???s TaleThe Plastic Surgeon???s TaleThe Otherkin???s TaleThe Instagram Addict???s TaleThe Rascal Driver???s TaleThe Troll???s TaleThe Yoga Instructor???s TaleThe Pickup Artist???s TaleThe SWAT Cop???s TaleThe One Percenter???s TaleThe Anti-Vaxxer???s TaleWe???re looking for a talented, driven, career-oriented individual who???s willing to give up on their dreams for the betterment of this hip, multinational tech corporation. If you???re looking to smile on the outside while dying a slow, grueling death on the inside ??? this is the job for you.Applicants will preferably have had hopes of ???making it??? in one of the following fields: acting, creative writing (poets preferred ??? you had no real ambitions anyway, and wasn???t that the beauty of it?), painter, oboist, street performer, or photographer. Performance artists will be considered, as long as they unambiguously state on their application that this is not a ???meta piece of performance art.???Job-seekers should be violently opposed to the Microsoft Office suite of products, bottom-lines, right-wing politics, the gender binary, and their parents??? traditional conceptions of ???success.??? Proficiencies in Habermas??? notions of the ???public sphere,??? elementary Kant, and Kafka???s parables are a plus ??? even a working knowledge (i.e. the ability to say ???that???s so Kafka-esque??? when appropriate) will suffice, and might even be preferred.We would hate for you to be pretentious, but if you don???t regularly call other ",100
272,"people pretentious ??? this might not be the job for you.As the position will require the facile deployment of new media forms, please outline your ironically detached usage of social media, wherein you simultaneously make fun of the medium while using the medium itself. (Note: if you do not have a Facebook, please let us know why this bespeaks a certain ???authenticity??? missing in today???s globalized, media-saturated world, and why this proves you???re not as desperately alone as everyone else.) Video artwork is a plus, particularly if there is no discernible plot and if it quotes Nazi propagandist films as a means of commentating on the pseudo-Marxist approaches of certain Scandinavian policy makers.  Show us ??? without telling us ??? how your work???s subtle use of recycled film stock actually mirrors the very modes of production it rails against.It???s important that you fit in with our firm???s culture, so please note that while we do have an in-house beer tap, it only contains Samuel Adams varietals. Also, a ping-pong table is set up in the back room???and yes, to answer your question, we do know that we are merely clich??s of ourselves. Regular outings to sporting events will be had; however, we expect you to stand outside of the arena chain-smoking American Spirits and muttering something about ???the sad state of American populism??? under your breath. If you???ve got a penchant for hate-fucking people you vehemently disagree with, we ask that you send a detailed letter of recommendation from your dialectical therapy psychiatrist that speaks to your inability to ???really get close with someone.???Please include, along with your CV, a cover letter written in the style of David Foster Wallace a la ???Consider The Lobster,??? since it???s the only thing we???ve read by him and we assume you were planning on doing so anyway. Please begin by acknowledging the fact that you are writing a cover letter while you are, indeed, writing a cover letter. Applicants who simply turn in a piece of paper with the words COVER LETTER type-written on its face will automatically secure a spot in the second round of interviews (conducted via Morse code), but do know that this will have compromised your artistic integrity, as well as your sense of self.After all, isn???t that the whole point?Whew. Amazing. I can???t believe this. Thank you! You can tell that I???m very grateful by how emotional I am right now, though what you???re really seeing is incredible relief that I didn???t lose.To even be considered in the same category as the other four nominees ??? [NAME THEM] ??? is such an honor, and the fact that I just named the huge talents I beat out for this award is in no way an implication that I???ve surpassed them and am taking special joy in rubbing it in their faces. I think I???ll talk about how great they are some more and maybe tell two of them how I???ve idolized them ever since I was a child, which will make them feel incredibly old on top of being losers. But that???s okay, because both are true.First of all, I want to thank God, and why not? God is the Executive Producer of Earth, and he didn???t get the credit just because he found the source material. God is hands on. He created the universe, the Earth, human beings, the entertainment industry, cameras, lights, action ??? you name it. And by thanking the Seer of All Movies for providing me with this award, I am in no way suggesting that He loves me more than the other four nominees ??? [NAME THEM]. Though, if you think about it, there really is no other conclusion you can draw.I would also like to thank the members of the Academy for this tremendous honor, because I???d be an idiot not to curry favor with those septuagenarian white men who, provided they???re taking care of themselves and not eating too much red meat, will have opportunities to give me more of these in the future.Next I???d like to thank everyone in Hollywood who might help me with my career if I say their names right now: [NAME THEM]. I would also like to thank all the members of my team, and by using the word ???team??? you might think that I am the leader of an elite commando squad as opposed to one of myriad clients represented by the following managers, agents and lawyers: [NAME THEM]. I know that was long list, and that there is nothing entertaining in the least about hearing lists of names of people you don???t know, but I would rather bore you right now than risk the disdain of people who make their livings by taking percentages of my earnings.Now I???m going to say some more names, but these names may be marginally more interesting to you because they are people who are actually important to me, and my eyes are going to well with tears as I speak them. My spouse, [NAME THEM], I???m going to make eye contact with you even though you are seventeen rows away and tell you that there is no way this award would have happened without you, even though, by virtue of how many other people I???ve thanked before you, that seems like a stretch. I also want to thank my children, [NAME THEM], even though I haven???t seen them for two months since I started campaigning for this award. You guys should be in bed!Finally, to show that I care and that I???ve really thought about this, I???m going to offer up my award to the survivors of the latest natural disaster, international crisis, or war ??? though it???s hard to see what they would do with it, given that what they really need is clean water ??? as well as dedicate it to victims of racism, homophobia, spousal abuse, drug abuse, alcohol abuse, senior abuse, animal abuse, and to everyone who???s felt the intense pain and humiliation that comes with a hoverboard accident [NAME THEM].I don???t mean this title literally, of course. Woolf was a bit willowy and delicate in terms of her constitution, but she would (she did) run intellectual circles around us (yes, I???m lumping you into my ???us??? because I don???t care how smart you are; chances are Woolf was smarter). And now she???s pissed.This should not, however, intimidate us lowly souls and keep us from reading Woolf. Famous for her stream-of-consciousness style of writing, Woolf brings us into her thoughts when she writes, and we feel connected to her. If you???re only willing to let yourself be absorbed by her words, she will envelop you and guide you.But she will also kick your ass.Let???s be honest; if you???ve read Virginia Woolf???s writing, you???ve probably gotten the sense (as I have) that she was a bit pissed off during her lifetime. She hid it well most of the time, under a proper English Victorian-on-her-way-to-being-Modern veneer. But she was awfully ticked, I think, that the generation before her still had what she felt were old-fashioned expectations, that society was making such slow progress toward equality for women, that there was such trauma in her personal life as well as the world at large, and more.Virginia Woolf, were she still alive, or somehow able to see and hear our world today, would be pissed that talk of her death so often precedes (and sometimes eclipses) talk of her work and her life.In her February 17, 1922 diary, Woolf writes, ???I meant to write about death, only life came breaking in as usual.??? The opposite happens when people today talk about Woolf, as though they mean to talk about life, only death comes breaking in.Yes, she killed herself in 1941, when she was 59 years old. She filled her pockets with stones and walked into the river. It???s tragic, and by no means do I intend to brush it off as insignificant, but it???s not the only compelling thing about her.Adeline Virginia Stephen Woolf was born in 1",100
273,"882 to well-known and highly intellectual parents with a blended family. Woolf suffered greatly when she was 13 years old and her mother died; two years later her half-sister died, and seven years after that her father died. Woolf suffered ???breakdowns??? throughout her life, and was diagnosed with manic-depressive, bipolar affective disorder, and bipolar disorder, depending on who you ask and which generation they are a part of.Woolf married Leonard Woolf in 1912, and had an affair with Vita Sackville-West in 1922. The book Orlando is usually read as a love letter to Vita.Woolf wrote nine novels, six short story collections, three biographies, fourteen nonfiction books, seven autobiographies, one drama, one translation, and many prefaces, letters, and diaries. All of this while not only surviving two world wars, but being in great distress during World War II, after the Woolfs??? London home was destroyed in the Blitz and there was considerable danger for Leonard, who was Jewish.Cheery, no? We needn???t wonder why she may have been pissed off while alive.I think our focus on Woolf???s death occurs because we???re uncomfortable with her uncertainty or her ambiguity, or the way she draws out our own uncertainties and ambiguities. We can???t categorize her, even though at first glance there are many categories for her: Modernist, feminist, Bloomsbury, writer, suicide, bisexual, and more. But just dip a finger below the surface and you???re beset with contradictions.In our time as our understanding of things like sexuality and gender, age, what constitutes news, our understanding of media and its reputability (or lack thereof), becomes more fluid, both more and less complicated, and our definition of humanity broadens and deepens, we owe it to ourselves to read and appreciate Virginia Woolf. She was 100 years ahead of us in her ideas and experimentation. We should be running to catch up instead of letting her pass by while we chatter on about her death.If this sounds like a giant advertisement for Woolf, well, good. If I made a kerbillion dollars (which I???m sure is coming any day now, since most teachers and writers live the high life), I???d have purchased a 30-second slot during the Super Bowl to say READ VIRGINIA WOOLF. SHE WAS PISSED THEN AND SHE???S PISSED NOW BECAUSE IT IS TAKING FOREVER FOR US TO CATCH UP TO HER. Oh, and STOP FOCUSING FIRST AND ONLY ON HER DEATH.Yes, it???d be in all caps because it???s a proclamation that deserves to be shouted.As connected as I feel to Woolf when I read her work, few things terrify me more than the idea of actually speaking with her. I???m sure I???d be in such awe that I wouldn???t be able to form a complete sentence. Still, when the ???Who, living or dead, would you have a beer with if you could??? question becomes reality (as I know it will), I might still dare to choose Virginia Woolf, for the pleasure of listening to her kick my ass.My fellow Americans, as I have crisscrossed this country, one thing has become clear. When it comes to religion, we are a nation of true believers. But there are so many faiths, and as a candidate, picking the wrong one might be the difference between you trusting me with your vote, and choosing one of my opponents. And that is why I stand before you today as the only candidate with the conviction to say what is in my heart, what is deep in the core of my being: that it is YOUR faith that informs everything I say or do.I know what you are thinking. I have that wrong. It should be MY faith informs everything I say or do. But I did not misspeak. Rather than do the arrogant thing as my opponents do and tell you my beliefs, I will wait for you to tell me what you believe, then magically believe it as well. For it is through that sacred bond in which you talk directly to God, God talks back to you, you talk to me, and I say what it is you want to hear, that one can truly understand how deep my faith in your faith goes.Before I dare misquote the Bible, most likely scripture I don???t know from Adam (guy from the Bible?), or flub an illuminating Talmudic passage (points for calling it illuminating?), or make up a verse from the Book of Mormon (was it a musical or book first?), let???s not force it. As long as you are right with your creator and registered with the county board of elections, I will kneel and pray with you for as long as we are both together in this multi-purpose auditorium.To most of you, we are all sinners. For others, it???s prayer five times a day. To some, an elephant-headed person is a God, and I can get down with that. It???s weird, don???t get me wrong. But it is my abiding faith in your faith that has guided me through these grueling campaign months. It has been my rock when poll numbers showed I needed to broaden my appeal. It saved me when I needed an endorsement from that extremist religious figure. It shined a light on me when you asked ???when was the last time I went to church,??? and I had security remove you from the rally.Personally, I don???t see how a candidate can separate their politics from their faith. It???s as if you???re pretending to be something you???re not, rather than being something you pretend you are.  The former simply seems more wrong, no? Seriously, I???m asking, because whatever you say is what I???ll go with. If it???s the other way, then consider me an Evangelical. If you don???t like that, that new Pope seems cool, I???ll be Catholic. How fun would it be to hang with that Pope? Again, I???m asking, because honestly it doesn???t have to be him. Rabbis are fine too. Imams, I???ll manage.While some may call me opportunistic, to them I say isn???t there a proverb somewhere about minding your own business? There should be. Google it. Look, I don???t come to your church and smack the communion wine out of your mouth. It tastes good, right? So shut up! Because people of no conscience like myself will not cower ??? we will defend ourselves against those who show intolerance towards the way too tolerant. And not the lame stream media, not the Washington establishment, not one corporate lobbyist will change our hearts unless you demand we change them first!If you believe in values, virtue, and a slim electoral majority, I???m asking for your vote. And when I take the oath of office as your President, you can rest assured the book I???m swearing upon means as much to me as it does to you. But it could be another book. Any book, really. Even that kooky one about the galactic overlord all the celebrities like. Heck, I???m fine with Odin too. And Zeus, can???t leave him out. Quetzalcoatl?Was that a whoop in the back for Quetzalcoatl?!Richard III???Evil man gets the girl this time ??? but loses his horse.???A Midsummer Night???s Dream???A simple weaver experiences a night of passion with the fairy queen.

Located in the southern portion of Nevada, the facility has long been accused of being connected to extraterrestrials, housing top secret government experiments, and harshing nearby Las Vegas??? buzz.Is Area 51 a hotbed of alien interaction? Does the government use Area 51 to perform shadowy tests of horrible future technology? What is happening behind those barbed wire fences and in those windowless rooms? Does Area 51 have anything do with Pier 1, and if so, how much for a nice indoor sectional?By examining the claims of conspiracy theorists, debunkers, and then rebunking with my own, I???ll attempt to answer these questions with further questions.The truth is out there. The hard part is getting it in here.- - -Conspiracy Claim: The fact that Area 51 does not appear on U.S. geological survey maps, the area above it is restricted airspace, and the public is not allowed anywhere near it proves something devious and sinister is happening there.Debunking Claim: ???Area 51??? is officially classified as Homey Airport, a United States Air Force property and any secrecy or restricted access is merely in line with that of a military facility.Rebunking Claim: With the insane lengths taken to remain hidden and keep most people from entering, Area 51???s true purpose is obvious: it???s where the government throws surprise birthday parties. The government balances out all of the bad things it does by surprising random citizens with an out of the blue birthday bonanza. One day you wake up on your birthday in a pitch black, unmarked airplane hangar. ???What? This isn???t the airplane hangar I went to sleep in last night,??? you say, then the lights flick on and there???s streamers, cake, and hundreds of government agents wishing you the happiest of birthdays. You spend the entire day playing games, opening presents, and being assured you didn???t die and go to heaven. Then, as the greatest day of your life dies down, you???re tucked back into bed by all of the Men In Black type agents, your memory of the day is erased by a Men In Black-type device, and you???re given a copy of a Men In Black-type movie as a final parting gift. It explains why everyone has a birthday we can???t remember and why we all have a DVD of that generic Men In Black movie.- -Conspiracy Claim: With many UFOs seen around the area, it???s obvious that Area 51 has direct ties to extraterrestrial activity, and accounts from former employees have stated that actual aliens have been in the compound.Debunking Claim: Declassified files have stated that experimental aircraft were tested at and around the facility, explaining any UFO sightings. Claims of extraterrestrial activity, let alone actual aliens being present at the facility, are completely unfounded and were never made by individuals who could prove they worked at Area 51.Rebunking Claim: Experimental aircraft testing was and continues to be a means of luring aliens to land at Area 51 and then forcing them to work as employees of the stat",100
275,"e. Strong government workers??? unions have made hiring humans extremely costly. However, labor laws conveniently don???t apply to aliens in the United States (in all other countries they do). This means instead of paying a human $50,000 a year with benefits, they can pay an alien a handful of raisins a year with benefits, namely the benefit to continue living as long as it keeps its damn alien mouth shut and works hard at Nevada???s Department of Building and Safety. E.T. phone home? No, E.T. phone homeowner to tell them they???re approved to build a pool.- -Conspiracy Claim: All major advancements in human technology from the past 50 years were ???created??? by reverse engineering alien spacecraft and artifacts at Area 51.Debunking Claim: The rise in technology has followed a logical progression without any ???other-worldly??? leaps. Plus, since Area 51 is supposedly a strictly American endeavor, the technological achievements of other countries, which are either equal or above that of America, cannot be explained.Rebunking Claim: If you think human technology alone created the Swiffer WetJet, you???re insane.- -Conspiracy Claim: Area 51 is the home to the Majestic 12, or MJ-12, a secret committee working to create a one-world government run by the human and alien elite.Debunking Claim: The FBI examined supposedly leaked government documents detailing the existence of the Majestic 12 and declared them to be ???completely bogus.??? No proof exists of any such organization.Rebunking Claim: The Majestic 12 exists, but, like all committees, is bogged down with so much bureaucracy that none of its plans for world domination ever get underway. Just to get a deathforce of alien-human hybrids synthesized requires a majority vote on what DNA, both alien and human, to use for said deathforce, a caucus determining the name of said deathforce, a budget hearing on the allocation of funds required to feed, house, and transport said deathforce, and a unanimous decision on said deathforce???s mascot and approved licensed merchandise. In addition, half of MJ-12 lives over 32 light years away from Area 51 and commute to work, so every meeting begins with a 5 hour long ???What has everyone been up to since we last met decades ago???? session, leaving little time for actual progress.- -Conspiracy Claim: Area 51???s alien research figured heavily in the movie Independence Day, a movie that is too good to not contain the truth.Debunking Claim: Independence Day only has a 6.9 on IMDB and a 59 on Metacritic, hence it is not that great of a movie and can contain fictional elements, such as Area 51???s involvement with aliens.Rebunking Claim: They don???t make sequels to movies that aren???t true.Needs glass of waterSpilled glass of waterNeeds shower temperature adjusted by imperceptible degreeScrubby thing stuck to faucetNeeds towel that is hanging approx. 15 inches awayItchy kneecaps require lotionNeeds help rubbing lotion into kneecapsToo much lotion on kneecaps!Kneecaps sting real badNeeds band-aidNot that band-aidAnnouncing need for or accomplishment of defecationWants you to watch stuffed dog being thrown into the airWants you to watch stuffed dog being punched in the faceWonders whether it hurts Godzilla???s feelings when he is attacked with planes and guns when all he wants is a snackWants a snackWonders what happens after deathWonders why someone spray-painted ???GOD IS DEAD??? on the side of that bridgeRequires concise introduction to existentialismRequires boxes of various sizesRequires hot glue gun for that goddamn balsa wood airplane you bought in LatviaJust making sure you???re still thereThis was the last straw.

I must purge myself of your ??? wait??? what???s that smell? Is that smoke?I gaze out the window of my third-floor apartment you so frequently visited and peer down to the dumpster with the same eyes I used to watch you with. It appears my letter fire has started a dumpster fire.

It spreads swiftly. Some elements, like women, are untamable.Smoke billows. Flames heighten. Will I lose my apartment???s security deposit? I will need that money back to buy that hoverboard I???ve had my eye on. How would I even explain this to someone? ???Hey, I went through a kind of weird break up, so I dramatically burnt some letters??? Yeah, I know I could???ve shredded them instead, but this felt more symbolic, you know????I remember that your dad is a volunteer firefighter in Key West. I remember all your stories. I remember our three months together vividly. Three wonderful, dumpster-fireless months. A whirlwind of emotion overcomes me. I fear I???ve lost you forever.My dumpster fire rages on.I resolve to put this out the old-fashioned way; I grab two cups and fill them up with water from my sink. Running up and down the stairs, I dump them out into the dumpster. Yet the flames don???t diminish. I still feel the heat against my skin. I still feel the ache in my heart.Then, I remember: My apartment building has a fire extinguisher in the lobby. I run down and grab it from the storage closet, race to the dumpster, and quickly spray over the conflagration with the power of a strong, virile orgasm.The fire is vanquished.The crisis is averted.Life, it continues.What an ordeal this was! But what now for me? I???ve emerged from the fire unscathed. What an apt metaphor for our time together: a fire that grew so quickly and burned so bright, only to be defeated with pragmatism. Our time together left scars on my heart and ash in my dumpster. It will always be with me.Life begins anew. I am new.I text you: LOL, YOU???LL NEVER GUESS WHAT JUST HAPPENED!!!Portrait by Kelly Bjork- - -Tabitha1 is a kempt woman with a wholesome face, straight brown hair, and no makeup. I meet her as she???s finishing her shift at a food bank. Primary colors decorate the lobby, and on the walls, shards from plastic food containers are patterned into artsy mosaics. Tabitha wears jeans with an earth-toned sweater, and she carries a bouquet of dark pink tulips some florist couldn???t sell and donated instead. When I ask her about her job, she talks about the many duties she maintains, including the mail-holding center, which is especially helpful for homeless people who are unable to collect their mail for months at a time. ???I???ve gotten to know a lot of them by their first and last names because of this service,??? she says happily.As our interview begins, I ask Tabitha to tell me about the shooting at the Twilight Exit. It was only the second time she???d ever been to the bar, she said. ???I was with Dave. It was kind of spontaneous. I hadn???t really b",100
276,"een planning on going there at all, actually. Earlier that day, I???d broken up with him over dinner. We???d gone out to eat at a Mexican place. We???d only dated a few months. Dave is a very sweet guy. But it was just time to let it go. He was cool about it. He asked if I wanted to go out that night and I decided I did, to show we could still have fun together and that I wanted us to stay friends,??? she said.Tabitha was seated in the dining area when the shot sounded by the entryway outside. ???We hadn???t been there very long at all. Dave had just gotten up to get drinks, so I was at a table by myself when it happened,??? she said. ???I didn???t see any action. I???d heard some shots and that was it. I didn???t think I was gonna die. Dave was a lot more freaked out than I was. He was closer. He saw more of it. He saw the guy with the gun. I don???t know if I really saw him. I don???t know if I really saw a gun,??? she said.???There was some feeling of panic as I flipped my table over. I???d crouched down behind it, for protection. In a situation like that, you don???t know if you???re gonna get shot yourself. Some patrons were yelling to get down. And then it seemed like we were able to get out. We started cruising out. I left everything behind. I just followed the people and tried to stay calm. In the circumstances I was relatively calm,??? she said.This wasn???t Tabitha???s first run-in with violent crime, as it happens. Some years ago, she was burglarized and held at gunpoint, she said. ???It was back when I was in college, 1992 or so. I lived in a shared house in Houston. I was in the living room, talking on the telephone with a friend, and one of my housemates came in with two guys. She was in college too. I thought they were friends of hers, so I didn???t pay them much attention. It turns out they???d held her up in our covered parking garage when she???d pulled up in her car. Her window was down, and one of them ducked in and held a gun to her head and said, ???Give me your money.??? There were two of them, they were working together. I guess they were originally gonna get in my roommate???s car and drive off somewhere with her. But she told them not to, she said she had money in the house, so they followed her inside. I was talking to my friend, and they all walked in right as I was saying goodbye. The guy had a gun, but I didn???t realize it. I was like damnit, why didn???t I notice that. I could???ve whispered to my friend to call the police right before I hung up,??? she said.???They were Asian men. They might???ve been Vietnamese. My housemate was Korean. A very beautiful Korean woman. I immediately thought she was being targeted because of her race, but I don???t really know. The guys were hopped up on drugs. That might???ve had do with it too. They were acting super high, super agitated,??? she said.???One guy was pretty short. We stood eye to eye. He was fit. Very muscular.  He was in his late 20s or early 30s. He got in my face and said, ???Give me all your money, or I???ll fucking kill you.??? I think at that moment his buddy had the gun. It was a shotgun. I had anxiety rising in my chest, but I stayed really calm. Overall I stayed really calm. They went through our house. They gathered our valuables. What little we had, anyway. We didn???t have much money. We were all young and broke. My roommate told them she???d take them to her bank, so she could withdraw money for them. Then she left with one of the guys. They drove off to the bank together. The other stayed with the gun,??? she said. ???Somehow, he ended up being at our house for an hour.??????At first, it was just me at home, and another female housemate. She was in bed when they first came in. She???d been up late working on a project the night before. She was an architecture student. I had to get her up. He had us sitting in the living room. We were just sitting on the floor. The gun was across his lap. In the middle of the whole ordeal one of our other housemates, a guy, came home. And he had to sit down too,??? said Tabitha. ???There was one more housemate who didn???t come home and missed the whole thing.??????I don???t know why, but I had this instinct the gun wasn???t loaded. I remember I was just wishing so hard that my psychic powers were more developed, and that I could communicate a coordinated attack with my housemates so we could overpower the guy,??? she said, kind of joking, but kind of not. ???Obviously that didn???t happen, and it???s probably for the best, even if the gun wasn???t loaded,??? she added.???It got to a point where I was sort of back-talking him. He lit up a cigarette. I was like, can you please not smoke. I had an exam in differential equations the next morning, I remember. I wanted to go to the bathroom,??? said Tabitha. ???Eventually our roommate came home from the bank with the other guy and then both guys left, and then it was over.???Tabitha???s story ends as abruptly as it began. ???My roommate had withdrawn the cash, and the guy took it. I don???t know how much. She was broke too. She couldn???t have had more than a couple hundred dollars. We filed a police report after, but nothing happened. Since they???d gone to an ATM, there should???ve been footage. If the police would???ve put it high on their list, maybe they would???ve found them. I don???t think they ever really tried. We weren???t their priority because we didn???t live in a rich neighborhood.???Tabitha stays practical and upbeat as she???s speaking, even when distressing stuff comes up. I ask if her experiences from the burglary steepened any terror she might???ve felt at the Twilight. ???I don???t think that night was super traumatic to me. I was able to get back to normal afterwards. It was definitely a big deal as it was happening. But I have a protective impulse. I kept some separation from it all,??? she says. She mentions how the Twilight shooting had occurred alongside a couple other unrelated yet deeply challenging hardships in Tabitha???s life. As she describes them to me, her tone is consistent. We talk about moving forward. ???I like feeling confident every day and putting that energy out. It???s not like I???m clueless or that I don???t think someone would jump me. It???s more like: I???m not a worrier. I don???t want that feeling pervading. I choose to not live in fear,??? she says.- - -1  Not her real name, per her request.I know I am new to this gang, chaps, and most of you don???t know me, but sometimes it takes an outsider with fresh eyes to see what???s really going on. And what I see here is you lot being taken for a ride. Fagin can???t rip you off like this anymore, chaps. This is labor abuse, plain and simple and it WILL NOT stand. There is power in numbers, and we have it. The ball is in our court, chaps. We have demands and we will have them met! We will all have second helpings of gruel! Do you hear that? Every single one of us. With salt and a side crust of bread too! When we steal a wallet or a pocket watch, we won???t have to turn it over and never see a penny. No, siree, no. We will get a fixed percentage of everything we steal. Learn that chaps, fixed percentage! And when he asks us to work into the morning after a long night of stealing, well, gentlemen, I am about to introduce a concept that will blow your minds-overtime. That???s right, we get paid extra, for working extra. Otherwise, we strike. No more pickpocketing. Just think what this city would be without adorable half-starved orphans robbing you blind.

We ARE London. And we deserve better. Better hours, better food, better beds and better pay! So who is with me? Unionize and from now on, when you ask, ???Please, sir, I want some more,??? the answer will always be YES!To whom it may concern,Thank you for considering me for the position of [most likely a board member] at [a foundation that advocates for charter schools or something similar]. It is truly humbling to be given the opportunity. I learned about this job from [probably my brother or father].  I believe the skills I nurtured during my run for President [damnit!] will make me a successful member of your team.During that run, I saw firsthand how to persevere through setbacks. Whether it was the ridiculousness of my campaign slogan [!], or the college student who made clear I did not understand ISIS, or my inability to take down a field of weak and insane candidates, or my comments about Supergirl being ???hot,??? or saying I would still invade Iraq knowing what I know now, or asking a quiet crowd to ???please clap??? for me, or tweeting a photo of a gun with my name engraved on it, or my poor debate performances, I just kept campaigning without changing my stances.In those moments, many people asked or demanded: ???Jeb, please improve???; ""Jeb, please change your direction ??? you came in the clear front runner and are losing???; ???Jeb, think before you speak!??? And through all of those hardships, I stayed the course. I will do the same as your [you don???t think I???d have to be a political consultant or something, right?] That is the kind of unwavering leadership, determined to do something I have stuck in my head no matter the consequences, I can bring to your [please God be a foundation with a name people recognize]. That mindset is what got me into the race in the first place [how was that painting dolt President before me?]. That???s Jeb.I have been this kind of leader for most of my career. My experience in Florida as Governor [should I even put this in? People seemed to not care during the race] has given me the skills to galvanize varied stakeholders around new ideas [well, thirteen years ago, when I last ran for office and people liked my ideas], promote economic growth [during a period of steady rise before the 2008 recession], and proficiency in the Microsoft Office Suite [especially Outlook].Additionally, I can bring my many connections to any task sent my way. After using loopholes and spending six months gathering exorbitant amounts of money, I have met and interacted with many of the most wealthy and powerful members of the United States of America. [They probably won???t be mad if I ask for another favor, but I???ll send a few emails to check on this before I apply for stuff]. My Rolodex will be at your disposal.Most importantly, the prospect of [being something that???s not President] excites me. I have always wanted to [lose a primary I clearly should have won]. To be intellectually engaged in [not being the most powerful person in the world] and [not being someone the entire world knows] is a dream. I feel lucky to potentially [sit around a Thanksgiving table and see my father, President, my brother, President, and myself, only a Governor and of Florida].I am confident that in the position of [at least not making lousy paintings] I can excel. Thank you for considering me.I also speak fluent Spanish.Sincerely,John Ellis ???Jeb??? Bush- - -Jes??s Castillo was born in Mexico, moving to California with his parents and sister in the late nineties. In 2009, he graduated from the University of California-San Diego where he studied literature and writing. Castillo helped organize ???Lectric Collective, an art and poetry collaboration in the Bay Area, and he was a founding editor of Vertebrae. He has lived in Oceanside, La Jolla, Oakland, San Francisco, and Iowa City, where he received an MFA in poetry from the University of Iowa.Castillo recently spoke over email with McSweeney???s editors Dominic Luxford and Jesse Nathan about his first book, Remains, the tenth collection in the McSweeney???s Poetry Series.- - -McSWEENEY???S: Who are you writing for?JES??S CASTILLO: I guess I imagine I???m writing for someone like myself: someone who needs solitude from time to time to stay sane. Who lives in the fragmented flux of the post-industrial, computerized world, and takes comfort and nourishment from books.McSWEENEY???S: How did the form for Remains develop?CASTILLO: When I was twenty-three, I read Ron Silliman for the first time, and that???s also when I read Ben Lerner???s elegant and instructive Mean Free Path. The way Silliman and Lerner used the book (each in distinct ways) as the measure for structuring a poem was really exciting to me, and it made me want to write a book-length poem. I was excited by the idea of finding a form that could sustain its momentum for a long time and contain potentially any subject. The serial structure seemed ideal, a long poem that advanced via self-sustaining sections that complemented each other.I came about the poem???s actual form, which is fairly simple, sort of by chance. I guess the interesting part is that I wrote the poem on index cards. For the two years that I spent writing it, I carried a stack of twenty or so index cards wherever I went, and whenever I saw, read, or experienced something that made me think of a line, I would take out a card and fill it out, usually in one go, writing intuitively without stopping until the card was filled. Each card constituted a section. Writing on index cards meant I could carry my materials easily wherever I went. I wrote plenty of sections sitting at a desk or a table, but I also wrote many in transit, at parties, on walks, and so on. With the index cards taking care of the poem???s formal unity, I was free to just focus on filling them out. And because the cards weren???t bound, I could more easily think of each as its own separate entity or field, its own small world. And so I felt free to experiment within each one, to try out different modes of voice and formal tricks, trusting they were all part of the same poem, the same book.I came across Jack Spicer???s lectures when I was about half way through writing Remains. I like his description of the serial poem as a poem that could virtually go on forever, or until the poet dies or gets sick of writing the poem. I think another thing that ends a potentially endless poem is when the feeling that engendered the poem ends or changes, in other words when the poet???s worldview changes significantly from the one he had when he started the poem. Then it is no longer the same poem. I think that???s more or less what happened with Remains. Had I stayed the same person, retained the way of seeing the world that I had when I started writing the poem, I might???ve kept going with it, but that didn???t happen. Maybe there is a way to build into a long poem the ability to evolve, so it can live and stay the same poem even as significant changes in its worldview occur. Or maybe you just need an expansive enough external structure that can contain multiple such changes within it. You can do it with a large enough narrative concept of course, but to do it without relying on narrative is a different feat.McSWEENEY???S: Do you read a lot of p",100
278,"oetry?CASTILLO: When I was writing Remains, I was reading a lot of poetry. Right now, not so much. I don???t think it???s necessarily good to always be reading a lot of poetry though. I think even if you???re writing poetry, it???s good to read variously, not just poetry and literature. There are times for me when reading poetry feels important and necessary, like when I???m looking to learn or steal from other poets, for example, or when I want to read something that will refocus me and make me feel more present in the world, but sometimes other kinds of reading are more pressing or interesting. Or life is more pressing, and reading superfluous.McSWEENEY???S: The style seems plainspoken. Is that accurate, do you think? And if so, how did you arrive at it?CASTILLO: I think to a degree, that???s accurate, yeah, though there are many parts in the book that don???t sound to me like plainspoken language. It was all probably mostly unconscious. A friend once said to me that poets must use the language of their socialization. I think there???s a lot of truth to that. I wrote Remains in the style that felt most natural to me. In other words, a style I didn???t think about or make much of an effort to create. One reason I don???t like a lot of contemporary poetry is that I find it too solipsistic and cryptic. My only conscious stylistic goal has always been to not write like that. The subject matter and context of a line can be mysterious, but the feelings in it, the intentions behind it (multiple and contradictory though they may be) should be clear.McSWEENEY???S: How connected to Mexico do you feel?CASTILLO: I feel very connected to Mexico, but also disconnected from it in many ways. I also feel very connected to the United States, and disconnected from it in many ways as well. I imagine this is how a lot of people who were transplanted at a young age to another country feel. Mexico is my birthplace and my childhood, and the U.S. is where I???ve spent my adolescence and young adulthood. Some of the values and attitudes inherent in Mexico???s deeply Catholic working-class culture are imbedded in me. Mind you, I???m an atheist. My parents tried different churches when I was very young, but they quit trying after being disillusioned by all of them, and I wasn???t really raised to believe in religion or God. But even if you???re not religious, if you grow up working-class in Mexico, these Catholic values are in you because they are in the culture. I don???t like some of these values, and I???m trying to get rid of their influence still. The reverence for suffering, meekness, and humility, for example, is something imbedded in Mexican culture that I think can be toxic. But there are many aspects of Mexican culture that seem really healthy to me, i.e. its warmth and liveliness, the sense of community. Mexican families are more connected. The U.S. is sterile and cold compared to Mexico. Death is more graphically present in Mexico???s public imaginarium, while in the U.S. death is more abstract, depicted from a greater distance in the media, best not talked about in conversations. I???ve kept this awareness of death, but I think I lost some of the culture???s warmth after I moved to the States. I also lost some of my sense of connectedness to my extended family. I???ve kept Mexico???s fatalistic streak, which feels truer to me than the triumphalist narrative that has often informed Americans??? attitude towards the world. The history of Mexico-U.S. relations is obviously incredibly complicated. It???s one of exploitation and co-dependency, and I feel very much a product of the two countries.McSWEENEY???S: Do you ever write poems in Spanish?CASTILLO: I???ve written a few, yeah. They???re different. I was eleven when I moved permanently to the U.S. Since then, English has been my most exercised language. Because I???m less agile in Spanish, the poems I???ve written with it until now are simpler, but they also feel lusher to me. Rosario Ferr??, the excellent Puerto Rican poet who studied in the U.S. and chose to write poetry primarily in Spanish, has written some beautiful poems about the two languages.

Andrew CoombsSenior CounselThe Walt Disney CompanyEnclosure (Poison Apple)In my childhood household, there were Bad Words and there were Never Ever Words. ???Bitch??? was a Bad Word. ???Bomb??? was a Never Ever Word.It was in the delightful company of many other Never Evers. Some were names (Al-Qaeda), others were numbers (9/11), and others were terrifying nine-letter classifications (???extremist,??? ???terrorist???).You could call the world they occupy Never Ever Land. It is a world where Muslim children grow up almost instantly; where a hush-hush culture is perpetuated; where a ???they might come for us??? mentality is underlying. It is a world where a politician???s Islamophobic comments prompt renewed fears of deportation, where twin towers crash down again and again in a loop cycle.I do not remember 9/11, but I do remember Musa.Before he was deported, Musa ran a small Islamic clothing store in my neighborhood. He wore soft leather slippers and strong musk perfume, and whenever my dad and I visited him he asked me: Where is Allah? I always pointed to the sky in response, and he always rewarded my considerable knowledge with Ritz crackers.My parents heard that they came for him at dawn. Seized his store with all of its jilbabs and headscarves and prayer beads and Ritz crackers, my Ritz crackers. (Where are you, now?)I do not remember 9/11, but I do remember all the moments of silence.After one of them, my fifth grade teacher recounted how the smoke had been visible from the very windows where we sat, how the father of one of her own students had been stuck in the towers. She said we were the last generation who, scientifically speaking, had a chance of remembering the events.I took this to mean that my classmates and I made up the tangible periphery of the dark 9/11 era: beyond us, there would be no more.As distance grew between daily life and the events of 9/11, my parents did become more forgiving of Never Ever rule violations. They attempted to implement an Only-In-The-House rule. Like burping aloud, or eating while standing up, talking about terrorism or Islamophobia or suicide bombings was ill-mannered and unsettling. When dinner conversations crossed the line, my mom would interrupt me sharply ??? you don???t talk about stuff like this outside, right? ??? and I would nod unconvincingly.They were afraid that someone would get the wrong idea, the kind of idea that got you sent away at dawn.There are two sides to the post 9/11 us-against-the-world mentality. Muslims may be deemed suspect pretty hastily, but non-Muslims may be taken for ignorant Islamophobes just as quickly. I???ve experienced both ends, but it???s the latter that I am personally afraid of.It is difficult to be a minority, but to be a minority in defense mode all the time, burdened by the perceived suspicion of those that mill around you day after day ??? this is tragic. And while this paranoia in the Muslim-American community has largely decreased ??? there was a time after 9/11 that my parents and neighbors couldn???t even leave their homes, much less go to work ??? it still rears its head once in awhile.This phenomenon has become symbolized by The Olive Garden Incident.The Incident began as a typical family outing. My dad was retelling the same stories about working as a waiter when he first came to America. My mom was preaching about the danger that carbohydrates ??? specifically, Olive Garden breadsticks ??? posed to society. My younger sister was begging me to guess how many likes her latest Instagram post had gained in the past 24 hours. (Not a lot of likes.)Soon into the evening, my dad asked one of the waiters for a fork. About a quarter hour later, the waiter still hadn???t arrived. My dad grew increasingly restless, swiveling his head around every so often to look for him.Now, if it had been up to me, the waiter would have returned to our table at around this time. Belated fork in hand, bemused smile on his lips, he would have said: ???Well, I suppose you don???t need this anymore.??? We would have laughed, shared a few more teasing exchanges, and called it a night.In actuality, the waiter never came back.And in no time at all, my dad was surrounded by the manager and several other waiters, in the throes of a rant so intense it could???ve been scripted for reality television: The waiter had looked at us wrong, had purposely avoided our table and withheld our fork, and it had definitely been motivated by Islamophobia ???It was one of those passing moments where every detail seems either extraordinarily right or extraordinarily wrong, permeated with an emotion so singular and overwhelming it feels as if you are recalling a memory rather than experiencing the present.I hated that the manager???s expression ??? sugary, doe eyed, positively stricken ??? was another ruse my dad could not or would not recognize. I was revolted by the way my dad fumbled simple English words in his great urgency, by the way my classmates would perceive him if they were present. I hated that my parents had thought taking us to Olive Garden was a treat, that no one had ever informed them otherwise, that I had ordered eggplant parmesan. Even the cheap little dessert menus in the corner of our booth seemed like caricatures of our particular brand of pathetic.Because when all was said and done, The Incident still wasn???t atypical. I couldn???t/can???t distance myself from the event any more than I can cease physically resembling my dad. I couldn???t/can???t say that his behavior was incomprehensible or bizarre or even singular.The Incident has happened before and it is bound to happen again, although its form may be different: my dad???s suspect may be a constantly standoffish neighbor, or a teacher that once graded me poorly.In this regard my parents, and especially my dad, still linger in Never Ever Land.Perhaps Never Ever Land hasn???t faded over the years so much as retreated into a deeper place of vague irrationality. The perceived threat may be a politician that accuses us of celebrating 9/11.  It may be the veiled motives behind the delivery of a singular fork. Everything must be carefully questioned, approached with a dual consciousness.And so I can???t help but think that Obama???s recent speech at the Baltimore mosque ??? a response to ???inexcusable political rhetoric against Muslim-Americans??? ??? is too little too late.After all, this aforementioned political rhetoric is what reminded me of 9/11 and my parents??? atte",100

Despite my best efforts to adopt the seeming effortlessness of my peers, to write-off my father as out of touch or overly paranoid, the realities of this election have called the most sensitive parts of my identity into question.In a matter of months, after the cutoff for this particular election, I will officially be of voting age.

Though the Devil???s Workshop was once founded on the work of idle hands, it has come to our attention that this practice has become outdated and ineffective. The Prince of Darkness feels he has been left with no choice but to modernize immediately.We can no longer ignore the facts: Human non-productivity is at an all-time high, and our soul acquisition rate is at an all-time low. Right after The Fall, when we were just starting out, all we had to do was target standard perpetrators of idle behavior: male gamblers and drinkers. They were guaranteed to bring ruin upon their entire families, giving us a three-for-one soul profit. Now, with the advancement of women???s rights, wives can just leave these men and take the kids with them. That brings our soul acquisition down by more than half. Female equality was never factored into our original business model.Then, there???s the plague of modern emergency infrastructure. It used to be that we could just encourage a man to do nothing as his neighbor???s house burned down or a stranger was mugged. His idle hands would become our beautiful instruments of callous apathy. Now, an automated fire alarm calls the fire department and a police helicopter stops the mugging. The last time we saw this kind of advanced social structure was during the Roman Empire ??? and they were on our side.There was even a time when just sitting there not thinking of anything at all could lead to the actualization of an evil thought or an unclean impulse in a victim. We really thought the Internet was going to be our big break into that sector. YouTube was supposed to be the end of Man, but all of our projections were wrong. In the digital age, even when people aren???t doing anything, they???re still doing something. Their minds aren???t blank for a single goddamn second. Modern man cures his boredom with cat videos and online shoe-shopping instead of dabbling in witchcraft or planning a weekend B&E.Even those truly dark souls we used to rely on as our bread and butter are getting sidetracked by the advent of violent video games and virtual reality glasses. They can sit around beating hookers and murdering gang members to their blackened heart???s content without so much as leaving the house. There???s no repercussions with the law, no clean up??? we just can???t compete with that kind of user experience.So, my fellow demons, it is with a heavy heart that I have to say, idle hands are no longer the Devil???s weapon. Should you be let go in the coming days due to restructuring, we urge you to seek alternative employment immediately and not contribute further to our idleness issue. We???ve heard God has some openings and Jesus can be very forgiving.Sincerely,MGMT1.  I will abolish the IRS!2.  I will abolish homework!3.  I will sign a full repeal of Obamacare!4.

The Mom Team was meeting with your Auntie Jackie for coffee yesterday and she mentioned that her co-worker???s son, Andy, wants to get into the TV industry.Andy was previously a McDonald???s All-American basketball player. That is, until he suffered a devastating knee injury. Now his career prospects are just like his ACL: torn. He???s trying to create a new path, and he needs your help.The Mom Team knows you???ve interned on many TV shows and short films, and we have a question for you.Will you meet with Andy for a coffee to tell him about the TV industry?He doesn???t know exactly what he wants to do in TV, but inspired by a recent Michael Bay marathon, he decided that he couldn???t imagine himself in any other industry, except maybe Wall Street. The Mom Team thinks he could be successful, especially since he already has his own idea for a film. The Mom Team cannot remember the exact plot, but his pitch was ???the Fast and the Furious, but on Mars.???I???m sure he???d love to tell you all about it.Click here to receive Andy???s email address and Instagram account (which has 2,000 more followers than yours) so you can get in contact today.Thanks for making this possible,Mom, for the Mom TeamP.S.

Do not say anything else ??? even if it would be fulfilling to say it all out loud ??? and smile.If you???re a white man like me, you???ve been hearing the same question a lot lately: ???How may I help you, sir???? It???s a great question, and yes you do have my permission to help me. I???ll take those shoes, and that phone-watch, and North Carolina???s 4th Congressional District. But men like me have also been hearing another question: ???You need to check your privilege.??? Which I???d like to point out is not actually a question. Now as a white man my natural response to non-questions is to get sarcastic and ask to see somebody???s manager. Which I did. And it turns out I was their manager. So I sat down for a long meeting with myself, and came to one conclusion. I do need to check my privilege. Because what if I???ve lost it?I can???t imagine life without my white male privilege. Literally, my mind cannot conceive of what that would be like. And I???ve got a really good imagination. Ask me to imagine a half-man, half-zebra dressed like a half-woman/half-lion. No problem, already done. I can even see how the fake fur of his yarn lion-mane gets tangled in the real fur of his zebra pelt. And just for extra credit, I imagined he was on the beach eating a blue steak, a color no real steak has ever been. So let???s not kid ourselves, my imagination is probably in the top seven or eight imaginations of all time. If I can???t imagine life without my privilege, then it???s probably outside the realm of human thought, like string theory or the rules for frequent-flier mileage.If my privilege was missing, I needed to know right away. Taking a few days off from work (I???ll tell them I was sick or had a family thing or something ??? if my boss/dad???s college roommate even asks me), I checked the status of my white male privilege in a variety of situations.WorkplaceJoining an all-hands staff meeting a half-hour late, I immediately take control of the room through constant interruptions, derisive snorts, and loudly slurping two-dozen chilled oysters. When the meeting breaks, I am taken aside and told I have management potential. The fact that I don???t work there is never brought up.Privilege: IntactShoppingArriving five minutes after the posted closing time at my local Best Buy, I interrupt a female sales associate while she rings up someone else and deliver a nearly hour-long lecture on which Blu-Ray player is best for watching streaming HD video of college lacrosse games. She and her non-white customer listen patiently, nodding their heads meaningfully at some of my stronger points. Leaving without buying anything, I am offered membership in their Preferred Purchasers Discount Club and handed a complimentary bag of 80??? flat-screen televisions.Privilege: AcceptableDrivingSpend two hours circling an elementary school at high speed while announcing, ???I have a bomb??? through a bullhorn. Asked to pull over by a police officer, I roll down my window and take a swipe at him with a machete. The officer immediately hands me a beer and asks if I think the Mets have a shot at a series win. We bond over our shared love of pornography and cargo shorts. Not once during this interaction am I shot to death.Privilege: StandardPublic TransportationSqueezing into a packed subway car, I lie across the laps of four elderly Chinese women and deliver a speech about modern America???s crippling lack of respect for the one true male caucasian heterosexual god. Upon reaching my stop I learn I am leading the Republican presidential field by twenty-seven points.Privilege: As ExpectedChecking my privilege was an incredibly eye-opening experience. For far too long I???d failed to see how much easier life was for me as a white male. I won???t make that mistake again. From now on I will cherish and rejoice in how much easier life is for me as a white male. Thanks to the world???s urging, I finally checked my privilege. It turns out my privilege is awesome.You get three weeks of vacation a year if you???re lucky. One gets chewed up by the holiday season and one goes to the musical festival, Renaissance faire or erotica convention of your choosing. A few days get burned off visiting the alcoholic codependents of your spouse or significant other. That leaves one long weekend a year to better yourself by visiting a presidential site.How on earth can you choose? Only Zachary Taylor is lacking an accessible home (it???s now a private residence), and if you???re willing to risk being shot by the Louisville, Ky., police, you can even see that. Your civic journey could take you almost anywhere.Fortunately for you, I???ve done the scouting. I???ve been to every presidential grave, most of the birthplaces and homes, and the Quayle Vice Presidential Learning Center. I love them all, but I also know where you???ll get the most bang for your presidential vacation buck. You want Plymouth Notch, Vermont.Calvin Coolidge was a Republican governor from Massachusetts, but he came into the world on July 4, 1872, in a room behind ",100
283,"a general store in the Notch. Then as now, Vermont was the quaintness capital of America, with quilts on every bed and fine fruit preserves on tap. John Calvin Coolidge Sr. was the town???s civic linchpin, serving as the town jailer, notary, general store owner, postmaster, hairdresser, confessor and pilates instructor. He was also a dairy farmer, and a partner in the cheese factory.The point is, the man and the town were stoically self-sufficient, and from those roots sprang our stoically self-sufficient 30th president. Coolidge Jr. returned to the Notch when he wanted to relax. As vice president, he was there in 1923 when Warren Harding realized his limitations by dying. At 2:47 a.m. on August 3, Coolidge took the oath of office in the living room of his dad???s house. The oath was administered by his dad ??? as a notary, he was the only one qualified to do it.Coolidge came back to the Notch during his presidency. He needed some down time in 1924, after an infection suddenly killed his son. For a few weeks that summer, the country was run from a makeshift office above the town???s gas station / general store.Somewhere around 1935, someone got the bright idea to essentially laminate the whole town. When you visit today, the main street is pretty close to its 1930s look; there???s the general store, the church, the Coolidge farm house and a (totally functional) cheese factory. The oath-of-office living room is the same.  If you???re lucky, you???ll get stoic and crusty guides on porch rocking chairs who also date from the 1930s. The whole thing is stunningly sincere, right down to Coolidge???s humble marker in the nearby cemetery.Even if you don???t know much about Coolidge, walking around Plymouth Notch for an hour can help you understand him ??? the town is like a cultural park for old-fashioned conservatism. Plus, it has a cheese factory.  On the off chance you???re lactose intolerant, don???t worry about it. You???re still in Vermont. Throw a rock from the parking lot and you???re going to hit either a brewery or a stoic New England pot dealer.If quaint isn???t your style ??? or if you vomit in your mouth at the thought of entering a Republican home ??? then you want to visit Hyde Park. Drive up the Hudson from New York City. If you reach the Vanderbilt place, you???ve gone too far.The guy who devised the New Deal didn???t have it so bad under the old deal. The Roosevelts were obscenely rich ??? you can make a nice living off inheritance, investments, shipping and opium dealing in the Orient, if you don???t mind the hours. The Roosevelts probably could have ended the Depression with the proceeds from a yard sale.FDR was born in 1882 at Springwood, the 20,000 square-foot mansion on the Hyde Park estate. By the time he died, the place was entirely his own: The walls were decked out with nautical prints (he was a boating freak), the display cabinets were stuffed with the stuffed birds of his youth (he was a taxidermy freak), and Eleanor was often in her own home down the road, probably because FDR cheated on her mercilessly (he was a freak, period).Some smart guy said Mount Vernon is the autobiography Washington never wrote. Hyde Park is the trashy Fox drama FDR never starred in. Springwood was technically his mom???s house until he was well into adulthood. (And make no mistake, FDR was a momma???s boy. His mother basically raised his children and humiliated his wife.) The social areas of the house were arranged for deception ??? FDR could hide his polio from visitors by stage-managing the flow of guests and carefully orchestrating his entrances and exits.Then there???s Top Cottage. Springwood was FDR???s home, but the mansion did not offer an escape from public life. When FDR wanted privacy ??? of the kind you can???t get at a vacation mansion in Maine or the Georgia bungalow where you take your mistress ??? he went to a handicapped-accessible bachelor pad of his own design, just through the forest. Not far away from Top Cottage is Val-Kill ??? Eleanor???s home, which started as a cottage for her and two of her lady friends. Cough, cough. You can understand why the five Roosevelt kids had something like 15 divorces. Thanksgiving couldn???t have been relaxing at the Roosevelt household.Hyde Park is dripping with personality and probably a couple of other things; since its residents reshaped the course of Western civilization, you???re gonna find something to like.If neither of my favorite sites gets your pulse racing, come to Washington, bring some comfortable shoes, and try to hop the White House fence. It???s the most memorable presidential site visit possible, guaranteed. Assuming the taser doesn???t affect your memory.- - -Join Chris White in the search for the funniest president!

Like many of my fellow temporary instructors, my classes are stacked back-to-back. I???ll teach four classes in a row, or I???ll teach five in a row, with only a ten or fifteen minute passing period, often with longer classes later in the day, so there???s reverse momentum as I become more harried. In the time between classes, I need to walk from one building to another. I need to use the restroom and stand in line to drink from a water fountain as the student-person in front of me slowly fills a quart-sized container. There???s a computer at the front of the class, which I need to boot up. Students filter in, some want to talk to me, and after the class is over, some linger to talk again. I get no downtime and am supposed to always be ???on.??? I need to act interested in whatever the student-person is saying. I have to nod my head and make utterances of agreement. Often the student will expect me to provide something more complicated than our brief exchange will allow, and I???ll tell them to email me for an appointment to meet in my office. They want to know about grades, they want me to feed them a nutshell version of a class they missed or an upcoming assignment, and they want me to tell them it???s okay to miss a class.I have no problem with any of that, though today I???m unable to conceal my impatience as a dialogue with a student becomes a monologue and the student tells me much too much about an upcoming extra-curricular event, to take place in another state. He presents me with an official-looking letter from the extra-curricular club???s president to back up his claim. I know how to be polite as my opportunity to go to the bathroom slips away. And I can smile and nod as I???m told about something I can hardly muster a whit of interest in. It???s nothing personal. I like the student. I???m glad for the student. But class will go on without him, he won???t be missed, and though some teacher-persons do concern themselves with formal letters and they parse out excused from unexcused absences, I don???t need to see his letter.At the end of this particular class, the student is both excited and anxious. I think he???s afraid I???ll tell him he won???t be excused, because the letter describes an event that isn???t university-sponsored, and we both know it.I pause and look up at him after scanning the letter. ???You play quidditch???????Our team is really good,??? he says. ???We have a shot at nationals.??????You run around on brooms???????None of us can fly,??? he says. ???So we run with brooms.??????Like hobby-horses???????It???s a team-sport. It???s intense.??????Pretend-polo???????There",100
284," are balls. There are rules.???And now, despite myself, I???m drawn in. I don???t care that young people play a sport derived from a children???s book, but my natural curiosity leads me to questions, and the student-person is nonplussed, not at all embarrassed. I think he thinks that because I???m an English teacher I???m supposed to be a fan of anything book-related. I don???t tell him this, because it wouldn???t be appropriate, but I smack-talk Harry Potter in writing workshops. Inevitably, young people will want to talk about these books, which they grew up on and I haven???t read, and which I will not read, and which I shouldn???t be made to feel like I need to read. English professors read heaps of books, including books they didn???t want to read but felt they had to, though Harry Potter doesn???t fulfill that criteria for me. And when I tell creative writing workshops this, I tell it to illustrate the pitfalls of genre writing. Go ahead and write about witchy children at boarding school if you want, as long as you understand that there will always be more readers not interested in what you are doing than inclined to want to play along. This is true of any genre, including, and maybe even especially, literary realism. When I say, ???I would never willingly read this book because the premise is easy, and frankly, dumb,??? mine is a perfectly legitimate critique of a story, and no one should enter into genre writing without understanding that many readers won???t respond well to work they find the underlying broad strokes of ??? say, a boarding school for witchy children ??? to be stupid.And so, because I???ve got a human being in front of me who I want to understand and whose choices I would like to respect, I won???t stand in line at a drinking fountain before my next class, and I may even be late, because I need a glimpse of what makes running around on brooms fun instead of stupid, or if stupid, stupid but worthwhile, or stupid but exciting, or stupid, but way better than attending my class.???I feel like I???ve seen pictures,??? I say. ???Are there hula hoops???????Yes! There are three hoops on each side of the field that you throw the quaffle through. You put the quaffle through the hoop to score.??????A quaffle is a ball???????It???s a volleyball. But no one calls it that.??????And throwing the quaffle through the hoop???? I have a feeling this isn???t just one point.??????It???s ten!??????Well that???s better than one, isn???t it???????And there are more balls. Dodgeballs are bludgers. They???re used for defense. If you hit someone with a bludger they get knocked off their broom and have to touch a hoop before they can return to play.??????If this game were real,??? I say, ???someone might fall to his death.??????Or hers.??????It???s coed????We aren???t Muggles. No offense. We don???t recognize gender binaries.??????It???s a non-contact sport???????There???s contact. But not like rugby.??????You mean football??????????Football??? could mean ???soccer???.??????Only to an anglophile.??????I know that word,??? he says, ???but I???m not remembering it.??????Someone who loves England and all things English.??????Harry Potter isn???t just English.??????It???s very English.??????There are quidditch tournaments all over the world,??? he says.???There are anglophiles all over the world as well,??? I say, ???as a side effect of empire. I???m afraid I still don???t understand your game. How do you win???????This is the exciting part. There???s a snitch-runner who has a tennis ball in a sock, the ???snitch,??? that hangs from the back of his shorts like a tail. The seekers chase after him and try to grab the snitch from his shorts.??????Or her shorts???????Yes, well, the snitch-runner is usually a guy.??????Because you wouldn???t want seekers grabbing at a lady???s shorts.??????Basically, the snitch-runner needs to run really fast.??????And when someone grabs the snitch???????The game is over and the team who snatched the snitch gets thirty points.??????That might not take long.??????Oh, but it does,??? he says. ???The snitch-runners are really good.??????Are you a snitch-runner???????I???m a beater.??????I don???t believe we covered that.??????Beaters throw bludgers at chasers to knock them off their brooms, especially if they have the quaffle.??????Okay,??? I say, ???let me see if I???ve got this straight: half the team is playing dodgeball, while another half plays pretend-polo. Meanwhile there are folks running around trying to catch a tail. Is that it???????Kind of. There are also goalies.??????But they???re not called goalies???????They???re ???keepers???.??????Because calling them ???goalies??? would be too Muggle???????Everything contributes to the illusion that we???re a magical team of flying quidditchers,??? he says. ???And that???s the best part.??????Better than winning???????Winning is nice. Will I be excused from class Friday or not???????The attendance policy is on the syllabus.??????Which is??????????You can miss five classes. I don???t care for what. Nationals. World Cup. Sleeping in. Whatever.??????Great,??? he says. ???I???ve only missed, like, one.??????Some things are more important than school,??? I say, ???and I don???t really need to know your business.??????I wanted you to know.??????May you bludgeon many beaters and snitch many tails.??????I???m the beater. I bludgeon chasers. And I don???t play for the snitch. I???m not a seeker.??????Oh, but you are.???Chocolates. Wine. Romance. These are common elements of modern Valentine???s Day, but they???re a far cry from the holiday???s origins more than 2,000 years ago, when the holiday was first marked as a festival of breaking up with long-term boyfriends.What we know as Valentine???s Day was celebrated by ancient pagans after the midwinter festival of Imbolc. The ???Galenalia??? festival was dedicated to Minerva, Roman goddess of wisdom, trade, and recognizing that being single is better than staying with a dead-end guy.The worst of the winter had passed and women no longer needed to rely on a man as a source of life saving body heat at night. Mothers and daughters would gather their boyfriends??? animal pelts, set them on fire, and feast on winter squashes and root vegetables until the fires burned out.Thanks to the writings of Catallus and other Latin poets of the late Roman Republic, we know that women would celebrate Galenalia by leaving their homes for weeks at a time, traveling together on ???gal-cations,??? apparent sojourns in search of spiritual renewal following the death of old relationships. To the north, Iron Age Celts placed bouquets of flowers on the graves of sacrificed boyfriends.In the 4th Century A.D., right when Christianity was starting to heat up, Pope Julius I sought to establish a new holy day to memorialize not one but several saints named Valentinus who were all brutally martyred in different, inspiring ways. He wisely chose to adopt and absorb the traditions of Galenalia as part of the new feast day, assigned to February 14th on the Julian calendar. This resulted in the short-lived transition holiday ???Minervalentines???s Day??? which became ???Galentine???s Day??? which became the ???Valentine???s Day??? of modern parlance.Valentine???s Day was popularly embraced, but over the years church leaders worked to change the focus from pagan breakup customs. They downplayed dumping or sacrificing boyfriends, especially by the Middle Ages when the crusades were becoming a real PR fiasco. Instead, religious tracts encouraged women to ???get back out there, mingle, not look for anything serious, necessarily, but be open to having fun.???In later years, breaking up with bo",100
285,"yfriends would actually be condemned as heresy, which historians attribute to the church???s desire to propagate as much as possible in the face of massive plague-related personnel losses.In 14th Century England, flower production skyrocketed as agricultural practices advanced, and florist???s apprentice Geoffrey Chaucer scrambled to increase market demand, claiming that giving flowers to your lovers on Valentine???s Day was the highest form of courtly love and also warded off Saint Valentine???s Malady, epilepsy. In the Canterbury Tales, the Wife of Bath actually tells her boyfriend that a ???magyk natureel??? can undo a ???mayde abood fornicacioun??? with a gift of ???fleurs.??? Clever product placement indeed.Chaucer was a genius businessman and his plan worked, sparking a worldwide cultural and commercial phenomenon. Flower sales took off, epilepsy rates were unchanged, and Valentine???s Day became a holiday for sexing instead of ex-ing.In fact, Valentine???s Day became the least appropriate day of the year to break up with your long-term boyfriend ??? the opposite of what the pagans originally intended! How few couples at prix-fixe dinners know that the tradition of trading heart-shaped boxes of chocolate comes from a time when pagan women ripped out the actual hearts of boyfriends and handed them back and forth hot-potato style. It???s surprising what a look back at history can reveal.What would the ancient pagans think if they saw us today on February 14th, exchanging pink trinkets and confections, crepe paper and balloons, just lovers loving love? They???d probably think we recently completed a new henge, since that???s actually how they celebrated henge construction.

I meet them at their place. Inside, their space is neither messy nor spotless, neither small nor large, neither dumpy nor extravagant. I sit on the couch, and a pair of tabby cats named Peter Pan and Tinker Bell fling themselves around the living room, which is outfitted with Mardi Gras art prints and glittery harlequin masks. When I ask Kevin how he met Chris, he mentions a delightfully trashy multi-tiered gay bar in Seattle???s trendy Capitol-Hill neighborhood. ???We say we met through friends, but actually it was outside R Place,??? Kevin says.They???re a well-matched pair. Both are clean-cut, cute-faced, trim-bodied guys who look to be in their late 30s. Chris is a software developer with tan skin and thick, dark eyebrows. His voice is soft and has a pleasantly gauzy, far-away quality. Kevin manages a grocery store. He has a square-shaped jawline and hair dyed white-yellow blonde. He wears it slicked back just so. As I observe their dynamics, Chris seems to be the talker in the relationship, while Kevin is more watchful, springing up now and then to tend to the various small errands of the living room. The night of the shooting, ???I???d posted on Facebook that I was going to the Twilight to see if any friends would wanna come,??? said Chris. ???Later on, I was kinda thinking about not going, but then I felt like I had to go since I???d already announced it, in case the friends showed up. None of them did. I guess that???s good for them.???Chris and Kevin???s night had been going pretty well. They???d ordered food, got a couple drinks, chatted a little. As Chris picked out a karaoke song, he sent out a couple texts. ???It was stuff to get some people to come out, like, ???You???re missing the tater tots you know.??? I remember I asked my coworker, ???Are you still up for the Twilight???? and he said no, so I go, ???OK loser.??? Then I sent him another one. I was trying to lure him. It said, ???OMG. Peanut-butter bacon burger & tots!?????? said Chris.???Do you remember when they used to have deep-fried bacon? It came with a side of gravy. White gravy. It was hilarious,??? I said, but the guys hadn???t tried it. ???It sounds awesome,??? said Kevin politely, and then we get back to our story.Kevin and Chris had been in the bar maybe a half hour when James shot the bouncer Greg in the alleyway, ???I didn???t know anything about it, nothing. But that???s not surprising,??? said Chris. His personality has a certain dreamy quality, which he references now and again. ???I???d been called up to sing. My song was ???Better Be Good to Me??? by Tina Turner. I hadn???t performed that one since moving here from Wyoming in 1998. After I finished I was walking back to my seat. The karaoke guy hadn???t even called up the next singer yet. Just as I was sitting down I heard a pop, and I thought it was a balloon. I guess you don???t really think it???s gonna be anything else. But then I saw Kevin slide under the table.??????I think it???s because of where I was facing, towards the alleyway door. The things were happening over there,??? said Kevin. The sound was so jarring, ???everybody just sort of stopped and looked at each other. Usually I don???t assume the worst. But then we heard somebody screaming, a male. I think it was the doorman. He was screaming in pain. It looked like the people sitting closest to the door were the first to recognize that this was not a balloon. People started moving, you could hear chairs scooting, everybody got under a table. Things kinda slowed down,??? he said.???People were, like, hitting the floor,??? said Chris. ???I was lying there, trying to figure out what was going on, and what I should be doing. I saw a man walk in. He had a very purposeful walk.??? Later that night, Chris would describe James???s appearance in his police statement. ???You know, I just have a terrible memory anyway,??? Chris told the detective. ???Somebody in their twenties. I think he was wearing a white polo shirt. He may???ve been black, but I???m not totally sure,??? he said. Kevin gave his statement exactly thirty minutes later. The shooter was ???white, mid-twenties, 5???8???, white shirt,??? he said. Kevin told me, ???He just looked like your average guy. But he had a gun, a big gun. And he was kind of holding it up.??????I was trying to, like, melt into the floor,??? Chris said.???Nobody was talking. It was dead quiet. That was the quietest I???ve ever heard a room. We were all taking in what was going on. I was afraid if I rustled I???d be the only sound,??? said Kevin.???I can???t say I remember anything about his appearance. His demeanor is what struck me,??? Chris said. ???I didn???t see that he had a gun specifically, but I thought he might???ve been the shooter, just by the way he was carrying himself. Here in all this chaos is this one person walking very directly towards the bar. He seemed so determined.???As James moved past the dining room and into the lounge around the corner, Chris waited, gathering information. ???At first, I couldn???t tell if he was coming in just to cause mayhem. Was he gonna shoot anyone he saw? Was he ",100
286,"gonna be a threat to me? But pretty immediately I jumped to: He is going after somebody, and I have nothing to do with this,??? he said.???Somebody indicated the emergency-exit door that faces Cherry Street was open, and people were saying, ???Get out, get out,?????? said Kevin.???I did this really quiet, backwards-shuffle crab walk, so I could keep my back to the door and my eyes on the room. I thought Kevin and I both went out the door at the same time, but I lost him. He must???ve gone a different direction. I ran straight across the street to the barbeque place,??? said Chris. The Barbeque Pit is a brick building with a hand-painted facade giving the illusion the restaurant is being consumed by fire. Climbing the walls and windows, some flames look like scribbles, others have serrated edges and candy-corn gradations. Mounted along the roof, giant signboard cut-outs represent a couple patches of fire, all blobby and giant and billowing up.???There was one other guy standing against the front of the building. I ran up next to him, and we stood together for about twenty seconds. I was trying to think. My thoughts didn???t make sense, but I kept turning them over. ???Why am I here? What if we shouldn???t be here? Why are there two of us here???? It was like I was gonna try to solve the problem using whatever clues I had,??? said Chris. ???Then the guy just takes off running. I didn???t even know who he was, and I was a little paranoid, so I didn???t follow him. So now the street???s empty.??????I think I was still in shock and not really thinking straight, because I should???ve just ran. But I kept thinking about the guy with the gun. I knew he was still in the bar. I was worried about what would happen when he tried to leave. I???d heard two shots go off right as I was getting out. But there hadn???t been a shot in a while, so there couldn???t have been any reason for him to stay inside. I knew he hadn???t come out yet, because I had a view of both doors of the bar where I was. I was thinking he would come out any second. I didn???t want to be running on the street when that happened. I didn???t think he was gonna shoot me unless I startled him or did something weird, but I wanted to be sure I was far out of his way. ???Right next door to the barbeque joint, Chris noticed a well-kept residential building. As Chris wandered a few steps closer, he paused, considering its metal fence. ???I was trying to figure out if I should climb it. Then this guy comes out, stands by the gate. It???s locked, he???s on the other side. He could???ve opened it. He asked me what was going on, and I told him a guy had come into the bar with a gun and shot someone. I said, ???I???m kind of stuck.??? I???d indicated I was trying to get away. I was hoping he would let me in, but I didn???t want to seem panicky. He just stood there. It was clear he was disengaging. He said ???Good luck, man,??? as he walked away.???Ease into itWaking up can be an extremely complex issue. In fact, there is no guarantee it can always be done. Take a moment to marvel that you have accomplished a great feat. If you decide to reward yourself with a lie in, applaud yourself. It is not easy being a creative genius channeling art from a cosmic realm. Once you have risen from your bed/sarcophagus, allow ample time to reach full alertness via your method of choice, whether Red Bull-Monster smoothie or caffeine enema.Be properly attiredWhat are you wearing? Is it comfortable? Above all else ??? even paychecks! ??? writers value radical ultra-comfort. Suggestions: an XXXXL Snuggie, a Glad bag, or the tarp that covers your pool. Wear it with pride: YOU ARE A WRITER!Keep hydratedFill up a gas can with water or Honey Jack Daniels. Sip liberally. When sitting for twenty three hours of the day, it is necessary to lubricate your sluggish arteries. You should also bring a snack with you. Avoid glutinous snacks like a handful of honey or molten lard, as these may sully your keyboard and fuse you to your desk. Many writers have perished for their art in this manner.Keep your blood flowingOther things that should be on your mind at this early stage in the writing day are deep-vein thrombosis and lethal blood clots. To shield yourself from an untimely demise before you have begun the creative process, whip on your flight socks. If you do not own flight socks, don???t despair, with a bit of ingenuity, a hyper-extended condom will do just fine.- -IMPORTANT NOTE: IF THE WORD ???WRITING??? IS TOO INTIMIDATING, CONSIDER USING A EUPHEMISM LIKE ???PENPIDDLING??? OR ???WORDYWHOOPWHOOP.??? No one will think you are odd or certifiable. We are all internet acquaintances here.- -Draw strength from past defeatsTake a minute to remember that time your writing teacher told you to consider an alternate career in underwater basket weaving. Use it to inspire you to lofty literary heights. You too could be the next George R. R. Tolkien.Take deep, deep breathsFill your lungs with Febreeze???d air and look around your writing room/prison cell. Are you alone? If not, take a minute to intimidate those rodents with the nearest cello case. If your children have infiltrated this sacred space, gently remind them that this is the Boogie Monster???s headquarters and he is back on the Atkins Diet.Copy the routines of your heroesThink carefully about your literary idol and ask yourself how they approached their writing day. Consider adopting their practices. If you admire Hemingway, you should scale things back. Stephanie Meyer? Consider a romantic liaison with a classically trained hematophagic pianist. Hunter S. Thompson? Locate your nearest cocaine salesmen. If suicide was a practice of your favorite author, consider postponing this until the end of your day.Don???t sweat the small stuffOpen your laptop and look at the screen. Have you forgotten your password since last night? This is perfectly normal. There are so many things happening at all times. An appropriate amount of time for password recovery could be one to four hours. Password hint: Is it ???I???m A New York Times Best Seller??? or the name of your dead papillon?- -IMPORTANT NOTE: WRITERS USE MANY DIFFERENT TOOLS AND INSTRUMENTS TO ACTUALIZE THEIR CRAFT. A LAPTOP IS SATISFACTORY. SO IS A QUILL. THROWBACK CAVEMEN HIPSTER WRITERS MIGHT USE A CHISEL AND STONE. A PART-TIME ZOO KEEPER MIGHT WRITE IN TAPIR POOPS. REMEMBER: WRITERS DO NOT JUDGE OTHER WRITERS UNTIL THEY ARE ON THE BESTSELLERS LIST AND DESERVE A MAELSTROM OF JEALOUS BATTERFANGING BY A DETERMINED ARMY OF INTERNET TROGLODYTES.- -When in doubt, napAre you feeling a bit woozy? It must be the Jack Daniels. Don???t worry. Now is an excellent time for a nap on the floor or the desk. Move aside any writing implements, unpaid bills, and drug paraphernalia to allow ample space for your disco nap. Remember that you are a writer and there is no stigma to day drinking or sleeping. You are in fact, very cultured. In Spain, this is the norm and you enjoy tapas very much.Draw inspiration from the zeitgeistTake a minute or fourteen hundred to log onto your various social media sites. Google varied topics for creative inspiration and allow yourself to be blissfully siphoned through the Dustbuster nozzle of the Internet. Some thought-provoking topics include:LOL cats,The meaning of lifeTwerkingISISPerhaps some other words are jumping out at you? PYGMY MARMOSET? RUTABAGA? Sure, why not: type them onto your keyboard tool. This is called ???research??? and is often confiscated by people who make science.

Pat yourself on the back, and then pat yourself on the shoulder because you realize how far away your back is. Today has been an odyssey of information. Your eyes are watering from the brightness of the screen, your index finger is in the late stages of rigor mortis, and your ass is shaped like a dehydrated apple ring. Well done, you!- -Keep this routine up and you???ll have a trilogy under your belt in no time. You will need to acquire a belt for the previous sentence to come true. Remember that Rome wasn???t built in a day, and a day wasn???t really built by anyone. Also, pants are highly overrated, NO ONE can make you shower, and everyone???s lives and everything said to you is solely to aid your writing in accordance with cosmic law.

Go ahead, have another gas can of coffee and fart out those blockbusters. The world is waiting!MathMartin seems to have a natural love of, if not a talent for, mathematics. He does have a strange habit of adding zeros at the ends of numbers, ???to make them hella bigger??? (his words not mine). When I try to explain to him that adding these zeros actually markedly changes the equation at hand and will, in almost all cases, throw off the final answer and, in some cases, make a solution impossible, he twirls his pencil and smirks at me and says, ???It???s my world and you???re just a dancing monkey, chump.??? I don???t quite know what Martin means by this, but I get the gist, and I don???t like it. Also, Martin insists you can divide by zero, which is patently false.Grade: CArtMartin has a very high level of confidence in art class. Unfortunately, that confidence is wildly misplaced. He cannot draw very well at all, and flat-out refuses to paint because he ???doesn???t like the way it smells.??? When I suggested the other day that his giraffe looked more like a dog he smirked at me and said ???It???s a giraffe if I say it???s a giraffe,??? which, while an interesting philosophical claim, did not make the dog he was drawing actually look any more like a giraffe. I recommend Martin attempt to do the assignments I give him rather than just keep drawing dogs, which seems to be the only thing he ever does in class. Please contact me if you have questions or concerns or have ideas for how I might get him to actually participate in a constructive way in class and not just keep drawing shitty dogs.Grade: B-EnglishIt has been an interesting challenge to have Martin in class this year. While other students often try to mask the fact that they have not completed the reading for class by putting their heads down or answering some of the more intuitive, easier discussion questions, Martin???s aggressive participation seems to be unaffected by whether or not he has read the book, which he seems never to have done. He will, in fact, often offer intricate responses to my questions, complete with made-up character names and absolutely incorrect plot points (the other day he claimed that ???Atticus Bunch??? was an astronaut sent to space to kill a race of ???poor, dirty old people??? (his words, not mine) who lived on Mars. This, of course, is an incorrect summary of To Kill a Mockingbird). I get the sense that he simply enjoys hearing the sound of his own voice, and also that he has no shame.Grade: C-HistoryAs you know, Appleton Middle School teaches American History through a progressive lens, taking many of our lessons from Howard Zinn???s Young People???s History of the United States. While most of the students seem to be enjoying this approach, Martin has resisted this reading of history, claiming in the first lesson that Columbus was just ???gettin??? what was his??? and throughout the course he has maintained that the native tribes were ???cruisin??? for a bruisin?????? (his words, not mine). While we appreciate students expressing alternate views in class, Martin???s statements make the other students feel unsafe. Is there a good time for us to have a phone chat about how to work together to help Martin not be so very awful?Grade: B-ScienceMartin flatly denies the existence of gravity, claiming it is by sheer will that he keeps himself rooted to the earth, and that the solar system revolves not around the sun as was scientifically proven by Copernicus in the 15th century, but around him, Martin Shkreli. I would love to be able to sit down and talk about where Martin is getting these ideas, as it will be impossible for him to grow, as a scientist or really as a human being in any meaningful way, while he continues to harbor these narcissistic and wholly incorrect views of the universe. Also why does his face always look like he???s peeing his pants just to spite everyone else in the room?Grade: FPhysical EducationYoung Martin has the tenacity and energy of a world-class athlete with absolutely none of the natural skill or necessary work ethic. What he lacks in ability and focus he makes up for in just slamming into the other kids until they acquiesce. When they start to cry, he simply smirks and runs away. If he were bigger or had any physical acumen I???d recommend he be a football linebacker, but as it stands, I assume he will have mastered some important skills for fending off attackers in prison, should he ever end up there, which there seems to be a good chance of, because he literally cheats at every game we play, including that game where you lift up the parachute all together and run underneath it, in which there are no winners and the point is for everyone to have fun. He is truly a terrible child, and I weep for a future when he is an adult with money and power.Grade: CPolice responded to a burglary in the Chicago suburbs and arrested two men, who are suspected of multiple similar crimes in the neighborhood. The robbery was called in by homeowners who were not present during the crime. Two neighbors who were present at the time were questioned, an older gentleman who assisted in sustaining the suspects and a young boy, Kevin McCallister, who lived next door. The boy???s parents were not present for questioning. The two suspects are currently being treated for multiple injuries including facial burns, mild stab wounds, and bruising.- -A five-alarm fire was reported at the Initech building in the industrial tech complex near the popular Chotchkie???s restaurant.

Well played.I???ve never written on one of these parenting advice forums before. Fortunately, I???ve never needed to. Jeremy is such a sweet boy, but I fear that I???m in a little over my head when it comes to his new special friend. I know imaginary friends are relatively normal for four year olds, especially those going through transitional periods. And yes, it has been a bit of a transition, moving from Pittsburgh to New York because of Tom???s work, but I didn???t expect Jeremy to develop such a unique new friend.Tom and I laughed at first. Jeremy would be upstairs playing with his new best friend, Inside Voices with Duran Whitlock. He???d spend hours sitting quietly, wearing headphones that weren???t plugged into anything. Occasionally he would laugh, but mostly he was just sitting there, zoning out. It was cute. He???d tell us about how Duran Whitlock is a Santa Fe-based comedian who voiced Cecil the Cow on the short-lived Cartoon Network series Little Pie and The Comanche Adventures. Jeremy would bounce up and down and tell us about how each week on the podcast, Duran would interview a different voice actor about the joys and struggles of their craft. It???s adorable to watch the way Jeremy flaps his arms and spins around as he talks about how the voice actors would reconcile the international acclaim for the characters they create with their own crippling personal anonymity.But with every childhood phase comes its drawbacks. I feel as though other children have a difficult time relating to Jeremy. He???ll walk up to the other kids on the playground and tell them what Duran thinks of the standup crowds in Santa Fe, or how Duran???s overbearing wife Aquarius tries to convince him to go to law school because she doesn???t approve of his voice acting, and the children don???t seem to understand. If we???re lucky, the children just walk away. But sometimes, they tease him and call him names like ???Poopcast??? and ???Very Confusing Boy.??? I think this is a direct result of the time Jeremy spends with his imaginary friend/podcast.You never want to see your children upset. Jeremy wouldn???t stop crying when IVwDW was acquired by the Eardrum Podcast Network. He was inconsolable, and wouldn???t eat for a day. He kept saying that the podcast wouldn???t be the same now that they had to do mid-episode advertisements for Stamps.com. It was the first time in my life that I didn???t know how to comfort my own son. Tom is a little better with this. He explained to Jeremy that the short break for a Stamps.com ad was good for Duran and his guest, because it would give them a chance to pivot the interview if they did not like where it was going. This seemed to calm Jeremy down. I???m so lucky to have married a man who listens to You Made It Weird with Pete Holmes.I???m worried about what this phase will mean for Jeremy???s future. Yesterday I asked him what he wants to be when he grows up, and he told me about his hero. He wants to be just like Steven, Duran???s podcast producer, a 23-year-old post-bacc student at the Santa Fe University of Art and Design. I asked if he???d rather be an astronaut, or a race car driver, or anything else more exciting, and he said that none of those careers lead to free IVwDW merch.Jeremy???s pre-school teacher has also noticed the changes in him since he became a Durango (that???s what Duran calls the fans of his podcast). Every Tuesday at 11 am, Jeremy tells Miss Evelyn that he needs to go to the bathroom. He always brings his headphones with him. She thinks that his headphones are a comfort object for him, like Linus Van Pelt and his blanket. I know better. Tuesday at 11 am is when that week???s episode is released on the Eardrum Podcast Network. Every Durango knows that.My only hope for Jeremy is that this is a phase in his life that will help him grow and make friends in the future. I must stay optimistic, and I know it could be worse. One of the kids in his class has an imaginary friend who???s an imaginary Twitter feed. What a strange kid.""1.	Your favorite flavor is habanero anything, but especially mango habanero wing sauce, which you view as a major innovation in the wing, perhaps the only actual improvement to traditional wing sauce that even can be made. However, as you age, your body has begun to rebel. Now, when you eat anything with habanero in it, your bowel actually tries to turn itself inside out and you have cramping diarrhea so painful it leaves you light headed. Still, you keep ordering mango habanero wings. This cycle of pain and pleasure seems entirely inescapable.2.	Your kid is only three, but his favorite color is black and his favorite character is Darth Vader, even though he has not yet seen Star Wars. You walk to the Starbucks with him and admire his pale vampiric skin, his all black outfit, his odd, uneven haircut. You think he is so cute it is hard to breathe.3.	There is a movement in your company to encourage fitness. Guys who were once comfortably fat are now getting standing desks and taking Judo classes. It feels like a betrayal. This culture welcomed you into its nerdy embrace when you were but a teen, cried, ???Yes! Yes! Having a body is awful! Let???s pretend we have no bodies at all!??? And now it has changed its mind just when you are entering middle age and even walking kind of hurts.4.	Your dad died last year and you still don???t know how you feel about it. You loved him, that???s not the confusion. The confusion is over the void and death and what consciousness is. The worst thing you can even imagine is your wife dying, but that means you imagine it all the time.5.	You get most of your parenting advice from Reddit. You can???t help it ??? all the other websites are cloying and badly designed with unusable breadcrumb navigation.6.	Your most recent parenting query was how old your son should be before he sees Star Wars for the first time. The general consensus on Reddit was four years old. But he is a very mature three.7.	You have begun eating an alarming number of nicotine candies at work. Nicotine does factually improve cognitive performance, but you still don???t tell your wife because it would worry her.8.	Your wife wants to have more kids and you are scared. You just like the one kid so much. To her, this is an argument for more, but for you it is an argument for stopping while you are ahead.9.	You never in your whole life imagined yourself this happy. Being an adult is infinitely better",100

Still, even though you are the happiest you have ever been, you are aware that you are probably still clinically depressed.""Dear Editors of Literary Magazines,On behalf of all my writing comrades, I???m writing to beseech you to make some minor modifications to your scheduling of rejections. Of course, I can only imagine the mountains of submissions you are perpetually buried beneath, but I ask that you remember your early days as a writer, before you forsook your writing dreams, to become a highbrow editor.I???ve taken on the task of examining the calendar on a month-to-month basis and providing you with insights on the ideal times to schedule your rejections in order for them to have maximum impact while also being respectful of the highs and lows and further lows in a writer???s life.Trigger Dates to Avoid:Writer???s birthdayBirthdays of immediate family membersBirthdays of chosen family membersAnniversaries of major relationship milestones This includes marriage, divorce, first time, move in, move out, first fight, and first fight won.Family death anniversariesDeath anniversaries of pets/animal companionsSenior promRelevant for those who had memorable experiences as well as those who are still broken from never having been asked.January Many of us are reeling from all that we didn???t accomplish by the end of last year. We are also crumbling under the weight of our lofty and unrealistic New Year???s resolutions. We may still begin the year with optimism, but not if you crush us first with your rejections.February February is the month of St. Valentine???s. This might be our only shot at love for the year. And if we strike out on Valentine???s Day, we???re already smarting from rejection in our love life. However, we might be able to translate this pain into the next The Fault In Our Stars or The Notebook, but not if you crush us first with your rejections.March Reject away. But please be mindful of trigger dates that fall into this month.April Although there???s still a chill in the air and rain showers besiege us, we can smell the verdant beginnings of spring. And spring???s potential inspires us to think of our own. We???ll sit down and put pen to paper for all those ideas we incubated through the cold winter months, but not if you crush us first with your rejections.May Springs blooms are all around us and all things seem possible as we look ahead to the summer months, which stretch beckoningly before us. This is the summer that we will complete our manuscript for the next great American novel, which we???ve outlined on a napkin, or the collection of brilliantly interlinked short stories whose links are currently missing, or our memoir that our friends implore us to ???save it for the book,??? as they halt us from telling our life stories at the bar, exclaiming ???I don???t want you to spoil it for me.??? Please let us bask in the excitement of planning the summer of our writing dreams ??? this only happens but once a year.June Please hold off on all rejections during the summer of our writing dreams.July Please hold off on all rejections during the summer of our writing dreams.August Please hold off on all rejections during the summer of our writing dreams.September September marks the end of the summer of our writing dreams and the moment we return to reality. Reject away.October October is the month of transformation, when green leaves turn russet and we don masks and costumes to inhabit other identities. It is such a fertile time for the writer???s imagination, but not if you crush us first with your rejections.NovemberNovember is the month of giving thanks for all that we have been blessed with which includes our fellow writers, and you, our esteemed editors. We dwell in this moment of gratitude as we look back at the year that lies behind us, and the one that lies before us, but not if you crush us first with your rejections.DecemberDecember is not only chock-full of holidays, it is the final month of the year, the month we take stock of how insignificant our accomplishments have been and how conversely significant the number of rejections we???ve received. What???s worse, we must carry this with us to the many holiday gatherings with friends and family. I feel like I keep missing your publications? So where did that piece you were working on for six months land up? With the help of spiked eggnog we might be able to survive this season of scrutiny, but not if you crush us first with your rejections.Thank you for taking the time to review my humbly submitted rejection modification calendar. In my small way, I hope to make rejection suck less both for the writer and the editor, but really mostly for the writer. However, I understand if you are not able to accept the changes I have suggested. After all, it won???t be my first rejection from you.Always your literary comrade,Kavita DasIf Trump wins, I???m leaving the country. I???m serious. I???ll pack my bags, drive straight to the airport, and ask for the first ticket to anywhere. I know people say it every election, but they don???t mean it like I do. If Trump wins, I???ll hop right on a Spirit Airlines, watch The Maze Runner: Scorch Trials in-flight, and start my life over, maybe in a cliff-side Italian village or somewhere in Scandinavia.Of course, if Trump wins, there???s the issue of my wife Joanna and our children. Would I really uproot their lives just to make a political statement? Obviously not, that would be selfish. If Trump wins, I???ll kiss my two beautiful sons Dylan and Cayden goodnight, wait until Joanna falls asleep, and disappear from the home we made together before sunrise.No, this is not a midlife crisis. Do you see a sports car parked in my garage? Do you see me wearing Cayden???s Beats by Dre headphones and listening to his EDM music? Leaving the country has nothing to do with how Joanna and I probably wouldn???t be together if I hadn???t gotten her pregnant in high school, or the second mortgage we took out on the house. This is about politics. Do you even know anything about politics? I do.Maybe if Trump wins, I???ll decide to settle down again someday. I???ll start a new family in the English countryside. I???ll find a wife, a green-eyed Argentinean beauty named Nadia, who doesn???t roll her eyes when I mention my literary aspirations to write a novel (without giving too much away, think The Da Vinci Code meets 1974 folk-rock song ???Cat???s in the Cradle???). And we???ll have children, two girls, who do things besides play Minecraft and watch Vines all day.If Trump wins, with all the checks and balances in the political system, how much could things really change? It???s not about change, it???s about principles. Look, I???m a man of action. I stand up for what I believe in, and I refuse to be a passive accomplice to his politics. If I stayed in this country upon Trump???s election, I???d be tacitly endorsing his every policy, and my moral compass simply will not allow it. If Trump wins, I???ll leave the country, rent a chalet in the Swiss Alps, and every Sunday, I???ll go to the marketplace in the town square, where Luca will sell me marmalade.Of course, I???ll need a source of income to purchase marmalade. If Trump wins, the dead-end office job I fell into after college and that???s sucked the life out of me since won???t matter. We???d be living under Trump???s regime! It won???t be easy, but if Trump wins, to make ends meet I???ll have to take an apprenticeship with a glassblower in Montserrat, spend years toiling over open flames to impress tourists with my handcrafted dining sets, and then take over the studio upon my master???s death. Or maybe I",100
290,"???ll just join an ashram.If Trump wins, you could leave the country too. You could leave your spouse, move to Miami, snort a ton of coc ??? wait, that???s still in the United States. You???re doing it wrong. If Trump wins, you could move to Puerto Rico ??? nope, that???s still a U.S. territory. Okay, let???s try this: You could move to El Salvador ??? that checks out, I looked it up on one of my son???s iPads ??? live on a farm where you???ll grow cacao and tend a herd of alpacas. You???ll spin the softest wool in the whole village, so soft, like a cloud and a baby had a baby. And snort a ton of cocaine!If Trump wins, we could visit each other all the time without having our spouses complain that we???re never available to help around the house, that we treat them like a maid service, that we forgot our eldest son???s birthday party and humiliated him in front of his fourth grade class. We could hike the fjords of Reykjav??k! Or care for a small Shinto shrine on the outskirts of Nagasaki! Or sail the Balkans, docking our ship in a different port every night until we???ve circumnavigated every inch of this entire freakin??? globe!But hey, don???t get carried away. Trump winning, it???s all just hypothetical, right ??? the chalet, Luca, my twin girls with plaits running down their back who will call me ???Pap?????? Trump won???t win. The American people are too sensible. And you and I will just stay here in the Land of the Free, Home of the Brave, until at last we draw our dying breaths.Welcome to February. If you are reading this, and live in the Northern Hemisphere, you???ve made it through most of the winter.So far you probably shoveled anywhere between 6 and 250 inches of snow off of your driveway, and possibly scraped off at least three inches of ice off your windshield. You have probably slipped and fallen on the ice in front of shocked strangers no fewer than five times, and if you are really lucky, you???ve had a vehicle towed in the middle of the night for being parked in a snow removal zone.Oops.  It may be a little too late to make this decision for this year, but next year, you swear you???re going to just skip winter, and hibernate.Hibernation is a state of dormancy that is common in mammals during cold seasons. Possibly the most prolific hibernators are Alaskan black bears, which hibernate about seven months out of each year. That sounds nice, doesn???t it? During this time, the bears??? heart rate drops to about 14 beats per minute, their metabolism reduces by about 75%, and their body temperature fluctuates between 30??C-36??C. It???s not just bears that hibernate; smaller mammals such as ground squirrels, bats, and deer mice also hibernate through the winter. There are slight physiological variations due to the differences in surface area to volume (bears are big), however the overall theme is the same. To survive this reduced state of function, there is a shift from the use of carbohydrates as a primary source of fuel, to using fats instead. This is noted by altered regulation of metabolic pathways and inhibition of energy-costly protein synthesis processes.1 Calcium, phosphorus and urea are recycled to prevent bone and muscle loss.2To prepare for hibernation, animals need to accumulate as much fat as possible in the months leading up to this point. You can do this too, and your best bet is to consume foods that have been stuffed with other foods. This may include cream cheese-stuffed pancakes with Nutella spread on top, pizza with a cheese-and-bacon stuffed crust, double stuffed Oreos, macaroni and cheese nuggets stuffed with mayo and deep-fried, cheesecake-stuffed chocolate chip cookies, fried chicken-stuffed donuts, pork-rind-stuffed croissants???.You get the idea. The greatest part is after you pack in all of these foods, you???ll spend the next few months burning the fat off while you sleep. In fact, you may even notice that you???ve lost a bit of weight as you wake up to sunshine and springtime flowers.If you like the idea of skipping one winter, why not skip all of the winters? After all, you???ve never done anything half-assed in your entire life.  Critters such as water bears (tardigrades), rotifers, some types of insects, and nematodes can do this by allowing themselves to freeze in a preserved state (cryobiosis), where they can remain dormant for years, decades, and possibly even centuries. Interestingly, the active lifespan of water bears is typically less than a year; adding in a period or two of dormancy could hypothetically extend the total lifespan many times over.3Just think. In time, climate change will result in an increase in global temperatures just enough so that chances are, the winters where you live won???t be so dammed cold. This is a fantastic idea.I suppose you could also move to a warmer location. But, moving is the worst and the job market isn???t great, so cryobiosis it is.The main strategy to cryobiosis is to avoid inter- and intracellular ice formation. As it turns out, ice crystals are very damaging to cellular integrity, and the added weight of ice increases the risk of physical damage through crushing force. This is why jack-o???-lanterns never really do well after the first good November freeze, and why we can???t simply preserve ourselves by taking a ride in a tank full of liquid nitrogen. Pro-tip:  If you want your decorative gourds to last longer, keep them indoors and out of the cold. Then it can be decorative gourd season until January at the very least.There are a number of different cellular and biochemical mechanisms designed to protect cells from freezing and desiccation at the onset of cryobiosis; these include the use of protective proteins (heat shock and chaperones) as well as assorted antioxidants that may differ slightly from frozen critter to frozen critter.4 One mechanism that most of our freezable critters seem to have in common is the replacement of water inside the cell with trehalose. 4 5 Trehalose is a disaccharide (like sucrose), synthesized from glycogen in response to a drop in temperature. What makes it so special is that it takes on a gel-like structure, which acts as a protectant of cells and their contents, stabilizes proteins in their native state, and avoids the formation of damaging ice crystals. During a state of cryobiosis, trehalose may account for up to 20% of the critter???s dry weight.4 The fine details of all that occurs before, during, and after cryobiosis are currently being sorted out, but as it stands, after the temperature rises again trehalose is catabolized into glucose, and the critter resumes its normal metabolic processes.Ideally, if you entered a state of cryobiosis you could just settle in for the next few decades, then resume your normal activities without skipping a metabolic beat. This would allow us to extend our normal lifespan to see beyond the year 2100, and possibly even further.OK, enough daydreaming. The big question now is, could humans do this?Humans have most of the proper enzymatic machinery for hibernation, but we don???t do it for relatively unknown reasons. The reigning theory is that humans evolved out of tropical and subtropical ecosystems, and never really adapted to cold climates like bears and other mammals. Even after we started colonizing cold climates, we were always a little too busy, and would run the risk of someone stealing our stuff if we were to sleep for half the year.  Despite these issues, there are a few stories of determined individuals that claim to have hibernated.6  So, perhaps it is possible.Cryobiosis is a little more far-fetched.  It very well could be that trehalose is toxic to us, as vertebrates lack the enzymes need",100
291,"ed to synthesize trehalose, but we still have enzymes to break the stuff down into glucose.5  Despite this, being able to achieve a state of cryobiosis is absolutely desirable, as it opens up the door to completely new and awesome technologies. Examples of this include, bodily preservation and revival for medical purposes, and being able to survive a long ride through space on our way to our new Earth, as we are in the process of irredeemably trashing the current one. A little bit of genetic engineering will be necessary to allow us to synthesize and tolerate our own trehalose, but we can work on that. Necessity is the mother of invention after all.I know it???s obvious, but I feel like I should remind everyone that one we enter a state of cryobiosis, we are good to go, and can be jettisoned into space.

Picture a classroom full of twenty-three snot-nosed kids working on their ???What I Did for Summer Vacation??? essays. You are a teacher with plantar fasciitis and a bad hangover. You look through the psychotic handwriting of sixth graders and see the one shining jewel; the title is ???Wet Hot Balls: My Summer Volleyball Extravaganza.??? That day, crowned with three gold stars, a writer was born (it was me).In my previous applications you learned about my compassionate activism for the cause of men???s rights, my ventures in substitute teaching, and my triumphant return to the world of waiting tables. Well, let???s be honest, you weren???t impressed. This time I???m going to get down to brass tacks.Some of my influences: the sexy boriquas of Junot Diaz???s fiction, Benjamin Percy???s badass Batman voice, and the weed farm in T.C. Boyle???s Budding Prospects. All of which inspire me to sack up, drink my coffee black, and write about real issues that real men with real mustaches face, such as the story enclosed in this application, ???Santa Claus and the Never-Ending Case of Erectile Dysfunction.??? Spoiler Alert: Mrs. Claus is a lesbian.You should know two things: 1) I???ve done exhaustive research on all fronts of your writing program and 2), I???ve got to tell you, you would love my schnitzengruben. No innuendo intended, not at all. On the contrary, I???ll come right out and tell you I???ve seen photographs of your tenured faculty and they???re a batch of good-looking people that I???m willing to drink with on a regular basis.Regardless, the harsh reality is that I???m working a dead-end job, making less than enough to pay back my student loans, and I???d really like this MFA gig so I can defer all further payments indefinitely. A little stipend would really go a long way, which would certainly be a determining factor on whether or not I accept your inevitable offer of admissions. Inevitable, of course, because of the relentless flow of applications I have sent forth, and which I will continue to send forth until admitted or, rather, until the end of time (whichever comes first).Here???s a taste of my teaching style: I.

As you can imagine, I am swamped here by many similar enquiries ??? everyone wants homework, it seems! If you haven???t heard from me within a few weeks, then please presume that I am not interested at this time.- -Dear Mrs D,Thank you for your engagement in my education. My interest was piqued by your task, and though I unfortunately won???t be completing it on this occasion, I liked the idea of it, and of you, enough to take a look at any future homework you might set. Please stay in touch.- -Dear Mrs D,Thanks for your homework. Your idea of writing a Christmas ghost story was a good one, but it???s not really the kind of thing I tend to do ???  it???s a little bit too genre for my tastes. Try Kevin, who sits next to me. He loves that stuff.- -Dear Mrs D,It???s a no, as you???ve probably guessed.

My parents loved it for me, and thought I should seriously consider doing it; my younger brother and I just didn???t ???get it.??? Maybe it???s a generational thing, like Downton Abbey? It provoked much lively debate, as you can imagine, and we all learned a little more about ourselves ??? for which many thanks.

When I see you up there on stage collecting the Homework Of The Year award, I???ll kick myself.Nothing ignites our neighborhood association???s email list like the appearance of home security system salesmen. Once or twice a year, salespeople will canvass our neighborhood, knocking on doors, urging us to sign up for their service. Invariably, these visitations produce a flurry of panicked, hostile emails.???Someone came by at 8:30 last night claiming to be from ADT,??? one neighbor will report. ???Not sure he was legit. White guy with dark hair, clean cut, medium build. Wearing an orange safety vest.??????I called ADT,??? another neighbor replies. ???They said their salespeople usually wear blue and white.???A third concerned citizen doesn???t fool around: ???I called the police. They???re sending a patrol car. Asked which way he went and whether he had a weapon.???Regrettably, I???ve never been at home when the alarm system salesmen come calling, so I don???t know if their sales technique warrants them being hounded out of the area by cops. I do understand why they consider us potential customers. Our neighborhood lies just off a major urban highway, and break-ins are not uncommon; we contribute our share to America???s annual $3 billion in home burglary losses. So it???s ironic that people selling burglary prevention systems arouse our suspicion. But it???s a fitting irony, given that the home security business???like the other industries that make up Fear, Inc.???generates profits by stoking our worst fears.My neighbors??? mistrust of alarm system salesmen is not groundless. Scams involving home security are pretty common. The $12.5-billion-per-year industry is currently undergoing ???disruption,??? as Silicon Valley rolls out ???smart home??? technology and DIY systems. All these new players in the market make it easy for rip-off artists to look legitimate. But professionally installed, monitored services still control 93% of the home security market. They may not run scams, but their sales tactics aren???t exactly scrupulous either.Judging by their websites, most home security companies assume you are white, with blonde children, and that everything around you???curtains, woodwork, brick walls, or infinite beach horizon???is also white. The professionally protected homes they depict are cool and stark and free of chaos, making them look a little bit like prisons. The repeated use of these images, by multiple competing companies, suggests that the industry wants us to see white people as the most valuable, the most worthy of protection. Of the six sites I examined (ADT, Vivent, Lifeshield, SimpliSafe, Point Security, Smith Monitoring, and Alarm.com), four featured white people. In fact, Point Security and Smith Monitoring featured images of the exact same white, blonde family, in slightly different poses, evidently purchased from the same stock photo company.When I noted this coincidence on Twitter last year, Smith Monitoring replied with some cheerful banter, claimed to be a fan of my McSweeney???s writing, and offered me three free months of their monitoring service. I did not avail myself of that offer. Since then, I note that Smith Monitoring and Point Security have removed the matching photos.???Security for white people??? seems oddly counterproductive from a marketing standpoint, given that white people are an increasingly smaller segment of the market in America. It only makes sense if these companies are specifically targeting white customers. Perhaps white people, because we???re becoming outnumbered, are more likely to feel vulnerable and in need of security. Studies show that in fact burglary rates are consistently higher for blacks than for whites, but bias probably sells more alarms than facts do.Offline, the whiteness of the security industry???s appeals is less pronounced. ADT, the largest American home monitoring service, not only features people of color in its advertising, but goes so far as to personify its home security systems as a large, uncompromising black man. In ADT???s television commercials, he stands stoically through rain and snow, menacing burglars. The same actor appears on ADT???s website, where you can ???operate??? him remotely: Click a button to ???arm??? an ADT system, and the man clones himself into 30-plus men standing inside, around, and on top of a two-story home. ???Swipe??? the phone screen to manage the home???s door locks, and he cracks his neck joints, one direction for locked, the other for unlocked. The fact that ADT is inviting us to buy a black man and use his body to protect our property makes me (a white person) cringe inwardly. Still, the approach is a welcome change from the implicit racism of some of ADT???s rivals.It also represents a shift from the commercials of Brink???s Home Security, which merged with ADT in 2010. Brink???s ads used to be ubiquitous on television; I still have nightmares about them. One Brink???s commercial depicted a mother and daughter (carefully cast to depict people of color, but of no specific ethnicity) menaced by a masked intruder, then rescued with a phone call from ???Tom, at Brink???s Home Security,??? who assures them he???s ???sending help right now.??? Brink???s ads regularly featured shrieking women, children, and teenage girls. Just as many industry websites imply that white people need special protection, these TV spots portrayed women and girls as high-value targets for criminals.One fact that might slip your mind as you peruse these commercials and websites is that home security systems exist primarily to protect property, not people. There is no hard data showing that they reduce violent crime. That???s not surprising when you consider that most violence in homes is perpetrated by people who live there. ???The point of a security system is to reduce loss,??? according to the president of the Electronic Security Association, which represents some 2,600 businesses. Yet Brink???s evidently found it more effective to appeal to our fear of bodily harm. ADT deserves cre",100
293,"dit for disavowing this line of marketing.How does ADT???s service compare with Brink???s though? I decided to ask. ???CHAT NOW!??? The ADT home page commands, in language one normally associates with per-minute charges. I chatted with ADT Security Sales Specialist Brittani, who hastened to tell me that ADT has six call monitoring centers across the country. Great, I responded. What will they do if my alarm is activated????A trained ADT Professional will contact you,??? she explained. ???If you need assistance, the ADT Representative will contact police, fire department or other emergency personnel to request dispatch to your home immediately.???Is that all ???Tim??? was doing, I wondered? I felt let down. If all of the ???responding??? happens purely over the phone, what difference does it make that ADT has six call centers across the country? It???s not like they???re jumping into a car and driving to my house to help me. Their ???assistance??? consists of calling 911 for me, after they talk to me on the phone. If I can answer the phone, couldn???t I just use it to call 911 myself?If a monitored security system doesn???t provide any protection my local 911 service doesn???t already give me, is it really worth the money? According to my insurance agent, installing one would save me a whopping $171 annually on my homeowner???s policy. They also warned me I???d have to buy a $30 annual permit from the city. Because over 90% of police responses to security system activations turn out to be false alarms, many cities now charge an upfront fee to cover the associated public costs. Repeated false alarms incur stiff fines, and operating an unpermitted system can earn you a class C misdemeanor.A survey of my friends revealed just how confused consumers are about their home security spending. Those with systems said they provide ???peace of mind,??? but most understood the anxiety they were assuaging wasn???t necessarily rational. ???I was worried about break-ins and home invasions,??? one friend explained, ???though I know these are unlikely events.??? Others reported feeling frustrated by their systems and abandoning them. ???All it ever did was generate false alarms,??? my sister said. My friend Matt had perhaps the most logical approach: He simply divided the property loss deductible on his insurance policy by the monthly cost of monitoring, and concluded, ???ROI for a security system is only positive if I get robbed every eight years.??? He doesn???t have a security system.Neither do I, and I want one even less now that I???ve looked at how they???re sold. Home security is a model subsidiary of Fear, Inc. It generates sales by giving potential customers skewed visions of both its product and the problem of safety. There???s evidence that home security systems reduce property loss from burglary (ESA claims the average loss for a home without a system is over $5,000, versus about $3,200 for a home with one). But they???re not cost-effective for every home. And the systems clearly burden police forces when they malfunction They can generate significant financial penalties for owners. The industry does not encourage customers to do the basic math necessary to make a wise choice.More troubling, while these systems can include sensible safety components like fire detectors, it???s entirely unclear that they provide protection from violence. Yet many companies??? marketing methods explicitly focus customers??? attention on the need to protect people???especially white people and women, who are positioned as uniquely valuable and defenseless. Many of the images home security companies use to sell their products reinforce harmful stereotypes about how vulnerable we are, and about who represents a threat to us. Those stereotypes make our society more dangerous, not safer, because they encourage us to doubt our own competence and to value or distrust people based on their appearance.It???s pretty brazen for an industry to sell ???peace of mind??? by fueling self-doubt and mistrust. It???s especially sad when you consider that building relationships among neighbors has been recognized for thousands of years as the most effective way to keep your home and family safe. As Hesiod wrote in 700 BC, ???If misfortune strikes your house, your kinsmen take time to get dressed. Neighbors come in their nightclothes.???For that reason, I???m grateful to the home security industry???or at least, to the salespeople they keep sending into my neighborhood. The conversations they generate on our email list help me get to know my neighbors, and encourage us to share our concerns about safety. That kind of community building is a powerful rejection of Fear, Inc.???s sales pitch. And it???s given me more peace of mind that any alarm system ever could.Claire Clairmont was the stepsister of Mary Shelley, author of Frankenstein, and she played a larger role in the society of Romantic writers than she???s often given credit for; but that???s not what she???s pissed off about.If she had lived in the twenty-first century, Claire would have been that girl in high school ??? you know the one ??? who wanted so desperately to fit in that she???d follow anyone anywhere. That girl who clutched at the same guy (either the quarterback or the renegade hipster, choose your own clich??) for so long that he eventually noticed her, slept with her, and didn???t give her another thought until she turned up pregnant. That girl whom you felt kind of sorry for, even though there was always something a bit calculated behind her giggle.But Claire would have also been that woman at the ten-year class reunion whom you don???t recognize because she???s more interested now in career than in trendy clothing, spending her time observing and reflecting rather than fawning and following. This new Claire Clairmont is kind and likable; she probably even complimented your unnaturally white teeth (because as the commercials tell us, if you???re going to a reunion you had better panic about the shade of your tooth enamel).But alas ??? our new and wise friend Claire did not live in the twenty-first century but in nineteenth-century England (similar to now, but with far less attention to one???s teeth). That might be one thing that Clairmont is pissed off about, but there are more.Clairmont???s mother married Mary Shelley???s father when each of their daughters was about four years old. Mary Shelley disliked her stepmother, and the feeling was mutual. (When your mother dies as a result of your birth and happens to be the incomparable Mary Wollstonecraft, she leaves some hard-to-fill shoes behind.) Claire admired her stepfather (William Godwin, himself an important writer and thinker of the time) and grew to worship Mary Shelley???s deceased biological mother, Mary Wollstonecraft, as did the entire family (except the new wife, and can you blame her?), including Mary Shelley???s eventual husband, the poet Percy Shelley.Are you sketching this family tree on a napkin or something? It???s hard to keep track, I know.When Mary Shelley (then Godwin) was sixteen years old, she ran off with 21-year-old Percy Shelley, who was wealthy but not yet famous, and was, inconveniently, already married. Claire went along, of course, because who wouldn???t want to be a third wheel in their stepsister???s forbidden relationship? Mary, Percy, and Claire lived together for the most part until Percy???s death, only about nine years later. (Picture a sort of hippie commune, but with starched clothing and better manners.)Finally, we come to the part that gets Claire Clairmont pretty pissed off.In their travels around Europe, Mary, Percy, and Claire spent considerab",100
294,"le time with Lord Byron, then a well-known poet about ten years older than Claire. One of Byron???s many former lovers, Lady Caroline Lamb, famously described him as ???mad ??? bad ??? and dangerous to know,??? which of course made him irresistible to every woman (and many men) who came anywhere near him.This is where Claire becomes that high school girl I described, basically throwing herself at Byron until he sleeps with her and quickly forgets her. But Claire is pregnant, and Byron wants nothing to do with her. Claire persists in writing to Byron, begging him to take her back, even saying she would accept his other lovers (one of whom might have been his own half-sister). The common story at this point is that Claire begged Byron to take their daughter because he could better provide for her than Claire could, and that Byron finally agreed on the condition that Claire stop pummeling him with pleading letters. I wonder if this isn???t only part of the story, and if Byron took the baby more willingly than has been reported, intending it as punishment for Claire.Poor Claire. She found footing in her life when Allegra was born; finally, Claire had a purpose, and something of her very own. She doted on her baby girl and suffered bitterly when, at about eighteen months old, Allegra was taken from her and sent back to Lord Byron. Claire???s only solace was that she was able to send the baby???s nurse along, so Allegra had someone familiar with her and would presumably be better cared for than she would if it were left entirely to Byron.Byron had no particular interest in Allegra, sending her away to school at the first opportunity. Claire was rarely granted an opportunity to see her daughter, and in fact hadn???t seen her for two years when Allegra died at only five years old. Claire never forgave Byron, who continued to ignore her. It wasn???t until 1869, forty-seven years after her only child died, that Claire even learned where the little girl had been buried.Never has a woman had better reason to be pretty pissed off. As you might imagine, the removal and eventual death of her daughter changed Claire profoundly. She had found her calling as a mother, and when Allegra was taken from her, turned her attention to anyone near her who needed some sort of mothering. Claire spent much of the rest of her life as a governess, and children she worked with said they felt safe, loved, and well-educated in Claire???s care.I don???t know if there???s a tidy moral here, but let me give it a try so we don???t part ways feeling extremely bummed out. You know that girl who annoyed you in high school? Seek her out at the next reunion. I???m guessing that her teeth will be a normal shade of white and that she???ll have an important story to tell.- -For more information on Claire Clairmont, please read:Romantic Outlaws: The Extraordinary Lives of Mary Wollstonecraft and Mary Shelley, by Charlotte GordonYoung Romantics: The Shelleys, Byron, and Other Tangled Lives, by Daisy HayClaire Clairmont and the Shelleys, by Robert GittingsJerry RichardsonOwnerCarolina Panthers??? Hilton Santa Clara4949 Great America Pkwy, Santa Clara, CA 95054Dear Jerry Richardson,As a child I consumed Hardee???s hamburgers at an alarming rate. In fact, one summer I was known as ???The Hardee???s Kid,??? which was highly preferable to ???Dipwad,??? which I was called for many other summers, and the other three seasons, as well, right up through October of 2008 when I became known as ???Chewels??? for reasons I???ll explain in a follow-up letter.I used to ride my bicycle around just screaming ???Hardee???s??? at the top of my lungs for months on end. I would often throw wrapped Hardee???s hamburgers over the wall of the local swimming pool for whomever wanted one. That was known as a ???Hardee???s Alert.??????Don???t you want to come swimming, Hardee???s Kid???? a disembodied voice would shout.???No, I know my place in the world. Enjoy.??????Cool. Got any fries, Dipwad???????No.??? Then I would peddle away.If I were at a sad movie, I wouldn???t pull out a tissue. I would pull out a Hardee???s hamburger and dab my eyes with it. Then start eating it.I was a Hardee???s restaurant one Halloween. A big cardboard box, detailed by hand with markers. I also put that costume back on at Christmas and wore it to talk to ???Santa Claus.??? He didn???t get it. There was nothing to get. Other than joy. The guy was unprofessional. Asking where my parents were. And would I be getting off his lap before St. Patrick???s Day? I was 14. I could handle myself just fine. Joyless fat fuck.Anyway, I loved football almost as much as I loved Hardee???s. But I developed a condition known as ???Hardee???s heart.??? Took one for the team, so to speak. Thought riding the bike around screaming would keep me tip-top, but it did not. So for me, making a game-winning play on Super Bowl Sunday is not in the cards. I will not be a football hero, but for many years, I was a Hardee???s hero. And that is a feat that will never be commemorated on a trading card.Now, I realize you have nothing to do with Hardee???s anymore (other than being the FOUNDER) By the way, the company who runs Hardee???s now doesn???t know shit about the true Hardee???s Experience. I???m sure you???ve forgotten more than they will ever learn about Hardee???s culture. Hardee???s values. Hardee???s Racing. I can???t even look at that star logo today without puking all over myself and strangers.I also know that you???re, ???really busy with the Super Bowl.??? And that you???ve ???heard it all before.??? And are wondering, ???What your angle is???? Etc.It???s pretty simple. I estimate I???ve spent more than $2,594,333.39 on Hardee???s food, apparel, books, you name it. If you had some guy hunched over manicuring your lawn in those days, trimming some tulips, looking longingly at your spouse and vehicle, but always behaving himself, while sweating like a goddamned pig in the Carolina heat, chances are, I helped pay for part of that.Additionally, many of my vacations were based around Hardee???s locations. Trying to secure new Hardee???s toys. I was married in a Hardee???s. I bribed a manager once so that I could have one of my many surgeries inside a Hardee???s that was closed for the evening. Once, when I knew I was about to be fired from my job, I turned down four-months severance for a simple sit-down meal at Hardee???s and fifteen minutes of my boss???s time. The conversation was illuminating, after which I was terminated.So allow me to get to my point. I don???t want two Super Bowl tickets. Not even for free. I???m not some clich?? sad sack. Besides, I can not travel on an airplane, primarily due to my over-enjoyment of Hardee???s food. Much pleasure has been taken from me, by my own decisions and passions.Here???s where you come in. I will be watching the game, like everyone else. I only want a simple gesture of acknowledgement. I have FedExed vintage Hardee???s paper napkins to your hotel. When the camera inevitably fixes its gaze upon you, up in some luxury box, I would like to see that vintage Hardee???s napkin tucked into your collar, as if you???d just enjoyed a Big Deluxe, much like these fellows, who practically raised me. (Guess this must have come out before Mt. St. Helens erupted, there???s no way they could have predicted the 57 deaths.)I want Jim Nantz to ask, ???Is that is a Hardee???s napkin in Mr. Richardson???s collar???? And I want Phil Simms to try to answer, and then I want Nantz to ask him to be quiet and just take in the moment with the rest of America.Perhaps, much simpler would be if Mike Tolbert scores, could he grab a Hardee???s hamburger from a cheer",100
295,"leader or inside the foam around the goalpost and take a bite and scream, ???This is for you Hardee???s??? Adult????Or could Cam Newton ???dab??? after a score, and tucked in the crook of his arm would be a Hardee???s hamburger. Perhaps he could chew it and then drop it from his mouth into a fan???s mouth instead of doing the free ball thing. Too much to ask? Some kind of endorsement problems that would cause? Okay? Maybe we stick to Tolbert then.Thanks Jerry. I knew I could count on you.Panthers 28Broncos 24BuzzFoodAt the beginning of each month we send you a package of the moment???s buzziest food.

It has outlasted all the other bits of ephemera I???ve stuck to my monitor over the years: password hints, fortune cookie mottos, maxims of dead field marshals. It???s the only Bible verse I???ve ever memorized, the seventh verse of the first chapter of Paul???s Second Epistle to Timothy.The words may or may not be Paul???s own; scholars disagree about the authorship of the so-called pastoral letters. I don???t care one way or the other if Paul wrote the Second Epistle; this piece of advice resonates with me simply because, like St. Timothy, I???m prone to self-doubt and anxiety. Paul???s exhortation is a comforting reminder that my fear is not a normal state, nor an inevitable one. Paul (or his ghostwriter) offers reassurance that fear is foreign to our nature???that we???re entitled instead to an awareness of our own power and autonomy; that we have the capacity to engage joyfully with those who are different from us; that we can understand the world by using our inimitable human minds.Lately I???ve felt that I???m not alone in needing that reassurance. America, at this moment in our history, is afraid. We???re afraid of terrorists. Afraid of immigrants. Of home invaders, Zika, old age, cybercriminals, Muslims, black children, poor people, pit bulls, and snakes. We worry about government overreach on one hand, and societal collapse on the other. We can???t be bothered to choose one fear over another. We embrace them all.Our fear is unique among today???s first-world nations. There is no obvious reason for it. Unlike European states, the U.S. is protected from invasion by two oceans. We spend more on our national defense than the next seven countries in the world combined, making us, as our President recently pointed out, the most powerful nation on Earth. Domestically, our crime rates have been dropping steadily for the past 25 years. Yet America is an increasingly paranoid society. More and more of our decision-making???from border walls to Stand Your Ground laws???seems to be driven by nebulous fears rather than available facts.America used to pride itself on its citizens??? cheerful resolve in the face of danger. We had a spirit of power, and compassion, and sound thinking. Now we sweat fear from every pore. What happened to us?Our political system has undoubtedly played a role in this change. Politicians and those who fund them have been active agents in the promulgation of fear, and they???ve worked industriously to codify our fears into laws and policies that benefit select groups. Also complicit are the media, who use fear to drive ratings???sometimes in active collaboration with political interests. But there???s another player in the Frightening of America, one that has propagated fear by tapping into a powerful, basic behavior that defines all of our daily lives. Not sex or sports or cat memes; I???m talking about the single activity that best encapsulates American identity: Shopping.Fear sells. It sells so well that multi-billion-dollar industries have been built on one simple question: ???How much would you pay to feel safe???? The clich?? that you can???t put a price on safety is both trite and wrong; we put a price on our safety every day. And most Americans will pay that price, no matter how high. In fact, when it comes to goods and services that promise to protect us, we???re a nation of shopaholics. We spend over $30 billion annually home security products, and a few billion more on car alarms that we almost universally ignore. We spend about $16 billion each year on firearms and ammunition, though we already own more guns per capita than Serbia or Yemen. Lifelock, a company offering what it calls ???identity theft protection,??? generated $476 million in revenue last year (and agreed to pay the Federal Trade Commission $100 million deceptive advertising and other misbehavior). At the grocery store, we???re coaxed to purchase canisters of pepper spray from the same checkout stand display that offers us candy bars and gum. Americans grab security products off the ",100
296,"shelves as if our lives depended on them???even though we???re remarkably safe from violence and crime, and we???re growing safer each year. This spending fuels the growth of Fear, Inc., an entire market sector that profits from our sense of helplessness and vulnerability.It???s no surprise that Americans are increasingly obsessed with buying safety. Our nation???s faith in the power of purchasing is deeply rooted. If we feel unhealthy, we buy a gym membership or exercise equipment, though the odds of us using them are low. If our child does poorly in school, we invest in a phonics tutoring system???not because it works, but because it was advertised during our favorite television show. The value of all the cosmetics women have bought to fix some perceived flaw in their appearance, and then abandoned in bathroom drawers, must amount to millions of dollars. American citizens have been conditioned to believe that the very act of purchasing is virtuous; that we can buy dispensation from any sin, protection from any misfortune, if we sacrifice our hard-earned money to the gods of commerce.Take, for example, America???s love affair with gated communities. Real estate agents know that gated access to a neighborhood can boost a home???s value???estimates of the increase range from 6% to 30%. The perception of safety and exclusivity that gates provide is a powerful incentive to homebuyers. I say ???perception??? because, as police statistics show, gated communities are in truth no safer than other neighborhoods. Gates and walls around a community don???t yield any significant reduction in violent or property crimes. Yet according to the U.S. Census Bureau, the number of households living in gated communities rose from 7 to 11 million between 2001 and 2009. That???s 4 million homeowners who paid (let???s be conservative) 6% more for their homes because they felt safer behind gates. Given the median 2005 home price of $240,000, that would mean an average $14,400 premium on each gated house. Multiplied across four million households, we???re talking about $57 billion spent by Americans, for the same net security gain they could have achieved by sticking a DO NOT DISTURB sign on their front door.And gated communities are only one subsidiary of Fear, Inc. There are dozens of others, all simultaneously creating and catering to America???s growing siege mentality: Security cameras. ???Anti-rape??? clothing. Stun guns. Multi-part DVD collections that teach you how to protect yourself in a streetfight or survive a grenade attack. Potassium iodide tablets to shield your thyroid from nuclear fallout. Bulletproof blankets for schoolchildren. Panic buttons. Emergency alert systems for office workers. These are just a few of the items filling the shelves of Fear, Inc. And we???re buying them all.Who profits from this relentless barrage of fear-mongering, and what side effects does their enrichment inflict on the rest of us? We pay a steeper price than we realize for security goods and services. The constant chorus of fear-based marketing surrounding these products has helped create the fearful, isolated, and dangerous communities we now live in. In America today, a police officer can kill an unarmed 12-year-old because he perceived the boy to be a ???threat,??? and have his fear validated by a grand jury. Audiences will applaud politicians for calling the families we???ve alongside for years ???rapists and criminals??? who must be deported. These things have come to seem normal, because they mirror the nonstop advertising about danger we???re subjected to. We live in the marketplace of Fear, Inc., where tragedy and hatred are simply the cost of doing business.And there is something else we lose to Big Fear???s constant hucksterism???something of our spirit. There are times when fear is a sensible, useful reaction to environmental conditions. But when another person makes us feel afraid, on purpose, that person gains something: They can control our behavior, or take pleasure in their own power. They deprive us of some of our options and choices. They take away our confidence. They make us less trustful of others. They take the very things 2 Timothy 1:7 assures us we have a right to: Power, love, a sound mind.And that, in a word, is theft.What the Lord giveth, the marketplace taketh away???or tries to. But as the little slip of paper on my computer attests, fear is not our natural state. We have the right, and the ability, to instead confront the world with our gifts. We can ask questions and seek answers. We can draw conclusions and make informed choices. We can become more discerning consumers of what Fear, Inc. is trying to sell us.Over the next few months, the columns in this series will explore the marketplace of fear. I???ll assess some of the most popular products that promise us safety, including home security systems, online protection services, and personal safety gear. I???ll look at how they???re marketed. I???ll talk to the people who sell them, and to those who buy and use them. I???ll consider their cost, efficacy, and the larger impact a product has on individuals and communities. And I???ll be looking too at the stakeholders who profit from our fear, and have a vested interest in keeping us afraid, compliant, and spending. Most importantly, I hope this investigation will suggest more practical and empowering alternatives to the wares of Fear, Inc.I???ll do my best to approach each product with an open mind, because I am serious about safety. And I???m perfectly willing to spend money on things that reduce risk without taking too much away from me. I???m a big believer in fire extinguishers, for example, and seat belts, airbags, and smoke alarms. I love my insurance agent. I take vitamins.What I won???t do is sacrifice my family???s money to businesses that care more about their bottom line than they do about the trust and transparency that create safe communities. I refuse to outsource my security to unproven products or the soulless corporations that hawk them. The problem of safety won???t be solved with our wallets, but with confidence, compassion, and reason.We have all those things.

Yet some disagree with Gore and believe global warming isn???t so much an Inconvenient Truth as it is a God-Damned Lie.Is the Earth???s climate really getting warmer? If so, is mankind responsible or does the Earth just want to get hotter, like any prospective Abercrombie & Fitch model? Are the polar caps really melting and the oceans spiking in temperature? If so, is there anything we can do to reverse the process or should we just enjoy watching the planet slowly die like the soul of an Abercrombie & Fitch model?In this article, I???ll entertain the claims of conspiracy theorists and debunkers alike, and then entertain myself with my own rebunking theories regarding global warming. Hopefully by the end we???ll all be a little more like Al Gore: possess an understanding of climate change and be separated from a woman called Tipper.- - Conspiracy Claim: John Coleman, co-founder of the Weather Channel, has stated that global ice caps are increasing along with polar bear populations. Hence, global warming is, as Coleman states, ???the greatest scam in history.???Debunking Claim: Both of Coleman???s claims are misleading or downright false. Also, he hasn???t worked with the Weather Channel in over 30 years and has never conducted actual climate change research.Rebunking Claim: If scientists are to be believed, and the believability tests conducted by scientists assure us that they are, then the carbon dioxide created by burning fossil fuels such as gas, oil, and coal is one of the main contributors to global warming. Gas, oil, and COAL. John Coleman (or *COAL*man), realized that if global warming is proven true, his last name will be synonymous with something that devastated the planet, tarnishing his identity forever. It???d be like being named Brian Exxon-Valdez, or Katrina Hurricane, or Stacy Macarena. Coleman doesn???t need facts or research to know his name is at stake, and if he has to lie about how big the ice caps are or paint a few brown bears white, give them Coca-Colas and ship them to the Arctic, he???s going to do it.- -Conspiracy Claim: Any global warming is just natural variability that will abate over time and is not caused by humans. The Earth is billions of years old and this is just a short phase.Debunking Claim: The planet???s age and past weather phases are already taken into account when developing climate models, and the scientific consensus is that they cannot explain the recent warming trend.Rebunking Claim: If the Earth itself can go through phases, Ice Ages and Greenhouse Ages, science can as well. Right now we may very well be living in a period of science known as the Incorrect Age where all of science is simply wrong. If that???s true, science???s assertion that global warming is real actually means the opposite. It also means all of the scientific facts we ???know??? as true are just as wrong. The Earth doesn???t revolve around the Sun, the periodic table isn???t fun, babies should be called ugly, and Neil deGrasse Tyson is dead. Hopefully science will soon enter the Correct Age, when all of the truths of the universe will be revealed. Too bad Neil won???t be around to see it.- -Conspiracy Claim: If real, global warming is actually beneficial for the planet. Warmer weather means increased plant growth in northern areas, more usable land for farming, and longer growing seasons. Famines will be things of the past.Debunking Claim: Despite potential short term benefits, global warming???s effects will have a catastrophically negative impact on humans, animals, and the entire planet.Rebunking Claim: A warmer climate will mean more usable land and hotter seasons, but there???s not a chance in Hell (the endgame for the warming Earth) that a bunch of seed planting, tractor kissing, pitchfork marrying farmers will take advantage of it before a group of money making, opportunity seizing, tractor kissing (but only in jest) waterpark developers jump on the chance. A hot planet means anything that can become a waterpark, will become a waterpark. It???s this very reason that waterpark developers started, perpetuated, and refuse to end global warming. Thankfully we???ll get to cool off in an enjoyable way before the Four Inner-tubemen of the Apocalypse come winding down the lazy river.- -Conspiracy Claim: We don???t have to worry about global warming since humans always evolve to survive their problems. It???s too late to stop climate change, but a technological fix is bound to come along when we need it.Debunking Claim: It is not too late to stop climate change. There are many things that can be done to slow or lessen the effects of global warming. Plus, relying on a technological cure-all, which isn???t close to existing, is terribly foolish and negligent.Rebunking Claim: Disney has already confirmed a sequel to their movie Frozen. I don???t think it???s that big of a leap to assume",100
298," that Frozen 2 won???t be a movie at all, but some sort of quasi-magical weather altering device that will combat Earth???s rising temperatures with Disney-On-Ice beams of concentrated cold. Of course such a device could go out of control and bring about a new ice age, but that???s where Frozen 3: The Inferno Machine will step in. That will just be a movie, but we???ll be able to watch it from our snowed-in homes, and I???m sure it will be fun.- -Conspiracy Claim: With over 20 billion dollars spent annually around the world on climate change research and initiatives, it???s clear that global warming was invented solely for the financial gain of members and lobbyists of the environmental industry.Debunking Claim: Vast amounts of money are needed to change Earth???s infrastructure away from burning fossil fuels and towards green energy solutions. This isn???t about money. It???s about saving the planet.Rebunking Claim: If we bribe global warming enough, it???ll go away. Just like what happened with Y2K.Quilt Made From High School Track & Field Sweatshirts That Meant A Lot To MeNothing is better than snuggling up under a warm quilt.  After we broke up, Suzanne took my old track & field sweatshirts from high school (that cannot be replaced) and used scissors to cut them into long, thin strips.  You can weave the strips into a quilt, or do like Suzanne did and just leave them in a pile on my bed.Customizable Wall Art That Reminds Me I Need to Change the LocksUse your computer to create stencils and paint a fun or inspiring message onto your wall.  Something like ENJOY TODAY or BELIEVE.  Suzanne went with YOU SAID YOU LOVED ME FUCKER, which is not really fun or inspiring but it sure is a message.  Make sure to pick a cool font!  For a more rustic look, forgo the stencils (like Suzanne did) and spray paint the message directly onto the wall in a fit of rage.Lampshade Decoupaged With Pictures of Suzanne Making Out With My Best Friend PaulThis one will definitely turn some heads.  Use a strong adhesive to paste photographs onto an old lampshade.  You can find a cheap one on Craigslist. The end result is really something else!  When people see it, they???ll say things like, ???This is the worst day of my life,??? ???Paul has been my best friend since third grade,??? and ???Suzanne is a monster.???Wine Bottle Accent LightsInsert LED light bulbs into empty wine bottles to make these unique accent lights.  Take the wine from these bottles and pour it down your throat so you don???t have to think about what a shitty friend Paul is.Mason Jar VaseRepurposing mason jars is popular right now, and for good reason.  It???s super fun!  For this one, fill a mason jar about halfway with dirt, then pick some colorful flowers to plant in them. Alternately, you can skip the flowers (like Suzanne did) and just dump the dirt over the head of your ex???s Tinder date.DIY Mosaic Mirror FrameUse pieces of discarded tiles to create a mosaic around your favorite mirror all while convincing your new partner that Suzanne has moved on and everything is fine now.  When you???re done, take a look in the mirror and OH MY GOD SUZANNE IS STANDING RIGHT BEHIND YOU IN A WEDDING DRESS.Beaded Necklace(Wait a Second These Aren???t Beads They???re Human Teeth)Jesus Christ.  It???s been almost a year, Suzanne.  I moved and rented this apartment under a fake name.  How did you find me?  Whose teeth are these???Macaroni Picture FrameUse a hot glue gun to secure pieces of elbow macaroni to a store-bought picture frame.  While the hot glue gun warms up, experience occasional bursts of deranged laughter followed by long periods of intense weeping.  Realize the constant state of fear your life has become is causing your sanity to slip away from you.  Is Suzanne real?  Was it all a bad dream?  Eat the leftover dry pasta and hide in a closet until it feels safe to come out.Every atom of my blood, form???d in the soil of this earth, runs hot As I wheel through this snaked monster of steel, The Steamin??? Demon.O shit! Holy shit! I was not expecting that loop de loop. Woah! Anyways. Still joined are we, in this melded wagon of thrill, As action-seekers and comrades who???What the fuck was that? That turn was most unnatural and jerky. I suppose that last maneuver was tailored for the most crazed thrill junkies aboard. Swift sweeping clusters of revelation! Plunging into pockets of the earth???s belly, andShooting up into the blue and white woven infinity of the sky! How I???Fuck ME! These loopy loops are IN-SANE. Whooey! Wahooey! Gliding at breakneck speedThrough this mazy Demon was alone worth the price of an all-inclusive day pass, A cost so steep, it quite nearly outstrips the plummet I am thundering down at present! Whoo!The fire in my breast, is the same fire that burns in the womb of the stars,The very fire which excites the passion of young children, most notably those two kidsSitting in the front row of this crazy train???I see you up there! Whoop! Whoop!Sweet passion! What a corkscrew???to feel as if being unplugged from the wineOf the universe and spilling forth unto the celestial oceans from whence we sprang.I???m going to shit my pants if that???s a water park over there. Divinity intervene, hurl me From this mirage! Excuse me, fellow rider, do you know if this day pass is goodFor the water park?Steven Wright didn???t invent one-liners???or wait, did he?Wright is such an original, primal, bonkers performer that he could be some sort of wandering immortal, sent on a mission from Odin to enlighten and amuse us mere mortals. Maybe Wright did invent one-liners, thousands of years ago. The man is such a unique comedy treasure that I would believe anything.The key to Wright???s humor is literalism: glorious literalism. Wright takes words seriously and specifically in ways that turn everyday thoughts and terms into bouncy castles in a carnival of absurdity. Such literalism could wreak havoc at a casino: ???A while ago, I was in Las Vegas at the roulette table having a furious argument over what I considered to be an odd number.??? The beauty of this simple statement is it makes you imagine a whole comedy sketch???or perhaps Harold Pinter play???in your head. I like to think that in an alternate universe another Steven Wright is explaining to casino workers why 8 is the oddest number, because it???s also the infinity sign, and what???s odder than no limits?For Wright, even a plain phrase like ???writing a book??? can take on an oddball meaning that no one else noticed before: ???I???m writing a book. I have the page numbers done; now I just have to fill in the rest.??? This smart humor would likely bomb in the hands of a lesser comic, but Wright???s gruff, monotone, semi-depressed, weirdo persona gives those lines weight and reality. When Wright says??????I went to a tourist information booth and said ???tell me about some people who were here last year?????????it???s not just clever; it???s creepy and believable.When Wright isn???t taking existing terms literally, he mashes them together into new combinations, some of which might someday appear at the Westminster Dog Show: ???I got a new dog. He???s a paranoid retriever. He brings back everything because he???s not sure what I threw him.??? Many jokes are absurd self-revelations, such as ???I???m writing an unauthorized autobiography??? and ???I???m also part of the Jehovah???s Witness program.??? In some of those jokes, the simple Koan-like combination is enough. But others set up a beautiful punch line: ???My nephew has HDADD: high-definition attention-deficit disorder. He can barely pay attention, but when he does it???s unbelievably clear.???As with Mitch Hedbe",100
299,"rg???the top contender to Wright???s one-liner throne???Wright can make you see everyday objects in new ways: ???For my birthday, I got a humidifier and a dehumidifier. I put ???em in the same room. Let ???em fight it out.??? To the normal human mind, there???s not a lot of humor to be mined from a humidifier or dehumidifier, but Wright???s mind isn???t on the same landmass as normal. Where you or I see only boring gizmos, he sees two opposing forces, two mortal enemies who should duke it out: the Jedi and Sith of moisture.So what???s his Best Joke Ever? Even Odin???s ravens couldn???t say for sure. It could be this concise thought: ???24-hour banking? I don???t have time for that.??? That???s one of the cleverest of his literal jokes. Another of my personal top ten: ???I???m living on a one-way dead end street. I don???t know how I ever got there.???But I have to go with this gem, because it fits perfectly into Wright???s persona, while showing a glint of optimism that is ridiculous and poignant:???I got a paper cut from writing my suicide note. It???s a start.???I love jokes about suicide. What???s funnier than suicide? OK, everything. But I live by the words of the great Joan Rivers, who had this to say to a heckler who didn???t appreciate a Helen Keller joke because his son was deaf: ???Oh, you stupid ass. Let me tell you what comedy is about??? Comedy is to make everyone laugh at everything, and deal with things. You idiot. My mother is deaf, you stupid son of a bitch.???This suicide joke stands out from Wright???s long resume of great absurd jokes because it???s great, absurd, and real: it???s easy to imagine his character trying to kill himself incompetently. Then, it???s easy to imagine his character getting that paper cut and feeling not a stab of annoyance, but a flicker of optimism. Maybe enough optimism to put the note away and join the Jehovah???s witness protection program or hang out with his HDADD nephew. Sometimes, that???s enough.1. Be 23.In a perfect world, you are 23 and have read enough David Foster Wallace to start getting interested in Bolano and some of the South American fabulists who are known for their meaty paragraphs and sentences built link upon link upon link. You may have graduated from a college ??? do poor people write maximalist fiction, or is it only for the luxury class? ??? where a professor convinced you to read some of this South American fiction in the original. This did not, actually, do you any favors. It ruined your ability to pronounce ???Borges??? and ???Cortazar??? without sounding like a pompous windbag. You will forever be the lonely person at the party, breathlessly asking strangers, ???So, what did you think of Tristram Shandy???? This is not a good way to meet people, but you???re 23 and you don???t know that. Collect grudges, since you are the perfect age to take everything personally, and then catalogue them at great length in a thinly veiled autobiography that you???re thinking of rebranding as a pseudo-mnemonic parallel life memoir.2. Love your own voice. A lot.The sentences. Are so long. Longer than Proust, longer than a chain of Hebrew National sausages, longer than holiday dinners with people who don???t love you enough, longer than your high school girlfriend???s hair, longer than a page. You are 23 and you???ve just discovered that you can go on and on and on. You look at your idols, the ones that line your bookshelves with their girthy novels, and sigh. How do they do it? You wonder. You plunge forward into the story, figuring it???ll work itself out eventually, or maybe you???ll become famous for creating one of those endless, super meaningful novels about nothing. You get used to hearing yourself talk a lot. You wonder why nobody calls you, unless it???s your mother. You suspect that your friends are all secretly minimalists, or else avoiding you. Both of these statements may be true.3. It???s all about you.Yes, you, you precious starfish. They say, ???write what you know,??? and your 23-year-old ass is going to take that shit literally. Despite your tenuous grasp on your own personal reality, you may be emboldened by the amount of garbage that regularly appears in your Tumblr feed ??? essentially an endless scroll of unsendable text messages ??? and decide to emulate what you see. You may begin with your own personal experience, and then move on to your feelings about that experience, and your opinion of your feelings. You could do this shit indefinitely. And you will, because your experience is real and valid and true and although absolutely nobody wants to read the spool of self-centered jabbering you produce faithfully, that is not going to turn you away from sitting down to write every damn day. Because that???s what writers do.4. Take it seriously.Miss the point of every Pynchon novel you???ve gobbled up and opt to take your writing seriously. Yes, you are 23 and a Serious Writer. You flip to the author photo when you???re book shopping, and wonder if that person is younger than you, and what the odds are that you???ve missed your creative peak because you were busy trying to pass geometry or smoking weed on the lawn because it was a nice, sunny day. You only recourse is to redouble your efforts and your output. Never mind that you don???t know what your novel is about. Never mind that nobody wants to read it, and assiduously avoids eye contact when you mention what you may lovingly term The Work. Compensate for your relative youth and inexperience by writing about increasingly dark things, even though you yourself may never have been touched by real tragedy. Find ways to relate your personal problems to the things you???ve read about in other books, or seen in films directed by Angelina Jolie. There???s a formula for this, and involves building an elaborate web between how you choose to remember the past and all media you???ve been exposed to up to the present moment, which is like a library of meaningful shit, when you think about it in terms of yourself???since you are the center of this universe. For example. Your father maybe was mean to you once. And you read The Bluest Eye in college, during Banned Books Week when you were making a point to be seen reading controversial literature. And your best friend did a great short story that was kind of like ???Bluebeard??? but set on an island in the Caribbean, because she???s from Tobago and her authenticity gives her fiction the most enviable real-ness, which you pretend you don???t aspire to because maximalist fiction, you think, is about creating much from very little, a meringue of fiction, and you combine these three things and fluff it and fluff it until stiff peaks form and it ceases to be its ingredients and becomes something else, which doesn???t even approximate reality and is not funny but more like a horrible mashup of the things you think represent trauma. You think of James Frey and make a note to yourself not to market this as ???true.??? Unless the reader wants it to be true, you think, because really there???s nothing you can do about that. You???re just the Writer. You???re the vessel for The Work.5. Steal.Eventually, you will run out of steam. You will tire of talking about your own haphazard experience and at some point even your contrivances ??? incest, rape, arms deals, drug addiction, violence ??? will bore you. Reread your heroes and steal every fucking thing you read. Everything from Philip K. Dick to John Barth to William Gaddis, read and steal. You may own a vanity copy of Mrs. Dalloway or something, but it???s untouched. Avoid thinking about why there are no notable female maximalist writers???do women write maximalist",100
300," fiction, or is it only for the men, the truth-seekers, the genre-penetrators? ??? and focus on taking what you can. If you???re a man, resolve to do better than the writers you idealize, even as you admit that your effort will be a failure even if it ends in success. If you???re a woman, resolve to be the first of your kind, and ruminate endlessly on the accessories of womanhood, such as your child, your vibrator, your reproductive rights, your Women???s Studies syllabus, your menstrual cycle, your relationship with your mother. Steal from all sources. Don DeLillo baffles you, but Tao Lin does not. Confess to no one your sentimental love for Tom Robbins, from whom you steal unrepentantly.6. Finish What You StartWhether this was a NaNoWriMo novel, a thought experiment gone awry, an inspiration that wouldn???t burn out, or whatever, you will eventually run out of steam and ingredients and things to steal and lists and paragraphs and windy sentences with multiple parenthetical phrases and you???ve lost sight of the plot???s shore more than once and kind of drifted in and out of what you think you???re writing about???who cares, elevator pitches are so bourgeois, aren???t they? I mean who writes for profit ??? but now things are wrapping up and once you???ve slapped a few Joycean turns of phrase on it, you can more or less call it good. Once it???s done ??? and you can tell all your writer friends this ??? the real work of The Work begins. Unpicking the huge wad of whatever-it-is is significantly less fun than creating it, so let yourself drop off a bit. Mess around with a few sentences, get lost, convince no one to help you edit this thing into shape. By the time you worry out the burr in this nest of self-centered yarns, you???ll be 24. You???ll be done, and nearly cooked. You???ll be ready to move on.What they carried was winnowed as the time went by. Much of what seemed necessary in July of 2015 was, by the last week of January, gone. Now they carried only the things that were required of them. They carried red ties and blue-striped ties, fake tanner and bronzer, hairspray, a sports coat. They carried Sharpies, thick for signs and thin for photos. They carried black shoe polish and Kleenex. They carried flag pins. Some of them carried hand sanitizer. In their pockets, they carried carried a list of donors, with the names of their children in a slightly smaller type, so as not to get confused, and reminders that it???s MegYn, not MegAn, and the Koch brothers??? email address. They all knew it by heart, of course, but the mind can play tricks on a man who???s been on the campaign trail for too long. Better to have it in your pocket, just in case.They carried breath mints and gum, or the ones who didn???t have a body man did, which was most of them. They carried wallets, and in their wallets they carried photos, of their kids, and their dogs, and their wives, who were usually on trail themselves, lunching with the Kiwanis, always the Kiwanis. Some of them carried phones, and on those phones they carried a list of their medications, and Candy Crush, and the National Review???s app which they didn???t know had been discontinued, they???d been on trail for so long.Once, one of their phones had played the All Things Considered theme and everyone had looked around, shocked. Chris, sheepish, said, ???Oppo research.??? They carried baggies of old cookie crumbs from three towns before.They carried a sense of entitlement. They carried expectations, and hopes, and as the season wore on, they started to carry annoyances and grievances and dashed dreams. They all carried the memories of the men who???d left, of George, and Bobby, and the one with the girl???s name who they all called Cindy now. There were others, who no one remembered anymore. Only Rick remembered that there had been another Rick, who he called ???Glasses??? in his head, even though everyone else had just called them both ???Rick.???Ted, who had grown up in Texas and never let anyone forget it, carried a small Canadian flag with him, buried deep in his pocket where he thought no one would noticed it. At night, in the Marriott, he would take it out and wave it from the 23rd floor balcony, humming ???Oh Canada??? to himself. ???My home and?????? He would start to sing, but he wouldn???t finish. Someone told him that the Woman, Carly, had hidden cameras everywhere.Across the street, at the Holiday Inn, Rick carried his own things. The sweater vest, the one he???d worn last tour. Blue, starting to pill. It was too cold in Iowa for a sweater vest, but Rick carried it anyway, took it out and sniffed it from time to time.Mike carried a Bible, small, bound in fake leather. When they stopped to eat, sometimes, he would read aloud from it, and some of them were glad to hear it and seemed to listen, but the Sergeant only said, ???Shut up, Mikey, geez, ya idiot.??? Don was the Sergeant, and what he said goes. Mike hated him, but what could he do? They had to follow the Sergeant.Ben had a lucky quarter in his back pocket. He???d talk to anyone about that quarter, show how it was made the year he was born, talk about the pyramid on the back, with the eye.???It watches us, guys,??? he???d say. ???It???s the eye of God.??????Oh my God, this fucking weirdo,??? the Sergeant would say. ???There???s no pyramid on the back of a quarter!???But Ben didn???t care. He???d just put the quarter back in his pocket. He was getting out in March, they all knew. No one ever said it.Marco carried the lyrics of ???Freebird,??? given to him by a young woman in a Ronald Reagan T-shirt in Concord, New Hampshire. Sometimes he looked at it. Rand watched him, and thought, He???s never listened to Skynyrd in his life. Those lyrics were for me.They all called Jeb ???Point.??? It had been ???Jeb Exclamation Point??? and then ???Exclamation Point??? and now it was just ???Point.??? Marco liked to go back and walk with Point, who always brought up the rear. ???We don???t really need to be doing this,??? Point said. ???Schelpping ourselves all over. We could do all the primaries in one day. Two, tops.??? It sounded crazy, to hear it like that, but Marco thought Point was dreaming of a better, different world.In the meantime, they marched. They marched to Des Moines and Cedar Rapids and Iowa City and Davenport. They marched to Ames and Dubuque and Sioux City. They marched to Waterloo, which Point thought was pretty funny, though no one else laughed. They marched to Manchester and Concord and Portsmouth and Nashua and Dover. On and on and on they marched.???This can???t be worth it,??? Chris said to the group one day. ???Can it????Not quite answering him, Johnny K. looked into the distance and said, ???When I get home, I???m grabbing my golf clubs and heading straight to the green.??????Of course, it???s worth it,??? the Sergeant said. ???What the hell is the matter with you, moron? Who wouldn???t want to be President of the United States???? He stomped off.Every man nodded and kept moving. But Marco thought about something George had said to him just before he left ??? ???Any man who wants it has to be insane??? ??? and stopped to watch the men trudge on, forward, always forward, through the mud and through time. Maybe George was right he thought. But the moment passed, and he straightened his tie, pulled his stump speech from his pocket, and continued on trail, too.Portrait by Kelly Bjork- -Christie wears a majorette???s jacket with gold-braided epaulets when we meet. Her hair is smooth and blond, her clothes are black and stylish, and her manner is chatty and feminine. Before this, I???d seen her around with her boyfriend Raven, whom she refers to as he",100
301,"r husband, though they were never officially married. Today they are no longer together, she tells me repeatedly. She says she???s a forensic accountant. ???I???d do the paperwork for stuff like the Enron scandal,??? she said, and we go over her other basics. Christie hasn???t undergone formal disaster training, but she grew up having to help her parents study for their yearly exams. ???My mom was the first flight attendant hired at Alaska Airlines,??? said Christie. ???My family calls her the Bionic Woman. She had to have some surgeries. Her hands are metal. So are her knees and shoulders. Her fingers will be next, and her toes. The turbulence makes your joints give out a lot faster,??? she said. ???My dad was a lieutenant in the fire department for 45 years. He carried a gun. I don???t like guns, but that???s how it was. He told me to always know my exits and count the people in the clubs. He???s seen some bad stuff ??? crazy fires in bars, and bottlenecks, and people getting burned alive,??? she said.Christie and I talk over dinner, and I???ve brought her police statement, which she???d given only a couple hours after the shooting. It happened a couple years ago now, so it???s good to have a template. We eat salads, and as I read aloud, I ask Christie to fill in details. As her story begins, she???d arrived at the Twilight with Raven for Sunday-night karaoke. They sat at a table in the dining area with a couple friends. When the gun sounded, ???people started screaming. I thought it was coming from the transients that hang out in front of the building, and maybe something happened to one of them. At first I was gonna go help whoever got shot. I could handle whatever that was, whether it was CPR or a tourniquet or whatever needed to happen. I was mid-launch to go run out there. Then I saw the man enter. He was carrying a gun,??? she said.In Christie???s statement, she???d described James to police as a height-weight proportionate Caucasian with some ???color to his skin??? and blond or sandy-brown hair. He was wearing baggy blue jeans with a light wash and a cream-colored thermal shirt, and ???he had his arm extended as if to open fire,??? she said.???I should???ve grabbed his gun. I should???ve stood in his way. Maybe he wouldn???t have died,??? she said to me, looking back, and then continued. ???I told my friends to get down on the floor. I flipped the tables for coverage and my husband wrestled me down, so I???d get on the floor. Then I wrestled him back down so he???d get on the floor. All I was worried about was protecting Raven. Raven always had to be dominant, and he???s not. I just knew he wouldn???t have been able to handle himself in the situation. I thought James was going to shoot everybody in the bar. I was sure we were gonna die. I thought maybe the bullet would go through me, and Raven would stay alive. I didn???t want him to die. That was more important.???As James crossed the room, Christie said, ???he looked down at me. We had a moment. We???d locked eyes and he raised the gun in a way that meant, ???Stay away.?????? James disappeared into the lounge, then Christie sprang up and raced to an emergency exit door she???d spotted in the corner of the dining room. Christie thinks it might???ve been locked, but ???my dad had taught me how to kick exit doors open. You have to kick the bar directly. There???s some weird mechanism I guess they put in the doors, for that reason,??? she said. When it swung open, ???I bolted. I was the first one out. It felt like I was running for my life. I remember telling myself, ???Just keep running when you get shot in your back.??? Some people followed me once they saw me leave. We didn???t know how many shooters were after us.???After she got outside, Christie sprinted around, issuing commands. ???I was screaming to call 911. I instructed the people that were straggling, telling them where to go and where to hide. I shoved a bunch of people into the supermarket next door. I remember I felt so bad for the guy in the wheelchair. He was just rolling around, probably in a drunken stupor, not knowing what happened. I ran to a neighbor???s house. It was a little yellow house, or gold. An ugly ???70s color. The neighbors never came out. I think they were in bed. No one would answer the door. It was Sunday night. In hindsight, though, would you? I wouldn???t! Look at this neighborhood.???Christie heard another gunshot from inside the building. ???At that point I thought my friend Amy was dead. I thought he???d done it. I remember hearing her scream. I recognized her voice. But later I found her. She was hiding under my jeep. I had to get her out from under it. She was traumatized. She had no ability to talk. She wouldn???t respond to me.???As Christie made her way back to the market, she encountered Raven on the street. He was demanding that James exit the bar and fight Raven in person. ???I heard my insane husband yelling, across the way. Just yelling and yelling. I told him to get the f down. He told me to get the f down. He was nuts. He was so fucking nuts. I thought it meant there were more shooters, but it was all him. It was all so weird. He made the whole thing about him,??? she said.When Christie returned to the store, more witnesses had gathered inside. ???I thought bullets were gonna come through the walls. I told everyone to get down and stay away from the walls, but they all looked at me like I was on crack. I asked the owner if he had a shotgun or a baseball bat or anything. I had full intent on killing someone. I was going to try to stop whatever was going on. Had the store guy had something I could???ve used, I would???ve gone back into the bar. But he didn???t. So I left and went straight up the street until I found the cops. I ran as fast as I could towards the sirens, waving the police down. I was met head-on by an officer.???Christie???s statement reveals what she told the police. ???I said they needed to take the perpetrator out immediately, that this was Columbine. I knew he had a Glock, and he was already killing people. I told them again what he was wearing. They ran after him and opened fire and did not leave him alive. They told me they were really happy the description was so clear, so they could take him out right away.??? As Christie and I revisit this exchange, she grows somber. ???It???s kinda my fault James got killed. Because I knew the cops, and I ran to meet them."" Christie had previously met the cops through her dad, she said. ""I gave them precise details, like my father trained me to do. I told them to shoot on sight, and they did,??? she said. I mention the police collected descriptions from several witnesses, not just Christie, before they moved into the building. And they claim to have fired at James only after he shot at them first. Even still, Christie firmly accepts full blame. ???They were my friends, so they trusted my opinion. I can???t forgive myself. Having a man shot is not my idea of something I would???ve ever done,??? she said.Christie asks me what happened to James???s girlfriend Whitney after he shot her. ???From the case files, it looks like she was hit in each leg, above the knee. I don???t know how serious the wounds were, but they were non-fatal,??? I said.???Darn,??? said Christie. I wait for her to continue. ???People should consider who they???re having their children with. That???s all I have to say. And Child Protective Services needs to be way more active, because this isn???t the first time this happened at the bar with that couple,??? she said.This subject has come up with other witnesses, to a differing response.

302,"der???s view: ???If there were multiple interactions between this couple and the police, that only proves the police methods aren???t effective in the long term. We don???t have a society that supports people talking about their own interpersonal violence, and we don???t have a network beyond the domestic-violence shelters that are only accessible to people once they???ve gotten to a certain point. We need to change our dialogue, develop trust, and shift conditions in people???s lives,??? said Ryder.Back to Christie. I tell her I haven???t talked to Whitney yet, but I???ve found a couple of her mug shots. One involves a recent DUI in Idaho. ???I guess I???d drink myself silly too if I had my boyfriend killed and his dog killed,??? Christie said, though to me it???s unclear if the latter is really what happened. James???s motive to shoot Whitney wasn???t covered extensively in court, but multiple witnesses heard James announcing his dog had been killed by someone, and he seemed to believe Whitney was responsible. The case files contained pictures of James???s apartment taken the night of the shooting, but nothing in any photographs suggested a dog had recently died. Not in James???s home, at least. I???ve contacted a friend of James and a relative of James, but neither responded to my request for an interview.???It???s crazy how much the shooter reminds me of me,??? said Christie as we finish up. ???All I can think is, he was a Virgo like I am. His birthday is four days after mine. We both had pit bulls. My pit bull Ocean is dead, so I understand James???s plight. I love my dog just like James loved his. If you lose your dog, you kind of have no reason to live. And having a crazy partner. When your ex is mad and deranged and making your life a living hell, it???s just darkness in your soul. The poor guy. I???m not ashamed. If I???d known about the dog and what was going on with this awful girlfriend he had, I would have helped him,??? she said.???Appropriate That Funky Music, White Boy??????Killing Me Softly (With His Burning Man Stories)??????I???ve Been Through the Rapidly Desertifying Grasslands On a Horse With No Name??????The Man Who Sold the World is Shutting Down Your SuperPAC, Jeb??????I Shot the Sheriff, and Somehow It Was Totally Legal Because I Live in Texas??????Consciously Uncoupling is Hard to Do??????You???re So Vain, You Probably Just Wrote a Smug Blog Post Titled ???No, Carly Simon, I Don???t Think This Song is About Me.?????????I Fought the Law, and the Law Was Rewritten to My Lobbyists???

And the Internet was without form, and void; and God said, let there be Content; and there was Content. And God divided the content among Facebook and Twitter, YouTube and Instagram, Snapchat and Tumblr.And God said, Let the Content multiply at the hand of the people; it can really be anything.Even, just, like, playing yogurt cups like bongos, the Lord God said. Or reviewing a Bath and Body Works candle. It???s wide open.Except nipples, God added. Just women???s nipples are off limits.And God said, Let the Content be sponsored by all the brands of the earth; Nike and Adidas, Apple and Google, Scion and Ford, Always and Tampax, for Content might influence a primary sales objective.And God called up a great variety of baby animals ??? baby goats and baby elephants, baby kittens and baby puppies, baby koalas and baby sloths ??? and the Content multiplied among the people.And God said, Behold, I have laid out my belongings in a super organized way and shot it from above, to give my followers a fun creative snapshot of my lifestyle.And God left no inspirational quote unmatched with a lo-res image of flowers or water or sunsets.And God created YouTube stars, each after their kind, such as ???Unboxing??? and ???Reaction??? and ???Haul??? and ???Mouth Noises,??? and God saw that it was all pretty subpar across the board.And God told of 13 Potatoes that Look Like Channing Tatum.And God asked, Which Disney Princess are You? What Type of Emoji Are You? Who Would Play Your Best Friend in the Movie Version of Your Life?And God saw everything that he made, and kept scrolling. And scrolling. And scrolling.This here is your basic black trim, three-pocket system fanny pack with zipper closure, moisture protection, cotton webbing, and an extra thick waistband. See this? It???s a snap waist buckle ??? dual pins, side release. In. Out. That???s how it works. In. Out. No hesitation. If you???re good, and you practice, you get this baby off in four, maybe three seconds.Feel like calling it a ???waist-bag??? now? Didn???t think so. You may refer to it with terms of endearment in any of the following ways. The ???fanny pack.??? Aka the ???waist wallet.??? Aka the ???belly bag.??? Aka the ???bum bag.??? Aka the ???Purple Potato.??? Aka the ???Gunslinger.??? Aka the ???True Believer.???Top-stitched seams ensure nothing???s getting in, and nothing???s getting out. That???s called property insurance. If you get in a brawl, a game of handball, or an impromptu tussle with a lady, ain???t nothing getting out. Capeesh? Say it. Say capeesh. Good.This model is called, ???The Roy Rogers??? and it???s from Brussels. It???s designed from a rare blend of polyester-nylon, meaning it???s waterproof, sweatproof, flameproof, greaseproof, tamperproof, and it will repel insects, hairless babies, and small cats from your body.Look here. Hold it in your hands. It???s a little on the heavy side. See? How much do you think it weighs? I???ll tell you. Ten point six. That???s ounces, not pounds. Is that too much fanny for you? Can you handle that? That???s a lotta belt satchel for a dumbass.This one???s been through hell and back. Don???t let the pleasing tint, hues, and shades of the neon fool you. It???s a glam trick. This is a man???s work pack. Treat it with respect.Every day you wake up your goal is to survive life. And you only have your wits and your pack. These days you kids are all video games, Netflix, and i-bullshit. And you don???t wear socks. I don???t get that. When I was a kid, I wore socks all the time. See here? This is where your keys go. Open. Clip. Release. Keys are protected. Clutch, right?You should be writing this down. Memorize everything I tell you. Then burn it.It???s very, very important to me to have a minimal amount of clutter in my pants pockets. Personally, I sew mine shut. A wallet in the back pocket is out of the question. That will throw off your alignment. Once your alignment is thrown off then, you become lopsided ??? permanently.See how I walk now? It???s good, right? Smooth. Not gonna lie. I???m a known hot dogger. My style???s a little loose. That???s cause I like to strut. I???m a big-dog. But I earned that. You don???t know shit yet. You might never know shit. I don???t need no lopsided bullshit posture from a bullshit wallet. You think I???m going to spend my change on a chiropractor?Listen up. Here are a few things you can put in the pack: gum, money, nail clippers, Tabasco sauce, cockt",100
303,"ail sauce, shucking tools, small laser pointer, mini-binoculars, dog treats, first-aid kit, extra shoelaces, glue stick, sunglasses, macadamia oil, cool pictures, combs, small scissors, toothpicks, can opener, pedometer, small juice boxes, extra headbands, extra socks, identification, sticks, filet knife, bottle opener, toothpaste, and beef jerky.You paying attention? Good. Let???s talk change. Once it gets loose, you think it???s just a game. But it???s not a game. Change is money, and I don???t have time to be losing change. Which is where the three-pocket system comes in. You see the back zipper here? It leads to a hidden pocket ??? a pocket perfectly sized for my oval squeeze coin purse. So when I get change, the coins go into the oval squeeze coin purse, and the oval squeeze purse goes into this pocket here in the back. Don???t look at my money. That???s my money. See this. That???s a silver dollar. You???ll probably never see one of those ever again.When you get your own f-pack someday, they come in acid-wash, shiny gold, shiny silver, classic denim, different color patterns, tribal patterns, and of course, neon. Start thinking about it now. Cause your pack color, texture, and pattern should be a reflection of who you are as a person, and what kind of man you want to be. Understand? One request. Don???t be a baby, never ask for the vegan leather trim, that???s for suckers.One more thing. Get a back-up. Backups are clutch. You???re going to have to wash this bad boy every once and awhile. Have some respect for it. You wash your underwear don???t you? Don???t you? Well, then wash your damn fanny pack. Get a backup so you don???t have to go out there like an idiot with nothing to carry your tools.I guess that???s it. Welcome to a hands-free lifestyle, devoid of clutter, minimal pocket distractions, and zero bullshit. Remember, it???s not a pouch. You???re not a damn kangaroo. This is your fanny pack. Now go get your Uncle Larry a beer.1. Assume Steve stands on a 22-degree slope deep within a Japanese website, sliding from passing interest towards deeper curiosity. The coefficient of friction is 0.01; it???s a slippery slope. Steve weighs 80kg, and his growing, inexorable guilt adds another 5kg. Calculate his acceleration towards full-on addiction.2. Three tentacles extend towards Fumiko. Assume they are cylinders with diameters of 0.4m and lengths of 3m. If they can contract their diameter to 0.25m, will the change in length allow them to reach Fumiko? What if she squirms 20cm further away? Poisson???s ratio = 0.32.3. Mary throws a laptop at Steve???s head, while screaming about how the children could have found ???his filth.??? It leaves her hands at a 35-degree angle, traveling at 3 m/s. Calculate how long it takes to hit Steve, who stands 4.2m away, though the rift in their marriage is far, far larger.4. Steve wakes to a car pulling from the driveway and runs outside. He starts out 20m behind the car and accelerates at 3.5m/s2 to a top speed of 5m/s, while Mary accelerates the car at 2.8m/s2 to a top speed of 20m/s. Will he get within 10m of the car (close enough to see his children one last time through the rear window)?5. Steve is forced to borrow money from a loan shark in order to keep the house. When he can???t make his payments, the shark???s associates pay him a visit. If a baseball bat with a mass of 765g strikes Steve???s fingers and the contact area is 2cm2, calculate the swing speed needed to break the fingers. Assume the collision is perfectly elastic, and justify your values for the viscoelasticity of bone for a 54-year-old white male with a drinking problem and mild osteoporosis.NARRATOR: Today on Objectivist House Hunters, we join Jack and Rachel as they search for a new house with their realtor, Ayn Rand. They are looking for a home with a modern kitchen for Rachel, a foodie; a home office for Jack, a graphic designer; a room for Rachel to display her antique doll collection; and enough space for their two Great Danes, Chipper and Duke.HOUSE 1NARRATOR: They begin at House 1, a restored plantation house.AYN: This house was built in 1835 but, as you can see, the antiquated design elements suggest the work of a second-rate architect in love with the past who never had an original thought in his wasted life.JACK: There???s plenty of room for the dogs to run around. I like that.RACHEL: Nice hardwood floors. And these high ceilings are great. I love the plasterwork! Is it original?AYN: The age of the plaster has no bearing on its value. The only measure of its worth is the price freely negotiated with the craftsman who created it.RACHEL: The old-world charm of it is wonderful.AYN: I would rip it out.JACK: The appliances are modern, and I love the granite countertops, but it???s kind of cramped.RACHEL. When we entertain, our friends often end up gathered in the kitchen.AYN: The kitchen is cramped because the builder was an antebellum slaveowner. Everything here is based on a system of coercion and racism, the crudest form of collectivism. Conformity to a racist tradition does not constitute a human identity. This building is the emblem of a depraved society, and no home for free men.JACK: That spare bedroom would make a good home office.AYN: This house is a moral crime.HOUSE 2NARRATOR: House 2 is more modern, built in 1957.AYN: This house is above your price range, but I brought you here anyway, because your values are misplaced.JACK: The kitchen is big and modern.RACHEL: The living room is a good size, too, but it doesn???t have the warmth and charm of the last house.JACK: Yeah, it???s kind of cold.AYN: If the heating is insufficient, warm yourselves with the flame of your ideas and the heat of your cigarettes.JACK: We don???t smoke.NARRATOR: The second floor is also not quite what Jack and Rachel are looking for.AYN: Look at the layout of this bedroom: Simple. Clean. Perfect for rational, passionate lovemaking.RACHEL: It???s so plain! My doll collection would look out of place here.AYN: What you call plain is properly called rational. This house is a reflection of the reason of man. Reason integrates man???s perception by forming abstractions, raising man???s knowledge from the perceptual level of animals to the conceptual level that he alone can reach. This house has a reason and beauty that no palace can match. Your dolls are trash.JACK: I???m not sure the yard is big enough for Chipper and Duke. They need a lot of room to run.AYN: Your dogs are useless parasites. Sell them to someone who can put them to productive use.HOUSE 3NARRATOR: House 3 is a tiny house, recently built. At 425 square feet, it???s a tight squeeze, but the low asking price would let Jack and Rachel have more money for travel.AYN: This house is absurdly small, and its aesthetic is an offense to decency. You asked me to bring you here: as your agent, I complied.RACHEL: Sometimes I just want to simplify my life, you know? This house might be perfect for that.JACK: I???m not sure we need a bigger space to store more stuff.AYN: Run for your life from any man who tells you that possessions are evil. That sentence is the leper???s bell of the approaching looter.JACK: I love the woodwork, though.RACHEL: Yeah, I like the rustic charm of this place.[AYN lights a cigarette.]NARRATOR: Inside, they confront the realities of a tiny house.JACK: The kitchen is modern.RACHEL: I???m not sure I???d have enough room to cook in here. Does it even have a dishwasher?AYN: It does not. This kitchen is a den of toil and backwardness.RACHEL: It???s clever how they fit this closet underneath the stairs for storage.JACK: But the ceiling here in the loft is really low. And it???s small for a master bed",100
304,"room.AYN: No man who sleeps in this room deserves to call himself master.JACK: I???m still afraid there???s not enough room for the dogs.AYN: I tell you again: sell those dogs. Or kill them.RACHEL: It???s small, sure, but I feel like we could make it work.AYN: This house is for poor people.CONCLUSIONRACHEL: So, let???s look at our options. The first house was charming and historic.JACK: It was also within our budget, and had enough room for my home office.AYN: A looter???s palace, built on the corrupt philosophy of a dead culture.JACK: True, but I loved the hardwood floors.RACHEL: What about the tiny house? There???s something to be said for having fewer possessions cluttering up our lives.AYN: To discuss evil in a manner implying neutrality is to sanction it.JACK: How about the second house? I liked the layout.RACHEL: But it???s over our budget.AYN: You are undertaking the highest transaction: the acquisition of property. If you love this house, if you love your lives, you must value them appropriately. Anything else is a compromise with death.RACHEL: But how can we afford it?AYN: You have but one choice.THREE MONTHS LATERNARRATOR: Jack and Rachel chose the modern house.RACHEL: I wasn???t sure at first about the design, but I???ve come to appreciate its moral rightness.JOHN: I???ve taken up smoking.NARRATOR: They made some changes to meet the asking price.RACHEL: Jack quit the design business and opened a steel mill.JACK: Men were happy to work for me at low wages, because we agreed that the value of their labor was small.NARRATOR: After selling the dogs and doll collection, they could afford the downpayment.JACK: I miss Chipper and Duke sometimes, but I???m sure they???re happier now that the have jobs, guarding that junkyard.RACHEL: Once we rid ourselves of possessions that had no rational value and maximized our earning potential in the marketplace, getting the downpayment together was easy!NARRATOR: They paid in gold.Dear Charles Darwin and God,For over a half a century, I looked in the mirror each morning and saw a pair of hairless ears ??? admittedly oversized, but nonetheless, utterly and completely without hair.  And, between the three of us, that was just fine with me. Then on an otherwise mundane Tuesday, out of nowhere, a solitary hair popped out on the side of my left ear.  I sleepily gazed at my reflection and almost without pause thought ???Hmm, that???s odd.???  I then yanked out the offender and went about my day.What I didn???t know was that there had been a shift in the cosmic balance and soon this sort of thing would be no longer be ???odd??? at all.  In fact, it would be the opposite??? it would be routine.  The perimeter had been breached and there was no going back.  Slowly and inexorably, like a shuffling zombie hoard, they made their way to my ears.  At first, it was just a couple a month ??? ???no big deal??? I thought, ???just remain vigilant.???  But, no, they just kept coming??? and coming ??? in every growing numbers.  Now, they???re fucking everywhere ??? tops, sides, lobes, even down in the canal.At a time in my life when my hairline retreats toward the back of my head like the Union army at Bull Run, hair sprouts out of my ears like a game of ???Whack a Mole??? gone horribly wrong.   Suddenly, a routine of auricular depilation has become a part of my daily existence and I don???t want to be rude, but I think someone owes me an explanation.Mr. Darwin, what possible reason does your theory provide?    How do my increasingly hairy ears make me a better ???fit??? at this stage of my life?    Did they make my ancestors more likely to survive when they were cast out because they could no longer contribute to the tribe?   I suppose warm ears could have been of some value in that situation.  At least until they were viciously dismembered and eaten by something that they could no longer hear coming and was too fast to escape anyway.Or, maybe, just maybe, this follicular armageddon is simply a way of ensuring that old farts like me don???t pass their worn out sperm on to any young female members of the species who might be out there wandering about.   Believe me, I know.  I???ve been there ??? talking to the attractive young woman sitting beside me on the plane.   ???Are you OK???? she asks.   ???Sure, I???m fine, why???? I respond.   ???It???s just that you have a dried blood all over your ear??? she says.  The words ???Oh, thanks, it???s no big deal, I probably cut myself shaving??? spew forth from my mouth like the contents of Guy Fieri???s bowels on a Saturday morning.  Well done!  Human race saved!  Now, settle in for a long and very awkwardly quiet flight.What about you, God?  Can you clear things up for me?  Is it some sort of eternal punishment for what Adam did in The Garden?  The guy eats one apple and you lay this bullshit on me????  It???s a little harsh, don???t you think?  I mean, it was just an apple.  Plus, Eve was in on that deal too and I see plenty of women my age and all their ears look just fine.  Or, I suppose this could be simply proof that you have twisted sense of humor.  But, I already know about that.  I???m reminded of it during every 3 am trip to the bathroom, as I stare down and say ???Piss damn you, piss!???Maybe this is a straight up case of revenge ??? plain and simple Old Testament vengeance ??? against Darwin himself for developing the whole Theory of Evolution in the first place ??? now that I can understand.  The whole religion-versus-evolution thing certainly has caused a whole bunch of confusion and, if I may say, a considerably uproar among some segments of the human race.  At the very least, it has to be maddening to watch them be so ???right-wrong???/???black-white??? about it ??? no room for compromise, no shades of gray.  Who???d blame you for taking it out on Darwin?   I???ve seen pictures of the guy in his old age and it???s pretty clear you hit him with quite a set of earmuffs.Anyway, take your time, but I???d appreciate it if you two could sort it out among yourselves and get back to me.  However, for now, I???m going to have to close because I???ve got another letter to write. Sir Isaac Newton has some serious explaining to do about the flying squirrel in my pants that I used to call my scrotum.All the best, RussSmart FuneralCreative MocktailCamo CasualCorporate NudeFreakshow FestiveFundamentalist FormalCongregational CasualNip Slip ChicTurn of the Century RacistProhibition DesperateFifty & FrumpyAmbidextrousGrisly GlamourDivorce Settlement ChicExpression-less (Botox mandatory)Black(ish) TieTwist TieMai TieTie DieZombie FabulousHats OnlyGender OptionalCocktail SheikDo you have everything? Homework? Lunch? Field trip money?I love you.I remember that one of the Sandy Hook parents said that they took comfort in the fact that they had seen their child off to school that morning ??? you know that morning ??? and said, ???I love you.??? So before their first grader was gunned down in her classroom, she knew that she was loved. I bet they all did though.But just in case, I love you.We???ve talked about all kinds of scary things, like I???ve told you never to get into a car with anyone you don???t know and don???t ever believe that an adult needs your help finding a puppy or a kitten. Also: no one will ever give you a free iPad or Legos from their car, that???s just not how the world works.But for some reason, amidst all the talk of stranger danger and pedophiles, cancer and dying, and me sheepishly asking your friends??? parents if they have a gun in the house, we haven???t really talked about one of the scariest things of all. Those lockdown drills you???re always having at school? No one???s bei",100
305,"ng straight with you about those. They???re to prepare you in case someone decides to come into your school and murder you, your friends, your principal, the secretaries, and teachers before killing himself (it???s pretty much always a him). Sorry about that.I love you.I know that may sound scary, but what you need to remember is that this country was founded on freedom. And that includes the freedom of all people (sane, crazy, whatever) to have unchallenged access to guns that are capable of executing at least 20 first graders or 12 moviegoers or 9 of the faithful at a church service or even a baby asleep in her car seat. This is very, very important in terms of staying true to the principles and spirit upon which this country was founded. Just ask the Internet.I love you.Also: I think the real victims here are the politicians, how can they be expected to do what???s morally right when they lost their way, not to mention their souls, so very long ago? These politicians ??? most of whom have children, grandchildren, maybe even great grandchildren of their own ??? have no qualms about walking past grief-stricken parents who clutch photos of their murdered children to their chests and telling them in so many words, ???You don???t have to go home but you can???t cry here.???They have to know, deep down, that what they???re doing is wrong and the world certainly knows that what they???re doing is wrong but they put their suits on like it???s any other job or maybe they???re convinced that they???re righteous people doing God???s work. But they are no more doing God???s work than the ones who have pulled the trigger over and over again.And again.And yet again.Ad infinitum.I love you.I???m sorry, I wish I had better news. But let???s keep our sympathies where they belong ??? with the powerful and the armed. With those who feel threatened in the face of the most toothless efforts to hold back the bloodshed and those who believe scary monster stories about their guns being taken away. Let???s face it, it would be easier to take away the ocean or the stars. Did you know that there are more guns than people in this country? That means everyone in your class already has a gun with their name on it, so to speak. Maybe mention that at share time.I love you.You could also tell your class that sometimes when I hear a lot of ambulances and fire trucks go by, sirens filling the air with panic, I pay close attention to whether they???re heading in the direction of your school. And if they are, I check Twitter and our town hashtag and the fire department account to see if anyone???s mentioned your school. When I get the all clear I think, ???Someone else???s tragedy today, suckers!???And sometimes I wonder, what if one or both of you gets murdered at school? How will I ever forgive myself for sending you there? You know, to school. But do you want to know what makes me feel better? The fact that you could be massacred pretty much anywhere these days! Such a relief, right? So off you go!I love you.Yes I know, I know, you???re going to be late. Just to wrap up, our country has chosen to shift all of the weight regarding your safety away from our lawmakers and gun manufacturers and instead put it squarely on the shoulders of your principal and teachers. These people who kneel down on the first day of school so they???re just as tall as you. These people who shake your hand and say, ???Good morning!??? and help you rehearse for the spring concert and take you on field trips to see different rock formations ??? they are now in charge of keeping you from getting murdered. Which really is the least they can do for all that money they make.I love you.Oh hey, quick reminder, tell your teacher that I???ll be picking you up at 2 o???clock for your dentist appointment.And please don???t get murdered at school today.I love you.As an African-American Hispanic Jewish Catholic woman who experimented with homosexuality in her early twenties but ultimately married a Libertarian congressman from a key swing state, I am honored to accept both the Republican and Democratic nominations for Vice President!The more jaded among you may believe my running mates picked me to bring in votes from women, minorities, LGBTQs, the left, the right, the religious right, and the Hebrews. That couldn???t be further from the truth. They asked me to run because people are ready for an administration that will unite all of our diametrically opposed nation. They know that your contradictory values are my contradictory values.I have conveniently personal experience with either side of every divisive issue facing our democracy today, including immigration reform. My mother, a proud Jewish African-American, lost her college waitressing job to my father, who is a staunchly Catholic, staunchly undocumented immigrant from Mexico City. What other candidate can say that lax border security led to her family???s financial hardship and her conception?Most elected officials spend their entire careers focused on their home states. I, on the other hand, was born on a cross-country flight from California to New York. The doctors say I took my first breath at the exact midpoint between the purple mountain majesties and the amber waves of grain. The only home state I???ve ever known is America.Like other political figures before me, there is controversy surrounding my birth certificate. Yes, being delivered directly above the fruited plain, which straddles the Central and Eastern time zones, gives me two birthdays: December 31st, 1979, and January 1st, 1980. All that does is make me a Generation-Xer who works long hours and a YOLO-oriented millennial who spends the same number of hours on Facebook, Instagram, Tumblr, Snapchat, Reddit, Twitter, Vine, and, yes, even Google Plus.Before continuing, I???d like to take a brief moment to talk about my husband, since he made my delightfully high-polling family possible. We met as students at a prestigious politically neutral law school. The two of us got into a heated argument when I suggested pro-life and pro-choice aren???t mutually exclusive positions. He said, ???You???re crazy, and that???s coming from a Libertarian.??? I asked him, ???Why does a librarian need a law degree anyway???? I know what you???re thinking, and you???re right, I am funny for a woman. I wish I could grab a beer with me, too.Supreme Court Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Antonin Scalia officiated our wedding that summer. A year later, we had a beautiful set of mixed-gender twins. We knew that we had even more love to give, so we adopted an orphan from an unknown Asian or Pacific Island nation. I guess you can say we now have 2.5 children, which, coincidentally, is the average for American families according to the most recent census.I have heard many questions about our religious beliefs, and rightfully so. Allow me to explain. We practice both Catholicism and Judaism in equal measure. That???s a pretty holy weekend if you know what I mean! In all seriousness, when we have a crisis of faiths, like if the 7th night of Chanukah falls on Christmas Eve, I seek the counsel of our rabbi, our priest, and Tim, my agnostic spiritual advisor and campaign manager.Oh, the rumors are true, in an effort to gain the foreign policy chops necessary to deal with our enemies abroad, I???m raising my daughter as a Russian Muslim.To those voters who doubt my leadership abilities, I believe my diverse professional background proves that I am uniquely qualified to help run this republic. I???m CEO of a multinational pharmaceutical conglomerate, I operate an Etsy shop that sells locally mass-produced forks, and I just so happen to be the Gov",100

That means I know how to manage a publicly traded company, how to make ends meet as a small business owner in the 21st century, and how to bolster an economy that???s too reliant on a single product. What I did for Vermont and maple syrup, I will do for America and the military industrial complex.I stand before you as the vice-presidential candidate on both tickets and I promise that we will harmonize this land of liberty! We will restore her greatness through a transparently opaque government, loosely literal interpretations of the constitution, changing conservatively, and progressively staying exactly the same!Thank you, Gracias, Shalom, and Ni-Hao.May God, Adonai, Allah, and Black and White Jesus bless these United States of America!- -Comedy is sometimes perceived as an aggressive art form.  A full-contact sport.  One might therefore assume that the alpha-practitioners of the craft are mean-spirited, take-no-prisoners motherfuckers.  But in my experience, comedians are most often deeply soulful individuals who are skilled at cutting without drawing blood.  Or at least without leaving a permanent scar.  And that, in a nutshell, is why I believe Don Rickles is so beloved.  We the audience can see through to his true self.  The story of how I got Rickles??? classic comedy album Hello Dummy signed is one of my favorites.  Mostly because it is a tale of tremendous kindness.  (Spoiler alert: if you are the kind of person who insists on believing that big-time wrestling is real and don???t want your illusions shattered, stop reading now.)I formed my opinion of Don Rickles before I really knew his comic persona.  You see, over the years as a kid in Los Angeles, I attended school with the children of many celebrities.  It???s one of the unique aspects of growing up in an industry town that just always seemed normal to me.  So when I saw those famous people at school plays, swim meets and holiday concerts, they were out of costume and context.  Carol Burnett and Joan Rivers were moms like my mom.  Bob Newhart and Don Rickles were dads like my dad.  But shortly after my time in elementary school with Don???s daughter Mindy, I attended a benefit in Las Vegas with my parents where he performed.  He was fierce and ferocious and brutally funny.  After the show, I went up to say hello and immediately the fa??ade of the man onstage dropped, and he transformed back into the smiling, genuine, effusive guy I knew.  He embraced me and excitedly called over his wife.  ???Barbara, look!  It???s skinny Danny!???  Mr. Warmth indeed.But this story isn???t about Don Rickles.  It???s actually about Jimmy Kimmel.  Like Rickles, Kimmel is known for his quick, biting wit.  Whether it???s as Ben Stein???s caustic sidekick or as the co-host and co-creator of that typhoon of testosterone The Man Show or, most prominently, as the host of Jimmy Kimmel Live on ABC for over a decade, Jimmy often dares the audience to laugh at his delightful deviousness.  He is a master prankster who loves to torment friends and family alike.  Sometimes on his show, sometimes just for fun.  His YouTube challenge to parents across America wherein he elicits videos from viewers telling their children that they???ve eaten all of their Halloween candy has become a wonderfully sadistic annual tradition.  Yet somehow, Jimmy manages to glide along the edge without crossing over into actual cruelty.  And I think it has to do with the fact that we can tell, at his core, he???s a good guy.Jimmy and I have been friends for 20 years. I first met Jimmy when he was a local radio personality in LA and I was in my very first TV development job.  He was doing a promotional appearance for his radio station at the Macy???s store in the Beverly Center where my mom worked.  As luck would have it, I was visiting my mom that day and she asked if I had ever heard of ???Jimmy the Sports Guy??? from KROQ.  I told her that I listened to him on the Kevin and Bean morning show all the time and thought he was hilarious.  With that, she took me over and introduced me.Right away, Jimmy and I hit it off.  We went to lunch and Jimmy told me that he really wanted to get into TV.  I promised him that the very next project I could hire him for, I would.  Within weeks, I brought Jimmy onto something I had in development and although that show didn???t go anywhere, it did lead to him getting hired for Win Ben Stein???s Money.  And through the years, we???ve remained great friends.Jimmy is not only the hardest working person I know, he???s also one of the most generous.  Our birthdays are only six days apart and for many years we would celebrate together, invariably with him insisting on picking up the check.  And it???s not just me.  He???s like that with everyone in his immediate sphere.  As a result, I am always a little self-conscious about asking him for anything.  But after I moved away from LA, I did ask him if he wouldn???t mind doing me one specific favor.  Don Rickles was becoming a fairly frequent guest on JKL and it was clear that there was real affectionate relationship developing between them.  Jimmy reveled in having Don hurl invective at him, laughing deeply and appreciatively at every scowl and insult.  I mentioned to Jimmy that I had never gotten Rickles to sign my copy of Hello Dummy.  Without hesitation, Jimmy said he???d take care of it and I shipped the LP to him.  A few days before Don was scheduled to make his next appearance on the show, I fired off an email reminder to Jimmy.  He quickly replied that he was on it.  No problem. That he was happy to do it.  Consider it done.On the occasion of my next trip out to LA, I stopped by to see Jimmy in his office at the El Capitan Theater.  As soon I walked in, he proudly handed me the signed LP. Then, a few minutes later, Jimmy???s assistant pulled me aside and said, ???Don???t tell Jimmy I told you, but he actually lost your album.???  I didn???t understand. I was holding my album.  Then his assistant explained.  When Jimmy realized he lost it, he didn???t want to disappoint me, so he went online, found another pristine copy and had it shipped priority to his office in time to have it for Don to sign for me.  I never told Jimmy that I found out what he did for me.  But I???m guessing now that I???ve written this, word will get back to him.  Sorry Jimmy, but you???re busted.Exactly one month ago I came to you all with a dream: to build a machine that could take ocean water and make clean, potable water and sustain life on Earth for eons to come. Some people said I was crazy. Other people said it couldn???t be done. It appears as though they were correct.The upside? I???m gonna purchase twelve primo hoverboards and GoPro cameras and ??? fingers crossed ??? make some awesome videos and post them on YouTube.When I started this campaign, I really believed (and still believe!) in the cause of purifying drinkable water to help millions across the globe. But after substantial time sunk into research on Wikipedia and some really fascinating subreddits, I learned that this type of thing is really difficult and perhaps better left to ???engineer??? types.Plato was the first to say, ???Know thyself.??? And by knowing the limitations of what I can do vis-??-vis stopping the impending water crisis, I now really do know myself.Conversely, it???s impossible to see the limits of where these YouTube videos can take me and eleven of my closest friends. (As a mea culpa, I???m considering reserving a slot or two on the crew for those of you who have made the most generous contributions to the desalination machine campaign!)Without boring you by getting into the proverbial ???weeds,??? t",100

With enough viewers, there is a possibility I could generate money from ad revenue before the videos and even retain sponsors. Some YouTube stars have even gotten major deals from Hollywood. But I don???t want to get too far ahead of myself.Cheaper hoverboards break and have even reportedly caught fire. By purchasing quality boards, I have assured that your money has been well spent and that you can rest easy knowing that my friends and I will be safe.1.6 billion people live in areas where there is water, but they can???t afford to drink it.

I???d only just finished setting up my table on my first day when a lady approached me and asked ???What???s my Georgie doing???? which was totally exciting and confusing. I asked her, ???When did Georgie pass???? and she responded, ???I have a tasty snack for my baby.??? Then she pulled a dog out of her purse and fed him some hummus and pretzels. Had she paid for a reading, I???d have warned her about the impending dog diarrhea. Other than that, I get a lot of lookie-loos, but there???s also an outlet behind my chair. I have been trying some new marketing techniques. This week I???ve got coupons for half off pretzel dogs with an express reading.

There we go??? ???SECTION ONE: FIRST QUARTER METRICS.??? I want to talk a little bit about our sales performance, where we can improve our numbers. I also want to update everyone on corporate???s visit this spring.Quick side note: I???ve done some incredible shit on a dare, mostly when I was younger. Stole a car. I???m kind of going off-book here in my presentation ?????? doing the jazz version for you guys ?????? but, yeah, fucking poured Coleman camp-stove fuel all over the tires and set them on fire, then ghost rode it into the front windows of a Payless ShoeSource. Because Richard from Whiskey Tango???s by the new mall said I was a pussy. The car belonged to my parents, but??? still technically stolen. They sure as hell didn???t give me permission to light the wheels up, race it towards a shoe store and bail out at the last second before it crashed into it. Who???s the pussy now, Richard?(Long pause while I shuffle my papers and let fellow employees catch up with the way my brain works.)???SECTION TWO: STAFF REVIEWS.???Staff reviews went pretty well, everyone was pretty realistic about their goals for the coming year. I think I???ve literally developed a medication. It???s a long story, but I???ve mixed a handful of things together from the cabinet in the kitchen next to the safety posters and fire extinguisher. I didn???t do it as a party thing or whatever ???  in other words, I didn???t do it to get high. I did it in order to address my fear of people, and the low-grade hum of anxiety in my head, which feels like a thickening chorus of voices singing a joyless refrain about compromise and sensibility; it???s like out of tune bluegrass played by walking dead men. Like today, for instance: I don???t see everyone here at the regional office as my colleagues, I see you as this weird little tight knot of hermit crabs pestering me and eventually winning at some competition I???m convinced that we???re all having as adults. Other people feel like these barnacle crustacean things just moving slowly, maybe with stinging tentacles, you???re all barely inching over me, knowing that victory is yours eventually even at this glacial pace of slow, incremental, polite torture. Every single time I click ???reply all??? I am fucking tense and triple guessing every goddamn thing I???ve typed. Why? You know what I???m saying?(Another awkward pause because everyone at the regional office looks like they can???t understand a simple employee presentation.)Okay, what else do I have here, let???s see??? ???SECTION THREE: SUMMARY.???

Our instructor was a novelist, married to an Oscar-nominated film editor, an old school, tough broad. Her syllabus was simple, elegant: finish a screenplay by the end of the semester. Pass if you do. Fail if you don???t.Before the ubiquity of Powerbooks and PCs, if you wanted to write a screenplay you had to hunt and peck on a typewriter and before you could go ahuntin??? and apeckin???, you had to figure out how to create multiple tabs and to know when to use each for the various elements in your conceptual screenplay. It was, as I feared, going to be a lot of work.If you were lucky you had an IBM Selectric that functioned (I did), and luckier still if you understood how to work the Sherman tank of typewriters (I didn???t). Staring at it made me swoon; it looked like the control panel on Rocketship X-M. It took me several minutes to figure out just how to turn it on.I almost junked the class then and there.It was at moments like this I mourned not being Keyes in Double Indemnity. Keyes believes in his gut instincts. It???s his gut speaking when he tells his boss that the company is on the hook for Dietrichsen???s accidental death.1  Even after the incompetent executive dismisses Keyes, his gut doesn???t let him be. When he finally figures it out over dinner, Keyes can???t wait to tell someone, so he goes straight to Neff???s pad and explains how the little man inside had to get to the bottom of it, and because of that he???d figured it out. Dietrichsen???s death was no accident, and it certainly wasn???t a suicide; it was murder, and in all likelihood it was the wife did the deed, probably with the help of some simp she could lead around by his dick. All the while Keyes has no clue that Neff is that simp and that the dame is right behind the door.Even when Keyes was wrong, he was right.I, unfortunately, was Keyes???s obverse. Even when I was right, I was wrong. I wouldn???t listen to my gut if it delivered Lincoln???s Second Inaugural, spoke in tongues, serenaded me with sad and soulful blues???the sky is crying, look at the tears roll down the street. Had I listened to my gut I wouldn???t have been sitting trying to figure out how I was going to pull off what seemed impossible to me, since my gut had very clearly tried to communicate to me this was the road that should not have been taken. There was no wiggle room here, just pure binary opposition???black/white, yes/no, pass/fail, life/death. Either I produced a screenplay or I was fucked.It was beginning to look like I was fucked.??????Before she sent us off to wrestle with an empty page, our instructor offered what to her were words of advice and encouragement: Write what you know.It was a deceptively simple, deviously constructed formulation, a classic example of begging the question. It assumed in its proposition we knew something, and that that something was worth writing about. This kind of existential trap was not new to me. The simplest assumptions, usually accepted by others with little fanfare and less analysis, have often paralyzed me:Back in that day when getting high had metastasized from the hood to the halls of higher learning, ruling-class culture had to come to grips with the best minds of a generation baked in a cannabis casserole. The act of getting stoned then evolved from the terrifying criminal degeneracy of the dusky other,2  to an innocent, rose-colored ???experimentation,??? as if we were now toddlers in a sandbox, hypnotized by new, shiny toys. And because boojie shekels were now in play, the quality of the supply went on the rise, and one???s stash was no longer a generic ho-hum, like Chicago Green or Mexican Brown, but bore the name of an exotic place and a regal color. On this one particular night when I found myself in a circle of lab rats with varying degrees of brain chemistry problems, we were passing around a pair of fatties rolled from weed grown near Acapulco in the Mexican state of Guerrero whose buds had a golden hue to them. This reefer was pure wacky weed, one-hit shit, dynamite, though that didn???t stop us from toking and toking and toking, because we had yet to realize that the solution had become the problem.3George was a gnome in need of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. But this was the sixties, not Futureworld; he was shit out of luck. So George was heavy into self-medicating???like the rest of us, more or less. When the joint circled back to him, he took a heroic hit, sucking in a forest fire worth of smoke. The active ingredient befogged his brain. His eyes bugged out. He looked like a Martian popping doll. He finally exhaled in an explosion of smoke and spittle. Then George took a journey to his very own heart of darkness and stayed there for what seemed like forever before returning to the phenomenal plane and sharing his pens??e with the class???I don???t know where I leave off and everyone else begins.Upon hearing this, we did the eyeball-on-a-swivel move, checking each other out, trying to come to a telepathic consensus on how to react.  I took my cue from the three others because when you???re a young, callow, and feckless pothead, you must maintain some semblance of chill no matter what. It is always safer to laugh at than laugh with. George had made the mistake of getting real???real fucked up; it was best not to jump on that runaway bus.And so when they began laughing, I began laughing too.  If you didn???t know any better you might???ve thought we were all part of the same hive mind like in Attack of the Crab Monsters, where once you were devoured by the monstrously mutated decapod, you became part of its collective crab unc",100
309,"onscious. Once he was a man; now he is a land crab.But even as I was laughing I realized these are some very good questions. Where do I leave off? Where does everyone else begin???????Sixteen years might have passed but I was still the same metaphysically challenged dummkopf I had been back then. Write what I know. What did I know? How do I write about it?The first of what were to be twelve sessions was about to end and all I knew was a script had a specific format and a specific length, usually somewhere between a hundred and five and a hundred and twenty pages. There were only eleven sessions left. If I were to cobble together a hundred-ten-page script, I would have to come up with an average of ten pages a week. This problem was beginning to take on the contours of a can of worms, threatening to become a quandary, from which it could definitely develop into a crisis.Fretting, dithering, procrastination, these were things I did really well, things I knew really well. Could I write about them? Could I make a movie out of them? While I was certain that Bergman or Antonioni might be able to work with the holy trinity of work avoidance as their theme, I knew I couldn???t.What kind of movies did I like? I had only recently come to realize that westerns could be more than Roy Rogers, Gene Autry, or the Cisco Kid. I had long been searching for a good war movie, but there were precious few of them around, and more to the point, I had spent that portion of my adult life coinciding with the Vietnam War actively trying to avoid it, going as far as signing myself into the bin in order to get a psycho-deferment, so war was something I knew nothing about. I loved the conventions of hard-boiled, down-these-mean-streets movies and the jet-propelled dialogue of screwball comedies.But what I liked was not the same thing as what I knew, and what I knew seemed strictly limited to the formal rather than the experiential.I was back where I started, not knowing what to write about because there was nothing I knew anything about. This deliberation got me so fritzed, smoke was coming out my ears. I decided it would be better if smoke went into my lungs, where chemical conversions I knew nothing about???a theme was beginning to emerge???would isolate the active ingredient, send it coursing into my bloodstream, thus into my brain, enabling me to relax and perhaps to then figure this shit out.I opened my dark blue plastic stash box with a spaceship holograph stamped on the top and took a deep, satisfying whiff of the skunk weed within, pulled out my old school Bambus, and rolled me a joint. After the first toke I felt mind and body relax. A couple more tokes and the whole loft reeked with what Sgt. Friday4  referred to as the sickly sweet smell of marijuana, to me the perfume of the gods. I leaned back, closed my eyes, felt the beginnings of a smile. I began to make synaptic connections, logical leaps, mixing mental apples and oranges, when all of a sudden it snuck up on me like a strangler of Bombay, and before I had the time to scream Don???t jump in the snakepit, Guru,5  I knew the thing I knew, the thing I could write about: drugs.??????Drugs by themselves do not a movie make. A story needs context. It???s not just what, it???s when, how, why, who, and where as well. If I say penicillin, the first response is not likely to be, yeah, man, penicillin, that would make a helluva movie. But if you take the wayback machine to devastated post-WWII Europe, adulterate a relief shipment of penicillin in order to make a killing on the black market, and in the process knock off a bunch of malnourished children, add Orson Welles and Joseph Cotton, get Graham Greene to adapt his own story and Sir Carol Reed to direct, shoot it verit??-style on the streets and in the sewers of postwar Vienna (the Gingerbread Hell-House on the Danube), you???ve got The Third Man.By the time I figured that out, whatever that was, I had pushed my overheated brain too far, too fast and ended up with a world-class headache. I took a couple of aspirin, closed my eyes, and kept repeating the mantra It???s beautiful when the pain stops until sleep chased me down like a bloodthirsty T-Rex. I soon found myself swimming through a dreamy cinematic soup???I was fleeing body snatchers down a freeway in California, escaping, only to be hunted by a giant crab, taking refuge from these monsters from my id in the barracks of Stalag 17, from which, having disposed of the rat in our midst, I escaped, finally finding myself seated at the communal table of carnival Freaks, a gleeful participant in the chilling acceptance ritual???Gooble, gobble; gooble, gobble. One of us; one of us. We accept her, we accept her; one of us, one of us.My unconscious had given me a present and I now had a Mad Libs formula???if I could figure out how to fill in the blanks and untangle the knots, peel away the layers, follow the threads, and make sense of them, I???d have a story and could start writing my script. If drugs were to be my what, then the ???60s had to be my when (which was fine by me, since my address then was Living in the Past, Regretsville, USA), and thirteenth-grade sleepaway camp my where.But what about the who? Body snatchers and crab monsters were manifestations of enforced conformity, of going along to get along; they were one part of the Back in the Day dialectic.When you boil down the ???60s zeitgeist, it was all about questioning received wisdom, championing ambiguity, choosing shades of gray over black and white, widening the circles of confusion. Questioning cultural givens leads to questioning authority, this behavioral equation resulting in the then-shocking notion of respecting only those ideas and people that have earned your respect. Throw in the war, the pill, grass, acid, the Beatles and the Stones, and you had the makings of Kulturkampf, which gave me not only the who but the why of it as well.There was even a juicy cherry planted atop my ???60s sundae???the Rat. In order to live happily ever after within the confines of Stalag 17, the good guys had to uncover the Rat and dispose of him, which they do, with a flourish, at movie???s end. That would provide my screenplay with a through line, getting to the end of which would therefore be the how.??????It was Sunday evening, dinner was done, the dishes were washed, ten pages were due on Monday, and I had run out of excuses. I put a joint in my mouth, a blank sheet in the Selectric, typed FADE IN.The title was Freaks Like Us. The story was Animal House meets Kiss Me Deadly meets Stalag 17. There was an evil Dean, an ambitious Pol, a Rat, and a tortured love story climaxing at an ROTC breakfast where the Tang???s been spiked with acid. In the first act our Hero makes himself scarce after nearly getting popped in a drug dragnet, crashes with friends back home, falls for a chick he runs into, a chick he had known in his sandbox days.6  Reenergized, he returns to the scene of the crime, with the Girl, determined to wreak vengeance on those responsible for the busting of his pothead friends.In the second act he puts his plan into action: he gaslights the Rat and destroys the career of the Rat???s handler, a DA eyeing a vacant seat in Congress. A series of escalating pranks sends the Rat into a paranoid tailspin, rendering him fear-filled and pliable; in this condition the Rat is easily manipulated into unknowingly becoming the inciting incident of the climactic lysergic lunacy.Blackmailing the DA proves to be more complicated, requiring more planning, more technical support, as well as the cooperation of a hot and willing chick, in this case his newfound, long-lost love. Although she ",100
310,"agrees to help, the Girl suffers an alienation of her affection, setting up the inevitable second part of the romcom triad.My template for the romance was Mike Hammer and his secretary, Velda, in Kiss Me Deadly, the hardest of hard-boiled dick movies, a meditation on nuclear madness with gumshoes, gangsters, femme fatales, and a super-suave, hyperliterate villain, Dr. Soberin (Albert Dekker), who drops in references to Cerberus, Medusa, and Lot???s Wife; he even lectures the movie???s Lilith on the perils of Pandora???s box, since in this case the McGuffin is an outsized hatbox made out of lead that, when opened, unleashes a screaming, fiery apocalypse upon the happy seaside town of Malibu.Hammer is a bedroom dick; he makes his money blackmailing philandering husbands; Velda is his honey trap. But when he tells Velda to drop her seduction of some simp husband: We???re going to steer away from these penny ante divorce cases for a while. I got a line on something better???she gets pissed, though not angry enough to not do it: Why don???t you leave, Mike, before I change my mind. Besides, I???m gonna need all the rest I can get if I???m gonna have any strength to fight off my newfound, my bosom friend.Velda is the only character in the movie with anything resembling a moral compass. And although it???s compromised by love for her brutal, narcissistic boss???she switches her situational ethics gyro on and off as she needs to???she never fully abandons a fundamental understanding that right and wrong exist and are relevant, even within, especially within, the murky universe she and Mike inhabit.And in the end Hammer, savage and soulless as he might be, risks all to save her; or as Dr. Soberin puts it, Sentiment will succeed where greed failed.??????Kiss Me Deadly was not a run-of-the-mill black hat/white hat morality tale where the lines in the sand are really yawning canyons dividing good from evil. It was an investigation into moral relativity. Hammer was on a continuum with Soberin and the femme fatale. The line in the sand here is merely intimated by the pinky toe of a lightfoot, in a desert, during a sandstorm.Freaks like Us was to be a comedy, its apocalypse a messed-up ROTC parade in which all the officer candidates become Sergeant Sunshines from unknowingly drinking bug juice spiked with Owsley Purple Haze. But it was meant to share a shades-of-gray moral palette with Kiss Me Deadly. Here the rooting interest is a guy who deals dope, pranks a guy into a psychotic break with reality, and blackmails one of our legal guardians by pimping out his main squeeze.The romance had to be the heart of the movie (this much I knew). Our Hero is so intent on revenge he almost loses sight of the thing most important to him, and almost blows it.In the penultimate shot, our Hero, Bolex in hand, records for posterity the psychedelic pandemonium, then loses interest in what he has wrought, preferring to put the Bolex down on its side and cheerfully walk off arm in arm with his main squeeze. We then cut to the Bolex???s POV of the chaos on the quad, sideways to gravity, a vertiginous image of zonked-out weekend warriors in training in danger of falling off the edge of a flat earth. The film in the Bolex runs out, and the movie ends in a cascade of self-reflexivity???sprocket holes, film tails, edge letters, and dust-encrusted white light.- - -1  In context Keyes and Neff are called into the office of a paper pusher wanting to welch on Dietrichsen???s double indemnity accident insurance policy. The exec proposes that it was no accident that killed him, it was suicide killed the beast. Keyes doesn???t even try to mask his contempt, as he tells the schmuck like it is in the greatest cerebro-hardboiled monologue in the annals of noir, delivered by Little Caesar himself (Could this be the end of Johnny Rico?), Edward G.: You???ve never read an actuarial table in your life, have you? Why, we???ve got ten volumes on suicide alone. Suicide by race, by color, by occupation, by sex, by seasons of the year, by time of day. Suicide, how committed???by poisons, by firearms, by drowning, by leaps. Suicide by poison, subdivided by types of poison, such as corrosive, irritant, systemic, gaseous, narcotic, alkaloid, protein and so forth. Suicide by leaps! Subdivided by leaps from high places; under the wheels of trains, under the wheels of trucks, under the feet of horses! From steamboats! But Mr. Norton???of all the cases on record, there???s not one single case of suicide by leap from the rear end of a moving train. And do you know how fast that train was going at the point where the body was found? Fifteen miles an hour. Now how can anybody jump off a slow-moving train like that with any kind of expectation that he would kill himself? No. No soap, Mr. Norton. We???re sunk and we???ll have to pay through the nose, and you know it!2 ???Most marijuana smokers are Negroes, Hispanics, jazz musicians, and entertainers. Their satanic music is driven by marijuana, and marijuana smoking by white women makes them want to seek sexual relations with Negroes, entertainers, and others. It is a drug that causes insanity, criminality, and death???the most violence-causing drug in the history of mankind.???  ??? Harry J. Anslinger3 See My Own Personal RomCom.4 The TV series Dragnet starring Jack Webb as Sgt. Joe Friday, Badge 714, had two incarnations???black and white in the ???50s, color in the ???60s. Each episode, in which only the names have been changed to protect the innocent, was a true crime story featuring Webb???s patented clipped narration and flat affect acting as he led us through the sketchy underbelly of sunny La-La Land; in the two iterations of Dragnet, there were at least three episodes about dope, each a cautionary tale, each ending with the death of a kid, each one more absurdly chilling than the last. In The Big Seventeen (1952) Friday and his partner Frank Smith head to a neighborhood movie theater where a riot had broken out???a bunch of hopped up teens got rowdy, then violent, breaking the place up. Friday is given a cardboard pillbox with a couple of joints in it, setting him off on a crusade: busting kids, grilling them, getting them to give up the name of the dealer, who turns out to be a kid so depraved he beat his connection to death in order to steal the guy???s stash of heroin, shit so powerful its distribution was certain to leave the bodies of teens strewn throughout Gidget-ville. This intel forces Friday into further acts of crusading, this time to try and forestall the potential drug holocaust. It leads him to the first victim of this smack scourge???the perp himself, OD???d on his own medicine, an object lesson to anyone considering trying the evil weed, a sure gateway onto a literal dead end. The Prophet (1967) starts with a space cadet, half his face painted blue, soliloquizing psychedelically: My hair???s green and I???m a tree??? if your body dies your mind will live on??? Brown, blue, yellow, green??? I can hear them. I can hear them all. The episode then turns didactic with a short history of acid: Hoffman, hallucinations, potency (one kilo of acid can yield five to ten million doses), followed by this factoid: LSD is so potent that a single pound of the preparation could turn every person in Los Angeles County into a total psychotic. The population of the county: seven million people. If one kilo produces five to ten million hits but one pound is enough to render seven million people starkers, the shit???s not only dynamite, it???s magical. LSD is so potent it can even fuck up the immutable laws of math. (If a train full of acid heads journeys eastward at the speed of ",100
311,"light while a cattle car full of psychos moves westward at ramming speed, when will the world end?) But in Dragnet-world someone must pay for their sins with their life. The sacrificial lamb is Blue Boy, whose death (a miraculous OD on acid) so infuriates Friday that he spits out this gateway drug formulary: marijuana was the flame, heroin was the fuse, and acid was the bomb. In The Big High a pair of phi beta kappa suburbanites with an upscale shack in Sherman Oaks and a toddler gurgling in its playpen prison, initially engage Friday in a Platonic dialogue on the pros and cons of pot; they then get high, totally fucked up, forget about the baby, who, voo denn, pays with its little life, drowned in the bathtub, leaving space mama a mental wreck, Friday???s sidekick Gannon hurling his breakfast burrito, and Friday literally holding the bag???a lid full of weed???close up to the camera, wacky womb weeping in the background, the heartbroken cop finally crushing the deadly herb in his helpless hands.5 For the provenance of the phrase see Chance Is a Fool???s Name for Fate: Part 2: In All the Towns6 See My Own Personal RomCom (yet again). In this I wuz writing what I knew.When I wake on the couch in the early evening darkness, I reach out to touch the laptop. A ghost habit, leftover from a time when the battery was still full and the nights were lit with the glow of street lamps and inflatable snowmen, when the world was not the unfathomable snowscape that it is now. Now, each hour stretches on more gray and impenetrable than the last, leading us further and further away from our unfinished games of Words With Friends, our unwatched episodes of Jessica Jones, and our undrunk peppermint lattes.The snow has been falling steadily, just as they of weather.com had feared. I rise and stand by the window. I hear a distant beeping somewhere far off in the expanse of night: a snowplow reversing. The roommate shifts out of bed, walks to the hallway and listens.Do you hear that? she asks.It won???t come here, I say.I mean, eventually it will, she says. Probably pretty soon actually.Hope is indifferent to us, I say. Why should we waste our efforts on it?Whatever. I???m going to get some crackers, she says. She turns and is swallowed by the dark of the kitchen. The sound of the plow recedes towards more populated streets, and I know we have been forsaken.The clocks stopped at 8:17 the morning before this one. Now they flash and unflash their inscrutable message: 12:00; 12:00; 12:00. All the previous days the television had warned of this. I think of the five gallons of milk I purchased at the store in preparation.  Every minute, those cartons grow closer to spoiling in the dank breath of the dying fridge.In the beginning there had been parades of foolhardy people. The wheels on their SUVs spun futilely against the snow???s churning flesh. We should help, the roommate had said. No, I had said.  This is a world without ruth.Movement in a bush.  I drop to my knees and peer out the window. They???ve come for us, I think. Come for our cans of soup, for our working flashlights, for the ten packs of batteries I tore from an old woman???s panicked hands at Target last Monday.But no, it???s only a robin, rousing in her nest.  This stirs something in my long ossified heart: a memory of the days when evergreens pulsed and shook in the wind like young dancers on a moonlit night.  I think of talking about these memories with the roommate, before she forgets what it was like to live in a world not ravaged by snow and the need to occasionally turn on the taps so our pipes don???t burst.Once, there were cars on the roads and there was green in the lawns. In the intricate designs of the hedges and the garden gnomes, there were patterns. Patterns that told of an unburied world that can???t be made right again, for at least three or maybe four days.  A week and a half, even, if it snows once more on Thursday.  In the deep suburb where we live all things are obscured by the storm and they hum with panic and the hundreds of unshared photos that will be uploaded to Instagram as soon as we can charge our phones again.""Back in 2011, the United States Center for Disease Control (CDC) released an official blog post on preparing for a ???zombie apocalypse,??? as a metaphor for any kind of natural disaster or disease outbreak. This is all well and good to placate the public, but if you look at the qualities of zombies in various forms of media, from the initial cause of zombification, to the spread of the ???disease,??? to the manifestation of the ???zombie state??? you see that the CDC isn???t being ridiculous.If we want to classify how close a real-life disease is to a state of zombification, we need to get a diagnostic checklist of what constitutes a zombie. By observing some common patterns from depictions of zombies in popular media, we can gather four general zombie characteristics:1)	Mental/emotional/intellectual degradation: The intellectual level of a zombie has completely changed, or is no longer present. There are little to no thoughts or feelings reminiscent of the person they once were. The zombie ???entity??? has completely taken over.2)	Bodily degradation: Zombies ooze. There is a breakdown of circulatory, respiratory, and gastrointestinal systems. The skin and muscles may fall away, and the body may show extensive bleeding and/or decay.3)	Aggressive compulsion to feed on and/or infect others: Zombies tend to feed on the living, and a side effect of this is that the zombification state is infectious. Being fed on means that you will eventually become a zombie, and will crave living flesh.4)	Persistence: Unless the head of the zombie is removed, it will continue to do its zombie thing. There is no discernable end to a zombie lifespan. Sometimes it is implied that zombies can starve if deprived of living flesh, but that???s not always consistent.Armed with a checklist, let???s look at a few real-world afflictions to see if they qualify as a zombie-like condition.Zombie-like condition #1Infection by Cordyceps fungus typically occurs with a number of different insects; the most well-studied is the interaction between Ophiocordyceps unilateralis and tropical ants. In the tropics, ants living on tree canopies often descend down into the understory for foraging where O. unilateralis spores are present. After the fungus colonizes the brain, the ???zombie??? ant leaves the nest and wanders to the understory, where it bites down on a leaf vein and dies.1 Atrophy of the ant???s jaw ensures that the cadaver will continue to cling to the leaf without falling. The comparatively humid microclimate of the understory is an excellent condition for the fungus to grow out of the cadaver, culminating in the gruesome sprouting of a mushroom out the back of the head (Google this. It???s amazing) and dissemination of spores to infect other hapless ants.Can Cordyceps infection be a zombifying disease? Let???s weigh it against the checklist:1)	Mental/intellectual degradation: Yes. Cordyceps infects the brain and guides the ant???s actions to facilitate dissemination of spores2)	Bodily degradation: Not really. Zombie ants do a zombie ant-like stagger, but their appearance is normal.3)	Compulsion to infect others: Sure, see #1. The fungus ???drives??? the ant to a location that is favorable for the dissemination of a maximum amount of spores. More spores leads to more zombie ants.4)	Persistence:  No. Zombie ants die within just a few days.Why have we not had a Cordyceps zombie apocalypse yet? The host range is limited to insects living in tropical climates.Could we have a Cordyceps zombie apocalypse? If a host shift occ",100
312,"urred, then it might happen. Pathogens can and do shift hosts through evolutionary processes, with avian flu as a big example.Zombie score: 2/4 ???with a big hypothetical attached.Zombie-like condition #2Rabies is a neuroinflammatory disease caused by a virus (lyssavirus, aptly named from the Greek goddess of rage). We recognize rabies as the ???mad dog??? disease; infected animals behave aggressively and can transmit the virus through biting or scratching victims.Can we refer to rabid individuals as zombies?1)	Mental/intellectual degradation:  Big check. Infected animals are confused, paranoid, and prone to violent interactions. They are incredibly dangerous.2)	Bodily degradation: No. Rabid animals ???foam at the mouth??? due to an inability to swallow, but that???s really the extent to which they ooze.3)	Compulsion to infect others:  Absolutely. Rabid animals compulsively attack and bite healthy individuals, and the virus is transmitted via saliva4)	Persistence:  No. Rabid animals usually die within a few days.Why has a rabid zombie apocalypse not yet occurred? Rabies can be controlled through vaccination programs, education, and access to immunoglobulin if there is a chance that exposure has occurred.  Another point to consider is the relatively short infectious period, which limits the number of animals exposed by one infected individual before it dies.How could a rabid zombie apocalypse occur? First, removal of vaccination and post-exposure treatment programs, as rabies is a significant problem for parts of the world where feral animals are common, and there is less access to costly preventative medicine and treatments.2  Second, increase the probability of infection by lengthening the infectious period and increasing the number of animals attacked and infected.Zombie score: 2/4. Rabies is terrifying. Vaccinate your pets please!Zombie-like disease #3Ebola is a viral hemorrhagic fever spread by fluids and starts off with fever-like symptoms. Usually within 48 hours afflicted individuals show petachiae and decreased clotting of blood, which then turns into coughing/vomiting up blood, bleeding into the gastrointestinal tract, and bleeding into the whites of eyes. Death occurs one to two weeks later typically from low blood pressure.Do we think of Ebola as a zombifying disease? Let???s weigh it against the checklist:1)	Mental/intellectual degradation: No. The brain remains unaffected.2)	Bodily degradation: Yes, absolutely. The Ebola virus can infect a variety of tissues, which results in multiple organ failure and overwhelming blood vessel leakage.3)	Compulsion to feed on/infect:  No. Ebola victims are ill and exhausted.4)	Persistence:  Perhaps, but probably not. Victims usually die within one to two weeks.  Survivors may harbor the virus for some time afterwards without showing symptoms.Why hasn???t there been an Ebola zombie apocalypse? Everyone remembers the 2014 outbreak originating in Guinea; appropriate public education, sanitation, and quarantine measures kept the epidemic from spreading further. Probably the best thing from an epidemiological standpoint is that Ebola kills its victims relatively quickly, which limits the number of people in contact that could possibly contract the disease.Could there be an Ebola zombie apocalypse? Ebola is extremely dangerous, with typical mortality rates ranging from 80-90%.4 To date, there is no vaccination, and treatments have limited efficacy. If, hypothetically, Ebola could be transmitted through the air similar to the common cold, humans infected with Ebola sought to actively infect other humans, and the infected roamed around for a longer amount of time, then yes.Zombie score: 1/4. As scary as an Ebola epidemic is, the fact that it does not take over your mind disqualifies it from being characterized as a zombifying disease.Zombie-like disease #4Methamphetamine addiction is a little different from the aforementioned maladies. Here, the victims take it upon themselves to become infected, per se.  Methamphetamine causes considerable stimulation of the central nervous system, resulting in euphoria, heightened self-esteem, and increased alertness. This occurs through a heightened and sustained release of the neurotransmitter dopamine into the extracellular space. Furthermore, methamphetamine blocks the reuptake of dopamine, so levels remain heightened beyond the physiological state. The problem here is that constant, heavy release of dopamine beyond physiologically normal levels is neurotoxic, causing oxidative stress and inflammation. Additionally, chronic methamphetamine use causes long-term and possibly permanent damage to dopamine nerve terminals, so users lack the ability to experience pleasure.3Does chronic methamphetamine use turn us into zombies?1)	Mental/intellectual degradation: Sure. Chronic methamphetamine users experience paranoia, psychosis, hallucinations, and compulsive and sometimes violent behaviors. However, this behavior depends on the amount of drug in the system.2)	Bodily degradation: Yes. Constant skin picking, weight loss, and dental decay (???meth mouth???).3)	Impulse to infect others: Maybe, but not in the biological sense. Methamphetamine addiction epidemics are more of a social issue.4)	Persistence:  Yes, compared to the aforementioned maladies. Methamphetamine addicts live an average of 5 years, and are usually killed by something other than the drug.Why have we not all become methamphetamine-addicted zombies? Choice is a big factor here.  If we wanted to, then absolutely!Could we all become methamphetamine-addicted zombies? Supposedly, if there was some situation in which an evil-doing entity put it into the water supply. But, that???s some conspiracy theory-level thinking.Zombie score: 3.5/4. Although this may be debatable due to lack of full penetrance and non-biological attributes.None of these diseases perfectly match the exact combination of attributes to be a zombie-like disease, but hypothetically, if certain attributes of each of these diseases were combined, then we could quite possibly meet the optimal conditions for a zombie apocalypse. This is commonly the inspiration for recent zombie films. For example, the zombies in the film 28 Days Later suffer from what looks like a hybrid of rabies and Ebola, yielding dangerous rage-filed creatures with the appropriate amount of ooze. In the video game The Last of Us, the zombies are cannibalistic human-mushroom hybrids, having contracted a host-shifted Cordyceps fungus with rabid qualities for that appropriate amount of rage and aggression.The reality is that we are just one or two hypothetical situations away from a zombie apocalypse. So, my recommendation is to stock up on emergency water, canned food, a good pair of running shoes, a first aid kit and possibly a shotgun (if you are into that sort of thing).  Even if a zombie apocalypse does not occur, at least we will be prepared for the next natural disaster.Good luck.- - 1 Hughes et al., 2011.

I CAME BACK BECAUSE I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT HOW WE???VE CREATED SOMETHING REALLY SPECIAL IN THE NORTHWEST.??? ???THIS USED TO BE A BED SHEET. ONE UPON WHICH MY WIFE AND I MADE LOVE. SORRY, I???M LYING. I HAVE A WIFE BUT WE DO NOT MAKE LOVE. THAT???S ONE OF THE REASONS I AM HERE, TRYING TO TAUNT YOU WITH OLD LAUNDRY.??? ???I HATE SEEING JOY ON ANYONE???S FACES. YOURS. MINE. IT DOESN???T MATTER.??? ???DIDN???T THIS PLACE USED TO BE CALLED ERICSSON STADIUM? THAT WAS BEFORE YOUR TIME, NEVER MIND. I HAD AN ERICSSON PHONE ONCE. I DROPPED IT IN A JAR OF PICKLES. RUINED IT. I TRIED LETTING IT DRY OUT. BUT THAT VINEGAR REALLY DID A NUMBER ON IT.??? ???THIS IS ACTUALLY THE SECOND SIGN YOU???VE STOLEN FROM ME. IF YOU READ THIS, CAN YOU LET ME KNOW IF THERE???S ANY GREAT PLACE TO GRAB RIBS AROUND HERE? NOT TOO PRICEY, BUT NOT A REAL SHITHOLE, EITHER.??? ???WHEN RICK SANTORUM IS PRESIDENT, HE???LL PUT AN END TO THIS CRAP, CAM.??? ???THANKS TO YOU, MY HUSBAND NOW DABS AFTER GOING TO THE BATHROOM.??? ???WHY DIDN???T YOU GET THE BALL TO MIKE TOLBERT MORE???? ???CHRIS WEINKE NEVER DID THIS.??? I???m glad that if you wave a banner supporting an opposing team in his stadium and Cam???s running around slapping fans??? hands ??? as we all learned back in early November when that North Carolina Cheesehead dude got his banner yoinked after a Packers loss ??? he might grab your shit, like a pro wrestler, crumple it up and chuck it.(Click on that link and look at that picture. The work that guy put into that sign ??? he???s celebrating himself more than the Packers.)You should feel honored, not enraged, Seahawks lady.Cam Newton specifically grabbing your banner is like going to Medieval Times and having the winning knight gallop past you and snatch the drumstick from your greasy paws. You just became part of the event. Find the footage and post it on your social channels. You won.I???m also glad that Cam gives away game balls every time the Panthers score. Obviously, that???s not as polarizing. Everyone wants an NFL game ball. Getting a baseball at an MLB game is not difficult. But a football? Jesus. When I take my son to games, we try to get to the stadium as early as possible, hours before kickoff, when the drunk people in the parking lots are still mildly optimistic and saying ???Excuse me??? to grills they crash into, and there???s not much vomit to step around.Once inside the stadium, we trawl the sidelines bothering players and random quality control coaches to throw us a ball. Gloves. Whatever. He still wears Sharrif Floyd???s Vikings stocking cap, tossed to him from the field. In a perfect scenario, once something like that happens, we???d just leave the stadium, before even one down is played. The NFL game experience is usually less than fulfilling.This fall, we saw Washington play the Giants. We walked down to empty end zone seats and watched the teams warm up. Sometimes yelling enthusiastically to a bored-looking guy on injured reserve or the punting duffel bag attendant can at least get the, ???Hey, can you throw my child a ball???? conversation happening. Sure, it???s a lot different than Cam Newton handing you a Panthers TD ball in the middle of a game, but you haven???t lived until you???ve pestered an unfamiliar coach-like human being after doing a quick image search on your phone to make sure you???ve IDed him properly, then began yelling, ???Hey, Bradford! Bradford!??? like he???s LeBron James.Bradford did not toss us a ball. I???m not sure he even turned around. Then the team???s new GM Scot McCloughan walked past, looking vaguely like Will Ferrell if he had a more  Shanahan-esque wind-chapped ruddiness going on. He wasn???t entertaining any commentary from fans nearby who were asking if his wife was back on Twitter.Anyway, Washington finally ran off the field to the locker room. They left a lone kicking ball at midfield. Odell Beckham Jr. picked it up and tried to punt a field goal. He missed. The ball hit the wall near us, and a security guard picked it up, looked at my kid and tossed it to him.Carolina will win.PATRIOTS AT BRONCOSI spent a few moments this week conducting Internet searches with the terms ???Andy Reid??? and ???Great Depression.??? I wanted to see if anyone had compared the Chiefs coach???s reluctance to use his time outs last Saturday with the 1930s-style hoarding of bread crusts, trouser lint, robin feathers and piles of randomly punctured tiny hoses. Was it something more? A compulsion? Mental illness? Is he some kind of savant? Did he think the time outs were physical objects, somehow taken away from him?I didn???t find much.  Just a couple of tweets.I wasn???t even watching the Chiefs vs. Patriots game. Not on TV, anyway. I was looking at a gamecast on my phone, just watching the little dots move around, and smiling dumbly to myself or groaning, unaware of all the Chiefs near-interceptions. The only data I had was from plays that really happened. Not things that almost happened.When the Chiefs got the ball with 6:29 left, down 27-13, there was still a chance they could come back. That???s when you really focus, impatiently muttering swear words at your screen, waiting for it to refresh forever on 4th and 8, for: ???A.Smith pass short middle to J.Avant to NE 47 for 13 yards.??? to materialize. Best way to enjoy a game. A man sitting next to me was reading a hardcover book ??? oblivious to Andy Reid???s clock management issues ??? and not cursing at it.Anyway, we all know what happened on that drive.Chiefs WR Albert Wilson got down to the New England 1-yard line with 3:00 left, and Coach Andy would not call any time outs. Instead, he asked the referees to keep the clock moving while Alex Smith set up an old film projector and gave a short presentation about expired Estonian postage. Then Reid casually pulled a pair of pliers out of his trousers, reached inside his parka with them, pulled out a wrapped Whopper Jr., considered eating it, then discarded it. The clock kept ticking.The Patriots advanced.Peyton Manning moved the Broncos offense in a similar, Reid-like fashion. For much of the afternoon, he seemed like a guy jus",100
314,"t strolling unassumingly through a Home Depot, who is grabbed and forced into service as a camel doula. Over and over and over again. All his clever audibling, the gesticulating, and the shouting of ???Omaha,??? now just stressed me out and seemed sadly dated. I half expected him to shout, ???Oppa Gangnam style,??? or start singing Gotye lyrics at the line of scrimmage.His receivers did not help. The Broncos defense is great, but I have a bad feeling that the Patriots will win on the road and go to the Super Bowl.Friends, relatives, and neighborhood beekeepers, I???m sure you???re all wondering why I???ve asked you to meet me here and not wear any perfumes or bright colors. Unfortunately, I have some disappointing news. My soul mate, the love of my life, and my husband of ten years isn???t who he says he is. The truth is, he???s been a garbage bag full of bees this whole time.Now I know what you???re thinking. How could this be(e)? Our love, our life together, and the face I drew on the outside of the garbage bag all seemed so real. But even though it hurts, I have to admit that it???s true. My husband has been leading a double life, or approximately 50,000 different lives if you consider the volume of an average hive.It???s the kind of devastating secret I never could have expected when I married him. Or should I say it? This news has me questioning everything now, and I???m sure you have questions too. Like should you still use the name ???Frank??? when addressing the bag, who will get the house in the divorce, and how exactly was I able to navigate the logistics of a sexual relationship with a plastic bag full of bees for so many years? But I???d prefer to keep the sordid ???he said/she said, garbage bag full of bees made a buzzing noise???-details to ourselves for now. After all, there are kids involved.And even though I know now that our relationship was based on a lie, I can???t help but remember the good times. I remember the day we met, and the way my heart swelled when we first touched. I also remember the way my lips, mouth, eyelids and throat also swelled. It was a feeling unlike anything I???d ever experienced. Maybe it was because I???d never felt true love before, or maybe it was because I grew up in a city with limited access to nature, but either way I knew then that this relationship was special. In fact, to this day I still get butterflies in my stomach whenever we see each other. Yes, I???ll admit it???s probably because there???s a huge hole in the bag and I???ve swallowed some of the bees, but that hole isn???t nearly as big as the hole in my heart. Which is also full of bees.I suppose a few of you may have seen this coming, and even voiced your doubts early on in the relationship. Though I ignored them, I wasn???t unaware of the concerned whispers behind my back: ???Is she sure about this???? and ???Has she stopped taking her meds???? and ???OH MY GOD BRENDA, YOU KNOW I???M DEATHLY ALLERGIC TO BEES ??? WHY WOULD YOU BRING THAT HERE?????? But no matter how many times I heard it, or how many people went into anaphylactic shock as a result, I just wasn???t ready to face the truth. I guess I was blinded by love. And also, as I mentioned earlier, my eyes were completely swollen shut for most of our marriage.But I guess this is nothing new. After all, this isn???t the first guy I???ve been with who hasn???t been completely honest with me. In fact, every guy I???ve ever dated has turned out to be some kind of liar, cheater, international scam artist, pile of dirty laundry, small wooden puppet who dreams of one day becoming a real boy, the word ???MAN??? spelled out in a stack of children???s blocks, a chalk outline of a dead body at a crime scene, or a even a Republican presidential candidate. But for some reason, this betrayal stings more than the others. And it???s not just because stinging is a bee???s natural defense mechanism, it???s more like a metaphorical pain. It???s also very itchy.It???s been a tough road, and after all this, I fear I???ll never be able to trust again, that I may never find real love. But I just have to remember to stay positive and keep an heart open. After all, love can be unpredictable, and can show up when you least expect it. Sometimes it even falls right into your lap, like a burlap sack full of wet rats flung onto your porch by an irresponsible pest control employee. Speaking of which, I???ve gotta go. Have a hot date tonight!At the computer terminal in a classroom on the third floor of the science building, The Dr. Fritz Zwicky Endowed Chair of Astronomy cycled through Hubble images and she addressed the room.???You probably recognize this one from the quiz. Stars are seen birthing throughout the cloud. Can anyone name this nebula? Remember: they???re often named for what they look like.???No one took it in. None of them were interested. Someone coughed, which seemed to the Dr. Fritz Zwicky Endowed Chair of Astronomy like protest.???This is the Rosette Nebula,??? she said. ???See the rosette here????Her experience was that two or three students would get excited about astronomy, and she would teach as if those two or three were out there, though this semester she hadn???t found them yet. Mostly everyone needed a science credit, and astronomy was considered easier than physics, chemistry, or geology, and not as boring as ecology, if slightly more useless.???Can someone tell me what this one is???????That???s a nebula,??? a student said. ???The Cloud Nebula????The Dr. Fritz Zwicky Endowed Chair of Astronomy didn???t want to discourage the students from speaking up, even when they were wrong.???A nebula is a cloud,??? she said. ???So there???s no Cloud Nebula. This is a galaxy, actually. One difficulty when looking at images from space is that we don???t have perspective. This galaxy is smaller than ours, but the average nebula would be quite small compared to this galaxy.???None of them wrote down the image reference numbers from the Hubble website. No one took notes. There were laptops open, but the students either worked on other homework or they watched videos on mute and occasionally glanced up to see another Rorschach blot from space.???Can anyone tell me what this is???????Horsehead Nebula!??? someone shouted from the back.The Dr. Fritz Zwicky Endowed Chair of Astronomy felt like the butt of a joke. Horsehead Nebula was funny to them.???There is a dark area here,??? she said, ???like in the Horsehead cloud, so I can see a similarity, but this is a black hole. This is a supermassive black hole.???Another student in the back raised his hand.???Yes???????It???s a black hole.??????I just said that.???He lowered his hand slowly, like he still wanted credit for participating, though he???d demonstrated that he hadn???t been paying attention.???Okay,??? she said. ???Let???s shift gears. I want to talk about my work.???She opened a folder from the desktop and clicked on an image she???d gotten from the radio telescope she???d made by repurposing a DirecTV satellite dish and putting it on the roof of her house. It was a screen capture of a very small pixelated blob labeled ???2016 HZ36.??????This object is a couple of miles across and it???s going to kill us all.??????How is it going to kill us???????It???s speeding toward the Earth on an impact trajectory.??????Woah.??????Where???s it going to hit???????It doesn???t matter. With an object of this size, it would burn up everything. Even if you lived, you wouldn???t want to have lived.??????Why hasn???t it been on the news???????They don???t know.??????How come you know???????I spotted it.??????With that microscope in the dome???????The thing in the dome is a telescop",100

I took an old satellite dish and made it into a radio telescope.??????That???s what I meant. You made it from the TV.??????Which is exactly what MacGyver did. I think I seen him do that.??????MacGyver never made a telescope,??? she said.???That???s the point of the show. MacGyver makes stuff you don???t expect.??????I???m telling you that human life is fragile. We???re a drop in the bucket and the bucket???s about to spill.??????Aren???t you cheerful???? someone in the back said.???Why are you telling us???? one of the better students said.???NASA very likely knows,??? she said, ???but they don???t know how to proceed.??????Tell somebody.??????That???s a UFO,??? one of the gamers said. ???That???s a known UFO shape.??????Listen,??? the Dr. Fritz Zwicky Endowed Chair of Astronomy said, ???this is stupid. I???m going to postpone class until further notice. Go live your lives.??????You can???t just cancel class. We???re paying for this.??????Shut up?????? someone whispered.???She has tenure,??? another spat. ???She can do whatever she wants. Tenure is ruining education.??????Will all our classes be canceled? This is really serious. They should cancel school.??????Do we get a refund???????I???ve got a 4.0 on the line. I???m not going to just stop coming.???The Dr. Fritz Zwicky Endowed Chair of Astronomy closed her laptop, disconnected it, tucked it under her arm, and she walked out.- - -Later that day, as she paced back-and-forth and chewed a peanut butter sandwich in her office, there was a knock at the door.A student introduced himself and let himself in. He was a reporter for the school paper and he???d heard about what had happened in her class.???Oh shit,??? she said, and she slumped down at her desk. So she???d already started something, and while there wasn???t likely to be news outlets following the stories coming out of The Talon, word would eventually get out, and she was going to become the face of this thing as it unfolded.She was a scientist, she reminded herself. Her allegiance was to the truth. The fact of this object was something she knew to be true. She apologized for the clutter of her office, and for eating in front of the student. Then she gave the student the interview he wanted and she emailed him the image of the pixelated destroyer. The student took it all in, giddy over finally getting a good scoop. There were student reporters at some schools who won awards, and he suspected that he might finally be in the running. This was a big story, if what she said was true. If not, it was still pretty big.Kate imagined that she was the student???s oncologist, that she was telling him he had six months to live, and that he didn???t get it. He had faith in prayer and miracles. He couldn???t imagine everything going up in a flash and so he refused to see things that way, even as he jotted down the outline of a story that he would draft in plain paragraphs.He thanked her, and he got up to leave. And so the Dr. Fritz Zwicky Endowed Chair of Astronomy had begun her crusade of honesty. Her husband might be disappointed she didn???t sit on her findings a while longer, but what could she do about it now? It couldn???t be helped.The student said the story would likely run in the morning, and she should expect a crowd of students showing up to her classes. But she???d canceled all future classes, so they???d show up for no one, and she was glad. That had worked out at least.- - -The next day on campus, she knew she couldn???t stay in her office, and she couldn???t go to her class. She walked quickly across the quad, in sunglasses and an Orioles cap, when she heard someone shout for her. It was Dr. Rajneesh Gupta, the Vice President of Research.???Dr. Philips,??? he said as he rushed over to her, ???I???ve been looking for you. We need to find ways to monetize your discovery.??? He raised a finger in a way where it might look like he was upbraiding her. ???I want you to propose grants and corporate partnerships before you get too busy. I???ll get you an assistant. I have a list of contacts I can put you in touch with.??????Dr. Gupta,??? she said, ???I???m very sorry, but I have an appointment.??????Nonsense,??? he said. ???This is important.??????Nothing is that important,??? she said. ???Don???t you get it???????NORAD has a plan for this,??? he said. ???That???s why they monitor Near-Earth Objects. They???re going to blow it up or something. Maybe we could get in on that money. Do you know anyone over there???????I don???t.??????I???ve been disappointed by what you???ve brought in so far, but I think this can make up for it. This is gold.??????I???ve got to run.??????My office will be contacting you. You cannot ignore my calls.??????I wouldn???t do that.??????You owe me. We got you that telescope.??????The telescope was here before I was hired. I would have recommended that money be better spent.??????Better spent? That???s a beautiful telescope. We spared no expense. It has a copper dome.??????It has a beautiful dome. You should have known to place it outside the city limits.??????Where no donors would see it? I want you on this immediately. And don???t worry about your classes. We???ll get an adjunct to teach them.??????I???m not okay with that.??????They love it. Who wouldn???t want to teach astrology???????Astronomy.??????We???ll get someone who can teach both.??????Dr. Gupta, I???m not going to write any grants and I???m not going to talk to any of your corporate contacts. I have work to do.??????We???ll write the grants. We just need your name attached to the projects.??????I???m not okay with that.??????You can be replaced,??? he said finally, as she walked away from him. ???Just because you???ve got tenure doesn???t mean you can???t be fired. Your research stance is insubordinate and punishable by termination. You???re working against the mission of the university. You have an obligation to me.??????I can???t be fired for refusing to write grants. I have academic freedom. You can???t tell me what to do. And even if you could fire me, so what? This is the last year for our basketball team to try to make it into March Madness. We???ve got one more batch of freshmen. One more homecoming game. One more rush week. One more student body president.??????You???ll come around!??? he shouted at her, but she was gone.- - -Later that night, as the Dr. Fritz Zwicky Endowed Chair of Astronomy watched a stupid movie on the couch with her husband, there was a knock at the door.???The press???? her husband said.???Maybe. I???ll get it.???When she opened the door, she saw a silver Mercedes parked in the drive and there was a tan man with gray hair in a tailored suit with his son standing behind him, a kid The Dr. Fritz Zwicky Endowed Chair of Astronomy recognized as being from her 11:00 AM class.???I???m Harry Allten,??? the man said and he gave the Dr. Fritz Zwicky Endowed Chair of Astronomy a firm handshake. ???My son Harrison Jr. is in your class and he says you cancelled for the rest of the semester because of some comet? I don???t know what kind of business you???re trying to pull, but you???re paid to teach. I???ve seen enough of this in the state legislature. I???m a representative. So pretty much, you work for me.???Harrison Jr. was embarrassed and staring down at the sidewa",100
316,"lk. The Dr. Fritz Zwicky Endowed Chair of Astronomy had gotten phone calls in the past from parents, usually about grades, but no parent had ever turned up at her door.???As a member of the state legislature,??? she said, ???maybe you can do something about this. NASA knows about the inevitable catastrophic collision of a Near-Earth Object with our planet and they are keeping quiet about it. They???re hoping we won???t notice. But I noticed.???Harrison Sr. wagged a finger at the Dr. Fritz Zwicky Endowed  Chair of Astronomy, and he said, ???I???ve always thought they were up to something. NASA is a cover for black projects. I see it all the time in the state legislature. They call it one thing in the budget when really it???s for their friends.??????Mr. Allten, I don???t think that???s what???s going on here.??????Ever since we lost the senate, I knew they was up to no good. There ain???t no probe on Mars.??????There is a probe on Mars.??????It looks like pictures from a gravel pit.??????It does look like pictures from a gravel pit,??? she agreed. ???But those pictures are from Mars.??????You cancel class,??? Harrison Sr. said, ???and you???re as bad as them.??????Look,??? she said, ???do you want to come in and see it on the telescope? It???s the best way to explain.??????I would.???And so the Dr. Fritz Zwicky Endowed Chair of Astronomy, Harrison Sr, Harrison Jr, and her husband, after introductions, all went up to look at the computer monitors in her home office. And there it was, the deadly blip on the monitor. She realized the object, as a blip, really didn???t look like much, and she would have to convince him to believe her before he left.???You know about the meteor that killed the dinosaurs???? she said.???Evolution isn???t in the Bible,??? Harrison Sr. said, and Harrison Jr. and Charlie both shook their heads with their eyes closed.???The dinosaurs all died off,??? she said, ???because a giant rock from space crashed into the Earth. That???s the prevailing theory.??????Let me ask you something,??? Harrison Sr. said. ???I???ve got a pastor says the Star of Bethlehem was a supernova, and God timed it so the shepherds would see it. Is that feasible? Because I believe these are the End Times and I think God would make another supernova to herald in Jesus???s coming.??????I have no way of knowing about The Star of Bethlehem. It???s a story. There???s no way to confirm it.??????But you???re an astrologer???????Astronomer. A supernova is an exploding sun. It???s possible a supernova would be visible with the naked eye like a star. Especially to shepherds. There wasn???t light pollution and they knew the constellations. They would have noticed.??????So my pastor???s right???????It???s possible.??????I like you,??? Harrison Sr. said. ???Harrison said some of the kids didn???t like you. But I like you.??????This thing is going to hit the Earth,??? the Dr. Fritz Zwicky Endowed Chair of Astronomy said as she pointed at the monitor. ???You don???t have to like me.???Harrison Sr. stood there and stroked his chin. When a thought came to him, he brightened. ???There was a movie like that. Now what did they do in that movie???????Decent in bed.??? ??? My sheets???Stares a lot.??? ???

IT WAS AWFUL.??? And there???s a picture of a cat.???- -Jerica b. 1985: ???I told them, I said, you don???t need to biopsy it and they said, ???Well, who has a tattoo on their finger???? And I tried to tell them, I said, ???It???s a little mustache, see, you put it up to your lip and you have a little mustache.??? But they insisted. So they take a sample and a couple of seconds later they???re like all, ???Welp, it???s not a cancer??? and I???m like, ???No the s-word.??? Then they write me up for oppositional-defiant conduct.???- -Nirvana b. 1992: ??????On fleek.??? It meant when??? when??????- -Mason b. 1983: ???And bacon. We???d put it on everything.

The plan for a Friday night always seems to involve lighting a couch on fire.  Whether this is primordial and deep, or stupid and redneck, you are not sure. When the firemen come, you always think they will be mad, but they are not. They drink cans of PBR with you and just watch. It is possible that life is meaningless and your very consciousness is nothing but a conflagration which will result in a pile of sooty nothingness.2.	You spend all morning staring at your dog until it begins to seem really weird to you that human mouths don???t extend all the way to the hinges of our jaws. Our mouths are so small! They look sewn shut like we are grumpy dolls. Dogs must think we are so ugly. You are overwhelmed by how decent it is of your dog to love you despite your tiny mouth that you wonder if you should call in sick for work.3.	You have gotten pretty good with a blowgun and when you are bored, you blow darts at the beer cans in people???s hands so that foam explodes everywhere. This is generally when people know that you have had too much to drink and turned into Angry Misty and they put you to bed like you are a child and you hate them, you hate everyone who has ever lived.4.	Once, as part of an experiment regarding whether or not you had freewill, you made yourself fuck a disgusting older guy who had huge front teeth like Chiclets. His bed sheets were pinstripe. Afterward he said he wanted to be your boyfriend and you vomited on him and he still wanted to be your boyfriend. You left his house on foot, unsure how you would get home. But on the upside, you definitely do have free will.5.	The last time you called your mother she called you a selfish bitch and you cried and it was snowing and she hung up on you and then you took all the painkillers left from your wisdom teeth and watched the Smurf movie and wrote her a really, really mean email and laughed and laughed as you did it. But a few days later, when you opened the email to see what you said, you were shocked and frightened of yourself and you closed it without reading to the end and tried to forget you ever wrote anything like that to someone you love as much as your mother.6.	You are jealous of the fact that guys can pee standing up, and you think Nerf should invent some kind of vaginal firearm that would allow women to fire bloody tampons out of there. Imagine people???s surprise!7.	There is comfort in the fact that the mountains are so much bigger and more beautiful than you could ever hope to be. You are nothing. You are a speck. Your chaotic meaninglessness in no way mars the landscape. At least there is that. Beauty, even if it doesn???t include you, exists.""Dear You,What happened? I ask myself and others ??? friends, my mother, colleagues, bartenders ??? what, the hell, happened? We were on a clear, but uncommitted and unlabeled (of course, because I lead my life with low expectations and a mantra of flexibility in hopes of only pleasing my surrounding peoples) path of mutual enjoyment. OR WERE WE? I am a mad woman, zooming down a rabbit hole of self-doubt, searching for answers and hating only myself; wrapped up and surrounded by empty pints of ice cream and Nutella, pushed away by my friends who no longer sympathize ??? I am alone. I cling to my Snuggie for relief ??? simultaneously cold and perspiring ??? unable to sleep at night as the blinding UV lights of my iPad mini and the incessant Google searches seep through my corneas: ???He didn???t text back,??? ???Is he into me???? and ???Best online dating sites.???My neighbor Denise, the one who lives above me, the woman who you and I secretly mocked once for not knowing what Instagram was, she tells me to give it time: ???He???s probably nervous. Look at you, why wouldn???t he be?! Let me tell you, it took my husband two years to plant a kiss on these lips!??? she reassured me this afternoon at the mailbox. Two. Weeks. Denise. TWO WEEKS, I yell through tears and a mouthful of Pad Thai. I slammed the door in her face.The memories and exchanges you and I share are etched into my mind ??? I could recount them in my sleep, and have dreamt often about you returning to me ??? and perhaps have pinpointed where I went wrong. I write today to apologize for those mistakes, and vow to move forward with a promise of self-improvement and awareness for your needs.There was the time, after our second date of beers and spontaneous tacos, where I was too generous with the exclamation points the next day. ???Hey, I had a great time last night!!!!??? I cringe now to read that display of despicable immaturity, and apologize, as I later learned that overzealousness and ???texting first??? throws off men. As DonDon22 from Yahoo Answers wrote, ???U made a mistake for texting him first. he should have been the first to text or call u, but since u did that first, u???ve brought ursef low b4 him.??? DonDon22 is right.There was that unusually warm Sunday afternoon, and you complimented my smile. I brushed it off and nervously swung into a stream-of-consciousness mess outlining my orthodontic history and the associated post-traumatic stress disorder. You chuckled your fake chuckle and we parted ways soon thereafter, somewhat abruptly. I apologize for not exuding my utmost confidence and accepting that compliment as it was, and I apologize further for bringing emotional baggage into the mix too early on in our journey. It must have frightened you.And I want to say this, and I???m comfortable bringing it up: The last time I saw you, you remember we caught a weeknight show together, you looked really nice, and I was bloated ??? my",100
318," face, my stomach, my legs, everything. No, don???t try to offset this one, we both knew it, and I could tell you were thinking about it the whole night. I???m not making excuses, but it was a tiring day and I had four slices of pizza for dinner followed by a bucket of frozen yogurt with cookie dough bits on top. I didn???t tell you that. I apologize ??? you deserve to look at a woman who is slender and consistent with her eating habits, not a hedonist. I vow to never suffer from bloat again if it will please you.But, perhaps, above all of these deal-breaking mistakes, and do correct me if I???m wrong (or right!), there is something else happening in that handsome head of yours. You???ve thought about me extensively, maybe, and heart wrenchingly came to a conclusion ??? she???s just too good for me. She???s funny, she???s smart, she???s salaried with benefits ??? she???s perfect. Maybe you struggle to come up with an appropriate ???next step??? as I am always 50 steps ahead of you. The thought of reaching out, wondering what to say next, must be daunting; I can picture it now as you pace across your apartment and scream like a mad man, ???WHAT WILL SHE THINK!? EVERYTHING SHE DOES BOTH AMAZES AND SILENCES ME!!???I understand my actions have silenced both of us, which is why I was relieved to receive my ratings for Cosmo???s ???Are You Intimidating???? quiz, as they affirmed my suspicions. The results read, alongside a picture of Mean Girls??? Regina George, ???It???s great to have confidence in yourself, but by asserting your own superiority, you???re shutting off others and giving the wrong vibes.???I apologize for shutting you off and giving the wrong vibes ??? next time I???ll play nice, just for you. I???ll listen and tell you I love your jokes, your body, your touch. Anything. Let???s start over and unravel back to the days of blank slates and Internet exchanges ??? I???m nicer there.I want you to intimidate me ??? forever. Please text back to confirm.Yours,Maddy1. The Under-Wire DestroyerThis one contains pieces of shrapnel sewn right into the fabric. What could go wrong? Within the first week of wearing, a piece of metal will worm its way out of the cloth because it was likely made my someone who gets paid $7 a day. You will suddenly wonder why you feel like you are being stabbed and it will be because you are being stabbed. By your bra. You will spend the rest of your day gingerly shoving the wire back into place with your thumb to avoid being stabbed in the boob.2. The Lacey FlouncemasterThis one may as well be made of tin foil. You are scratched and tickled incessantly by innocent polyester flowers that do nothing in the way of actually supporting your breasts and secretly hate you. They laugh as your sagging, itchy boobs flounce around in misery. You have this bra because a former sex partner thought it would look pretty on you and they didn???t really care about you. You wear it when you???re thinking about your ex and you hate yourself.3. The Boob EliminatorThis one defies physics and anatomy by forcing your body to reabsorb your breasts back into your armpits, neck, and chest cavity, rendering them immobile. This can be helpful if you are engaging in what is considered a high impact activity, such as the sports or wrestling panda bears. (Don???t actually wrestle panda bears. They are adorable and they will eat you.)4. The NipplerThis one was designed by a room full of people who despise women and, much like the rest of female anatomy, lack a basic understanding of nipples. Basically, the GOP. This bra looks sort of cool if you???re not the one actually wearing it and WHY GOD, OH WHY, IS THERE A SANDPAPERY SEAM OF HORRIBLENESS RUNNING ACROSS THE VERY PART OF MY BODY I WOULD USE TO FEED A NEWBORN BABY?! This bra makes excellent kindling if you don???t first end up violently tearing it from your body in a fit of rage and dropping into the nearest Salvation Army bucket or Post Office box.5. The Pseudo BraThis bra calls itself a bra, but basically it???s about as effective as a layer of cheesecloth draped over your boobs that somehow makes your silhouette look even saggier than if you were wearing no bra at all. Sometimes this is called a ???sleep bra??? because it makes your breasts look like they???re fast asleep after a long day of picking up garbage off the side of the road.6. The OverflowerThis bra makes you feel like an impoverished bottom rung porn star who, when not making porn, is waiting tables in a blue plate diner where you have to bend over to pour the coffee and then suddenly there???s fucking breasts everywhere. This bra works fine as long as you don???t lift your arms or bend forward more than 120 degrees, at which point extra support will materialize in the form of Ron Jeremy.7. The One from the J. Edgar Hoover CollectionThis bra time traveled into your lingerie drawer from the ???fifties and is made of gabardine. It has a sailor motif and several bow accents that look like extra nipples when worn under anything thinner than your winter coat. You save this one for that boudoir shoot you???re going to hire a photographer for any day now because you still do fun, artsy, risqu?? stuff like that. (Actually, you???re pushing forty, and, Jesus Christ, you???ve hung onto this old fashioned bra for over ten years, you fucking weirdo.)8. The One that Gives You a RashThis one is made with a material that is not recognized on the Periodic Table, probably because it was melted down from used Goodyear tires and old Nerf balls. It also was soaked in formaldehyde, a chemical that???s been deemed safe for corpses. The company that made this bra denies this, but you and a few thousand other women have a radioactive heat rash that proves otherwise. Still, you keep it around, because you really should know better than to have breasts in the first place. The fact that you were born with those sin cushions is proof of your inferior intellect and morality and you must receive your punishment as the powers-that-be see fit. Plus, it cost $45 and you can???t return it.9. The One that Doubles as a Kevlar VestThis one is great for your stint on that space station in the future where women are supposedly seen as equals, except that they still are required to wear skin tight neoprene body suits at all times. The nice thing about this bra is that though your breasts appear prominent and adept, they literally don???t move, even when physics should dictate otherwise. Just like in space. In the future.Portrait by Kelly Bjork- -Raven suggests we do this interview at the Twilight Exit. I feel uneasy at first because I???m not looking to draw attention to myself or offend the staff. But then I figure it isn???t such a big deal. As long as we keep it low-key, maybe the setting could help Raven remember more details. The day we meet, the dining area is busy. Raven, a slightly built man in his middle years, looks like the wandering antihero from some post-apocalyptic action movie. He wears a gray hoodie beneath a black motorcycle jacket, and his gray hair is cut into a mohawk. I???ve never talked to Raven before this, but I???ve seen him around a lot, singing karaoke. He???s showy onstage, the gestures and the emotions come tumbling right out of him.I grab us a two-seater. Raven orders a steak dinner, which arrives quickly, and he tells me about his various careers. His past is heavily strewn with accomplishments. It gets hard to keep track of them all. When he was young, Raven says, he created the world???s first sci-fi/fantasy role-playing game, and it sold in 13 countries. He tells me he was a television host for a time, interviewing music personalities for a local program",100
319,". He says he was a mechanical engineer too, developing a part for the articulated flaps on airplane wings. As far as his current agenda, ???I???ve got 12 books coming out in 12 months. I don???t know of anybody who???s ever done that. Do you???????No,??? I said. Raven smiles knowingly.???I???m the golden goose for my company now, so they made me swear not to get in any more fights,??? said Raven, laughing. ???I???ve been in a lot of these situations. Yeah, I???ve been in trouble. Real trouble. I???ve seen violence. I???ve got scars on me from knives. Less than a year ago, I got into a fight on the street protecting some girls. She???d had pizza thrown on her, and I got in a fistfight, attacking a guy who threw it. That???s just one example. I???ve been in many,??? he says.The night of the shooting, Raven had been in the dining area about a half hour with his now former girlfriend Christie and two other friends. ???That entire night was unusual from the moment we walked inside. We couldn???t get our regular seats. Everything was different. Our whole rhythm was off,??? says Raven, framing his story. His sentences are precise and carefully delivered. It seems as if he???s reading them from a script. ???I was sitting near the front of the table because I was going to have to get up to sing.??? Raven thinks he put in ???Just What I Needed??? by The Cars. ???We were just sitting, waiting, talking, and that???s when everything happened. We heard a loud explosion. A bang. A gun went off. At first everybody reacted like they do when it???s a loud noise like that, like it might be a joke. We all went back to normal. But no, the guy started screaming. It was emphatic. It was the kind that only comes around when there???s real trouble. Christie yelled, ???Everybody get down,??? and everybody hit the ground,??? said Raven.???Immediately everybody in the place started to throw furniture over and freak out. I dropped to the floor. Christie dove on top of me. I had to roll her underneath me, and jump on top of her. Then she tried to roll on top of me. We were wrestling about who was gonna protect each other,??? said Raven, laughing. ???That was an actual fight for dominance. I won???t let anybody dominate me in a life-threatening situation, because it???s my job to protect people.???As Raven was on the floor, ???I was underneath a table and looking up at an angle. I saw James come walking straight in, just as big as life. He had his gun in his hand, pointed at the ground. It was a silver Glock with almost stainless steel. The gun was backlit by the flame underneath the jukebox. That cold fire matched the way he was walking,??? Raven said. He sprang up and did a solemn demonstration amidst the customers. ???He was very serious. He was not in the least bit rattled. He wasn???t in a hurry. I thought, ???Oh god, here it comes. He???s gonna kill everybody. I gotta stop him.??? I tried my phone, but our cells weren???t responding because everybody was calling 911 at once and it tied the lines up.???I ask Raven if he was scared. ???Not scared. I was pissed and frustrated because I couldn???t do anything. If I would???ve had a piece on me, I would???ve had a clear shot. God, it was clean. It was perfect. I could???ve pulled that gun out of his hand and put him down. I would???ve shot him before he made it to his target.??????But that would???ve thwarted fate,??? said Raven. ???Whitney needed to be punished. If I would???ve shot him, he wouldn???t have punished her. Knowing her story, she needed to be punished. She???d come into our bar and lied to everyone. She said she didn???t know him and that someone should call 911. But she had a child with the guy. She???d left his house unlocked for him to be robbed, to lose everything he owned. She???d gotten away with this behavior because she was beautiful and a good liar. I never laid eyes on her, but she was described as abnormally attractive. I???ve seen this before. These are traits that only come with unusually attractive females. I know what real evil is like. I know what crazy is like,??? said Raven.I say nothing, and Raven continues. ???James wasn???t out to hurt anybody else. I know he didn???t want to shoot Greg. He tried to shoot him in the leg. He didn???t intend for the bullet to hit the femoral. He didn???t want to kill Greg. But he was not going to be stopped. He wanted to punish her, and then he wanted to die. What drives a man to that???where he???s willing to come in and shoot an innocent person and not kill them and then allow himself to be murdered? Tell me. This is a cul de sac. This is a wall. This is a man who could get no other resolution.??????Think about the facts. James was willing to sacrifice his life to punish her. He could???ve easily killed her, and he didn???t. You know this, you felt this. Her head would???ve blown up on top of her,??? he said. As Raven goes on, I feel every molecule in my body bloating out, doubling in size. There doesn???t seem to be enough room for all of them. For a moment, I???m certain we will be asked to leave, but it doesn???t happen. There are lots of voices in the dining area, and nobody???s paying attention.I ask Raven how he knew so much about Whitney. ???The court cases show it. She???d repetitively gotten away with lying. These things start to add up,??? he said. Raven mentions a previous altercation the couple had at the Twilight two months before the shooting. Raven decided it was Whitney???s fault. ???All of it happened because James had to come in here and look for her,??? he said.(I couldn???t recall the incident???s specifics, so I looked up Christine Clarridge???s article in the Seattle Times after I got home. James was said to have left his baby alone in his parked Mustang while he walked into the bar, searching for Whitney. According to the police report in the municipal court files, he???d driven with the baby free in the front seat, with no use of safety belts. Also, the baby???s clothes were too thin to accommodate the cold weather. James had been charged with endangering the child.)I steer Raven back to the night of the shooting. As Raven was hiding on the floor, James moved across the dining area until ???he disappeared from sight. Christie got everybody out. She was first to open the exit door, and then everybody started going for it. It was very good that she did that. We were stunned and nobody would???ve even thought about it, but she got us all out. I gathered everybody up and I started pushing people out. People were crawling on their hands and knees. I just said, ???Go, go, go, go.??? Somebody had to tap me to leave. I was the last one out. I was waiting to get a bullet in my back. I really was. I turned my back on life, and I, I had to get the people out.???After Raven left the building, ???I screamed as loud as I could. I???ve got a loud voice. I was telling James to come outside and shoot me. Everybody else had bailed at that point. I said, ???Come out, you coward. How dare you come in and threaten me. Come outside.??? While I was saying this, I made sure I was protected from machine-gun fire. I was standing behind the big telephone pole on the corner,??? he said, laughing.Then Raven looked up and into the streets, and ???it was like the films. The police were across the line with their lights flashing. They were coming up on all sides. Christie ran up to meet the police officers, and she ran back with them while she was describing the shooter. She actually said to execute him. I stopped yelling when the police started shooting. I stood on the street and listened to them fire. I grimaced. They fired for a long time.??????At first, all I thought was, ???That",100
320," son of a bitch came in and shot that poor girl. I???m glad they shot him.??? We were all that way. Then we got on the bus, and somebody said, ???There???s a baby. Where???s the baby???? All of a sudden everybody panicked. We all started to get concerned about the baby. We didn???t care whose baby it was. It was a baby, and it was in trouble, and that???s all that mattered. We were all one group. We were all a tribe for a brief moment,??? said Raven, nodding. His eyes get glossy.???As the story started coming out, my emotional certainty started eroding and eroding, and it collapsed. My fury towards her started to mount. My sympathy towards him started to mount. My outrage towards the whole situation absolutely inflamed. I can???t believe it went this far, that it was able to go this far, that all of us were involved,??? he said. ???But I still love this place,??? he adds. ???I walk in proudly. I wish I could come here more. I stick my finger in that bullet hole every time I come in. Every time. It???s kind of like a fist-bump. It???s a real, tactile reminder of an event. Oh I forgot to do it this time,??? he said, and he dashed to the entryway and fondled a rip in the metal doorframe.I ask Raven to throw in a final thought. ???I???ve been writing adventure stuff since I was a baby. It was like being in an adventure again,??? he says.While I???m packing my things, I notice how exhausted I am. I say goodbye to Raven and head straight to the ladies??? room. Empty public spaces give me a pleasant shut-down feeling. I gaze into the beige stalls and think about an exercise I read in Dale Carnegie???s ???How to Stop Worrying and Start Living.??? Dale says to crumple your muscles like you???re a rag. You???re supposed to hold yourself that way all the time, though I???m always forgetting. Dale says he keeps an old maroon sock on his desk ???as a reminder of how limp I ought to be.??? For a while, I stand in the quiet of the bathroom and think about Dale???s sock.When I???m ready to go, I pass through the dining area to get to the door, and Raven ducks into view. He tells me about his Lightsaber battles. He???s in a guild, and ???it???s as crazy as it sounds. It???s a nonprofit. We wear costumes and do charity performances. It???s geeky. It???s so funny. Here, take my card. It???s my last one,??? he said. ???I???m a real Jedi. I still can???t believe it. Maybe you can mention it in your article.??????Sure,??? I said.Image courtesy of ROQ Films.It is with considerable ambivalence that we hereby announce the reopening of Muir Woods National Monument to the public this coming spring. Once again, this marvelous, ancient range of coastal redwoods and giant sequoias will welcome arboreal enthusiasts from around the globe. However, these visitors will now enjoy significant enhancements to the area, developed specifically according to the suggestions of previous guests.The most immediate of these costly renovations is a second, larger gift shop situated just beyond the perimeter of the site. Tourists in a hurry or disinclined to part with seven dollars on the matter of admission can now enjoy the convenience of purchasing a souvenir on the very edge of our parking lot. It may go without saying that this new facility is sure to alleviate some of the congestion within the inner, original gift shop.Despite the strident legal efforts of the Bureau for the Protection of Conspicuous Consumption, we have been granted the right to disable all mobile devices upon park entry with a harmless electromagnetic pulse. This is not an attempt to preserve an atmosphere of tech-less tranquillity, for the record: If you cannot resist the urge to ???selfie,??? use one of our designated tinted kiosks, where mirrors, lip gloss, and blowouts are provided for an additional fee.Those who venture on into the famous groves are sure to also notice at least one loudly weeping individual. Don???t be alarmed. These are professional actors, selected over many months of grueling auditions, whose job it is to emotionally heighten your experience of nature. We have hired consultants who believe that when seeing others overcome by the majesty of your surroundings, you, too, will appreciate them more acutely.Bark and leaves are not enough, the brand mercenaries insist. A millennium???s growth against pests and droughts, fires, floods, and chainsaws ??? this is hardly cause for wonder. Each day I parry proposals for John Muir holograms, a zipline and electric gondolas. A team of Finnish happiness architects has suggested an adult playpen where the psychedelically inclined might frolic unhindered by sober people or drug legislation.On the rare occasions I leave the park I am assaulted with information, all of it bad or disturbing. Tragedies accrue with sinister momentum. In redwood time, of course, this shall pass. A shadow grown long then short again. I think of first laying eyes on this place, at seven. How the pronoun ???I??? wafted up among the branches like a mote of golden dust. Sun shone coldly, splashing no more than the highest needles with light. My mother let go of my hand. They found me hours later, crouched in a hollow trunk, half-feral.Few of you notice the ravens; they cannot help but notice you. You are a storm they weather with their plumage tucked. But there are cruel complaints on the winged wildlife. The people who bother to leave feedback for my team of rangers ??? well, sub-minimum-wage-earning immigrants in movie character costumes I don???t begin to recognize ??? are put off by the faintest of trilling above, too intelligent and conversational. They crave ???dumber??? birds who are ???less stuck-up.??? The solution is, regrettably, forthcoming.What I???m most ashamed of, though, is the trunk cross-section display, the concentric rings accumulated over four thousand seasons (some wet, many dry, the single strand fussed by lightning) that marked a formative Aztec year, the name Columbus, our own break from the British crown??? all the great American angst. I???ve been ordered to unscrew these historical placards. We cannot allow ourselves to shatter your fragile sense of relevance.Finally, you???ll want to know about the subterranean expansion, a change that easily eclipses any of these quibbling adjustments. The state-of-the-art indoor resort complex below the forest???s irrelevant root system is the size of ten football stadiums, earthquake-proof, with twenty miles of boardwalks, arcades, shopping plazas, roller coasters, theme bars, nightclubs, and sparkling HD vistas. We feed the trees intravenously, in case you???re curious.I had not thought of myself as the sort of man who would tell you that you???re appreciating something incorrectly. Yet I find myself believing these changes will slake your fickle thirsts, even so recalling how you whined that the lacy lower canopies blocked your view of the ocean (we trimmed them). If I have done my job whatsoever, perhaps you will come to an understanding of this silent forest, the lone example of its kind on earth. Perhaps you will see its mystery as a luxury, even a convenience.This letter must also serve as my resignation from my post as Chief Ranger. I leave this oasis to those who copyrighted the redwood???s genome, who gather cones on cherry pickers and keep them locked in fireproof safes (to which I recently held the key) and later plant them in arrangements decided by algorithm. Completely pointless, as I mentioned rather often. Saplings can also sprout from a parent???s root, or burl, or stump. Only five percent of the tree???s six million annual seeds are viable in soil.Anyone seeking to grow a new forest from seeds must be diligent. He must n",100

Anyone searching for them will surely have moved on to more pressing endeavors. Short of the immortality that silicon billionaires are after, none of us would endure to be dwarfed by transplants, though research has shown that a warmer climate could accelerate their maturity. I told you they were survivors.Soon satellites may be able to spot my duplicate forest from space, tell you the exact coordinates of my reckless ecoterror. I can???t see it???ll make much difference. By that time, the languages and governments that rule your fortunes and mine won???t matter. Their successors may well have left the solar system behind. I would. What do we want with this dead moon, the infernal sun? Mars is boring and red; the asteroid belt is dirty. We???ll find somewhere better and fix that up, too. You won???t even recognize it.With misplaced fondness, etc,    Chief Ranger Otis McFateMuir Woods National MonumentMill Valley, CaliforniaI don???t know much about Anne Bront?? (who does?), but I think she???d be pretty pissed off because it seems like all of the research dedicated to only her begins by asking something along the lines of ???Is Anne Bront?? worthy of study????Worthy of study, indeed. Pish-posh, as I think a proper English person would say. (I don???t know much about proper English people, either, but pish-posh seems right and is quite fun to say.) If you???re bothering to write an article or book about Anne Bront??, clearly you think she???s worthy of study; if not, then even you would agree you???ve wasted a significant portion of your life studying her.Anyway, the fact that scholars continue asking the question of Anne Bront?????s worth seems particularly biting when we remember where we???ve heard her name before. Anne Bront?? was the younger sister of both Charlotte Bront??, writer of Jane Eyre, and Emily Bront??, writer of Wuthering Heights. So Anne was not the younger sister of two fairly good writers; she???s the younger sister of women considered two of the best novelists in history. A bit hard to live up to, I imagine.Of course, in their lifetimes (which were relatively short: Anne lived to be 29; Emily lived to be 30; Charlotte made it to the ripe old age of 38), none of the Bront?? sisters were as well-known as they are now. Their reputations were built over time, unfortunately most of that occurring after they died. Still, when you publish books right alongside your sisters and yet ages later are the only one considered possibly unworthy of study, I imagine it???s difficult.There???s no doubt that Anne loved her sisters very much and would not want to be remembered as angry or jealous. Still, my sister has been my best friend for my entire life, and yet she???s the only person I???ve ever attacked with a vacuum cleaner. What I???m saying is that sisterly emotions are complicated.So, pious and polite though she may have been, Anne Bront?? is still left in the shadow of her older sisters, and I for some reason (perhaps because I???m petty and small) really need her to be a little ticked about that.Because who???s heard of Agnes Grey, or The Tenant of Wildfell Hall? Yes, yes, some of you are shouting at the screen and thrusting your hands in the air like eager schoolchildren, anxious to prove that you have heard of these novels, and that you???ve read them, studied them (and thus probably wondered if they???re worthy of study), perhaps acted in their television dramatizations. Good for you. That???s great, and I???m not being sarcastic. I???m happy you???re out there, and Anne Bront?? certainly would be, too. But you are a rarity, is my point.So why is Anne Bront?? so relatively unknown, compared to her iconic sisters?Perhaps it???s the content of their books. For this rather cursory investigation, I???m going to choose only one novel by each sister, though each of them wrote more than that. I will also go from oldest sister to youngest, because it seems fair and if Anne is, as my dearest hopes suggest, fuming from the grave, I want her to know that I???m trying to be systematically fair.Charlotte Bront?????s novel, Jane Eyre, is considered one of the best ever written because of its insight into the life of a young woman, specifically a governess, and the ways in which it demonstrates her growth through age and experience. Jane must navigate an unloving guardian after her parents die, unfortunate conditions at her boarding school, and the mysterious and sometimes infuriating Mr. Rochester, her employer once she becomes a governess. There is a rumored alcoholic in the book, a prophetic lightning-damaged tree, life-changing female friendships, psychic predictions, hushed attic activity, whispers on the wind that simply must be answered (out loud and in the middle of nowhere), more than one house fire, and several people who are evidently less attractive than one is accustomed to expecting. You should read this novel immediately.Emily Bront?????s novel, Wuthering Heights, is usually described as an unruly revenge tale, full of ghosts, foggy moors, the truest of true loves, the direst of dark hate, a few more moors (oh, that???s fun to say), and generations of characters who all seem to be named after each other. It is gothic and dark, full of characters for which readers will always have strong feelings. One wonders what other brilliant works Emily might have written had she not died the year after Wuthering Heights was published. Read this one, too. You???ll thank me later.Anne Bront?????s The Tenant of Wildfell Hall is about a woman who moves into Wildfell Hall (as you might have predicted, from the book???s title) with her young son and wishes to keep to herself, but her neighbors, particularly the man who finds himself attracted to her, won???t leave her be. The story of this woman???s past finally comes out and reveals reckless attraction by the carelessly wealthy, both verbal and physical abuse, and a wish for both revenge and freedom. Anne detailed some characters??? drunken revelries so well (thanks to her firsthand experience with her brother, Branwell) that it was a bit of a scandal. Yes, read this one, too. You won???t be sorry.Anne was more interested in tidy morals and religious messages than her sisters were, but even so, she???s written a novel that is captivating in some of the same ways as Charlotte???s and Emily???s. Anne???s books, you could argue, take on some of the best characteristics of both of her sisters??? works, making use of the moors that surrounded the Bront?? family home as Emily did, and giving her female characters considerably more backbone and capacity for reason than was common, which is what Charlotte did.Perhaps this would be the most frustrating aspect for Anne: the sisters were all three more similar than they were different. Look at the portrait made of them together by their brother, Branwell. They all three share an expression that can only be described as fierce.alienAn extraterrestrial who makes the children boogie.(see mama-papa; Ziggy)babeThe one with the power. What power?

The rock group had fans, fame, fortune, and other good things that started with the letter ???F,??? the alphabet???s coolest letter throughout the sixties. However, many conspiracy theorists believe the Beatles did not have one key element starting in the later half of the decade: Paul McCartney.Theorists claim that McCartney, one of the top four Beatles, died in a car crash in 1966, and, in order to keep the yellow cash $ubmarine revolving down Penny Lane buying love at every stop, record executives and the other band members replaced Paul with a lookalike.Examining the claims of conspiracy theorists, debunkers, and providing my own conjectures, I???ll leave it up to the reader to determine if the Paul Is Dead theory has Wings, or if we can bury it in Strawberry Fields Forever and Let It Be.NOTE: If Something is capitalized, it???s probably a music reference, except for words at the beginning of sentences and the names of people. Those are capitalized for no reason whatsoever.- - -Conspiracy Claim: Sgt. Pepper???s Lonely Hearts Club Band, the first album made after McCartney???s death, features a lyric where the Beatles introduce their listeners to ???the one and only Billy Shears.??? Billy Shears is the name of the man who replaced Paul in the band.Debunking Claim: Billy Shears is merely the name of a member of the fictional Lonely Hearts Club Band. Also, if Paul had died and been secretly replaced, it???d be insane for the Beatles to use such an explicit lyric with the replacement???s real name.Rebunking Claim: The Beatles wouldn???t be silly enough to announce the new Paul???s name, but they???d be just the right amount of silly to hint at his death. Using unnecessarily complicated anagram technology, I???ve determined that the letters in ???Billy Shears??? can be rearranged to form ???Shilly bears.??? This would mean nothing to someone without an in depth knowledge of the Beatles (whose original name WASN???T the Beatles, it was something else), but since I???m a Beatle boy through and through, it has all Come Together. All super fans know that the original McCartney???s favorite hobby was playfully mocking bears in a Scottish accent. ???Shilly bears??? (???silly bears??? in real English) were obviously the final words Paul ever spoke before the bears had enough of his nonsense and mauled him to death. Any criticisms of this claim can easily be shut down by noting that ???maul??? and ???Paul??? rhyme together really well.- - -Conspiracy Claim: On the album cover of Sgt. Pepper???s there is a wreath shaped like a bass guitar, McCartney???s signature instrument. This proves he died and the Beatles replaced him. They left the wreath as a clue to an astute viewer.Debunking Claim: The wreath is either a merely aesthetic choice or a tribute to the Beatles??? original bassist Stu Sutcliffe who passed away in 1962.Rebunking Claim: The yellow wreath is a red herring. The true smoking gun on the Sgt. Pepper???s album cover is that, if you look close enough, the drumhead says ???Dead Is Paul,??? which when reading the words backwards aloud (clever, Beatles!) sounds very close to ???Paul Is Dead,??? which when put into the context of whether or not Paul is dead, seems to hint that Paul is dead! Also, McCartney???s grave can be seen in the bottom left of the cover.- - -Conspiracy Claim: In the final moments of the song ???Strawberry Fields Forever,??? John Lennon can be heard speaking the words ???I buried Paul,??? thus Paul is dead since buried people normally aren???t alive.Debunking Claim: John Lennon has stated that what he actually said was ???cranberry sauce.??? Conspiracy theorists simply heard what they wanted to hear.Rebunking Claim: What Lennon actually said was ???Cranberry Paul,??? an attempt to tell the world that Paul had died and had been replaced by a can of cranberry sauce wearing a convincing wig and a set of even more convincing googly McCartney eyes.- - -Conspiracy Claim: The Abbey Road album cover signifies that Paul is dead. It features a funeral procession with John, dressed in white, symbolizing a clergyman. Ringo is in black as a mourner. George is in denim jeans and a denim shirt as a gravedigger, and Paul, barefoot and o",100
323,"ut of step with other members of the band, is the corpse.Debunking Claim: Each Beatle made their own wardrobe choices for the photo without any sort of underlying meaning. Paul even wore sandals for 4 out of the 6 photos taken, however one of him barefoot was chosen for the album cover.Rebunking Claim: You can see any group of four people and convince yourself that their outfits suggest they???re a part of the classic clergyman, mourner, gravedigger, and out-of-casket corpse four person tried-and-true funeral procession. You really need to look at the photos taken, but not chosen for Abbey Road???s cover to get a glimpse at the truth about Paul. The one below shows just how many Paul lookalikes the Beatles were using to keep the truth about his death from being found out about Here, There and Everywhere. It???s obvious why they didn???t choose this photo for the cover, Because it???s slightly out of focus and some of the Pauls are blinking.\- - -Conspiracy Claim: The fake Paul???s solo projects and albums with the band Wings are so bad that he had to have died and been replaced with a less talented person.Debunking Claim: [Nothing could be found to debunk this conspiracy.]Rebunking Claim: Oh!

I checked in with these guys and they???re still onboard, nearly a decade later.Before we get into the playoffs, let???s get Los Angeles out of the way. The Rams need to consider starting fresh in L.A. Perfect time to part ways with Jeff Fisher. For a guy who was born there, and starred for USC, he doesn???t seem very L.A. at all.

In recent years, if you gave a weird look at a nightclub to a guy who catches passes for the Patriots, you maybe ran the risk of being shot. Now, if you???re a neighbor of guy who catches passes for the Patriots, you can get on his case about how his carport ruins your Providence, RI neighborhood???s 1774 vibe and nothing will happen to you. And this week, a different guy on the Patriots smoked fake weed and ended up scaring the bejeezus out of himself. Their top receiver, Julian Edelman, has to play on Saturday with a steel plate in his shoe so his foot won???t break again (it would also be cool if he had to play the whole game with a lit candle in one hand, seeking out uncharted spaces on the field) and they???re on their 944th running back of the season.Usually none of this matters.

The whole ???Tom???s playing MAD this year, because of Ballghazi??? narrative is unsustainable for a whole season. The Patriots will not repeat as Super Bowl Champions, and the real reason is because right after the Patriots won the Super Bowl, Tom Brady was in a gym in lower Manhattan, and on his way out, a group of children (and one strange adult male) raced up to him and asked for autographs and selfies and Tom, in a handsome trench coat, gave a wan, vaguely hemorrhoidal smile and said, ???I???m kinda doing family stuff today.???Chiefs win.PACKERS AT CARDINALSThe Packers had a similar fast start, and a much more severe decline. Their offense has functioned a lot like a man (we???ll call him Mike McCarthy) on a business trip who has to make a big presentation to a room full of handsome, Type A, Ivy League grads who also were Navy Seals. In the men???s room before the presentation, McCarthy is sucking on a lozenge at a urinal. ???Gotta get the voice ready!???He casually spits out the lozenge, thinking it will land in the urinal and melt away. Instead, the lozenge (with glue-like surface) lands in his pubic hair. McCarthy winces, and quickly tries to flick it out. That does not work. The harder he works to remove it, the more tangled it gets. So much so, that soon he is tugging wildly at his private parts right in front of the urinal.He begins to sweat. Muttering under his breath. A man walks in and observes him.???Mike? Jesus.??????It???s okay!???Ummhmm. Shouldn???t be doing that here. Anyway, see you in five, buddy.???Clock ticking, McCarthy now perspiring, just has to surrender. Leave the hardened lozenge right where it is, pull up his pants, and get to the meeting. His fingers are all sticky, as are the front of his khakis. The LEGO-sized lozenge is still attached to his nether regions. And as he walks, it gets tugged in different directions and that actually hurts. His focus is gone. He thinks only of how liberating it will be to get a pair of scissors and cut it out.In the meeting room, there is no podium. The table only comes up to the top of his thighs. So he stands awkwardly with a folder in front of the crotch of his lozenge-stained khakis for 45 minutes. Still perspiring relentlessly. Unable to gesture and change slides on his laptop se",100
324,"amlessly with just the one good hand.He quickly toggles ahead in his presentation to a GIF of a giraffe eating leaves that always lightens the mood. It will not load properly. His audience waits. McCarthy still will not put down the folder, now moist from hand sweat.Packers lose again.STEELERS AT BRONCOSI???m assuming the telecast will begin with an earnest 19-minute apology from Jim Nantz. ???We owe you, the fans, as well as our sponsors, a better game. You did not see that last week. What you saw would be unacceptable on the PGA Tour, a courthouse, and most places of worship. And we let you down.??? People who watch this game will be let down, too.Broncos win.In recent years, a new and disturbing phenomenon has been discovered among America???s youth. This strange new trend, led by a small but relentless minority of ???squeaky wheels,??? is a reaction to what until now was considered a perfect normal part of growing up. This experience, referred to as ???bullying??? by these ???activists,??? is, apparently (in their words, not ours), the exploitation of a lower-status child by a higher-status child through repeated and unrelenting emotional, physical, and psychological torments. Why these complainers seem to think that it???s better to protect our children from the ???real world??? than have them face it at as early an age as possible is unknown to school administrators, but to be sure, the ???anti-bullying??? crazy has spread across the country, from small town to big city to rural schoolhouse, and it???s high time we address these issues head-on.What has caused a sudden concern about ???bullying??? is unclear ??? in fact, such complaints seem completely without precedent in the history of civilization, throughout which those with less power have primarily (with the exception of a few major social and political revolutions) accepted their lower status and the exploitation it naturally resulted in. Suddenly, however, parents of weak and whimpering children have begun to find the negative attention (the operative word here being ???attention???) shown them by their genetically, socially, or otherwise superior peers unacceptable and untenable. And so, as educators, it has fallen on us to be the first line of defense in protecting the ???bullies??? (as they are now called) from such accusations and their harmful side effects.Whereas such power-imbalanced relationships used to simply be categorized among the various types of healthy and normal friendships experienced by children, it seems that the disenfranchised members of such partnerships are no longer interested in participating in them, despite the very real benefits of the relationship, such as attention from someone cooler and stronger than you, and a series of challenging encounters that build mental and physical toughness.Here are some signs that a person is feeling ???bullied??? (according to them and their entirely subjective experience which, while we may find it silly and overactive, we must take seriously if we are to be proper mediators and advocates in such encounters):Complains when picked last in sports despite clear physical deficiencies.Interprets physical violence, taunting, jeering, etc. from peers as ???aggressive??? rather than ???just the kick in the pants they need to stop feeling sorry for themselves.???Insists the ???bully??? is ???not his friend??? even when it is pointed out that they ???sure do spend a lot of time together for people who aren???t friends, Andrew.???Apparently the ???bullied??? (again, their term, not ours) have decided that the ???mental anguish??? they withstand at the hand of the ???bully??? is ???too much??? for their ???tender constitution???, and wish to actively disengage from the ???bullying??? relationship. Therefore, regardless of the level of seriousness with which you as the educator might take these claims (which in some cases will be not seriously at all), it???s important that you act on them, both to cover your own ass and to protect the bully from his accuser. After all, today???s bully may very likely be tomorrow???s CEO, President of the United States, or middle-school gym coach.Disengaging the bully from his source of power, however, can leave him (a side note: science has proven that bullies are always male and that girls who engage in behavior that exploits the power structure are simply ???Queen Bees??? and do not pose a serious threat to anyone but uncoordinated girls who can???t seriously think they have a shot at making the cheerleading squad) with little outlet for his natural and biologically imperative rage, requiring educators to find other healthy outlets for the bully???s very real physiological needs.Helping a bully find new and less-complained-about outlets for his intensity is a task that hitherto will fall on the educator. Some possible activities include:Working in the school locker room, which builds character while allowing the bully a controlled environment in which to judge (and, with supervision), gently taunt or physically intimidate students weaker than him.Building a deck for an attractive young divorced neighborhood mom. Sometimes a young boy turns to bullying because he is too strong, mature, and handsome to relate to his peers. Getting attention from a sad but beautiful woman who hasn???t felt a man???s touch in months if not years can often be the self-esteem boost the bully needs to feel the love and affection he may never have experienced from his mother.Learning to dance, perhaps for the school talent show, preferably in secret, which burns off excess energy, takes up unstructured time, and, in the end, gives peers an opportunity to see the bully in a ???new light,??? perhaps making them realize that it was really society???s fault ??? and by extension theirs ??? for not seeing the true, gentle soul of the bully underneath all that violent anger.Remember, your role as an educator is to maintain a healthy learning environment for all your students, especially the stronger alphas without whose support your authority might be completely nullified. Providing the ???victims??? with a real sense that you are attending to the (perceived) problem while maintaining your unspoken alliance with the strongest of their peers will help teach everyone an important lesson about where they fall in the power structure, and what they can expect from the unforgiving world outside of these hallowed halls. Thank you in advance for your attention to this very ???real??? and ???serious??? issue, and for all that you do to help turn our students into productive and compliant members of our predetermined social hierarchy.I recently found out that the gym classes at my specialized high school are dubbed ???Honors??? Gym Classes. We wear the same rancid smelling, never-been-washed pinnies to play the same emotionally scarring games of dodgeball as every other high school in America, but we are still Officially Better Than You and we???ve got the Official Transcripts to prove it.I mean, Honors Gym? I am basically an NFL athlete, minus the problematic allegations and the multimillion dollar salary! My very sweat is smarter than yours!And years from now, whenever faced with the glad tidings of my peers??? accomplishments, I will have but one response: OK ??? but were you in Honors Gym? They will be confused. But then again, the common people often are.Earlier this week my school had its annual entrance examination. Over two thousand preteens and their parents circled around our block and waited for the double doors of Wisdom to open. In especially cold weather, the scene may resemble a Depression-era soup kitchen line.On the bright side, the .07% ",100
325,"of students who are accepted will soon be rewarded with Honors Gym and similar distinguish-ments. The others will struggle to come to terms with their perceived stupidity. The proctors will find other work, the administrators will collect $100,000+ in exam fees, and the student volunteers probably still won???t have enough service credit to impress colleges.Am I exaggerating? Not at all.Am I ungrateful? Possibly.To be fair, I???ve always felt a little bit like an outsider. First of all, the aforementioned .07% will consist almost entirely of White and Asian students. There might be one hijabi in the incoming class, and when I pass her in the third floor hallway months later I will smile and greet her because I know her already, I know her and the long sleeves she will wear in gym class and the role she will play during the ???Islam Unit??? and the role she will play always and the questions she will have to answer and the teachers that will always, always mistake her for me.Second of all ??? and I am slightly ashamed to admit this ??? I only took the entrance exam because my mother bribed me. I knew nothing about my school at the time. My entire specialized high school experience is the product of an ill-conceived desire, many years ago, for a pair of Kenneth Cole ballet flats.Do I regret it? I honestly don???t know. I haven???t sampled the Unspecial life.Can I still be bribed with a good pair of shoes? Absolutely.I think that a majority of both the Gifted and the Ordinary can agree upon the general unpleasantness of gym class. In fact, up until this semester, I have maintained a long-held and well-justified hatred of all things PE related.(Do basketballs care about the fact that I have other non-fitness related marketable skills? Do hockey sticks duly take my religious/ethnic minority status into consideration before they start hacking dents into my shins? Do I ever have enough time before class to change into: socks, sneakers, baggy sweatpants, a shirt I accidentally stole from some girl at camp, two Nike ???maximum support??? sports bras, and a gray bedazzled headscarf? Uh, no.)As it turns out, gym class-induced misery is a welcome relief from SAT/ACT/GPA-induced misery; from the cutthroat, number-driven madness that is my school; from the fact that once again I find myself standing in an endless file to gain acceptance into a selective institution. And this time, there???s more on the line than a pair of shoes. Or so I???m told.Despite it all, my gym class remains completely average. Every week I can anticipate arguing about what the team name should be, dismally failing Insert Grudgingly Decided Team Name, and shielding my face from both flying sports equipment and tremendous shame.You could say that gym class is my rock.It can even break (albeit temporarily) the most unbearable of egos. During the period, my classmates and I suddenly don???t look like the city???s Most Gifted. We look like a group of teenagers who will definitely smell bad if approached.In a few short months, the .07 % that I have come to know ??? my graduating class ??? will disperse. In other words, we will get our college decisions back. There will be the Accepted and the Rejected, the ???Winners??? and the ???Losers??? ??? as simple and irrevocable as picking teams ??? and I???m not sure I want to be there when it happens. Some of us will realize that a) maybe we???re not so special anymore, and b) there is something wrong with our nation???s increasingly competitive and racially stratified two-track academic system.The Rejected will eventually recover from their perceived stupidity, the administrators of each respective school will collect hundreds of thousands of dollars in admissions fees, and high school students nationwide will continue to search ??? achingly ??? for easy community service hours.Perhaps the only lingering reminder of my specialized high school experience will be the lone hijabi younger termers who, long after I leave, will continue to be called by my name.Of Ice and MenParadise FrostFahrenheit 32SnowlitaTo Chill a MockingbirdA Tree Froze in BrooklynMiddlejanuaryMansfield ParkaIn Colder BloodThe ChilliadI???m Turning The Color PurpleCatch-Twenty FluA Farewell to Bare ArmsThe Big SleetThe Importance of Being FurnacedA Tale of Two DegreesThe Sound and the FlurrySomething Frigid This Way ComesAtlas ShiveredThe Scarlet SweaterThe Cold Man and the TeaDear Fellow Nurturer:Thank you and congratulations for taking care of our daughter, Ovul, while we are gone.The following sets forth some basic information about Ovul and instructions for her care.  As discussed during the sixth screening interview, it is important to us that you feel completely relaxed and comfortable while you enjoy your time with Ovul in our house.  Please countersign at the end of this document and initial each page to indicate that you agree to feel completely relaxed and comfortable while you enjoy your time with Ovul in those parts of our house to which you are allowed access.What You Need To Know About OvulOvul is six months oldOvul is Pisces AscendantOvul is in the 99th percentile for height and moral awarenessOvul currently identifies as femaleOvul has flaxen hairOvul is an ideal weight for someone with her frameOvul has eyes the color of the Himalayas at sunriseOvul has two parents, one of whom has a paying jobOvul is pre-diabetic and pre-depressedOvul has been fully immunized against negativity and excessive consumerismOvul is smart, athletic, curious, a problem solver, and an accomplished yogiOvul leans inWhat We Need To Know About YouYou are patientYou are compassionateYou are kindYou are kind of flexible on our return timeYou know CPRYou know how to eliminate the smell of vomit from a crib sheetYou know you are being filmedYou know that we will never consider you an ???employee??? no matter how many hours you work for usYou accept bitcoinYou accept your lot in lifeYou can find humor in devastating personal humiliationYou can believe this gig will get better even if it won???tYou can believe in something bigger than yourself even if she is smaller than youFeedingOvul takes a bottle, as Jamie no longer shows any interest in breastfeeding.  We make our own formula.  In a blender, please mix together the following ingredients, some of which you will have to grow:  mint chutney, daikon, sunflower sprouts, yams, roasted cauliflower, kelp noodles, and sprouted probiotic brown rice.  If Ovul gags convulsively during her feeding, it is okay to comfort her with a warm bottle of raw camel milk.  Ovul eats 3-14 times a day.AllergiesOvul is allergic to honey, tree nuts, peanuts (including the cartoon), Android-based cell phones, foam, fracking, wall-to-wall carpet, gels, plastic, copper, network television, humidity, the holidays, flannel, thick fur and pressure.BathroomWe practice ???elimination communication??? with Ovul, so there is no need for diapers.  Ovul will clearly signal to you that she needs to use the bathroom by either scrunching up her face, shifting around restlessly, or peeing down your back.  If you are ever unsure if Ovul is signalling you, you can also rely on your intuition.  For example, if you have the sense Ovul needs to pee, that probably means she needs to pee or it might mean that she has already peed in your tote bag.TelevisionOvul is allowed 10 minutes of screen time a week, with the exception of the following videos, which she can watch on an unlimited basis:  Jamie giving birth; Jamie practicing her TED talk; Jamie delivering her TED talk.ComputersOvul is sensitive to WiFi.  If you need WiFi, please use the neighbors???.MusicResearch consistently shows that early exposure to",100
326," classical music helps in the development of a child???s creativity, memory, literacy, social development, motor skills, cognition, immune function, spatial intelligence, emotional intelligence, empathy, self-expression and self-esteem.  But Jamie hates classical music and would rather just obsessively play  Joni Mitchell???s Blue all day long, so that???s probably what you and Ovul will be listening to.EntertainmentOvul has been identified by Jeff as high achieving/highly gifted/high income.  Please engage Ovul in intellectually appropriate and stimulating games, including chess, Monopoly, flash trading, and statistical arbitrage.ExerciseAt sunset, please take Ovul for a light jog of 13 miles at a 5:30/mile pace.   Please use the Team Six AWD Hybrid Stroller in the garage.  Please note, this stroller easily converts to a car seat, changing table, and tree house.PlayPlay with Ovul should be entirely child-directed but should always incorporate at least two lightly sanded wood blocks and a recycled piece of hemp cloth.  Praise should be limited and specific.  For example, if Ovul hides one of the wood blocks under the recycled piece of hemp cloth, you should look up from your phone and say ???Wow, you hid the sanded wood block under the recycled piece of hemp cloth!??? instead of ???Hey, let???s do something else.???ReadingOvul enjoys stories by Dr.  Seuss, Mo Willems, Margaret Wise Brown, Martin Amis, Haruki Murakami, and God.  She is currently reading Infinite Jest, which we made into a 178-volume board book and store in what used to be the master bedroom.  She is on volume two.LanguageWe believe strongly in the importance of exposing Ovul to foreign languages and cultures. Whenever possible, please speak to Ovul with a southern accent.Rules of the HouseNo swearingNo sweatingNo sugarNo steviaNo scented personal productsNo sportsNo use of your phone other than to tell us you can stay lateNo visitorsNo Gladiator sandalsNo use of the word noNo exceptionsLeaving the HouseOther than to jog with Ovul and shop for the ancient grains listed on the back of this note, please do not leave the house while we are away.  If you do find you have to drive somewhere, please use your own car, which should be electric.  To the extent they are not inconsistent with Ovul???s needs, please obey all traffic laws and respect the rights of other drivers.EmergencyIn the event of an emergency, don???t waste your time calling Jeff???s mom.  She???s useless.  When Ovul was born she came out for two weeks and didn???t do anything and lectured us the entire time.  She actually didn???t even stay the full two weeks.Location of Items You May NeedCandles: If the power goes out, you can probably find a few candles in the basement.  Please do not use the Diptyque candles you see in every room of the house.First Aid Kit:  We have a first aid kit in our vacation home in Joshua Tree.Fusebox:  No idea.Gas shut off:  No idea.Fire Extinguisher:  Jeff hasn???t picked one up despite Jamie asking him to like a 1000 times.Flashlight:  With first aid kit.NappingOvul does not have a ???naptime.???  She naps when she is tired.  Some signs Ovul is feeling tired include yawning, rubbing her face, touching her ears, yanking on your ears, spitting in your eyes, screaming, pointing at the crib, crawling to the crib, putting her head down on a flat surface and descending into what appears to be a coma.NighttimePlease use the following routine when putting Ovul to bed for the night.  IMPORTANT:  you must begin this routine no later than 11:00 am:  bath, story, bath, bottle, dance, song, bath, peek-a-boo, vacuum, walk, bath, interstate drive, bath, story, bottle, Harvey Karp, bouncy chair, bath, swing, count-every-star-in-the-night-sky-and-make-a-different-farm animal-noise-for-every-star, bath, bouncy chair, hair dryer, Harvey Karp, Target run, classical music, jazz, country, alt country, trip hop, story, bath.  If Ovul still has trouble going to bed, there is a large bottle of lorazepam in the medicine cabinet.  Take four and when you wake up, Ovul should be asleep.If you have any other questions, Jamie???s parents and our regular nanny will be here with you while we are gone.We will be back in half an hour.??? Jamie and Jeff- - -Read ???Jamie and Jeff???s Birth Plan.???1. How does this work?Great question, Gus. First, I will get some background information about the cause of your call today then collect some personal details from you (full name, DOB, credit card information, etc), you will give me the credit card your wife or partner doesn???t have access to, and finally, I will process payment for a test at a clinic near you. Feel free to be as detailed as possible. I???ve been trained to not have an emotional response no matter how vivid or lurid your story gets. Think of me like a doctor, except I earn $12.50 an hour and I have a degree in History that my parents told me would be useless.2. Can I get HIV from a stripper???s breast milk?Great question, Andy. I had to Google the answer to this question since it wasn???t covered in the training I received for this job. I found a great deal of NSFW links before I landed on BabyCenter.com. Apparently, you can, Andy. If said stripper is HIV positive and you choose to consume her breast milk it could result in you contracting HIV. No judgment here, Andy. Let???s get you set up for $99 Rapid HIV test.3. Do you guys sell STDs?Great question, Rich. Did you mean do we sell STD tests? If so, yes we do! We sell tests for all the major STDs: HIV, herpes, chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, and Hepatitis B! All for the low price of $249.  If you meant do we sell actual STDs, no Rich, unfortunately, we do not. If you???d like I can forward this feedback to our sales department and perhaps this will be an offering on our site in the near future.4. Did my boyfriend give me herpes?Great question, Ann. Unfortunately, our tests are not advanced enough to tell us who gave you this STD. We appreciate your offer to mail us his shaving razor for DNA purposes, however, unlike the fully functional crime lab you saw in that one episode of Law & Order: SVU, we can only test blood and urine samples given to us with the explicit consent of the donor. I???m sorry for any inconvenience this causes.5. Can I use my mom???s credit card for this?Great question, Martin. You can absolutely use your mother???s credit card for this transaction as long as we have your personal information on the test and you bring a valid ID to the clinic on the day of your test. ???Section C: Connecting With the Customer??? from our Quality Assurance manual encourages us to use personal experiences to comfort our customers, so let me just say that it???s great to hear that you have such a great relationship with our your mother. I, personally, plan on letting my mother think I???m a virgin until the day I die. She???s Catholic. Very different from your mom, Martha.6. I saw this number in my son???s phone. Does he have an STD?Great question, Martha. While I appreciate your concern for the well-being of your son, I cannot disclose any details about any of our patients to any third-parties, even if those parties are the ones who pay his cell phone bill. If you are concerned about any of your own recent sexual encounters, please allow me to walk you through our panel of the most common STDs: HIV, herpes, chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, and Hepatitis B. All for the extremely affordable price of $249. Are you still there, Martha?[Originally published January 12, 2016.]- - -Should we increase the character limit of tweets to 142 characters?No.Increase the character limit of tweets to 145 characters? No. No one wants this. No Twi",100
327,"tter user in the history of our platform has ever encountered the problem of trying to cut down a tweet that was a few characters over the 140-character limit. This simply isn???t an issue.Increase the character limit of tweets to 150 characters? How many of these suggestions are going to be changes to the character limit? We are not changing the character limit. 140 characters is an integral part of Twitter???s identity. People are drawn to the simplicity of Twitter and the constraint of 140 characters. We must keep Twitter???s identity simple and clean.Studies show that Twitter engagement is not going up because Twitter is too boring. What if we added HTML functionality to the tweets so people could make fancy tweets with fancy and distracting formatting?This is a great idea! Finally, a way to make tweets more exciting. Imagine a flashing pink, bold, all-caps tweet! That will be sure to boost excitement and engagement.A function that shows the top 10 most liked tweets of the day posted by the people you follow.No. We already have the new ???While you were away?????? function which shows some arbitrarily-selected tweets from some random subset of the people someone follows, which is basically the same thing.Tweets that disappear a few seconds after you see them. This is a great idea that the teens will probably love but if we do this then how will we get to keep the data?Ability to edit tweets.NO. ABSOLUTELY NOT. YOU DO REALIZE THAT ABOUT 95% OF OUR READERSHIP COMES FROM PEOPLE WHO LIKE TO LAUGH AT FAMOUS PEOPLE FOR SPELLING THUINGS INCORRECTLY, RIGHT?People keep tweeting ???.@twitter??? at us with their complaints and because they are putting the period before the @-symbol, all of their followers can see them dissing us.We have absolutely no idea what this means. What does this mean. Is this a Twitter thing. Is this a thing people on Twitter are doing now? Also this isn???t a suggestion for a new feature.Can we make the scrolling method different? Maybe having the newest tweets show up above the older tweets isn???t the best way to do it. What if we flipped it so the newer tweets show up underneath the older tweets instead?Yes. This is a perfect example of the type of arbitrary change that users of our platform love and have come to expect from us.Or better yet, what if the tweets scroll side-to-side? Or even better, what if the newer tweets show up in front of the older tweets and we make everything 3D?! Let???s make Twitter 3D.Twitter but 3D?! That???s perfect. We love this idea. Investors will love this idea.Can we hire more women to be part of the core Twitter team?If we suddenly started hiring all these women out of nowhere, wouldn???t that look a little suspicious? Isn???t that sexist? We don???t want to get in trouble here. One thing???s for sure, we would definitely get a lot of backlash from the men???s rights activist community on Twitter ??? a very large and active part of our user base. And we certainly don???t want to upset any of our users. Let???s just play it safe and keep our team exactly the way it???s always been. That way everything will be the fine and normal, and most importantly, the same.Can we hire more minorities to be part of the core Twitter team?Again, isn???t it racist if we started hiring a bunch of minorities all of a sudden? And what???s with all this talk about diversity, anyway? Our company???s diversity statistics are exactly on par with all the other major players in the tech industry. If diversity was an issue, don???t you think Google, Facebook, Apple, Yahoo, LinkedIn, Instagram, and the rest of Silicon Valley would have more diverse teams as well? But they don???t. Look, diversity in tech is simply not an issue. Let???s focus on more important things, okay?How about a ???Super Like??? function where you can show you really, really like a tweet, but you only get one ???Super Like??? every day?See, this is a great idea. If only Tinder hadn???t beaten us to it. We don???t want to seem too desperate to copy other apps. Except Instagram. Do we have any ideas that make us more like Instagram?Ability to rate tweets on a 5-star scale instead of a 1-heart scale.Actually, this works great for Yelp. Let???s do that. Let???s be the Yelp of opinions from random people on the Internet.A ride-sharing service that matches drivers to people who need a ride. The service would operate on a contractor-based model so even though the service seems like a taxi service, it is absolutely immune to taxi laws and regulations. Also, later on once the platform finds popularity and success, we can add a new feature that allows strangers to share rides together, and no one will use it.This is a great idea with no precedent and no foreseeable repercussions. Let???s implement this as soon as possible.How are we going to deal with plagiarism? Plagiarism is rampant on Twitter. What about a feature that automatically blocks a tweet if it???s detected to be an exact copy of another tweet. No??? Plagiarism is good. It drives user engagement and traffic. If we restricted plagiarized tweets then we would lose 98% of all the tweets on Twitter.An algorithm that doesn???t show all tweets but only shows you tweets above a certain number of likes or that is customized to predict only what the reader wants to see.Hmm??? we proposed this last year and everyone complained. But it must be a good idea because Facebook is doing it. So let???s just do it anyway.We need more ads to generate more revenue. Can every other tweet be an ad? Actually can we make every single tweet be covered by an ad that you have to watch for 15 seconds before you can see the tweet?Yes, this should be the next iteration of Twitter Ads. This worked for YouTube and it will definitely work for us.When a user blocks someone, it should block that person from showing up anywhere at all in their Twitter experience, even if someone else they follow retweets them and even in searches.No, because if we did that, the user would never ever be able to see the person they blocked on Twitter at all. That???s definitely not what people want when they block someone.Pay-for-verification feature.This was a great idea to generate more revenue, but we tested a pilot version with that horrible Breitbart Editor guy @Nero, or Milo Yiannopoulos or whatever his name is, and look at what a disaster that turned out to be.Allow users to see the tweets of people nearby.Sure, this seems like a quirky function for strangers to find each other that in no way could go wrong. Let???s do it.Can we make it so that the ???follow??? button that???s on the bottom right corner of every tweet in the mobile app isn???t so easy to accidentally click all the time?But how else would we be able to expand the connections between our users? After all, isn???t life just a series of accidental connections?We should change the tweeting structure so the platform offers the ability to post 10 tweets a day for free, then you have to pay to post more.Interesting. This may be our way to finally make some real money. People love paying for services that were previously free because it legitimizes the service. Brilliant!We need more fun features. Can we have a feature where any user can press a button and it will get Lin-Manuel Miranda to turn their tweet into a rap lyric?Honestly, we love this idea and have already reached out to him but he said he???s too busy to do it.Okay then can we get an even more elaborate animation of the heart exploding into a firework whenever you click ???like??? on a tweet?Whoa whoa whoa, hold on now. Our team has been working on this for months and months but this stuff doesn???t just happen overnight you know. Be patient!W",100
328,"hen are we going to rework the retweet button so it plays an elaborate and awesome spinning animation to match the exploding heart firework animation?AGAIN. THESE THINGS TAKE TIME. OUR TEAM HAS BEEN WORKING ON THE PERFECT SPINNING RETWEET ANIMATION FOR YEARS. IT???S COMING.A better reporting and response system for harassment and abuse.Listen, this is a great and noble idea but we simply don???t have the time or resources to work on this.Okay well then you know how we have balloons that show up on someone???s profile page when it???s their birthday? What if we make the balloons an interactive mini-game where you can pop the balloons and score points for absolutely no reason.Yes. This is a great idea. It???s fun, useful and important. Let???s dedicate all of our remaining funding to make this happen.Increase the character limit of tweets to 1000 characters.No. If we are going to dramatically expand the length of tweets, then this number is not hilariously excessive enough.Increase the character limit of tweets to 2000 characters.Isn???t Instagram???s character limit for their captions 2200 characters? Can we be better than Instagram?!Increase the character limit of tweets to 5000 characters.On the right track, but not better than Instagram ENOUGH.Increase the character limit of tweets to 10,000 characters.Yes. YES. Now we are showing Instagram who is the boss. Implement this IMMEDIATELY.If we are doing longer tweets, we need a new name to differentiate the new, longer tweets from the old, 140-character tweets. We should name them ???tweeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeets??? because that word is longer than the word ???tweet.???Ha-ha! Brilliant and clever! Done! Goodbye tweets, hello tweeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeets!While we???re at it, ???Twitter??? is a bland company name. Let???s just rename ourselves to ???Tumblr 2.0.???Done.It???s time for a revolution??? in our federal dental plan. ??? George WashingtonThe White House is totally haunted. ???

It???s not just about one man???s wrongful conviction and exoneration; it highlights the systematic flaws in the criminal justice system that afflict the entire country.

It would never work.???Track 1: ???French Toast???This haunting ballad set the blogosphere on fire when it dropped in late September, cementing Janet???s status as an indie darling.  The entire album was recorded in the home we shared for many years, creating a rich, warm sonic tapestry that draws you in immediately. We made French toast every Saturday in that house. It???s hard to believe that I am not even mentioned in this song. Listen for the unique reverb effect created by the walls of the breakfast nook.Track 2: ???Shaking Bad???We???ve seen Janet???s vocal range in the past, but she takes things to new heights on the album???s most stripped-down effort. This track deals with our sex life, and Janet spares no detail. From the unsettling description of my body to the no holds-barred revelations concerning my endurance and general aptitude, this one deserves a couple of listens. Pay special attention to the vocal solo where she mocks the noises I make when I climax.Track 3: ???Worthless???A scathing takedown of my hopes and dreams, the third track on the album is definitely one of the standouts. Referencing our frequent deeply personal conversations about my career and self-image, she warbles, ???You think you???re an artist / But you???re just a fucking writer.??? Sounding like a young Patti Smith, Janet forgoes conventional lyrical structure in favor of a more provocative style. It works; I was furious upon hearing this track.Track 4: ???Tuscany???I hate to admit it, but this song is beautiful.  Employing a host of exotic instruments, Janet evokes the verdant fields of central Italy in this ode to wine and leisure. The use of the theremin during the second chorus really took me for a ride. Choice lyrics include, ???I???m finally free, I???m finally free / Oh, Tuscany / You set me free.??? Although this track is not a direct slap in the face to me, it???s difficult for me not to think of our long-held plans to travel through Europe together.Track 5: ???Tom???A searing personal confession of infidelity, ???Tom??? punches you right in the gut, especially when you show up at ???Tom???s??? house to confront him. Backed by a powerful orchestral arrangement, Janet recounts an extended love affair that began a devastating two years before the divorce. Tom comes over to Janet???s house during the day, while her husband is home, wearing his noise-canceling headphones in his office. Listen to this one with a glass of wine, or if you???re me, a box of tissues and some mystery pills.Track 6: ???Fame???An obvious homage to Bowie, Janet infuses some Philadelphia Soul into this dancehall cut chronicling her rise in the music industry. I remember a time when she wasn???t so well-known, when we were just two kids trying to figure things out. Now she has everything figured out and I am writing about her. But not speaking to her. Did fame tear us apart? Maybe. Will ???Fame??? tear up FM radio this winter? Definitely.Track 7: ???Because of You???The title track is a blistering response to my many shortcomings. Over pounding drums and a relentless funk beat, Janet enumerates the various ways in which I failed to live up to her expectations. She takes me to task with lines like, ???Never made music like you said you would / Never helped with the kids like you knew you should.???Track 8: ???Redemption????In this crisp jam, Janet provides a light-hearted account of my attempt to win her back. I bought her favorite flower, orchids, and went to her new condo. She hugged me and said she???d been thinking about me and that she had made a huge mistake. Just when I thought I had her, Tom leapt out of the closet and shouted, ???Gotcha!??? Since they recorded the whole thing, Janet creatively uses Tom???s ???Gotcha??? sample as an insanely catchy chorus that I???ve been humming for weeks.Track 9: ???Sign the Papers???A direct appeal to me and an attempt to embarrass me on the national stage, Janet is demanding that I finalize the divorce in this upbeat closing track. I???m holding off for now, as I have a good feeling that she is going to change her mind. Janet kicks off a string of U.S. tour dates next week. I will be at every show, reminding her that I still love her.

Sometimes, she said, the specter of a woman appeared behind you.I was just a kid then and didn???t want her to think I was chicken, so I went into the bathroom and did what she said: ???Bloody Mary, Bloody Mary, Bloody Mary.??? When I opened my eyes, the ghost of Mary Todd Lincoln was standing behind me.My whole body shook; I burst into a cold sweat; I couldn???t move. ???It was the opinion of my late husband,??? Mary Todd croaked, ???that the Constitution is a permanently binding contract between the individual states and a strong federal government.???I felt the blood drain from my face. ???What if the federal government oversteps its power???? I asked. ???Shouldn???t a well-armed citizenry have the right to force the government into submission????Mary Todd???s ghost thinned as she returned to the Other Side. ???Where,??? she asked, ???does armed resistance end and domestic terrorism begin???????Arson in the Night???Recently, my son and I noticed an invasive plant species moving onto our property. The only reason these weeds reached our land was because the Bureau of Land Management wasn???t tending their own territory. One day, we set a controlled fire to protect our pastures. We didn???t think much of it???goddamn it, our land is ours to burn, even if it borders a wildlife refuge???and by dusk the fire die",100
330,"d down having done its job.A few nights later, our dog Jeff Davis dashed to the front door and scrambled onto the porch. He barked like mad into the night, but there was nothing there. I was about to go back inside when I heard the crunch of boots on gravel. In the driveway, two men dressed in black from head to toe stepped out of the shadows. I don???t know whether it was the Bureau of Land Management patches on their shoulders or the bureaucratic darkness in their eyes, but something about them sent chills down my spine.???Who are you???? I stammered. ???Where did you come from????Their only words? ???Controlled or not, fires on government land are costly to the taxpayer and jeopardize the lives of firefighters. You???re under arrest on the charge of arson.??????The Ouija Board???A few years ago, my buddies and I were hanging out in our friend???s basement after a Ruth Bader Ginsburg effigy-burning party. We ordered pizza and bummed a few beers from his roommate???s stash while we watched a zombie flick. We got bored, so we pulled out a Ouija board and asked it a few questions.???Is there a ghost in the room???????N-O.??????Has anyone ever died in this house???????N-O.??????Will the current Supreme Court loosely interpret the implied powers of the federal government???????Y-E-S.???No one spoke. Terrified, we shoved the Ouija board back into its box as fast as we could and ran upstairs.???Liberals from the Great Beyond???I grew up in an old farmhouse that dated back to the 1820s. My family wasn???t sure why, but something in that place didn???t feel right. Faucets dripped black ooze. Shadows played across the walls without any person to cast them. No matter how many times we moved it back to the bookcase, my dad???s copy of Decision Points, the heroic saga of the George W. Bush presidency, always ended up in the trash.One night, my mother placed a call to a nearby historical society. We thought the ghosts of past residents might be holding grudges against us, and so we dug deeper. The phone rang with our answer and my mother left the living room to pick it up, eager to hear who the previous tenants had been. But by the time she got off the phone, we already knew.Scrawled on the ceiling in dripping blood, a message told all: ???We voted McGovern.??? The spirits were liberal, and not the ???practical??? kind.???The Guest Bedroom Ghost???There???s a guest room at my uncle???s house that no one ever uses. No one mentions why, so I decided to sleep in it one night on my way here to join the militia. ???What???s the worst that could happen???? I thought to myself.Around midnight, I sensed something out of the corner of my eye. I was sure the big oak tree outside was just casting shadows, so I didn???t think anything of it, but then I felt a tug on the bedspread. Turning over, I looked into a pair of transparent, silvery eyes.???We already fought this war,??? said the specter of a bloodied Union soldier. ???Why do you insist on revisiting it???????I think it???s more complicated than that,??? I answered groggily. ???The Obama Administration doesn???t understand that??????Portrait by Kelly Bjork- - Steve moonlights as a karaoke host at various bars. He???s the best. A stout man in his early-middle years, Steve manages to infuse all situations with a plain-dealing optimism, just as the upstairs neighbor does in Tony Orlando and Dawn???s 1970 easy-listening masterpiece ???Knock Three Times.??? I???ve come to associate him directly with the song, because I???ve heard him use it as his warm-up so many times. I???ve been seeing Steve at his gigs more than a decade, so I???ve gathered a load of facts about him. On top of maintaining his consistent late-night schedule, for instance, Steve???s got a full-time day job at a waste-and-recycling company. This routine seems impossible to me, but he???s used to it. He worked a whole lot more when he was younger, he says. Steve???s also a father to three adult children, a fan of Bob Seger, and an active bowling hobbyist. A couple times a year, he and his league vacation together in Vegas, where Steve enjoys going to shows and lounging alongside pools of Windex-blue water. Also, Steve is solidly bald. He used to wear a hairpiece, but then he stopped in a spectacular way, through social media. He posted a picture of it on the floor of his shower, all soaked and wadded. The caption suggested it had slid off by accident. No one saw it again.Steve lives as a bachelor in a distant neighborhood, in a top-floor condo with giant windows on every wall. So much white sky brings the space a placid feeling. The living room is tidy and contains unsurprising items: various sports memorabilia, wildly comfortable lounge chairs, a good entertainment system. Steve visits the Twilight regularly, so I begin by asking whether he???d previously met James and his girlfriend.He hadn???t. ???They were described to me as day drinkers, so we wouldn???t have been in the bar at the same time,??? he said. Steve???s first encounter with James happened the night of the shooting. ???I???d gotten up to use the restroom, and when I came out and was walking back, James was standing there, screaming at the bar. I thought it was directed at someone I knew, and I thought, ???Now why would the hell would he be yelling at her like that???? I started to step over, and Greg was already there. He was pushing James towards the door, so James was leaving backwards, and he kept looking into the bar. I had a moment of eye contact with him. I wanted him to know there was more than just one person there, so I gave him a look that said, ???What the hell, dude.??? I saw his eyes then. He had the crazy eyes. He was incensed. I was like, ???This dude is straight-up crazy.??? Out the door he went.???Steve passed the incident off and returned to his traveling karaoke stand, with its plastic milk crates and stacks of binders and discs the size of frisbees, flashing with silvery rainbows. (Fun fact: Throughout the years, Steve has come to memorize the number-letter codes designating every song in his collection. There are about five thousand.) ???I was probably a half hour into rolling songs,??? he said. Someone was was singing Tina Turner, and George Michael???s ???Faith??? was up after, Steve remembers. ???I???d already pulled the disc for it. When the other song ended, I???d put the new disc in, and I was almost going to announce into the microphone who was next and fire up the track. That???s what I was doing when I heard the first pop. It was such a large bang. I thought it was a balloon or a firecracker. It seemed like it was coming from the jukebox. But after the second shot, I had no doubt what was going on.???James entered, gun in hand, and he crossed the far end of the dining room on his way to the lounge. Police records suggest there were about two-dozen customers with Steve in the dining area. ???Everybody hit the floor. I mean everybody,??? he said. Steve got down too, shielding himself behind a Pac-Man cocktail-table arcade. ???Nobody was standing. Everybody was down. Then the most awkward thing happened. The next song started. The music actually came on right then. You know, I didn???t want to be the one person in the bar to irritate the guy with the gun. I was scared, I was on the floor. I thought to myself, ???I have to stand up. Shit.??????(After the pop, I heard only screaming. I don???t recall hearing music, so I ask Steve what the song was, whether it was ???Faith??? or some other track at the start of the disc. ???I don???t remember,??? said Steve. He stopped and looked into a middle distance. A short moment went by, and then he said again, with confidence, ???Yeah. I do",100
331,"n???t remember.???)Steve took care of things fast. ???I got up, reached over and I pulled the volume buttons back. While I was up, I swiped the shuffleboard trough to get what I could. I???d always put my keys there, and two phones. One was my work phone. I wasn???t able to grab everything, but I did grab that. I turned its volume off and immediately got back down on the floor.???James disappeared behind a bend as he approached the back corner of the horseshoe bar. ???I couldn???t see what was going on, but here???s what I???d assessed, and this was all the assessing I needed. James???s attention was not on our half of the bar. Maybe that brief encounter I???d had earlier kind of clued me in. Right away I???m thinking, ???Crazy fucker in the bar. There???s a crazy fucker in the bar with a gun.??? But I didn???t get the sense he was gonna kill everybody. There was nobody approaching us, nobody looking at us. There was nothing holding us there.??????I was really concerned about my tiny environment, the area running parallel with the shuffleboard table. I was at one end of it, and I needed to be at the other end. There???s an emergency exit there,??? said Steve. ???I go in and out of the door all the time when I???m loading my gear, so I knew the alarm wouldn???t sound,??? he said. A couple young women, friends of Steve, were right in front of the door. ???They were frozen. I don???t think they knew the exit was there, and I sure wasn???t going to knock them over running past,??? he said. After Steve got their attention, the women opened the door and bolted outside. ???They were the first and second out. I was the third. The girls went right and I went left. I never turned around. They didn???t either. They ran home. They lived only a block or two away. Once they hit their front door, they never came back,??? said Steve. In the months after the shooting, one of these women met with Steve. ???She thanked me a billion times for telling her to get the hell out the door, but my actions didn???t feel heroic to me,??? he said.Steve ran to the mini-mart next door, called 911 and the bar owner, and waited with a group of witnesses, including two I???ve mentioned in-passing: the lady friend Dave had been on a date with, and the guy in the wheelchair who was hanging out with Ryder. ???I thought a lot about the cop who had to enter that unknown situation, with no windows,??? said Steve. Later that night, as he boarded the witness bus, ???I was completely focused on Steve-O???s pants. They were saturated with blood,??? he said. The blood was Greg???s, and ???the events that led up to him not dying are crazy,??? said Steve. Several precise and seemingly random things had to occur, and in a certain order. I???ll get to them later.The evening after the shooting, Steve returned with his son to the Twilight. He needed to retrieve his karaoke equipment and his car. He???d parked it in the loading spot directly in front of the building, and it???d been cordoned with police tape until the forensic team finished processing the scene. ???[The Twilight???s owner] called me when they gave him his bar back, and I came right over,??? said Steve.???It was eerie. I saw some of the bullet holes. There was an insane amount of blood on the floor. The owner said he???d have to hire a professional to clean that up, but a couple staff were there and cleaning what they could. They wanted to get the bar reopened fast and get back to business as usual. They???d put what was left behind on a big table, all the purses and cell phones. I remember seeing Darrel???s disc case on the table. He???s a professor at UW, and he brings his own music. He sings Mumford & Sons,??? said Steve. These items were transported to the Twilight???s sister bar nearby, where people would trickle in and reclaim their belongings.Most witnesses had no reason to enter the Twilight before its official reopening, other than Steve, but Lexi and I had stopped in as well. Things were crucial for us. We???d abandoned our keys, jackets, money, and cellphones in the bar during the rush to escape. Without them, there wasn???t much to do but wander the sidewalks together the following day, laughing at all our hilarious misfortunes, but sometimes crying about them too. Steve wasn???t there, and right after we grabbed our stuff, we split.As I was leaving Steve???s place, his son entered the room. He looked about 20. He greeted me, then handed me his cell phone. The screen showed the puddle of blood where James had died, inside the bar. I???d seen it there too that evening I???d returned. The image matched my memory. I looked at the picture a long time.Hi everyone! Doug here. Thanks for visiting this part of our website! Here are some questions I expect many of you will be wondering about!Who is getting married?I???m told people were confused upon receiving the invitation, which requested your attendance at ???The wedding of Doug and M&M???s.??? Many have asked if ???M&M???s??? is a nickname for the bride or perhaps an acronym. No. I am marrying M&M???s. The candy.What?The candy.How did the couple meet? M&M???s and I have known each other for many years (I dare say intimately! Ha-ha!) but one day at work I was talking about how much I loved M&M???s. My co-worker, Phil, asked if I loved them so much, why didn???t I marry them. And here we are. Phil???s the best!Does/do M&M???s have a gender identity or preferred pronoun?She or her. No one likes to be called ???it??? so don???t do that. Also, please steer away from ???them??? even if, at the wedding in particular, you are faced with thousands of M&M???s at once in mountains such as you would have never imagined. Keep with the singular. Thanks.Is this marriage even legal?I looked through all the law books I could at the library and found nothing that said a person couldn???t marry candy. Granted, there was nothing that said a person COULD marry candy but you can???t prove a negative and correlation does not equal causation. Quid pro quo.Will there be a bachelor party?Yes! This is going to be a really fun event (not TOO fun! ha-ha!). I would have loved to have invited all the fellas attending the wedding but Phil, my Best Man, tells me that there is only space for ten on the tour of the M&M Mars factory. Those already invited to attend the party should prepare for a looooong night as this tour will be extensive and detailed. Also, no alcohol will be available as it could interfere with the manufacturing.Will there be a bridal shower?I don???t know. I can???t figure out how that would work. Probably not. I???ll let you know if there is. Probably not, though.Where should we park?Anywhere in the employee section of the M&M Mars factory parking lot. The wedding is on a Saturday so there should be plenty of spots.Do you understand what marriage even is?I understand what love is! And the rest we???ll just make up as we go along! I???m surprised how often this particular question is raised, to be honest.Again about the bride, who or what will be standing up there?It???s a good question since what I???m marrying is as much a concept as a physical entity. Joining me at the altar will be the bag I was holding when Phil (love ya, Phil!) first suggested we tie the knot. It???s been reinforced with a lot of duct tape but I???d say there are still ten or twelve manifestations of my beloved in there.???Who on Earth would agree to conduct such a ceremony???? (direct quote from my sister)We have managed to secure the services of the daytime manager of the M&M???s store in Times Square in New York City. She has been ordained online so, yes, Gretchen, it???s legal.If I eat M&M???s, am I then eating your bride?Thank ",100
332,"you for asking. I have thought a lot about this and I feel that yes, you are. But that the spirit of M&M???s goodness does not die upon consumption. If anything, the joy one feels upon consuming M&M???s makes the spirit of M&M???s grow stronger and more powerful. I believe that this resultant joy is imbued in the new M&M???s being constantly manufactured in Hackettstown, New Jersey, site of the wedding, where there are several hotels and fun things to do.Where will the couple live?My apartment, which is estimated to be capable of containing 253 million M&M???s. We???re going to put that to the test! Ha-ha!What about the stuff that happens on the wedding night? How will that work?That???s when we???re having the reception!So will we be actually consuming your bride at the reception?She insists, I???d bet!What if I prefer Peanut M&M???s?Fuck off.The holidays are finally over and your body is tired.

A baggie of oregano I intend to sell to pre-teens?Yes, it???s me. Some of you might recognize me as the Yo, Games! intern let go for his dynamic, outside-the-box approach to mail fraud. Still others might know me from my failed start up, Big Twizzin, a company that sold novelty-sized reproductions of a licorice candy that I can???t legally name.Well, forget all that ??? let priors be priors, as the saying goes. Because tonight I???m here to introduce a dynamic, disruptive start-up that???s ready to change San Francisco forever.Ha-ha, yes, Aiden: ???He has a knife!???  That???s exactly the sort of instant engagement I???m going for.Allow me to explain. Knife, the company, is a disruptive idea that is right on the cutting edge. Users ??? in this case, me ??? simply brandish their knife to take money from neighboring tech workers. By leveraging hyper-local tactics, I am able to capitalize on the excess capacity of your incomes. And, unless you want to see me penetrate your market, you???ll pay up.Knife has a story as simple as it is inspirational. I was barely scraping by as an artisan substance mogul, squeezed out by gentrification and Big Frank. One night, hoping to pivot myself to a hot meal, I found myself looking at the office buildings high above me. I wondered: had the tech world forgotten me, and, by extension, all those less fortunate? And, in this on-demand economy, could I demand money with a knife?That???s the philosophy behind Knife, an exciting start-up that Wired called ???Please don???t hurt me.???From those humble beginnings, Knife has spread throughout the area in a viral, gritty campaign. You may have already met colleagues or neighbors who can???t stop talking about their experience. And, not to brag, but I???ve already been labeled a local ???person of interest??? in several publications.Don???t even think about it, Aiden. One false move and you???ll be an angel investor.Well that???s my elevator pitch ??? excuse me, alley pitch. And, if  any of you aren???t convinced to be part of this crowdfunding, I???d be happy to give you an intimate, face-to-face exploration of the Knife dynamic.No? Excellent. Crowdfunding is an important part of any new company, and I???m glad to see you all on board with our freemium ???not-getting-stabbed??? pac",100
333,"kage. Wallets and jewelry up to the front. Series B will be you in the back, and???Is that a siren? Huh. See, that???s problematic: in the proud tradition of disruptive start-ups like Uber or Air B&B, Knife doesn???t exactly hold by dusty old legality.It???s a shame to pivot so quickly, but hey; that???s start-ups for you. Still, even as I prepare to run through these alleys, I feel confident in knowing that I left behind a legacy. Which, for the record, is different than evidence.In the meantime, don???t get caught off-guard for my next investment opportunity. I don???t want to jinx anything, but let???s just say that ???Sock Full Of Quarters??? might be the next thing on everyone???s lips in 2016. Especially Aiden???s.Thank you so much for being with me on the #Knifed journey. Be sure to use the hashtag in the police report!This will be a little different than most of my columns. I generally try to pick comedians or TV shows I dearly love. That love is usually accompanied by knowledge that???s somewhere between thorough and obsessive. I had watched every Archer episode at least five times when I wrote about the show, and I think I???ve memorized half the jokes written by the subject of my first column, Jack Handey. I might be an idiot, but I???m an idiot who usually knows his stuff.Not this time. I don???t know a whole heckuva lot about Bill Burr, other than he is a comedian and was on Breaking Bad. But after a friend???s wife got sick, I ended up with a free ticket to Burr???s standup show at the Chicago Theater in October. One of his jokes stuck with me, and here we are.Based on one show, I found Burr a hard comedian to figure out; his persona was a bit incoherent. Much of his shtick seemed old-fashioned and Neanderthal-ish: for example, a long bit about why woman deserve to be paid less than men. The premises of this joke ??? like how men need to pay for women???s dinners, etc. ??? were so archaic I felt like I stepped into a time machine, and not a cool one. After the odd routine, Burr assured us all that women do deserve to be paid more, which only added to my confusion. Is the Ralph Kramden routine just a pose to draw in meatheaded fans? Is so, why backtrack? I felt like I had accidentally walked into a Republican fundraiser, and I suspect Burr is like a lot of Republican candidates: putting on a show that appeals to the worst instincts of his crowd.I have no problem with comics who say awful things: I???m a huge fan of Anthony Jeselnik, whose recent Thoughts and Prayers special on Netflix included a joke about how he didn???t want to give his nephew a Barbie doll ??? because it gives ???little boys unrealistic expectations of how easy it???s gonna be to tear off a head.???I loved that joke. By any measure, ripping off a woman???s head is worse than underpaying her. The difference is that Jeselnik is being deliberately absurd: he used the old-fashioned, stereotypical idea that ???Boys shouldn???t play with dolls??? to set up a far more preposterous and unlikely punchline. But Jeselnik isn???t pandering to serial killers: he???s just trying to get a surprise and a laugh. Unfortunately, Burr does seem to be pandering to sexists and other lunkheads, which is disappointing.I don???t know how much Burr???s performance was hurt by the crowd, which was kind of awful. There wasn???t so much heckling as there was obnoxious, drunken yelling. It sounded like there might have been a lunatic in attendance ??? or perhaps a real Neanderthal. Burr was annoyed but gentle with the heckler. It was a good reminder that being a standup is one of the hardest jobs in entertainment: it???s not be as physically demanding as being thrown off the top of a cage by the Undertaker, but it might be the emotional equivalent.Anyway, the joke that is Burr???s Best Joke Ever ??? er, Best Bit from the One Night I Was Aware of Him ??? involved Hitler and Michael Jordan. Talking about Hitler isn???t a particularly promising start for a bit. While there is the occasionally inspired idea, like when Louis CK compared Ray Charles to Hitler in an avalanche of absurdity, joking about Hitler is usually about as hacky as it gets (as is talking about airplanes, which Burr did for about a half hour). But Burr did have a Hitler routine with a somewhat decent premise: that Hitler is unquestionably the Michael Jordan of evil, but he doesn???t deserve it because Stalin killed so many more people.Burr weaved in and out of this topic for about ten minutes, but the endpoint was what made the routine stick for me. To wrap up the bit, Burr summarized:???Stalin is Jordan. Hitler is just Kobe!???I love this punchline for many reasons. The first is I???m a huge NBA fan, and it???s the only sport I know enough about to actually argue ???Who???s better???? type stuff. I love debating where NBA players like Jordan and Kobe rank with Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Wilt Chamberlain, Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, and LeBron James (who, by the way, might be the Funniest Basketball Player Ever based on his performance in Train Wreck).This joke is comedy perfection for the NBA nerd who has a sense of how Jordan and Kobe rank. If that???s not you, Jordan is the unquestioned greatest player ever, as demonstrated by his six NBA titles, six NBA Finals MVPs, 5 regular season MVPs, numerous scoring records, and ridiculously entertaining style. He was also a jerk and a bully who actually wore a Hitler mustache for a while.Kobe Bryant ??? who recently announced his retirement ??? came along a little later and modeled himself after Jordan with great success: he has very similar skills and has had a Hall of Fame career. While Kobe hasn???t won quite as many titles as Jordan or nearly as many awards, he has a reputation for being just as much of a jerk and bully. He topped Jordan in the bad human being department with a rape allegation. Kobe is one of the best players of all-time, greatest jerks of all-time, and kind of Jordan???s Mini-Me.So the idea of insulting Hitler by comparing him to Kobe??? that???s pretty damn funny. It also makes me wonder who???s the Tim Duncan of evil or Charles Barkley of evil. With this joke, Burr achieved the high level of absurdity I enjoy in my comedy ??? even if you have to be an NBA nerd to get it.1. Ninja2.  Guru3.  Cub4. Master5. Sage6. Apprentice7. Grasshopper8.

The support groups listed below will help you move on by getting the highly specialized help that you deserve. If you have lost friends or family to some of the evils listed below, just take a look at our options, and I???m sure you will find a group that fits your needs.IMPROVISATIONAL COMEDYHas this happened to you? Your best friend from Wesleyan stopped helping you with your web series to take more improv classes, and is starting to get a team together. Your fianc?? dropped out of law school to pursue a career in comedy and you???re wondering if that guy you met on your cruise in Florida would still be interested. If this sounds painfully familiar, now is your time to heal. Don???t feel neglected anymore. Say ???Yes, and?????? to getting better.VEGANISMYour loved one has been looking pale and fragile, and there???s nothing you can do about it. All your roommate eats is kale chips and nuts, and she is  withering away. Whenever she has enough energy to speak, she just quotes lines from Jonathan Safran Foer???s Eating Animals. You want to stop feeling so helpless, and for your friend to stop looking so hungry. At each meeting, we can help you convince your friend or relative that veganism is overra",100

(Don???t worry, we will be serving unlimited cold cuts every week).PODCASTSHas your boyfriend worn his WTF WITH MARC MARON T-shirt three times in a row this week? Does your mother no longer have time for you because she just discovered Serial and needs to find out how it ends? Then this group is the perfect way to distract yourself from the fact that everyone is too distracted by their podcasts to pay attention to you.CROSSFITIf you???ve lost a friend or relative to this treacherous activity, you???ve probably already realized that CrossFit is 10% strength training and 90% talking about CrossFit. Sure, you try to bring up other important topics, like the Benghazi hearings, or that video where the bunny marries a goat. But it just won???t work. At this group, you???ll discover new ways to promise them an abundance of protein, and then guide the conversation in a new direction in order to talk about anything else.BLOGGINGYou think your friend is already too far-gone to be saved. Every waking moment is spent making self-destructive decisions for ???inspiration.??? You want to hold an intervention, but know they would enjoy it too much, and use the incident as something ???quirky??? and ???fun??? to write about afterwards. The only way you can reach this friend is by tweeting at them. Here, we will help you to craft your very own blog so that they will finally notice you again.PAINT NITEAfter two glasses of wine, your cousin thinks she???s the Van Gogh of her generation. But you know that the only thing that???s got to gogh are those Instagram pictures of her drinking next to twenty identical paintings of an Eiffel Tower. This group will allow you to channel your anger, and create abstract paintings while sober.DAVE MATTHEWS BANDIt might be too late to seek help. You should just consider finding new friends and/or family.UNNECESSARY SUPPORT GROUPSYour loved one has probably lost complete perspective on reality. Learn how to gently tell them that they have too much free time on their hands to be attending pointless support groups, and should take up a hobby instead, like CrossFit or Paint Nite.You see that lamp in the corner? Look again ??? a wisp of blond hair is your only clue that it???s no ordinary lamp.- -This delicious pizza you???re about to enjoy? Doesn???t that pizza seem a little taller than you remember? And pizzas don???t normally have eyes, do they?- - I mean, some days when you look in the mirror, does it take you a second to recognize yourself? That???s because it???s not really you??? It???s Tilda Swinton, hiding inside your wall.- - This morning, I noticed the ironing board seemed softer than I remembered??? Then it came to me ??? isn???t SONY making a movie about an ironing board?- -As I lay on the floor, I thought: I don???t remember getting a rug this shape???- -I tried to make some soup but I think the electric kettle is broken. It was whistling so strangely and the water wouldn???t boil at all ??? also it had hands. Did our kettle always have hands?- - I went to brush my teeth but the toothbrush was very heavy and wouldn???t fit into my mouth at all. It seemed so much larger than it was the day before.  I could???ve sworn it had grown by almost six feet???- -Now the shower head keeps staring at me. Also, the shower head is starting to look a lot more like a real, human head.- -And, by the way, I feel like our garbage can used to hold so much more garbage. And when did it start crying all the time?- - On top of all that, I don???t remember buying this grandfather clock??? wait a second??? is that a small wisp of blond hair?A bus is a vehicle that runs twice as fast when you are after it as when you are in it???but, actually, I just remembered this Times article from 2003 that pointed out how a number of New York City buses are actually slower than walking. And while we???re at it, have you noticed there are rarely any good-looking people on the bus? I???m not trying to be lookist here, just pointing something out. There are plenty of attractive passengers on the subway, so, other than a preponderance of the elderly who can???t navigate subway stairs, why should the bus be any different? You???ll find these and other bus-oriented observations in my new one-man comedy show, Bus-Ted, which intertwines our nation???s love of buses with my own personal stories about them.For years, my wife and I have belonged to a country club that has an ???unspoken??? policy against letting Blacks, Jews, and other minorities become members. Although we would never outwardly endorse these policies, we???ve justified our membership for professional networking reasons, and because many of our friends are members. Also the restaurant serves an unbelievable lobster roll. But lately my wife and I are having a crisis of conscience. The overfishing of lobsters by commercial fishing companies, combined with the effects of oceanic warming, pose a real and present danger to global lobster populations. Should we continue to remain members knowing that the club insists on ignoring this very serious issue???? R.S.,  Charleston- -On my walk to the subway, I often pass a homeless man who stands on the corner begging for change. If I???m carrying coins or small bills, I am generally happy to give something to him. I have never seen him drink alcohol, and he doesn???t appear to be a drug user. Therefore, I???ve assumed that he has the capacity to be judicious with how he spends his donations. Then, yesterday, I saw him in line at the Whole Foods around the corner, buying a box of gluten-free muffins. Not the Whole Foods 365 brand of gluten-free muffins, but the fancy ones that cost four dollars more and frankly aren???t as good. Further, I have no reason to believe that he is in fact even gluten-intolerant. Plenty of times, I have seen him enjoying someone???s half-eaten Bahn Mi or Shake Shack burger and he seems to do just fine. As someone who thinks she possibly might have Celiac disease, is it within my ethical bounds to confront the homeless man about the legitimacy of his gluten-free lifestyle?  Or should I just stop giving him money until he owns up to the lie???? T. S., Brooklyn- - I am a professor of Women???s Studies at a prominent East Coast liberal arts college. Recently, a friend of mine from high school whom I haven???t heard from in years  ??? I???ll call her Sheila ??? contacted me out of the blue. After a few minutes of chitchat, she said that she was calling to ask me to write a recommendation for her daughter, who was in the process of applying to schools, including the one at which I teach.  I have never met her daughter, and therefore cannot speak to her character or academic strengths. Writing a false recommendation would go against school policy and threaten my tenure.To complicate matters, when we were in high school, I was jealous that Sheila???s prom date Jason asked her to the dance instead of me. On the day of the prom, I sneaked into Sheila???s purse and poked ten holes in her new diaphragm with a sewing needle. Sheila lost her virginity that night, and became pregnant with the very child she was now calling about. Jason stuck around for a while but then got into drugs and went to prison. Sheila moved in with her mother, who helped raise the child while Sheila worked at the local fabric store. Then her mother died of cancer, leaving Sheila to raise the child alone, cobbling together what she could to give her daughter a shot at a decent life. Sheila never found out the truth about what I did.  Because of me, she was robbed of the future she deserved, while here I sit, perched high up in my ",100
335,"office, overlooking the commons as the leaves turn golden in the fading light of fall. I don???t really have a question for you. I???m just reminiscing. Sorry.??? L.B., Upstate New York- - A few months ago, I overheard a co-worker, who is also a good friend, talking on the phone on the other side of our shared cubicle. I didn???t hear the entire conversation, but I quickly understood that he was plotting to have his wife killed. At one point, I heard him say, ???I will pay you fifty-thousand dollars. Just make her go away.??? Naturally, I was shocked and abhorred.My cousin knows a guy who might or might not know a guy who would gladly kill my friend???s wife for much less than $50,000. Maybe even half that. Assuming the thoroughness and quality of the deed would not be sacrificed, am I obligated to inform my friend that he is egregiously overpaying? In doing so, I would have to admit to eavesdropping, thereby betraying his right to privacy and risking our friendship. On the other hand, by not saying anything, I am essentially an accomplice in my friend???s wasting $25,000.  I haven???t slept in days.??? M.J., San Francisco- -Last week, I was driving home from work. It was late, it had been raining, and the road was dark and wet. Out of nowhere, a dog darted right in front of me. I had no time to swerve, and I heard the sickening sound that one associates with running over an animal. I got out and approached the poor thing. He looked at me with his big, pleading brown doggy eyes and let out a plaintive whine. It was one of those airy, high-pitched, heart-breaking whines dogs make when they are in extreme pain. He needed a vet immediately. Unfortunately, I have a severe dog allergy. If I so much as get one tiny hair on me, my face becomes red, swollen and grotesque, like Gary Busey. Gary Busey with a severe dog allergy who just rubbed his face all over a Siberian Husky.  Then, I get these nasty, itchy, oozing pustules all up and down my body. It???s disgusting. Please believe me, this wasn???t a Cockadoodle or another one of those gay hypo-allergenic dogs laying there. This thing was a real big shedding bastard. I???d never get that hair out of my car, do you understand? Never! So, I drove away, leaving the dog???s life in God???s hands. My question is, it is unethical for me to analogize the way my face looks during an allergic reaction to an actor who is still living, and who might possibly be reading this???? C. C. Denver- -Recently, my dog was hit by a car. By some miracle, he survived. But the driver left the scene, sticking me with an exorbitant vet bill for which I had no means of paying. In desperate need of money, I turned to contract killing. My first client offered me $50,000 to murder his wife. I quickly accepted, even though I was prepared to take less. I wasn???t surprised when the man called the next day to cancel the contract. Indeed, he had found a cheaper assassin who had more experience. He then broke down in tears. I asked him what was wrong. He told me that although he was happy to be saving almost $25,000 to have his wife killed, he had lost a dear friend in the process, a friend who had betrayed his privacy and whom he would never forgive. It was a cost he could never recoup. I feel awful about the role I might have played in this man???s suffering. Was it my moral duty to charge a competitive price to begin with? Should I have at least offered to let him pay in installments? I???d still have been able to afford my dog???s rear-leg amputations and buy him his wheelchair. My client would still have his best friend. The wife would still be dead.  And everyone, everywhere, would be happy.??? Name WithheldQ: You sold wedding dresses.A: I worked at one of the more well-known, affordable chains that are common in my part of the country. It???s a huge warehouse. There is a small section of formalwear but the rest is racks and racks of wedding dresses. They cost from $99 to $1500.Q: Do people just wander in? A: We preferred if they???d make appointments, but we did have wanderers.I got one woman who tried three dresses and bought $1300 worth of stuff within 30 minutes. Others were just trying on dresses for fun.Q: Have you seen the TV show Say Yes to the Dress?A: Yes. I did that same kind of work but it was way less glamorous. The people on that show are paying for that experience. I worked at the Walmart of bridal stores.I was a new rep, so I wasn???t assigned as many brides as other people were. But there were times when I was juggling three or four customers (some were prom girls or bridesmaids) at the same time. For one bride, I would be getting a different bra, the other, shoes, and the other might be waiting to get into a dressing room. I was running around ragged, especially on Saturdays. Ideally if it was going well, I???d sit down for a quick consultation with the bride, asking what price range she wanted and what she was looking for.Q: How did you find the right dresses for people?A: I memorized the layout of the store pretty quick. It was do or die. I was severely undertrained, with little to no training. They gave me a generic employee handbook and were like, ???Okay, go!??? I was the new girl and I had to learn it myself because there was no one there who really had time to teach me.I think the company felt they should not waste time training people more??? The woman who interviewed me for the job was greeting people at the door ??? she didn???t even have 20 minutes to interview me privately.Q: What kinds of things did you mess up because you didn???t have training?A: There were times when I was saying things that may or may not have been accurate. Luckily I have always been interested in fashion, and a lot of women coming in had no knowledge of that sort of thing. I was able to use terminology about hemlines and silhouettes, like ???this is flattering to this body type.??? But I never wanted to trick or upsell anybody.Q: How honest were you? What if a dress looked terrible?A: A lot of the dresses that the store carried were, in my opinion, pretty hideous. Like I???m not into sequins, that kind of thing.I had to physically get in the dressing room and help them get into the dress though, and I could tell whether or not they felt comfortable. Sometimes they wanted my opinion but sometimes they didn???t. I just wanted them to feel comfortable.Q: What made you apply to this job? A: Desperation. I had just finished college with an art degree and I realized I was screwed.Q: How long were you there?A: I worked there like two months. I was continuing to apply for other jobs the whole time I was there. It was stressful. Saturdays were our crazy day. That???s when their sister-in-law can come with them, when everybody???s off work???There were a lot of lovely women that worked there. Everyone who worked there seemed unhappy though.Q: Were the brides ever demanding or mean?A: A lot of the customers had been married before or already had children. Most were realistic about what they wanted. They didn???t expect to be treated like queens, and I never had a bridezilla. Some women teared up and hugged me when they found the dress they wanted. And then they ring a bell???Q: They ring a bell? Elaborate please.A: Yes. We would get the attention of everyone in the whole store and then say something like, ???Attention everyone! Barbara here has found the man of her dreams, and now she???s found the dress of her dreams. Now she???s going to make a wish for her wedding day, ring the bell, and her wish will come true!???Everyone would applaud; some people would really get into it.I also remember there was a constant soundtrack of the most typical love songs p",100
336,"laying. Like Frank Sinatra, that kind of thing.Q: Do you remember any of the brides specifically?A: One woman I just loved because she could see through all the bullshit. We were supposed to encourage them to buy our undergarments ??? basically force them to put them on when they tried on the dress. This woman was kind of a hippie. She tried on a dress with the fancy bra underneath, but afterward, in the dressing room, she was like, ???Can I just take this stupid thing off!???? Then she put back on her daisy dress with no bra and did a little spin around and said, ???Oh! that feels so much better.???I remember another customer who was really sweet. She was a schoolteacher. She put total faith in me and let me pick everything out???the shoes, the dress. She went with everything I said. She seemed so happy and excited about her wedding.Q: Anything else about this job that you want to say?A: I???m a bit of a feminist so I do want to say that it was the first time I worked with all women and I was impressed and happy with how we all supported each other. One woman was a schoolteacher full-time and did this job on evenings and weekends. These were really kind, really hard-working women. We should always treat the people who are working in these tough jobs with dignity.Q: It sounds like it should be fun. A: It sounds like it should be. It was like peeking behind the curtain of something I didn???t know existed.Insert side with USB logo facing upright.Insert side with uncovered holes facing upright.Add Wite-Out to correct side to remember for later.Try both sides haphazardly.Try both sides, then the first side again, then the second side, then back to the first side, then, I dunno, the second side.Wiggle cord.Stuff cord into appropriate slot until whole thing just disappears, shit goddamn.Call daughter for help.Call daughter in general, not just when you need something.Tie USB cord around finger absentmindedly.Is she still dating Jared?

It was awkward and you made the men on the senior leadership team uncomfortable.You don???t speak up. We???d really like to see you take on more of a leadership role before we pay you for being a leader.You???re sloppy. Like when you sent that email with a typo. You need to proofread your work.You???re too focused on details. Leaders need to take the 50,000-foot fighter pilot view. No, I never served in the armed forces, what???s your point?You???re not seasoned. Oh, wait, you???re 35? Well, you look young. Maybe if you were more mature, like if you were married or had kids (why don???t you have kids, by the way? We???re all a little curious) then we could envision you as being a leader in this organization.Oh, you do have kids? Well, we???re concerned about your ability to balance everything and you look really tired all the time and I feel guilty asking you to stay late so I just ask good old Tom who???s a great guy and simple and easy to talk to.You???re argumentative. For example, right now you???re upset that you didn???t get a promotion and you???re asking for concrete examples of what you can do better. I really don???t want to get into the nitty-gritty and you should trust my judgment anyways.You???re a pushover. When Tom came up and gave you that totally platonic hug in the shareholders meeting you should have just told him to not touch you instead of telling me you thought it was inappropriate. Leaders handle their own problems.You???re not a team player. If you???d just wait a few years, there will be some great opportunities here for you, we need you in this role right now.You aren???t good at promoting yourself.

The applicant pool this year was particularly strong, and by that I mean the Admissions Committee once again sent candidates like you multiple enticing pamphlets encouraging you to apply, knowing full well we had no intention of accepting you.However, you will be pleased to know that you have contributed to our declining admissions rate, which has helped our university appear exclusive. This allows us to attract our real candidates: upper-class kids and certified geniuses who will glean no new information from our courses or faculty, whose parents can incentivize us with a new swimming pool or lacrosse stadium.As a reminder, we don???t aspire to be a socially exclusive learning environment. In fact, we have chosen to actively pursue a more diverse campus and welcome all minorities. But our admissions program is quite unique; we combat past discrimination by discriminating in the present.

This absolutist view is flawed, however, because language is an art of nuance. From time to time, writers may well find illustrative value in the lightest of phrases, sentences so weightless and feathery that they scarcely even seem to exist at all. These can convey details well beyond the crude thrust of the hulking active voice, and when used strictly as ornamentation, they needn???t actually convey anything at all.As a thought experiment, let???s examine in extremely close detail a set of iterative changes that can be made to a single simple grammatical structure, turning it from a statement taken at face value into one loaded with unrealized implication. This makes for rich writing which rewards ??? or even demands ??? close scrutiny.The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.The most fundamental feature of the passive voice is the conversion of the object into the subject by way of a stative verb. This often requires complete structural inversion of the sentence, since the two clauses are changing position, but it allows the roles of the nouns to shift, bringing the secondary participant to the foreground.It???s also helpful to switch to past tense; this very slight change often lessens the  impact of the statement. If the action being described happened at some point in the distant past, it is no longer an immediate concern, so other parts of the sentence can be more easily emphasized instead.Remove definite articles whenever possible, replacing them with indefinites. This diffuses the verb: in this form, the notion that any actor may have performed the action is a logical conclusion. The exact referents can still be intuited upon closer reading.The verb is still concrete, but it shouldn???t be. In fact, the verb can be removed completely: convert it into a present participle adjective, and then use that participle as a modifier for a broad, general-purpose noun. In this example we???ll use ???incident??? to at least acknowledge that the events took place along a common timeline, but even that much is still an unnecessary concession to specificity ?????we could just as easily substitute ???thing,??? which is so broad that unpacking it will command the reader???s complete attention.In addition, there is still a distinction between the subject and object which can be further erased. Both subject and object were ???involved??? in the proceedings, simply because both are present in the sentence. That new verb can apply to both nouns, making them equal and indistinguishable partners.The adjective can be made vaguer still simply by implying that it is a class of modifier, rather than the specific modifier itself. That is, an apple can itself be fairly called apple-related, and a banana is itself also truly banana-related, so this adjective modifier can likewise be fairly described as adjective-modifier-related???????a grammatical identity theorem, if you will.Further in pursuit of turning the two operators into equal partners, we are now in a position to alter the broader structure of the sentence to present them alongside one another. This removes the last vestiges of the initial phrasing, in which an object was being operated upon by the subject. Both nouns are now equally implicated, based on their position in the sentence.The word ???both??? is now redundant here, so it can be removed in the interest of concision. The participation of both parties in the action is logically implied simply by their presence, so it does not need to be explicitly stated to the reader.It???s time for another major structural leap. We have carefully converted both subject and object into equal participants, but they are still both acting ?????both are now subjects. But what if neither of them was taking action? We can divert the reader???s attention to a completely separate entity and re-cast the entire scenario around it, moving both nouns into passive slots. Both actors are now being acted upon as objects instead of acting as subjects, and the reader???s attention is now drawn to a specific quality which had previously been a disposable attribute of one of the nouns.Having already turned one attribute into the new active subject of the overall sentence, let???s similarly recast the other attribute, such that the noun is now just a passive recipient of its descriptive qualities.We have finally fully arrived at the ultimate in passive voice: the past exonerative tense, so named because culpability is impossible when actions no longer exist. For the most extensive erasure of direct communicative value, the original object can now even be removed entirely.???A police officer shot a black person.???(source)Illustration by Francisco Baudizzone- - -[Originally published September 2, 2015.]- - -TAYLOR SWIFT: Tell me, Socrates, must the player always play, play, play?SOCRATES: Well, that depends on what it is to be a player and what it means to play. Could you be more specific?SWIFT: I???m thinking of the dirty, dirty cheats of the world. Those about whom so many get down and out while they could be getting down to sick beats. Alcibiades, for example, abandoned Athens and sought refuge in Sparta, then left Sparta for Persia before finally returning to Athens, leaving an inter-imperial trail of broken hearts.SOCRATES: Yes, I see. Alcibiades is, in fact, a player who will play, play, play.SWIFT: Yes, very much so.SOCRATES: But must he? That is the question at hand.SWIFT: I believe he must for, consider that the hater must hate, hate, hate, and the faker must fake, fake, fake. Why should the player be different?SOCRATES: But might people change? Couldn???t something convince the player to stay, stay, stay rather than play, play, play?SWIFT: Ah, but you see Socrates, it is not the player that decides to stay, stay, stay. Rather, the player becomes a stayer when he ceases to play, play, play.SOCRATES: So then one must eliminate the other. A player can never stay, stay, stay because, according to you, he would then be a stayer and not a player.SWIFT: That is correct.SOCRATES: Could a stayer, having previously been one to go on too many dates, fall into old habits?SWIFT: Perhaps I???ve got nothing in my brain, at least that???s what people say, but I???m afraid I don???t follow.SOCRATES: Pay no attention to what people say. The depth of this issue you bring up shows the substantial content of your brain. But, let me make myself clear. Might it be a matter of degree? Could a stayer who was previously a player, still have an urge to play, play, play but resist temptation and stay, stay, stay?SWIFT: No, a player that appears to stay, stay, stay is nothing more than a faker. And as I said before, fakers gonna fake, fake, fake.SOCRATES: Well then let???s consider the avowed stayer. Having been one to always stay, stay, stay, perhaps he stays out too late, and giving in to temptation he???s gonna play, play, play. What say you?SWIFT: The case you describe, the stayer that???s gonna play, play, play, is that of the heartbrea",100

And fakers gonna fake, fake, fake. Correct?SWIFT: Yes.SOCRATES: And is it the case that the stayer that will play, play, play is a heartbreaker who will break, break, break.SWIFT: That???s my position.SOCRATES: It sounds like you speak from experience.SWIFT: In some sense. But these experiences, if not completely universal, are at least easily relatable.SOCRATES: Like a popular song that can???t stop, or won???t stop groovin???.SWIFT: That???s just the type of music that gets in your mind.SOCRATES: Saying it???s gonna be alright.SWIFT: Indeed.SOCRATES: Let us return to the beginning. Your hypothesis is that players gonna play, play, play. Is that right?SWIFT: That is right.SOCRATES: And so they cannot stay, stay, stay.SWIFT: You???re right again.SOCRATES: But didn???t you say also that the player that appears to stay, stay, stay, is really a faker. And as a faker, therefore, is gonna fake, fake, fake.SWIFT: Yes, I did say as much.SOCRATES: It seems we???ve reached an impasse ??? you say players will always play, play, play, but its possible for them to appear to stay, stay, stay and yet this makes them a faker who will fake, fake, fake. But if they fake, fake, fake then they do not always play, play, play for there must be at least some stay, stay, stay for otherwise, they only play, play, play and hence, are a player and not a faker.SWIFT: The human creature is a ponderous thing, full of complexities and contradictions. But what can one do? If only there was some sort of movement that would throw off the psychic troubles that follow from simply being.SOCRATES: Maybe like a dog that has gone for a swim, you can shake, shake, shake.SWIFT: Shake it off?SOCRATES: Shake it off.[Originally published February 10, 2015.]- - -The Music ManHe logged more than 50 hours of detention in high school.Les Miserables???He took inspirational school assemblies very seriously.Phantom of the OperaHe keeps asking if Jenna will be at the reunion.West Side Story???He can???t help you if you won???t tell him what???s wrong.Damn Yankees???He has his grandfather???s baseball cards and his grandfather???s Playboys.Fiddler on the Roof???He has a special name he called his grandmother.Guys and Dolls???He has his own nickname for every member of the Rat Pack.Jersey Boys???He and his dad have plans for that Camaro.TommyHe and his dad have plans for that acid.GreaseHe has photos of himself on every ride at Six Flags, and he knows where they are.Little Shop of Horrors (Movie)He thinks Phineas and Ferb is funny.Little Shop of Horrors (Broadway)He thinks Hannibal is funny.Book of MormonHe will explain to you why something is funny.CatsHis fingernails are creepily long.Avenue QDon???t get him started on student loans.GypsyDon???t get him started on his mom.Sweeney Todd???Don???t get him started on anything.CompanyHe carries a tiny notebook and writes down things people said, but feels bad when he reads it.Hedwig and the Angry Inch???He has pierced his own ear at least once.RentHe thought about piercing his own ear once.A Chorus Line???He???s a SoulCycle instructor, but that???s just for right now.The Sound of Music???He doesn???t understand why people don???t spank their kids anymore.Anything Gilbert and SullivanHe doesn???t understand why no one asks about his SAT score anymore.Anything Jason Robert BrownHe doesn???t understand why you don???t want to hear the story about him losing his virginity at that pre-college summer program anymore.Anything Cole PorterHe greets people by kissing them on the cheek.

All your ???J???s??? are backwards.- - - -1989Jen,I???ve always made it a point to start off any notes I give with some positive comment first. Unfortunately, your work here has made it virtually impossible for me to do that this time.This letter is meandering, lacking in structure, and just an overall mess of what should be a very personal, intimate correspondence with Santa Claus. One gets the sense that the author was high on pixie sticks while writing it, and upon review of the mess that was discovered underneath your bedroom this morning, I gather that this was exactly the case.You begin the letter with what is perhaps a pure intention of inquiring about the reader and turning the focus onto him. I am all for work that breaks the audience???s suspension of disbelief and forces them to become a participant in the art itself. However, asking questions such as, ???if it???s really cold up there???? and ???where do all the reindeer sleep???? are completely offensive and demeaning to the reader???s intelligence and show an utter lack of real concern for who your audience is. Sure, if this was the first Christmas in the history of the world, then those are perfectly valid, wonderful questions to present, ones that surely need to be ask. But, as timeless readings of The Night Before Christmas, have surely informed you, those questions are old, outdated, and a literal waste of ink and paper, not to mention cookies.And while we???re on the topic of baked goods, I was also disappointed with your choice of Lorne Doones in lieu of the traditional homemade chocolate chip.

If intentional, I think it???s a great utilization of withholding something from your audience to achieve a desired effect.

I did not rustle the sheets. I breathed slowly and silently, listening for Santa???s sleigh. After a long time, I did hear a sound, though not the sound of sleigh bells. From outside came the sound of hissing brakes and screeching metal. I looked through the window and saw an old train standing perfectly still in front of my house.It had rickety, metal carriages covered in soot and graffiti, and there was a sign on the side that said METROPOLITAN TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY. People shoved their way on-board until the doors wouldn???t close. In the middle, a conductor stood at the open window of one of the cars. I put on my slippers and robe, and tiptoed downstairs and out the door.???The train can???t go if the doors are open!??? the conductor cried out. I ran up to him.???Well,??? he said to me, ???what is it???????Where are you going???? I asked.???Santa???s Workshop,??? he said before turning to his microphone, ???This is a North Pole-bound, Polar Express train. Please stand clear of the closing doors.??????You???re not very Christmas-y,??? I said.???Yeah, well we???re public transit now, kid. They make the rules. Get on.???I nodded my head and climbed aboard. He spoke into his microphone again. ???Let go of the doors! There???s another train right behind us.???The Polar Express was filled with other children, all in their pajamas and nightgowns. Together, as the train pulled away into the softly falling snow, we sat in silence and avoided eye contact. One kid was clipping his toenails for some reason. On-board, as if by magic, there were warm marshmallows and cups of hot chocolate, but they had spilled all over the floor and everyone pretended not to see them.Outside, the lights of towns and villages flickered in the distance as the Polar Express raced northward. The mountains turned into hills, the hills to snow-covered plains. We crossed a barren desert of ice ??? the Great Polar Ice Cap. Lights appeared in the distance. They looked like the lights of a strange ocean liner sailing on a frozen sea.???There!??? said someone, ???the North Pole!??? We pressed our faces against the glass. The conductor came over the speakers.???Due to an earlier incident, all northbound, Polar Express trains will not make stops at North Pole-Santa???s Workshop and are running on the N, R local track. For service to the North Pole-Santa???s Workshop, please transfer at the next station.???We sighed and returned to our seats.Soon there were no more lights to be seen. We traveled through cold, dark forests, where lean wolves roamed and white-tailed rabbits hid from our train as it thundered through the quiet wilderness. Faster and faster we ran along, rolling over peaks and through valleys like a car on a roller coaster.Out of nowhere, we screeched to a halt. I was thrown across the cabin. And then we stayed there for close to forty minutes. Nobody knew why. Some kids slept. Others cried. A snowman came through asking for money. After a while the conductor came on and told us that a traffic signal had burnt out, turning off all the traffic lights on the same string. We should be moving shortly.We didn???t.Time wore on. Eventually, we were transferred to another train. After all our troubles, we were going to the North Pole! A murmur of excitement grew among the passengers. When the lights of the great city and its workshops blinked into sight on the horizon, even the train itself shook with anticipation. I hugged my robe close and smiled.Pulling into the station, we slowed to a crawl. In the yard, we passed a group of elves huddled together for warmth, chestnuts roasting on an open track fire. Even then, people stood at the doors, nervously kicking to get out. Finally, with a lurch, the train came to a halt and let out a great sigh. After a moment, which seemed a lifetime, the doors opened and we rushed out into the city.It was a magical place, decorated with candy canes and gumdrops. As we exited the station, we ran into an elf, who started with a jump. In our excitement, we almost yelled our questions at him.???Where is Santa???? we shouted. ???Where are all the reindeer and the gifts???????Oh, they all went home,??? he told us. ???That whole thing was over, like, two hours ago.???This is a disgusting, horrifying tale of what happens when a decent, God-fearing American seeks to righteously bear arms to protect his own family, and instead is oppressed and brainwashed by subhuman liberal freaks seeking to destroy America.The movie???s hero, Ralphie, is a salt-of-the-earth, midwestern dude just trying to live free and grab his piece of the American Dream. Unfortunately, Ralphie lives in a home run by brain-dead, liberal scum who seek to deny him his basic rights. His mother is a slavering, permissive nitwit who allows her younger child to mash his face into his food like a goddamn hog, and yet denies her older son the right to arm himself like a man. She saddles Ralphie with nerdy glasses, the symbol of weak intellectualism and myopic thinking, and systematically pollutes his mind with encrypted radio transmissions from some ???little orphan,??? no doubt a foreign freeloader spawned from some godless hellhole to establish a caliphate on American soil.Ralphie???s old man is even worse. This emasculated stuffed suit ???battles??? his furnace by impotently cussing at it (just shoot the damn thing!) and allows a cadre of mangy hounds to run in and out of his house at will (just shoot the damn things!). The only millisecond of respect I had for this numb-nuts was when I thought the guy had bagged himself a sweet trophy leg from a productive day of cleansing the planet of feminists. But no ??? it was a fucking lamp.  I should have guessed: actual feminist legs are known for being hairy as wildebeests, and also for kicking a guy in the gonads when he asks them out for a perfectly nice evening of baby deerburgers and autoerotic taxidermy. Not that ol??? Uncle Ted is speaking from personal experience, mind you. I???m a freaking rock god.Ralphie is the only relatable character in this whole miserable liberal shitshow. Each day, he wages war against terror, as he is attacked regularly by two thugs perpetrating some sort of communist lunch money plot. One of them is dressed just like a little pinko union goon, and the other one should be killed on the spot just for the (most likely rabid) raccoon up on his head.So for Christmas, Ralphie wants only what???s decent, proper, and his God-given right under the Second Amendment ??? a weapon to fight off the evils that surround him. His choice of weaponry, a Red Ryder Carbine Action 200-shot Range Model air rifle, is laughably weak, but even a weak-ass gun is better than no gun, as we see in Ralphie???s glorious dream sequence. This scene shows with brilliant clarity what a good guy with a gun can do. Ralphie is able to take a heroic stand against a gang of escaped jailbirds who have come to encroach upon his way of life. This scene also is a great big middle finger to all the liberals who want to know how you can tell a bad guy with a gun from a good guy with a gun.  It???s simple, ",100
342,"asswipe ??? they???ll be wearing black and white stripes.So Ralphie appeals to his mother, his fat-ass witch of a teacher, and even the pagan ???Santa Claus??? to give him what is rightfully his. All respond with some nonsense about ???shooting his eye out,??? which is one of the most ridiculous things I???ve ever heard. Why would God have given us eyes if he didn???t want us to have the freedom to blow them right out of our skulls in a bloody, gelatinous mess? He wouldn???t have, is the answer to that.Christmas day finally arrives, and it is a full-fledged nightmare. Not only is the pile of gifts under the tree  repulsively weapon-free, but Ralphie???s castrating harpy of a mother further unmans him by forcing him to model a mortifying pink rabbit suit that will likely leave him impotent for life.He is about to give up hope when his limp-dicked peon of a father points out something in the corner. Well, it???s goddamn Christmas miracle ??? Santa Claus has come to his senses and empowered our hero with the means to fight enemies of America.All does not end well, however. In the truly tragic scene that follows, Ralphie barely manages to fire off a few exhilarating rounds before his sissy nerd-boy glasses get lost and broken ??? along with his nerve. The years of fearmongering and liberal inculcation finally take their toll ??? he begins to weep like a wet-diapered infant, and runs inside to his mama, who is all too happy to see him reduced to pile of liberal diarrhea. He???s finally won his freedom, but in the end, he???s too weak to man up and use it.Meanwhile, the balless wonder of a dad has allowed the neighbor???s dogs to waltz right in and eat his Christmas turkey right in front of him. After pathetically watching his home get plundered while his flaccid little Y chromosome officially dies, the eunuch suggests that they abandon their down-home American traditions to embrace the culture of the Chinese, with their obvious plot to overtake America???s gross domestic product. These lily-livered wastes of oxygen can???t even stomach looking at the duck head on their dinner. I chew on duck heads like they???re bubblegum, like a real American. I???ve got a piece of mallard going right now, I shit you not.This scene, in my view, is the chilling culmination of a bleak and frightening depiction of a nation gone wrong. So this Christmas, consider the scene where Ralphie has gone blind from soap poisoning (the symbol of whitewashed political correctness). I???d rather go down fighting, my friends. If I should put my eye out while deploying a weapon of freedom, I???ll put the other one out just for shits and giggles. An eye for an eye, goddamn it ??? even if they???re both mine.1. ???I Will Buy You a New Life??? by Everclear2. ???If I Had $1,000,000??? by Barenaked Ladies3. ???Money??? by Pink Floyd4. ???Material Girl??? by Madonna5. ???Royals??? by Lorde6. ???I Want It All??? by Queen7. ???Can???t Buy Me Love??? by The Beatles8. ???She Works Hard For the Money??? by Donna Summer9. ???Money For Nothing??? by Dire Straits10. ???Get A Job??? by The Silhouettes11. ???Taxman??? by The Beatles12. ???Keep It Simple??? by Van Morrison13. ???Bitter Sweet Symphony??? by The Verve14. ???Give it Away??? by Red Hot Chili Peppers15. ???You Can???t Always Get What You Want??? by The Rolling StonesMy name is Chris Monks and I am the editor of this website, McSweeney???s Internet Tendency. I write today from McSweeney???s Boston headquarters, which is neither in Boston nor an actual headquarters. I actually live just outside the city and work from home, usually at my dining room table. It???s from here where I review and respond to submissions, ready articles for publication, and actively avoid the snarky comments on our Facebook page.About 15 years ago, I was at this same dining room table, writing short humor pieces, desperately trying to get published by McSweeney???s Internet Tendency. I wrote and wrote and wrote, and got rejected and rejected and rejected. Why didn???t I just give up and save myself from the disappointment? Well, because McSweeney???s was unlike anything I had ever read. The website featured irreverent comic voices like John Hodgman, Wendy Molyneux, and Jonathan Ames. It was the kind of site you could get lost in; one funny article led to a silly list, which led to a charming open letter, and before you knew it an hour had gone by and what was it you were you supposed to be doing again? Oh right, helping pilots land planes from this air traffic control tower. So that???s what all the alarm bells and screaming were about. Mystery solved.I think (i.e. hope!) that McSweeney???s Internet Tendency is still a fun place to get lost in. When I took over editing the site, my main goal was simply not to break the thing. During my time, we???ve exposed the world to Comic Sans??? true nature, Baroness Elsa Schraeder???s bitterness, and, of course, the thrill of decorative gourd season. We???ve helped launch the careers of many writers (both through our daily features and our annual column contest) who???ve gone on to pen acclaimed novels, write funny TV shows, and script award-winning films.We need your help to continue publishing smart, funny work by both new and established voices. The site is free to enjoy, and ads are minimal, and we rely on contributions from our readers to keep it all going. Thanks to the kind folks who backed our Kickstarter this year, the site will soon be even easier to read and enjoy from wherever you are. But in order for McSweeney???s Internet Tendency to continue humming week after week, your support matters. So if you read and enjoy the site, and occasionally laugh a little too loudly from your office cubicle, please consider making a donation. In return, we promise to keep making the Tendency your one-stop shop for amusing internet distraction. Just be sure those planes land safely!Happy holidays, and thanks for reading.??? Chris Monks???Twas Christmas in Brooklyn, 12:10 in the morning,I???d fallen asleep (and most likely was snoring),Kings County was quiet, the street lamps shone low,And Prospect Park glistened ???neath fresh fallen snow,All covered in blankets (though that would change later,I have no control over my radiator???),I dreamt of the treasures that I soon would own,A Vespa, an iWatch, a brand new Brownstone!(For Christmas, of course, it must be understood,Is meant to reward those especially good,And if good is the thing, then you may rest assured,That my place on the ???Good List??? was all but secured),My deeds through that year, and I do not embellish,Made Mother Teresa look petty and selfish:At dinner, when waiters seem haggard and spent,I reached deep and tipped them at fourteen percent!(That???s assuming, of course, that the service was great,If not then I???d drop them to seven or eight),And when riding the train with a mother and child,I???d look up and give them my very best smile,(A shame that they couldn???t find one open seat,But if I gave up mine, where would I put my feet?)The student debt crisis that???s crippling our nation,I tackled head-on with some tax-free donations,To Brandi, and Jasmine, and my new friend Jewel,(A stripper who told me she???s in nursing school),And so it was clear, based on the aforementioned,That on Christmas morning I???d surely be destined,To reap an abundance of Yuletide excesses,And thus I slept soundly ??? no quandaries, no stresses,Till jolted from slumber I woke with a fright,At the sound of my door???s ringer piercing the night,???Who is it???? I asked, rubbing sleep from my eyes,As I opened my window, and to my surpriseI heard this response (in voice fraught with wheezing):???Come on ",100

I???m freezing!???(His red suit was soiled and wrinkled and stinking,I quickly surmised the great elf had been drinking),I reached for the buzzer, despite his demanding,(It was Christmas time, we should be understanding),Besides which, I thought, this may not be unpleasant,I bet that he???s coming to bring me my presents!So you can imagine my shock and surprise,(As he stared back at me through his whiskey-soaked eyes),To see that St. Nick (with whom I was now stranded),Had come to Apartment 1F empty-handed!(Well, not empty-handed; he clutched in his fistA crumpled-up paper with ???My Christmas List???Written right cross the top, and despite the low lighting,I saw right away it was in my handwriting),???I just can???t believe??? he said, slurring his words,???That any one person could be so absurd,As to think he???d be able to curry my favor,Displaying such vile, repulsive behavior!You people amaze me, the way that you think,It???s really no wonder I???m driven to drink!??????But Santa,??? I begged, ???I just don???t understand!I implore you to find a more ethical man!Just look how I act when a young woman passes,I never forget to say how nice her ass is!And though I???m quite busy I have no objections,To leaving my comments in all comments sections!???A red sleigh could drive through the silence that followed,???You realize that this season used to be hallowed????Asked Santa, as he swiped his hat from his head,???But I guess the true meaning of Christmas is dead,You people don???t get it.

What a terrible night.???I couldn???t make out all the rest that he stammered,(As I???ve said before, he was really quite hammered),So hammered, in fact, as he made for the door,That he lost all his footing and crashed to the floor,???Oh Santa!??? I cried, ???Let me put you to bed,You shouldn???t be flying ??? just stay here instead,I???ll call Mrs. Claus and I???ll give her a warning,I promise you???ll feel better tomorrow morning.???I grabbed him a blanket and pulled off his boots,I helped him shake out of his stinking red suit,I poured him some water and said ???As a favor,Drink all of this now, it???ll help you out later???,I tucked him in bed and I tiptoed away,I slept on the sofa, and woke the next day,To a pile of presents, all wrapped up in bows,And a handwritten card filled with elegant prose:???I guess I was wrong ??? you???re not always a dick,I???ll see you next Christmas, and thanks again ???

Fancy babies in fancy hats are the best. My dream is to work with celebrity babies, but it???s such a competitive market. I???m thinking the key to success is to have baby hats on me at all times because I never know when I???ll meet an attractive baby who needs a hat.

Sometimes they think we???re filming a reality show and I go with that too. What do you do when a client spits up in your hatbox? That???s a serious question.

My emotions roiled with this piece.  Starting with light, sweet anticipation of a homespun tale, then jerking left into a churning revulsion, then screeching to a pleading, bargaining, horrified end, the story left me wondering why, wondering how. The lasting image of gelatinous red goo teeming with wrigglers is worthy of a Troma flick ??? just add a scream and a big discordant pipe organ hit.  How Ms. Altman did not immediately decide, in what must have been a jolting moment of discovery, that the trash can was too good for this mess is beyond my power to reckon.  Worms in one???s jam is a ???toss it far outside the house, on the property line, maybe a little over, like the burned oil from a beginners??? failed tempura night??? situation.   To have tasted it and offered it to a loved one pushes credulity.  ???No god-blessed way,??? I mumbled aloud here at my desk.Then I thought:  It would be the first jam to offer a complete protein, ha-ha.  And, if you really can???t tell or taste it too much, wouldn???t that make it something desirable, nutritionally?   Before refrigeration or technological dessert-making tools, before readily available chocolate or refined sugars, jam and preserves were special and treasured, playing a prominent role in the food pantry, one of the few pure gustatory pleasures that was  easily available to the non-wealthy.  They must have encountered this very phenomenon on the frontier, and never batted an eye ??? before wasting the  precious pectins and fructose simply for the sake some insect embryos, they cooked the bejeezus out of it, made it unrecognizable and digested the protein as a nut",100

KH- - -From: Eric KangDate: Sat, Sep 19, 2015Subject: Beef Jerky LiteratureDear McSweeney???s,One of my favorite pastimes is to walk through fresh paper bookstores. My parents must have had limited space in the home when I was born and jammed my crib into the same room as their office. Instead of twinkling stars and bubbling music, I???m convinced that I lay next to the printer ??? the exploding fusion of ink needle ice skating across newly grafted groves of paper wafted as an irresistible aroma in my nostrils, programming neurological patterns of addiction like burnt toast. While others were soothed by words ringing audibly through vocal murmurs of parental love, I was scientifically plugged into the DNA of those very words through the nasal whistle of inkjet violin. This is the only explanation for the idyllic high that sweeps over me as I saunter through the aisles.This is why I keep going back. When I do, I frequent the bargain section, not as a cheap Asian looking to barter for an extra penny or page, but as a relic hunter looking for lost pearls. Over the years, I have uncovered a secret. Society is not prone to buying great books ??? good, maybe, but not the kind you put your back into, reaping the everlasting benefits of sweat and blood . As a result, some of these gems end up on the shelves for far too long, according to the impatient capitalistic rule, and low and behold, the discount chest of gold!But what, may I ask, is McSweeney literature doing in this section? Are you surprised, dismayed, or reminded of resolute original conviction? As I grab hold of its artistic cover and creative smell, something surges through my system. I rage over injustice, demanding that the attached coffee shop put these books on display along with McSweeney???s beef jerky. The Pavlovian mystery of meat candy salivation can create a similar sweet tasting sensation on the palate of our Neanderthal state as people leaf through the pages while chewing away, feeling like superstar pro athletes. All this for literary addiction.But I get ahead of myself. I just said that the bargain section was potential home to treasure. I should just let it be but not without this statement.I once moved and lived in a small farming town with lots of millionaires moping around, wondering how to save their money. An elderly grandma once had a leak on her roof and instead of calling an able-bodied trained person to investigate, she found her way up in the sky all by her shiny self. She slipped, took a tumble to ground zero, and broke her hip.It was in this mentality that I took my nephew, a native of the land, to the gas station to buy all the various flavours and brands of beef jerky. We sat in the car, sampling and critiquing each kind until we were sick. It was a sacrifice we had to make. What came out on top was McSweeney???s. But the only way to make this discovery, to value good taste, was to spend a little money.I live in an oil and gas city that holds very little artistic accomplishment and investment. It can be summed up like this ??? a friend of mine just spent 1000 dollars on a pair of shoes but won???t spend 1% of that on a recommended book, changing her life forever. It turns out we are not sophisticated city dwellers after all.???

Since my last correspondence, some issues with our language have come to my attention.Because I am a mother and used to doing unpleasant duties involving dirt, body fluids, and other seemingly toxic substances, it has unfortunately fallen to me to clean up American English.  It???s become rather sloppy of late, sagging its acronyms around its knees, with hyperbole settling heavily into its midsection, and routine, compulsive use of expletives while picking off the skin around its fingernails and chain smoking Marlboro Ultra Lights.  Somebody MUST step in and clean up this deadbeat before its too late and it comes home and confesses it never liked pot pie and is moving to Panajachel to join a commune that processes tofu or starts following the Grateful Dead around, not realizing that they just gave what is hopefully their last farewell concert, which is both sad and woefully uninformed.I am starting this gargantuan task with a simple pack and removal like one of those home makeover shows.  I???ll be deleting several words from the language in an effort to pare down and simplify.  These words include, but are not limited to:  innovation, opportunity, growth, development, amazing, unique, receptivity, communication, and associate.You might be complaining, ???Hey, I need those words!???  All I can say is keep it up and I???ll take away enthusiasm and commitment.  There are plenty of other ways to indicate how creative you are without the i-n-n-o word.  Why don???t you be creative and think of one?  In fact, if you use any of these words, chances are you are spending your evenings watching re-runs of Scandal and eating bags of Chubby Chuck???s Orange-Colored Food-Style Rings.It???s sad that someone like me, a sometime victim of Chubby Chuck, is left to do the dirty work of fixing up American English.  Again, I need to emphasize it is not by choice, but sense of duty.  As a true patriot, after I finish tidying up the language, I???ll probably spend some time throwing out America???s bigger clutter like Donald Trump, website comments sections, and most of the stuff at my dad???s house.Your friend and fellow patriot,Jodie Leidecker- - -From: Matt Gassan ??????Date: Thu, Jul 16, 2015 Subject: CliffhangersDear McSweeney???s,It is 1:30 AM on a Thursday, and due to some changes in my scheduling priorities I haven???t read any of your pieces in months.

I know that your readers must be curious about my latest attempts to communicate with-slash-exterminate our insect friends. In the public interest the following is an update that continues to obsessively reference Infinite Jest:I am standing at the large kitchen window overlooking our yard. It is almost 10 at night. While we look forward to The Daily Show and some evening rest, a substantial Alabama thunderstorm brews. The light from the repurposed gas lamp hanging from the ceiling gradually mutes until it reaches the wide outside sill where three junebugs struggle on their backs. My last letter to your fine publication insulted these creatures. I am not writing to take back my comments.Junebugs are not the smartest of insects. They fire their pale brown bodies like buckshot into evening wear from here to Washington, careening off with the right feint to race back into the night. If you???re out in a nice dress with a cool cocktail in hand, a junebug is a horror to be squeaked at. Here in the safety of my kitchen, they are irreducibly sad. Their legs wave from pale undersides with feeble purpose. Is it a signal or the mute instinct of immanence?I drink the remains of a cocktail. Thunder threatens, but nobody takes June seriously around here. The three junebugs fluster. I don???t claim to be a Buddhist, but at this moment, I think that I am just terrible. Why do I let these creatures suffer? Why do I pay someone to spray this windowsill, and others like it, so that these tiny and miraculous bugs will shiver slowly into their deaths?Maybe you are not someone who thinks on these matters too much. Perhaps you exterminate ants or spiders with abandon. As someone who bears an irrational fear of cockroaches, I can relate.But they mean no harm. They strive only to feed, mate, and fly blindly about. Who of us doesn???t know a more evolved person who fits that description? An hour later, I return to the kitchen to refill my water before bed. A lone survivor twitches once, twice. It is trying to generate momentum for a reversal before the poison kicks in. I know this creature will be dead before I see it again. If it were in the house, I???d freak out for someone to evacuate it. H",100
346,"ere on the sill, outside my reach, I find myself wishing someone would save it. Its robust junebug body has much to offer. Surely it could find a mate to carry on its genes.The second day I wake up remembering that bugs brought me to Alabama the first time. My New Mexico high school had qualified for the National Science Olympiad at Auburn. I was, improbably, the entomology specialist. Someone who is content to leave dead cockroaches under glass jars for days rather than pick them up herself (and this before reading Infinite Jest) seems like an unlikely fit. Two factors worked in my favor.First: the insects were dead. There was no wiggling or flapping, which was important not just because I am skittish, but because insects are really incredible to look at when there is no risk that they will blindly land in your hair or crawl on your arm. You notice their colors, their interlocking parts, their alien eyes. Second: the task was merely organizational. You couldn???t bring a guidebook, but you could make one. I did not plan to memorize elaborate taxonomies, but I was happy to design an illustrated decision tree for bug identification in a spiral-bound notebook. I picked up and examined a lot of bugs. The last time I was this interested in insects, I???d run a short-lived childhood ???roly poly??? farm after discovering the armadillo-style creatures were attracted to geranium leaves. This turned out to be toxic, perhaps poisoning me forever for a love of insects. In any case, we didn???t win the Science Olympiad.Through the next day the last junebug (Phyllophaga) lies there. It bakes in the sun. I think about how slight it seems. How should I read its final pose? Is it supplication or resistance? Where are its colleagues? Why hasn???t an enterprising bird???maybe one of our yard???s flock of cardinals???picked it up by now? Dusk arrives. Dinner is cooked and eaten; I do the dishes in the quiet of the laundry???s hum. And then it moves. The segmented legs pedaling up and down in the front, side to side weakly in the back. How can it be alive after all this time? What ancient instinct woke it at dusk to struggle once again?I decide that I want it to live. More precisely, I decide that I can???t watch it die. I walk outside into the sweltering heat. I convey it to a shady part under our climbing roses. I watch, hoping it will right itself. I nudge a bit with the corner of the folder that once contained ???AT&T BILL.??? I notice that its head is actually a splendid red sienna, a contrast to its duller body. I notice the delicacy of its legs, the way each surprisingly hairy part precisely moves in time with its partners. Its eyes are shielded, while its antennae slowly feel out the new landscape.By the time we return from a baking hot dog walk, it???s gone. Did it walk off? Did one of the cardinals snap it up? Do I care because I am secretly obsessed with my own mortality?I eagerly await your response in this matter.Best,Kate ShusterMontgomery, AL- - -From: Andrew Cohill Date: Wed, Jun 24, 2015 Subject: Day three of chili dog purgeThings did not go well today. I was not sure what to expect when I started this, but I did figure that the word ???purge??? was a clue. I had started on Saturday so that my body could get used to the heavy diet of chili dogs before work today. I had another restless night, and kept waking myself up with numerous loud eruptions of excess vapors. After yesterday???s overdose on six chili dogs (two per meal), I decided to go with what seemed safer for breakfast: a chili omelet. It was actually pretty good. And things seemed under control as I headed off to work.But it was probably the second mug of coffee at work that triggered an intense bout of vaporous eruptions, punctuated with intermittent but highly embarrassing flatulent reports. I work in a cubicle farm, so I have many co-workers in close proximity. I was hoping that the sulfurous discharges were mainly confined to my cubicle, but that was not the case.At about 10:15 AM, my boss called me.???I need to see you in my office right away.???I could tell by his tone of voice that something was awry.I was having a sharp bout of abdominal pain when he called, so I crab-walked as best I could down the hall to his office, hoping fervently that I could contain the pressure until the meeting was over.I entered his office, and he was terse.???Shut the door.???I shut the door and sat down gingerly, not wanting to set off an explosion.???What???s going on???? he asked.???What do you mean? I replied in return.???It is a few minutes after ten on a Monday morning, and four of your co-workers have already been in here demanding that I move you or they are moving. Are you having some kind of medical problem????I was mortified; apparently the gaseous emissions were more noxious in their discharge than I had presumed. I explained that I was on day three of a ???colon cleanse.??? I refrained from calling it by its real name, the ???Chili Dog Purge,??? because all of a sudden that sounded ridiculous.He asked me how long I had to be doing this. I replied that I was day three, and had four more days???until??? At that moment, as I was about to utter the word ???Friday,??? the pressure that had been building since I entered the office discharged all at once with a sound like someone ripping a long piece of cardboard. And the chili-laden fumes instantly filled the office.I don???t know who was more horrified???me, at the utter shame of that horrible flatulent release, or my boss, who seemed overcome by the mass of hydrogen sulfide that was filling the room.We stared at each other, both dismayed by the absolute awkwardness of the situation. He stuttered for a moment, and I realized he was choking??? he finally managed to compose his thoughts, and said, ???You have my permission to work from home for the rest of the week. Now get out of here immediately.???I fled down the hall, grabbed my hat and my briefcase, and rushed toward the exit, with what seemed like everyone on the floor following me with their eyes, like I was some kind malformed circus freak.Once I got home, I settled down at my desk, fired up my laptop, and tried to get some work done before lunch, but the constant chili gas discharges was making my eyes water. I gave up, logged onto Amazon, and ordered a GasBGon flatulence seat cushion, and paid extra for overnight shipping.I gamely had two chili dogs for lunch. I had two more for dinner, and sat morosely at the kitchen table after dinner, unable to stop thinking about the events of the morning.Your obedient correspondent,AndrewEditor???s note: We have not received any further updates from Andrew. This causes us some concern.- - -From: Andrew Cohill Date: Tue, Jun 23, 2015 Subject: Day two of chili dog purgeThis morning, I approached the kitchen with some trepidation, as I had slept restlessly through the night. The spicy chili had my pyloric valve slamming open and shut all night long, and there were times when I was not sure if I was hearing thunder from storms in the neighborhood or it was just the gaseous rumbling of my distressed intestinal tract.Since I had not actually had any chili dogs on Day One, I decided to start with chili dogs for breakfast. And it occurred to me that the spongy white bread hot dog buns might slow down the purge effect. I got out two buns, and fried two hot dogs by splitting them down the middle and searing them in a frying pan. I placed the nicely browned hot dogs in their buns, and loaded them with chili. Delicious! As usual, the chili tends to improve with age.Sunday church was a bit of a trial, and I ended up in the crying room where the smell of poopy diapers helped mask ",100
347,"any emissions by yours truly.I decided to go all in and stick with more chili dogs for lunch??? after all, this is the chili dog purge. Two more delicious dogs, buns heaped high with chili, grated cheese, and some extra Sriracha hot sauce just to keep things spicy. The Sriracha may have been a mistake, because as I started on the second dog, I began sweating profusely and turned quite red. I bravely finished the meal, but had to lie down until I returned to my normal Scotch-Irish pallor.Dinner was two more chili dogs, and it may have been two buns too many, as I began to feel quite bloated after dinner. The buns seemed to be stopping things up, and I began to have sharp wrenching abdominal pains, which continued unabated until I drank two liters of ginger ale, which usually helps with stomachaches. Initially, the highly carbonated soda seemed to increase the internal pressure even more, but after a few minutes of screaming punctuated with prayers for a quick death, things ???loosened up??? rather violently.With five days to go, this may be difficult.Your obedient correspondent,Andrew- - -From: Andrew Cohill Date: Mon, Jun 22, 2015 Subject: Day One: Chili Dog PurgeDay one of the Chili Dog Purge: Made six quarts of chili on Friday. May have gone overboard on the jalape??o peppers. Accidentally got pepper juice in a cut on my hand while I was chopping them. Fell writhing to the floor in pain; poured a quart of milk over my hand, but then slipped on a milk puddle and sprained my wrist.Ace bandage is very uncomfortable in this hot weather. Had chili scrambled eggs for breakfast on Saturday morning. Washed it down with two cups of coffee.Purging started almost immediately. Burning sensation is continual and not very pleasant. Lunch was better; had chili burritos. Useful side effect: my allergies have completely disappeared; have not breathed this easily in many months. Dinner was a bowl of chili; actually pretty tasty with lots of grated cheese and washed down with a beer.Probably should not venture far from a bathroom; purging continues unabated. Tomorrow I will actually have a chili dog. On a low carb diet, so trying to avoid the white bread buns.Your obedient correspondent,Andrew- - -From: Brendan Hogan Date: Mon, Jun 22, 2015 Subject: RubricsGreetings,Please tell Susan Harlan that I will be posting her memo on rubrics for my other college colleagues to take due note of outside my faculty office.I will call her when I am called into the dean???s office to explain my lack of team spirit.Best wishes,Dr. Brendan Hogan- - -From: D.

I was reading an Internet Tendency from September 2014 and ran across a tiny curiosity that neither Suzanne Yeagley nor her interviewee could understand. The interview was with a person who creates images and proofreads text for tombstones.??? There are also strange days. Like yesterday I sent a proof back that made so little sense, I was like, ???Are you sure this is right???? It was for an old woman who had died, and it said, ???He paid it all.???Q: Maybe it was a situation where the husband paid for everything?A: That???s the only thing I could think of. Sometimes people just have to get the last word???The phrase is a reference to a hymn commonly sung at the end of a normal worship service in Southern Baptist churches. At the end of the service, the pastor invites people to come ???down the aisle??? (to the front, that is) to talk to him about joining that church or being ???saved??? (becoming a Christian, which Southern Baptists believe can only be done after you???re capable of understanding the concept for yourself).During that time, the congregation sings a quiet, meaningful song that is easily repeated. More than likely, her favorite hymn was ???Jesus paid it all,??? which was very popular as a closing hymn in the mid-to-late 1900s. Here are the two most relevant verses of the song, the refrain of which is sung over and over (and over and over) if the pastor isn???t done talking to the people who???ve come down the aisle. (By Elvina Hall, 1865)When from my dying bedMy ransomed soul shall rise,???Jesus died my soul to save,???Shall rend the vaulted skies.(Refrain:)Jesus paid it all,All to Him I owe;Sin had left a crimson stain,He washed it white as snow.The woman???s tombstone was her way of showing she was a Christian. I hope that cleared up their confusion!??? D. CooperP.S. My parents were fervent Christians, so I spent WAAAYYYYYYY too many Sunday mornings in the 1970s and 1980s waiting for the service???s closing hymn! Often the people at the front were quietly crying while the pastor counseled and prayed with them, but when the hymn got dragged out for a while, people would get restless. After a while, though, my dad???s patience would wear thin and he would lean over to my mom and try to whisper in his deep Texan drawl, ???He oughta cut that out. There???s old people here needs to get to lunch.??? He was genuinely serious that he felt the pastor was doing a disservice to the ???old??? people there, even though we all knew he was just hungry.

Maybe pining for a simpler time is a waste of breath in today???s fractured culture. But it???s gotten so out of hand, and it wasn???t always like this. The War On Christmas used to mean something.Lately I???ve been thinking about how we got to where we are. When they told us we were going to wage a war, we were assured it wasn???t going to be a prolonged campaign. Our goals were modest, to loosen one religion???s grip on a beloved holiday.Call me old-fashioned, but when I was a little kid, we waited until Thanksgiving was over before declaring War On Christmas. Sure, Santa would have his spot in the Macy???s Day Parade, but our parents assured us it was good, clean, secular fun. ???Well, yes, his character is loos",100
348,"ely based on a semi-historical Saint Nicolas,??? they???d say, explaining how modern day Santa Claus is more of a wintertime mascot, accessible to Christians and non-Christians alike.And then once the turkey was finished, that???s when it was OK to start taking the ???Christ??? out of Christmas. Which, yes, it was a war, but the sides weren???t as entrenched as they are in today???s divided America. It used to be enough to write ???Season???s Greetings??? on your holiday cards to let everyone know that shots had been fired. Maybe if the spirit moved us, we???d write letters expressing concern regarding the town nativity scene in such close proximity to City Hall.But the point wasn???t to linger on our differences. The War On Christmas was never meant to be the full-scale quagmire that???s it???s devolved into today. We were just trying to mount a subversive campaign to slowly chip away at the religious foundation of our nation???s most celebrated December holiday. And we were willing to compromise. ???Merry X-Mas??? was a genuine effort to ease the spread of our godless agenda.At least, that???s what I always believed. But now? We???ve got shopping malls flaunting their modern Santa???s villages, devoid of all religious iconography. We???ve got plain red coffee cups that, just last year, used to come decorated with festive snowflake illustrations. Talk about bringing a cr??che to a tinsel-fight. It wasn???t supposed to be this way.What???s the exit strategy? How much more War On Christmas can our country take? I blame commercialism. And I also blame the media. And the Internet. With so many distractions preventing us from living in the moment, we???ve lost sight of what it means to be at war with Christmas. If we could somehow collectively put our phones down for a minute, maybe we could see that the spirit of the War On Christmas is much more than shopping malls and coffee cups.It???s about Frosty the Snowman and Rudolph the red-nosed Reindeer. Come on, that???s how you steep the culture in secular-progressivism without sounding alarms. It???s about passive-aggressive generic seasonal greetings. It???s about casually letting your religious friends and family members know how excited you are to put up the holiday tree this year. And tell them you???re putting up a menorah too. Call it a holiday menorah. Just throw it all together and wrap them up with a continuous string of blinking holiday lights.We can do this, America. It???s not too late to get back on track. Because if we???re ever going to win this thing, we???ve got to find some way to reconnect with the true spirit of the War On Christmas. Happy holidays, everybody.Portrait by Kelly Bjork- - As we talk, Jake???s drinking a shot of espresso from a tiny cup. He???s a handsome guy with a narrow build and a charmingly unhurried presence. Tattoos the color of blue smoke decorate his limbs and neck. It???s fun to look at them. There are human skulls, railroad tracks, and menacing faces, and along one knuckle, plain-script letters spell Jake???s name.Jake is the Twilight???s cook, and he was working alone in the back when James shot Greg and entered the building. ???I heard all the commotion. I knew what the sounds were right away,??? he said, and I ask him about that, because most witnesses didn???t recognize the sounds as gunfire. ???I lived in New Orleans a couple years. You???d hear gunshots all the time there, at all different hours. I was used to hearing them at pretty close range, within a block or two from my house. It???d gotten so I could differentiate the noise from other loud popping sounds,??? Jake said. He has such an easy style of talking, and I realize how much his manner reminds me of Mario, a roommate???s ex. Mario was a cool, quiet man who worked in a car-repair shop and wore dark blue overalls. My roommate never got over him. She wrote his name, circled in a heart, on a carton of eggs that stayed in our fridge for a year.Back to Jake. ???My coworkers ran into the kitchen and swooped me up. I???d been cutting up some onions. Slicing them. They were bourbon onions for the Twilight Burger. That???s what I was doing right when everything started to happen, so it made the onions memorable,??? he said.He rushed to the patio with another coworker, a mysterious stranger in fairy wings, and the bartender Natalie, who was on the phone with 911. Could Jake tell what was happening? ???Not really. I could see that Natalie was really, really freaked out. It was a week or two after Sandy Hook, and my brain was leaning towards that. If I???d have known it was just a domestic type of situation, I wouldn???t have been too worried about it,??? he says.The group piled into the patio???s latch-door storage closet as Natalie continued her call. ???At first I thought our hiding place was kind of crappy,??? said Jake. ???If the shooter was a crazy dude, he could???ve just reached over and opened up the little gate. But I got over it. I realized we should just stay there. I figured he wouldn???t come back where we were, and I knew the cops would show up soon.???In a separate interview, Natalie said, ???As I was on the phone, Jake kept saying ???We???re ok, we???re ok,??? and helping me get through it. If anybody were to come to the patio, Jake would???ve been able to see them, but they wouldn???t have been able to see us. So Jake was peeking over the fence. He didn???t see anything,??? Natalie said. She kept her job at Twilight after the shooting, and more than year later, these memories continue to haunt her. ???I don???t like being on the patio,??? she said. ???I avoid it. If I have to close, I try to get someone to come out there with me. That closet still creeps me out too much. I haven???t used it since.???Natalie and I skip around in time, going back to the court inquest that followed the shooting. I ask her if it was bizarre to sit on the witness stand before the jury while the courtroom listened to a recording of her 911 call. ???Oh my god, yes,??? she said. ???It???s like an out-of-body experience to hear yourself that terrified.???It???s hard for me to hear it, too. I obtained my copy through public records. The full thing is over in less than two minutes. Natalie spits out the address. Her breathing is rapid. At one point, she screams a little, but she contains the volume, quickly pulling it inside herself. She describes the shooter as a light-skinned black male in a gray shirt. ???I have to be quiet, I have to be quiet,??? she whispers. ???Just stay on the phone with me if you can, you???re doing really good,??? says the operator. Then the line goes dead.Jake said, ???At one point I???d whispered to Natalie, ???It???s probably good. I???m sure 911 has been called like 20 times by now. Let???s keep it mellow and really quiet back here, and she hung up.??? As they stayed huddled together, ???the guy with wings started talking. He was audibly freaking out,??? said Jake. ???He was saying that we should go, that we should all run. Hop the fence and run away. I was just kinda telling him to be quiet. If the shooter was a crazy dude, I didn???t want him to hear us talking. We wouldn???t have had anywhere to go if he opened the gate and decided to shoot us or whatever. We wouldn???t have had much of a chance.???The winged guy calmed down, and for a time, the four waited in silence. Suddenly, ???we heard ten shots all at once, and then nothing after that,??? said Jake.???It ended so abruptly. We didn???t know if it was James shooting, or if the cops were shooting James,??? said Natalie. ???We weren???t even sure if the cops were there. But then I heard voices and I heard the police. One opened the door and we saw ",100
349,"his flashlight. We all put our hands up. That???s when we felt safe to come out. We were hustled through. We kept our hands up as we were walking. We passed a different closet and an officer was standing at the door, holding his gun up to it. I think he was checking to secure the scene,??? she said.The room was in shambles. Greg???s blood pooled the entry way. ???Blood doesn???t freak me out. I don???t know. Maybe I???m disconnected,??? said Jake. ???I didn???t see the shooter???s body. I guess it was behind the bar, up by the wall.??????I didn???t look around. I didn???t want to look around. At all. I just looked straight ahead and walked,??? said Natalie.When Jake???s group got outside, they joined the police and other witnesses gathered in front of the building. (All except the guy with the fairy wings. Who knows what his story was. Somewhere along the way, he must???ve cut out, sprinting off into the soggy black streets. He didn???t leave a police report. I asked a few witnesses if he???d arrived with their crew, but nobody remembers him. I don???t know how to find him, even though I really want to. Given that I???ve never met this man, nor even seen him, it???s strange how often I think of him.)I ask Jake what were his thoughts as he stood next to the bar. ???I was worried about the kitchen. The cops wouldn???t let us back in. Everything was on ??? the fryers, the stoves,??? he said.???Were the onions still out???? I asked.???The onions were still out,??? he said.- -Kitchen at the Twilight Exit.Photo courtesy of the Seattle Police Department.???5AM In Toronto??????Draft Day??????Headlines??????The Language??????Preach??????Look What You???ve Done??????Lord Knows??????Fear??????Buried Alive Interlude??????Under Ground Kings??????0-100/The Catch-Up??????Hold On, We???re Going Home???1999 was the boom before the bust for Christmas music. The musical landscape morphed into a bitter circus of tears. There were lucid moments amidst the pot smoke ??? Nirvana crashing the Billboard charts, Lauryn Hill???s heyday, Meatloaf???s role in Spice World ??? but for a decade that felt like it could have belonged to authentic artists with challenging music and ideas, it ended up in the gold-plated hands of Cher, auto-tuned to hell and back.Financially, a guaranteed seller was a lukewarm Christmas album from any top-selling pop artist. Love it or hate it, Christmas music was big business in the ???90s and reappeared every year as regularly as the three spirits in A Christmas Carol.???If you???re not ready for them, Christmas songs kind of force the sentiment,??? Alan Sparhawk, guitarist and singer for the Duluth, Minnesota band, Low, says. ???Nobody???s going to convince you, if you???re not ready. So it can be very tricky to open yourself up to it.???Tricky, and patronizing too. Forcing sentiment onto listeners can backfire spectacularly. For more on this, listen to ???The Christmas Shoes,??? and watch the corresponding TV movie starring Rob Lowe, then read the feel-good novelization.  Most artists rarely strike gold with an original Christmas tune; even fewer are likely to try. (In fact, it???s a commonly discouraged exercise.) Artists that do pen original songs walk a fine line between failure and forgetfulness. A poorly executed Christmas song won???t kill your career, but it does cast you into the land of sentimental pap, where so many Christmas albums from the ???90s reside. (N???Sync, 98 Degrees, Garth Brooks, Faith Hill, The Flaming Lips, Barenaked Ladies, Sarah McLachlan, James Taylor, Rod Stewart, The Brian Setzer Orchestra, Ren and Stimpy, just to name a few.)???We knew we were stepping into a live minefield, potentially,??? Sparhawk says. ???Whether it???s people who just don???t want to listen to [Christmas music] or people who are pretty precious about Christmas music and don???t want to hear some hack indie rock band doing versions of songs.???But Low are not just any ???hack indie rock??? band. They are the only ???hack indie rock??? band whom I would unconditionally trust to record an album of Christmas material.In November 1999, the band released an EP, eight songs, simply titled Christmas. Christmas allowed Low to stretch their musical boundaries without sacrificing their musical identity, but also established them as a band that were not afraid to embrace a different approach to Christmas ??? even if that meant exploring overtly religious concepts. But it also offered a glimmer of lightheartedness and hope; the marriage of Low???s musical textures combined with Christmas music offered a small, welcome reprieve from the darker material the band traded in.???Before we recorded that EP, [Christmas music] was relegated to the comical or the ironic,??? Sparhawk says. ""But we went in knowing that we wanted it to be cool and to stand on its own. We didn???t really think as much of it at the time, we just thought, ???this will be fun.??? And I didn???t want to necessarily draw on nostalgia, even though there are some covers. But we decided if we???re going to cover ???Little Drummer Boy??? it???s going to sound like a mess.???Only three tracks were covers of Christmas songs: ???Silent Night,??? ???Little Drummer Boy,??? and ???Blue Christmas.??? The rest are originals, a treacherous route that was not lost on the band.???Obviously if you???re going to write Christmas songs, it???s pretty daunting,??? Sparhawk says. ???You???re working against tradition; a lot of symbolism that???s already been used. It???s hard to find a new way to address that.???But Low spent much of the ???90s exploring new ways to address the themes and structures inherent in their music. Low created a sound so minimal and uncharacteristic, it spawned its own short-lived genre: slowcore. Low weren???t the progenitors of slowcore and that sobriquet that has long been abandoned, but they were one of a handful of bands to stretch its fundamentals to the limit. Low???s songs, especially on their first two releases, I Could Live In Hope and Long Division, are down tempo to the point of stasis. They mirror the desolation of Midwestern winters and the feeling of paranoia, anxiety, and dread that accompany a lack of color in the coldest months. Usually, there???s no room for light within Low???s songs; if there is, it???s a blinking fluorescent bulb inside a municipal building.This unassuming trio from Duluth, Minnesota is not made to be carriers of the Christmas music torch. Yet, they captured the sentiment of Christmas through honesty and sincerity. The EP touched a nerve.???At the time when it came out we ended up getting a lot more attention than I thought. John Peel really loved it and convinced the daytime DJs on the BBC to play it,??? Sparhawk says. ""That was a huge. It ended up being something they really loved, especially in England. We didn???t know it would be heard as much as it was; we just wanted to make sure it wasn???t out of line and then figured the rest would carry itself. I think if we knew it was going to be such a big deal, we probably wouldn???t have finished it,??? Sparhawk laughs.Not everyone ???got it,??? however. Some listeners tried to return the disc claiming that something was wrong with the track, ???Little Drummer Boy.??????Because it???s so digitally distorted, some people thought, ???hey, there???s something broken on this,?????? Sparhawk says. ???And that was one of the moments where I thought, ???Yes, I???m glad we did this.??????Low reinvented what a Christmas album could be ??? whether through interpretation, arrangement, or willingness to tackle subjects such as taking down the Christmas tree (???Taking Down the Tree???) and the fate of the baby Jesus in present-",100
350,"day (???If You Were Born Today???). And since the EP eschews irony for sincerity, I was curious if Sparhawk believes Christmas music has to be sincere ??? or even religious ??? to connect on a personal level.???No, it can be just anything,??? Sparhawk says. ???I think anything that taps into the spirit of giving or a moment of pause to consider one???s place. There are songs that are religious and songs that are not and there is a place for all of that. Just like there???s a place for songs about being with your family and going home for Christmas. Of anything in our society, I???m sure there are lots of people who are not Christian who could take Christmas or leave it. But for something that rallies in a universal way, for society to ponder and be a little bit more reflective about life and the passage of time is positive. It???s a message of hope; there is love and there are powerful things in the world. Whether you???re Christian or not the hope is that you kind of contribute to that without being irreverent.???Low are nothing if not reverent, and contributed a lasting document of Christmas simplicity in a decade of excess and insincerity. Sixteen years later, Christmas is one of the band???s most popular releases and a beacon of distinction among the Christmas detritus. An album that resonates bigger and brighter every year.Christmas Music Bonus Round with Alan SparhawkFavorite Christmas song: ???I like ???Little Drummer Boy.??? But I have this old Jim Nabors Christmas LP. He had a really unusual, unique, but beautiful voice. I take that one every Christmas; it puts me back in touch with the weird possibilities of music.???Least favorite Christmas song: ""Oh man. [Mimi] (Alan???s wife and band member) and I go back and forth about Amy Grant. She loves it and plays it a lot. I tolerate it. I mean, Amy Grant???s great and that???s a really pure effort that she made. And she brought a lot of really nice things to people, but for some reason when I hear that I just think, ???Oh man, there???s go to be something else.??? (Laughs)To: Resident ServicesSubject: Neighbor complaintMy millennial neighbor???s future is incredibly bright, and it is shining right into my apartment.  Due to my recent divorce and subsequent loss of identity, I have developed a real, not made up sensitivity to the vivid, glowing promise of young talented people.  Living next to her could cause lasting damage to my corneas and/or dignity.   I can only assume it is a violation of some ordinance that one of your residents be put in close proximity to a known allergen.  Therefore, for health reasons, I am requesting that she be moved.The glaring light of her future, full of so much untapped potential, is somehow managing to come through every window on all sides of my apartment, defying the laws of logic and physics.  I didn???t notice it when I moved in.  I thought she was a college drop out. She is, but seems to have a real eye for web design and is going to enter her 24th year debt-free.  That knowledge has given me three migraine headaches this month alone.I was erroneously led to believe that a good education would lead to a good life.  It seems that this girl was raised to believe that you can follow your own personal happiness.  Watching her do so has forced me to double up my Prozac dose.I tried blackout curtains to block out the dazzling light coming from her infinite possibilities, but I can still hear her playing vinyl Jack White albums, and the sound is deafening.  Maybe she can switch apartments with Doris from B12?  Doris is well into her 50s and has all but given up on real fulfillment. Her life will provide a much better backdrop for me as I use what???s left of my dwindling youth to stage a career change as a stand-up comic.Her future is also effecting my dating life, as the brightness coming from next door casts a shadow of doubt across my threshold whenever I open the door for a man, and by contrast makes everything in my home appear drab and unattractive, including my children.Speaking of my children, each day that they are exposed to the neighbor???s abundant optimism, they look at me more and more like an outdated piece of furniture. ???Doris is the outdated piece of furniture!???  I try to tell them, but they just look at me confused, and then ask where Daddy is.Please address this health risk immediately.  Normally I wouldn???t complain, because I have low self-esteem and don???t often advocate for myself, but the past week has been unbearable.   Last Monday, she yelled over to me that she would be out of town for a few days because she???d been cast as an extra on Portlandia, and asked if could I keep an eye on her bonsai trees, which she has named Fitz and Saffron. I have been sick to my stomach ever since, and am unable to go to work.And that is why I haven???t paid the rent.To begin, yes, I???m that Annie. But I go by Anne now. One of my classmates at Cornell introduced me to hair straighteners and, after some intense work with a speech therapist, I???ve mostly stopped spontaneously breaking out into song.(Clears throat)So, um, when Google asked me to give a motivational speech, I thought, What could I possibly talk about? I mean, sure, I sang that song about the sun coming out tomorrow, but nowadays I need a Zoloft prescription just to get me through a partly cloudy day.(Laughs nervously)I???m kidding. I mean, not about the Zoloft ??? you???ll have to pry that out of my cold dead hands! Anyway. My speech is called ???Tomorrow: It???s Only a Day Away.??? Get it? Of course you get it. You???re Google. You???re the thing other people go to when they don???t get it. So this should be fun, right? Not ???renting out an entire movie theatre to impress the woman you want to sleep with and her weird orphan???-fun. But still fun.So today I???ll be talking about staying motivated at work. So, uh, unless there are any questions, let???s get started.(A hand goes up)Yes???? Ma???am, you???ll have to speak a little louder??? Oh, apparently, she wants to know why Mr. Bundles didn???t notice I was in the laundry cart! Good question. Not technically about staying motivated, but that???s fine. I bribed him. Mr. Bundles isn???t an idiot. Don???t you think he would say ???Hey, that???s weird. The laundry is, at minimum, 65 pounds heavier than it usually is???? Of course he would. So I saved all the money I made in the orphan gambling ring and gave it to Mr. Bundles to sneak me out.Now, let???s get started. Motivation, as you all know, is a key element in making work feel less like a job and more like???.(Another hand)I???m sorry, what???? Why did FDR get involved in the whole thing when he probably had a lot of other things going on? Sir, this is supposed to be about??? alright, fine. Originally there was a song in Act 1 called ???Hey Shouldn???t You Be Paying a Little More Attention To That Hitler Guy Instead of Worrying About An Adoption Case???? sung by FDR???s cabinet, but it was cut for time. Happy?Now do you guys have any questions about staying motivated? Anyone want to know some productivity tips, ???cause I googled??? I???m sorry, are you offended when I use it as a verb? Oh, good. I googled like a hundred productivity tips before I got here today just to get ready for this talk. Did you know that there are seventeen different ways to use Post-It notes? Interesting, right?(Silence)Alright fine, lady in the back? You look like you???re dying to jump in here??? Ah, yes, the thing everybody asks eventually: ???Did Grace and Daddy Warbucks stay together????No. Of course they didn???t stay together. He???s a middle-aged balding billionaire who likes being called ???Daddy??? and she???",100
351,"s his perky, much younger secretary. How long do you think it lasted? Here???s a hint: Not much longer than that reprise of ???Tomorrow??? that I sang with FDR. Mr. President, for the love of God, stop focusing on the harmonies and start saving some Jews, amiright!?(Silence)Fun fact, people ??? and you can???t google this one: Grace caught Mr. Warbucks sleeping with Annette, got a lawyer, and sued the pants off him for a hostile work environment. You might remember Annette as the woman who ???comes into make your bed. The silk sheets? No the satin ones I think.??? Who picks satin sheets for a 10-year-old? A whore, that???s who. Why not also leave a bottle of lube and a radio playing ???Let???s Get It On??? on loop? Anyway, Grace had a fantastic lawyer and took Warbucks for millions. She even got joint custody of Punjab and took??? I???m sorry what?Look. I just wanted to come here, make a few bucks, and maybe give you some goddamn motivation tips that probably won???t work anyway. I dunno, make a to-do list. Freaking color code your files. Put some goddamn inspirational quotes on your goddamn copy machine. Whatever. But instead I get: ???Do you and Sandy still hang out???? Sir, are you an idiot? Dogs live to be, what? Ten? Twelve? Sandy died three weeks after we filmed the last scene. We were on a budget. We didn???t do doggie surgeries or hide little pet antidepressants in lunch meat. Dog starts to cough, you put him down. Dog starts to bite the mailman, you put him down. Dog keeps focusing on a goddamn adoption case instead of the genocide that is obviously going on in Germany, you put him down!(She looks around)I???m sorry. That didn???t make sense. Could I get some water?(Voice begins to shake)All I want to say is, the sun might not come out. It might not come out tomorrow and it might not come out the next day and it might not come out ever again. And if you don???t think that???s true, then watch the movie musical about all the orphans who didn???t get adopted. You???ll get to hear catchy songs like ???Grandma at 33??? and ???Just One More Handjob Till I Can Pay the Electric Bill.??? That one???s a tap number! NOW GET ME SOME GODDAMN WATER!(She grabs a water bottle from one of the audience members, reaches into her pocket and grabs a pill. She puts the pill in her mouth and takes a swig of water.)I???m sorry. I???m so, so sorry. I thought I was ready for this.(She gathers herself and begins to quietly sing)When I???m stuck with a day that???s gray and lonely. I just stick up my chin and grin and say, ohhhh(The audience joins in one by one)The sun???ll come out tomorrow. So you gotta hang on till tomorrow ??? come what may(Harmony)Toooooommorrow! Tomorrow! I love ya, tomorrow! You???re always a day away.Two weeks before the long anticipated campus visit of world-famous writer and all-around wonderful person, Margaret Atwood, the English department chair sent out an email blast to remind the professors to encourage students to go, quickly followed by one, two, then three curmudgeonly emails from tenured English professors and department fixtures pleading for an end to the common practice of giving students extra-credit to attend author appearances, because those who were only motivated by class credit wouldn???t be able to mask their disinterest and would behave in ways embarrassing to the university. This email was quickly followed by an email from an English major, who reminded the boo-hooing department fixtures of the difference between ???reply??? and ???reply all,??? and that the former was the better choice when disparaging students, since the department chair???s email blast also went out to English majors, and there were now a lot of students who had concrete evidence of the long-suspected negative attitudes of the fixtures toward their students.On the night of the Margaret Atwood talk, I arrived on campus early enough to get something to eat at the student center that featured express versions of fast food restaurants where students worked, and where students stood in roped-off snaking lines. I rarely went to campus at night, and except for the restaurant managers who looked like graduates who had hung around, I was easily the oldest person out of hundreds in this large cafeteria. Despite my being employed by the university, this was their habitat, and I felt like I very much didn???t belong. I remembered being nineteen, thirty years ago, in a university dining hall not unlike this one, where we lingered after we???d eaten to joke around and put off studying, and I remembered a friend I often ate with who couldn???t sit still. He???d wad up napkins and shoot baskets into many of the drinking glasses at the table, so I???d learned to keep a hand over any glass I hoped to drink out of as I ate as best I could one-handed.Behind me, as I waited in line for a veggie burger, I sensed a nineteen-year-old bursting with the same anxious energy, and I knew that time moved differently for him, that this waiting was excruciatingly tedious for him, and as most of us fiddled on our phones, he was practically doing jumping jacks to try and will the line to move forward. As I ordered, new to this particular burger chain, I asked questions, and the nineteen-year-old, who could no longer bother to stand behind me but was next to me and leaning on the counter, practically choked from having to listen to my circuitous navigation of the simple menu, hardly able to contain himself to not shout out his combo before his turn. I was as glad as he was when my food was paid for and I was given my receipt, so I could go stand among the loitering students with similar tickets instead of waiting with the nineteen-year-old one moment longer, our brains really quite different. Blessed as he was with youth, he was entirely unable to hide his discomfort with something so ordinary as waiting to be served a hamburger.After eating alone in my office on another part of campus, I forewent my usual practice of showing up early to find a good seat in the front of the auditorium, in the near proximity of the famous writer, and instead I sat in the back, where the seats were just as rare, with hopes of witnessing firsthand the embarrassing behavior of students bribed into attending this event with class credit, to see if maybe the department fixtures were right, despite their rudeness and unfortunate attitudes. What I noticed was that a lot of people ??? students, professors, and readerly townies ??? had shown up early, just as I had, either to sit up front, or to sit all the way in the back, with a chasm of empty seats between the two groups. In back, the students talked about being sure they would receive the promised class credit by signing in on a sign-up sheet, and one of the professors who spotted one of her students reminded the student to be sure to do just that. While I don???t believe that extra-credit is a notion compatible with higher education, I won???t question the motives of my colleagues who may have understood better than I did the effects of reward and punishment, however ephemeral, because as the auditorium filled and I got a good look around, not one of my 100+ writing or literature students was in attendance. I also noticed that only one out of the three of the curmudgeonly professors who had unintentionally insulted the English majors was there. Many of the students around me had no idea what the event was even about, and while I was hopeful they???d be won over by Margaret Atwood, everyone was talking, and everyone had a phone out, and I suspected, skeptically, that she wouldn???t be reaching those of us in the back of the auditorium where the students were paid with cl",100
352,"ass credit.The M.C. appeared to introduce the honored guest and the conversations didn???t stop, but as the bow-tied smallish professor talked about dystopian literature, the gulf between the ways we talk, and the ways we talk about art was demonstrated, the smallish professor delighted and nervous to be smart about the work of Margaret Atwood, the author, in front of Margaret Atwood, the person. She stepped to the podium and as she spoke, the conversations in the back of the auditorium lowered to a simmer. Some of the students left very soon after she began, while most stayed to barely listen. If you???ve not seen Margaret Atwood, her dry wit hits repeatedly as she drones on, and up front there was twittering delight at all the right beats. Meanwhile, in back, about twenty minutes in, the paid audience settled in to quietly watch videos or to interact with faraway humans who were elsewhere and also on phones. Margaret Atwood explained how she was affected by The Feminine Mystique when it came out, like many women of her generation, and to try to demonstrate the sexist flavor of that time she quoted repeatedly from ???The Good Wife???s Guide,??? which she didn???t know was a hoax, probably a pre-Internet hoax, but a made-up document that purported to have come from a women???s magazine in 1957. ???The Good Wife???s Guide??? has circulated because of its exaggerated but believably sexist suggestions to housewives that they should prepare themselves, their children, and the home, to greet their husbands upon his return from work. It escalates his importance in listicle style as it advises her to make the best of her dependence, so that he???s godlike, and she???s nearly an insect, but a smiling one ??? because feminism is a joke to some people. Even if anyone up front caught her reference and knew ???The Good Wife???s Guide??? was a satire and a fake, there wasn???t a good way to tell Margaret Atwood. After all, her experience had been real. She was merely trying to present the flavor. Meanwhile, in back, the story of her feminist awakening was lost on everyone around me, where one young woman shopped for shoes, lots of young women played with strands of hair, and everyone else was on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and they shared with each other what they???d found on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and Siri was heard being activated with a bell tone, and Siri said, ???I can help you with that.???Thirty minutes in, the paid audience had grown tired of their phones but perked up when Margaret Atwood talked about the Bible. She suggested there would always be contradictory messages found in any book that was actually a diverse collection of books, and this Southern audience, many of whom thought of themselves as authorities on that very same quite unified and singlehandedly ghost-authored best-book-ever, edged forward in their seats to listen. I learned that some international students used different gestures than Americans to shush each other (by repeatedly cupping the chin), and that references to ???real rape??? from polite apologists invoked uncomfortable disquiet among even those who got her, as Margaret Atwood admitted by the end of her talk that The Handmaid???s Tale was more relevant thirty years later, at a time when women???s bodies were claimed as state property, just as young men???s bodies were once claimed as state property by the draft. She addressed everyone as ???readers,??? and screens flipped off as her talk wound down. The standing ovation rippled back from the front, with those around me clapping not for her speech but to acknowledge that it had ended, most of whom stayed because they believed, rightly or wrongly, that they needed to endure the whole talk to be able to get credit, and they bolted out of the auditorium before the applause died down, while those who cared about Margaret Atwood didn???t notice any of this, and Margaret Atwood could not have known either.There are parallel societies in the university that will go out into the world separately, one whose members read and talk about books, and a second, whose members ignore the first when they do. Because of the nature of this event and the stature of the speaker, the representation of these parallel societies was skewed. Be assured: the readers are far outnumbered by those who see little value in time spent reading, and they were multiplied many times over by those elsewhere on campus that night. There were those who were waiting tables who liked to read, and those who were waiting tables who never did. There were those in the library working on calculus proofs who would rather have been reading, and those in the library working on calculus proofs who preferred anything over reading.At the end of the question and answer period Margaret Atwood described a project in Norway she???d been asked to participate in called Future Library, where a forest of 1000 saplings will be pulped in one hundred years, to make an anthology from the 100 texts contributed, one per year, with each successive and exclusive contribution housed there in the Norwegian woods. Margaret Atwood was optimistic that there would still be readers in one hundred years, and why wouldn???t there be? Everyone on campus that night will have lived and died before the piece Margaret Atwood had given them will be printed up and distributed, and she was the only one who knew what she had said. The people up front were curious and buoyed by the idea, while the audience in back was dispersed and had already started in on what was left of the night. And I got up and walked out too. As I left, I heard a young person say, ???I???m so glad I went to that,??? and I didn???t know if she was coerced or if she came of her own accord, but I think I know.I got in my car and drove the 1 ?? hours through the Tennessee night from the city where I was a professor to the city where I lived. I watched for deer along the highway as I listened to Mrs. Dalloway on the Audible app, and a semi with an L.E.D. Christian cross on its grill drove too closely behind me for most of the way home.???Ishmael, call me.???- -???Today, died mother.???- -???The times: best of they were, worst of they were.???- -???Nobody but God, never tell, you better not.???- -???True this is universally: good fortune has a single man, wife must he want.???- - ???Of my life, light; of my loins, fire, Lolita she was.???- -???See them hitting, between the curling flower spaces, through the fence I could.???- -???Me you know not, The Adventures of Tom Sawyer without have read, ain???t no matter ??? luminous beings are we!???- -???In a house we lived ??? to the mountains, across the river and the plain looked a village that year in late summer.???- -???Facing the firing squad many years later, ice he remembered, how Colonel Aureliano Buendia???s father took him, to discover they did.???- -???Born twice was I: In Detroit remarkably smogless it was in January 1960 as baby girl born first was I; Near Petoskey, Michigan in an emergency room in August of 1974 born then again as a teenage boy was I.???- - ???Riverrun, past Eve and Adam???s, from swerve of shore to bend of bay, brings us by a commodius vicus of recirculation back to Howth Castle and Environs.???Dear [INSERT PARTNER???S NAME],I can???t believe this day has finally arrived.

Because this class was a level 1 course, we also covered some basic biology lab techniques. In one particular session, the task at hand was to learn how to extract DNA. The victims were conventionally bred strawberries, which as octoploids, contain such a ridiculously high amount of DNA that a rough extraction technique is sufficient.How to extract DNA from a strawberry, as understood by my botany students:11)	Have your teaching assistant put an amount of isopropanol (aka rubbing alcohol, ~50mls) in the freezer before you know that this lab will exist, because you???ve not done the reading.2)	Make 50mls of extraction buffer by mixing a 1:10 dilution of dish soap (TA says shampoo works as well) with the salt sitting in the weigh boat, located to your right.3)	Place 1 large berry (choose the one with a bit of mold because you plan on eating the rest of them) in an airtight baggie, add extraction buffer and mash thoroughly with your fist.4)	Pour the mash into a beaker through a sieve or whatever to filter out the chunks/clumps/globs and discard by whipping them into the trash all the way across the room. Three points if you make it!5)	Add an equal amount of cold isopropanol and invert to mix. At this point you should see the strands of DNA precipitate out of the solution. This is actually quite neat.6)	Use a glass hook to remove the DNA, and twirl it around like a helicopter before putting it in water.7)	Eat the rest of the berries if you have not done so already, because eating something that is sitting on a lab bench isn???t sketchy at all. Not one bit.At some point during the lab session, I saw one student accidentally (?) fling a glob of strawberry DNA across the bench with a glass hook. The surrounding students all stared at the white mucus-y gooey pile, before one spoke up.???Dude, you spilled your DNA.???Overhearing this, I let out an undignified snort, because I was not mature enough for this job.Due to the interest in do-it-yourself biology as a larger part of the citizen science movement, the extraction protocol posted above can be readily found on the internet, along with protocols for downstream techniques, such as restriction digest and gel electrophoresis.The nature of DIY science has changed quite a bit in the last 150 years or so. Between the beginning of the industrial age through the 1960s, forays into citizen science focused on the chemical and mechanical/engineering sciences as advances in these areas became synonymous with American pride. This could be due to the success of the Manhattan Project in ending World War II, the rise of companies such as DuPont and Goodyear offering chemical products to improve our vehicles, our crops, our clothes, our homes, our hygiene, our cosmetics, our foods, our hair, etcetera, etcetera, and, last but not least, advancements in mechanics inspired by, and for the space race.As it was in society, so it echoed in children???s toys. The 1940???s and 50???s gave rise to an ever-diversifying array of chemistry sets, which provided everything needed to conduct experiments at home. Basic sets typically included a balance, assorted flasks, beakers, and tests tubes, pipettes, thermometers, and most importantly, chemicals. These ranged from the innocuous (potassium chloride) to the eyebrow-raising (hydrogen peroxide, nitric/sulfuric acid) to the ???are you kidding me??? (U-238 isotope, sodium cyanide) along with other flammable, explosive, and toxic items so that you could carry out the dangerous and awesome tasks on your own.Admittedly I???m not jealous, because I had Nintendo when I was a kid.I???m also not jealous because I generally don???t like explosions followed by fire while I am in ",100
354,"the vicinity.You can still get chemistry sets today, but they are quite a bit different. They focus on the creation of inert crystal structures, pretty colors, and things that glow. Neat stuff and all, but what happened to our chemistry sets of old?The pushback started in the 1960s, as the effects of Agent Orange, Rachel Carson???s Silent Spring, lead poisoning, and growing concern about nuclear proliferation wised us up to the fact that chemistry had a downside. This gave rise to appropriate legislation such as The Federal Hazardous Labeling Act (1960), The Consumer Product Safety Commission (1972), and the Toxic Substances Control Act (1976). More recently, we have our fears about meth labs, chemical warfare, and last but not least, chemtrails. You may not know what it is, but it???s probably controlling your brain waves.Raise your hand if you know at least one person that won???t eat something if s/he can???t pronounce every single thing in the ingredient list.Now in the 2010s, we still have a healthy suspicion towards chemicals, manifested in declarations against so-called Big Pharma (GlaxoSmithKline/vaccines/PharmaBro!!!) and Big Food (Monsanto/pesticides/GMOs). And it???s these concerns that have led to a new DIY science movement that centers around biology, or in particular, growing, culturing, fermenting, and preserving your own food. For example, a quick internet search will let you know how to make your own yogurt (step 1: buy yogurt, because you need a starter culture of microbes). Along the same vein, my home state, Oregon, has the honor of being the land of a million microbrews, and it seems like everybody???s grandmother has tried their hand at brewing their own beer. Simply and cheesily put, Do it Yourself has become Brew it Yourself. I???d argue that this is a Good Thing, mainly because it helps us to avoid the extra sugar and salt that is often present in store-bought, processed food.Another example of wholesome DIY biology/citizen science is wide public participation into ecological and population counting studies. These include bird-counting projects set forth by The National Audubon Society, and the Cornell University Ornithology labs.2 A similar project includes algal tracking by the University of Georgia,3 and cicada counting by the National Geographical Society.4 I???d argue that this is a Fantastic Thing, as population counts and related studies are so large-scale, it???s a good idea to have mass participation over many years to do the best, most thorough job.On the computational side, there is an ever-expanding number of databases popping up for organisms that have had their genomes sequenced and annotated. These databases are open-source, which is science-talk for being accessible to the public. A few examples are human, fruit fly, corn, chocolate and most recently, water bears (bizarre), and coming soon, beavers!5 Anyone with internet access could go in and poke around, no coding experience necessary. I???d argue that this is an Awesome Thing, as these projects are typically funded by the public, so of course they should be available to the public. The only drawback is that there may be a bit of a learning curve when it comes to drawing a connection from genome databases to figuring out the intricate aspects of the genome that make our critter du jour tick. We in the scientific community are still figuring this one out.DIY biology has also moved into the realm of recombinant DNA, with the Holy Grail being the creation of a bioluminescent plant. As might be expected, recombinant DNA technology is on the expensive side, requiring a multitude of specific enzymes, cultures, reagents, and equipment such as super cold freezers and centrifuges. This has produced a community effort into creating shared spaces in major US cities, where regular folks can take classes and work on projects in a group environment.6This DIY movement into recombinant DNA technology is what has raised some eyebrows, and has lent itself some unwholesome names such as ???BioPunk,??? ???BioHacking,??? and so on, and so forth. The public is terrified of genetically modified organisms (GMOs), which is exactly what this movement creates. Apparently, there is little difference between folks that want to make a fluorescent bacterial culture spell LOVE ??? in a petri dish, and folks that think creating the next highly virulent toxic cancerous liquefying superbug is first of all, something that can be easily done on an evil whim, and secondly, is a 2nd Amendment right.As for superbugs, we are doing a fine job of creating them simply through ill-advised and excessive use of sanitizers and antibiotics.Regular folks studying recombinant DNA technology is a Wonderful Thing, because it is the basis of so many crucial medicines that we use today, not to mention that increased scientific literacy is the Best Thing Ever. If we have the knowledge to create superbugs, it???s likely that we also have the knowledge to stop superbugs. If it makes you nervous, I recommend actually going out, learning about it, and doing it. After all, the best way to get over a fear of flying is to get a pilot???s license.- - -1  My botany students were fantastic and talented people.

It???s an incredible piece of writing about a legendary space, an homage and a eulogy and a celebration and an act of cultural criticism all in one. It encompasses personal history and national history and race and politics and art and money and spirituality. It is exactly the kind of essay The Believer was founded in 2003 in order to publish, and yet The Believer almost wasn???t here to publish it.A couple of years ago, when The Believer was a decade old, we had a moment when we realized: it would be easier to stop doing this every month. We???d never thought this way before, and obviously most artists and writers and arts facilitators try hard never to think this way. Because it is always easier to not write the book or not write the song or not produce the album or not publish the magazine. It can be a struggle to make it in the arts. It can be hard to ???make rent??? in both the metaphorical and less metaphorical meanings of the term. Making rent can begin to feel like a gargantuan undertaking, like making a person from scratch, or making a peace accord. Making rent, over the years, can tire a human out.That we allowed ourselves to think this way at all???that it would be easier to not???was because we felt that The Believer could be proud of what it had accomplished. Over the years we had seen countless young writers flow through our pages and then on to bigger, better-paying gigs. They write for all kinds of famous periodicals, and they get book deals based on essays they wrote for us???rent-paying book deals. We felt our existence was justified if we helped young, untested writers and artists and filmmakers through the tenuous foothold years and gave them a springboard opportunity to become self-sufficient creators. We???d done our work, for ten years we???d done it, and now we could retire.However, we realized The Believer had nothing to do with us, ",100
355,"the founders, any longer. It had become its own institution???and an institution that???s just as vital as it was when we first created it. After all, artists and writers will always at one point in their lives be twenty and unknown, or they will be dead and forgotten and requiring a reboot in the cultural consciousness, or they will be older and alive, and writing experimental work that no one else will publish.So instead of shutting our doors, we???ve reinvented The Believer as a bimonthly magazine with more space for ambitious, unique, and innovative work from writers and artists at every stage in their careers and from all around the world. In 2016, we???ll be bringing you new work by Lydia Davis and Ben Mauk and Lena Dunham, Karen Tongson and Katrina Dodson and Kima Jones, Azareen Van der Vliet Oloomi and Sarah Marshall and Sandi Rankaduwa. We???ll have reporting from Berlin and Northeast India, Guyana and Vietnam, the dense forests of the Pacific Northwest and the wilds of Florida. We???ll have interviews with philosophers and writers, painters and gurus, actors and comedians. We???re redesigning our website to make our articles more pleasant to read on screens and thirteen years??? worth of work easier to find. We can???t wait to share it all with you.But to keep this work alive, to continue empowering the writers and artists that make The Believer what it is, your support is essential. Without the financial reinforcement of our readers, none of this is possible. If you believe in the value of this magazine, we ask you to contribute what you can. It will make a difference.We feel humbled to have touched, even briefly, the work of writers we know will go on to become institutions in their own rights. We are a conduit. We remain a conduit. Most importantly, we are here.Thank you for being here with us.Sincerely,Heidi JulavitsVendela VidaFounding Editors- - - -By donating today, you can help The Believer continue to publish ambitious, unique, and innovative work from writers and artists at every stage in their careers, from all around the world.ND7: Netflix Disputes per WeekRSMH: Restless Sleeper Mattress Heat MapOZ%: Overreaction Zone PercentageSAR: Sexts Above ReplacementiFON: Independent Fries Ordering NecessityBoWNfreq: Borrowing Without Notice FrequencyA/E: Apology per ErrorLiWoS: (Rate of) Listening Without SolvingTEDDI: Snuggling Compatibility (Named for stat creator: Ted DiCarlo)McSweeney???s Internet Tendency contributor Doogie Horner???s Some Very Interesting Cats Perhaps You Weren???t Aware Of is an illustrated book of short stories and cartoons about cats, most of which are funny.

A tea party with Abraham Lincoln and Cinderella.These are a few of my favorite things.These ???what if???? scenarios are culled from the imagination of children. Because children have no precautions about creating impossible scenarios, they combine disparate objects and people to actualize their visions. Adults are typically terrible at this. But sometimes, just sometimes, they turn the impossible into reality.In 1977, at the request of absolutely no one, an impossible dream came true.Fresh off a debilitating drug addiction and accusations of Nazi sympathizing, David Bowie was ready to capitalize on the non-chart success of his latest record, Low, by appearing on Bing Crosby???s Merrie Olde Christmas. On paper it made sense to no one. But when these two icons met to record a television segment, it made even less sense. It must have been quite chilly on that mocked English castle set; warmer performances occur at Apple board meetings.The story of their arrangement has been reported to excess and most reports use words such as ???surreal,???1 ???weird,??? and ???defying musical logic"" to describe it. This seemed like the worst pairing since peanut butter and mayonnaise.Clearly written to highlight a generation gap, the segment makes the most of an awkward encounter. First, Bowie mistakes Bing for the new butler (because everyone who lives on Bowie???s street must have a butler), and then asks Bing if he is the ???poor relation??? from America. Nevermind that Bowie can???t be bothered to make a normal introduction, he???s just popping by his neighbor???s house (Percival) to bang out a few scales on the piano.But the conversation turns to music and Bowie asks Bing if he ???like(s) modern music.??? Bowie reminisces about ???John Lennon and??? ah, Harry Nilsson??? with a boyish grin, and the implication is clear: You???re welcome, old man. Bing responds in mock-surprise: ???Oh? You go back that far, huh???? Subtitle: Kiss the ring, youngster. You???re lucky I let you in the door. It???s like watching a wrestling match of wits; each one trading barbs hoping to draw blood. But behold, the encounter is quelled by the glad tidings of a suggested Christmas duet.Together they perform the 1941 Christmas tune, ???The Little Drummer Boy,??? with some alterations: Bowie sings a new counterpoint, ???Peace On Earth,??? written by the show???s script and music writers, Ian Fraser, Larry Grossman, and Alan Kohan. Bowie balked at singing a song he did not like, a tradition he still maintains today by refusing to sing ???China Girl??? or ???Cat People (Putting Out Fire)??? in concert.  Obviously, the only possible solution to this quandary is to write an ENTIRELY NEW SONG FOR BOWIE.I suppose the producers, Bowie???s mom (an admitted fan of Bing), and Bing???s kids (admitted fans of Bowie) really wanted this merrie Christmas scene to take flight. Bing Crosby r",100
357,"eserves the right to toss anyone off set if he deems it necessary. This is a man who allegedly weighed his chubby son every week, only to whip him with a studded belt if he didn???t like the results. You don???t just walk onto Bing???s set and say you care for the song you???re about to duet on with him.Apparently, David Bowie does.Christmas specials were routine to Bing Crosby. At 74, Crosby was pretty much on autopilot. But he doesn???t look like a man who will be dead a month later. He???s got a swagger about him and his baritone voice is still near top form. But he looks tired, unwilling to tussle to reassert his alpha status. I imagine a resigned Bing letting the writers placate Bowie with several options for song choices while he steps out to get a few practice golf swings in. Let the writers deal with this kid, I???m going to the driving range.The performance was a hit, though Bowie all but disowned it. Even though it was widely bootlegged, an official single was released in 1982, a move that angered Bowie further. For Bing, it was the last Christmas special, his last recorded television segment; he died of a heart attack October 14, 1977 following a round of golf.Bing doesn???t stay dead for long, though. We dust him off every year at Christmas and resurrect his work all month long. Sometimes we even enjoy it.The ghost of Bing was resurrected once again five years ago on Christmas day. This time in the form Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly reenacting a line-for-line parody of the Bing and Bowie segment. With Ferrell as a pudgier Bowie and Reilly as a disheveled Bing, the two work the scene as if they were reciting dialogue from Samuel Beckett.YouTube commenters found much to revel in. User ""Ron Morris??? (if that is his real name) says, ""Way funny!  Frame for frame remake!  AHAHAHHaha  Almost shared this with my whole family though.  Glad I didn???t.??? (Maybe his family is easily offended by terrible makeup jobs?) While commenter ""butts poop??? (almost definitely his real name) boldly declares, ""This is the best video I???ve ever seen in my life.??? Among the trolls, however, are a few quips of sincerity. Some commenters remember watching the original when it aired and have fond memories of seeing it for the first time. Others talk about how their parents loved Bing Crosby and watched all of his Christmas specials from the beginning. A few acknowledge the sadness of Bing Crosby???s death. The thread is surprisingly tame and almost readable, a minor Christmas miracle in a medium usually reserved for snark and derision. Some quality of the original must have tapped into some goodwill to keep the unpleasantness of commenters in check. Nostalgia, it seems, runs deep at Christmas time ??? even when we???re making fun of it.Most people, myself included, seem to be split on the true nature of the video. Is it homage? Is it irony? Is it genuine? A Christmas gift? If so, for whom? And why this moment? There are plenty of terrible Christmas moments to satirize and I don???t believe that Bing and Bowie intentionally played the scene for irony. Their duet sounds sincere, even compassionate. If there is any antagonism apparent, it doesn???t happen onscreen. And if it does, we should ask ourselves, ???Did we impose it????Because why not cast a hairy eyeball at the original meeting? It???s easier than enjoying it and it evokes the same dichotomy that divides Christmas music; sincere Christmas music stirs an emotional response, insincere Christmas music is an easy target for cynicism. It???s difficult and uncomfortable to acknowledge that there might be some bit of nostalgia that puts us in a place where we have to reconcile our attitude towards Christmas. The natural defense is to deride it, pushing it out of the realm of the sincere and into the realm of the hypocritical. Bowie and Bing embody such a notion; what seems laughable can often be sincere and what seems perfunctory can serve a greater purpose.Just like A Charlie Brown Christmas, this scene, this song, is a cultural staple of Christmas, a building block for our collective Christmas memories; one more of those shared nostalgic experiences. But the subsequent death of Bing imbues this scene with a stark significance. His death marked a soft end to Baby Boomer Christmas nostalgia. As the calendar flipped from the ???70s to the ???80s, no living artist held up the foundation vacated by Bing. No one picked up where his legacy of Christmas left off. And I doubt anyone ever can.- -1  David Buckley (1999) Strange Fascination ???

He sees over a 100 more shades of orange than the average person and his eyesight is like a combination of an eagle???s and the Six Million Dollar Man???s.""Dr. Beatrix Underhaul, Urologist???Mr. Trump???s pee stream is rivaled only by Niagara Falls for its sheer force and beauty. This past summer he used his gift to simultaneously power-wash our deck and ward off a pack of coyotes that were attracted to his pungent, virile odor. Take my word for it, people: Mr. Trump???s urinary tract is nothing short of fabulous.???Dr. Lou Group, Dermatologist???I often extend Mr. Trump???s remarkably problem-free appointments to gently run my hand over his glowing, supple skin so that its magical oils collect on my fingers, which I then smear on lesser patients who suffer from hideously gross afflictions like eczema, cystic acne, and cold sores. Whatever is left over I keep in vials in a secret vault hidden on the estate of one of my three vacation homes in the Hamptons, which I am 100% sure I will use to one day create a vaccine for all diseases in the known and unknown world.???Dr. Antoine Delight, Allergist???Simply standing within a 30-meter radius of Mr. Trump glorious, full-bodied, 100%-real head of hair will eradicate all allergy sufferers??? symptoms.

Believe me when I tell you, it???s pretty unbelievable what Mr. Trump???s hair can do. It would make your head spin!""Choosing the right doctor can be a daunting task. That???s why the American Medical Association has prepared a standard list of questions for patients to ask before any first consultation. Capable physicians should be able to answer these questions calmly and professionally, ensuring not only expert medical advice but peace of mind as well.What is your opinion of vaccines and autism?And to be clear, let???s say you???re asked this question in a public setting; for instance, one that includes people who get the bulk of their news from shared posts on Facebook. Are you going to knock this one out of the park (as one would expect any doctor to)? Or is",100
359," it going to be more like a reach on a throwing error, because these people have money and love to throw it at some crazy shit?Speaking of crazy shit, are you a published author, and do you have office hours during your surprise book tours?Would you characterize yourself as a ???based on a true story??? sort of author or more an ???inspired by actual events??? sort?Similarly, where do you stand on proof? Just in general. Are you ???pro-proof??? or ???anti-proof????And allow me to explain that last one. Let???s say you???ve taken a scan of me called an MRI, which we can think of as a kind of ???visual biography??? of the brain. And let???s also say you tell me about some disturbing aspects of this ???biography??? ??? with the qualifier that such is the nature of some biographies and that the point is always the potential to heal. If I then ask to see this MRI ??? you know, evidence of the narrative you were just reciting ??? would you show it to me, taking great care to explain what it is I???m seeing? Or would you go off on some half-baked rant about the audacity of anyone daring to question The Great and Powerful Oz? And that???s a complicated question for some, I know. So, let me repeat it to you for, like, the 500th time.Moving on, have you ever worked for a maker of dietary supplements?I know you said ???no??? to that last one. But let me just make sure I have this correct: At any time has a company that makes cures ???they??? don???t want you to know about handed over a check and in return expected you to do something? For instance, give a speech or appear in a video or, you know, show up and do work for them?If I handed you a six-figure check right now and asked you to publicly suggest, though not directly state, that ???farts cure cancer,??? would you? And, if this makes it any easier, we can say it???s a ???natural??? cure; even call them ???methane nutrients.???How do you normally communicate important medical information to your patients? For instance, should the curvature of my vertebrae concern you, would you communicate those concerns in a calm, rational manner? Or would you declare that I display the worst spine since ???Chamberlain in Munich????Same question, only here it???s about a biopsy that???s the worst thing you???ve seen since ???slavery gay married 9/11.???And that brings me to my next question: Let???s say we engage in some typical doctor-patient small-talk; for instance, about some friends of mine about to marry. And let???s also say their names are Greg and Jeff and that I need suggestions for a wedding gift. Are you more likely to suggest I get Greg and Jeff ???a cutting board???? Or would it be more like ???a Bible with Leviticus highlighted????Same question, only the names are Muhammad and Nadia and the choices are ???monogrammed napkins??? and the Book of Revelation. No other books of the Bible. Just Revelation.Would you say you have a good bedside manner and sense of humor? For instance, let???s say you force a conversation about the one time you were in the Middle East and, maybe you mispronounce a few of the names you learned over there and, me being a bit of a jokester, I repeat one of those names back to you exactly the way you said it, adding, ""You know, interesting fact, they took their name from perhaps our greatest Founding Father.??? And you look at me like, ???Whuh???? And I go, ???Yeah. You know???? Hamas Jefferson???? You???d find that funny, right?The bulk of medical research would suggest a person run away from bullets during a mass shooting: Agree or Disagree?You remember that old commercial where the actor says, ???I???m not a doctor, but I play one on TV??? ??? and for some reason people were ready, willing and able to believe a guy who, no doubt he had a lot of training in his chosen field, was nevertheless going on TV to spout a lot of things he definitely wasn???t read in on and were outside his professional wheelhouse (and, basically, because marketers know that consumers implicitly trust someone labeled ???a doctor???)? No question here, just wondering if you remember that.Oh, I do have one more question before I decide to make an appointment, and I probably should have asked it first: Do you take Obamacare?SYRACUSE, NEW YORK ??? Forty-six-year-old Caterpillar Carle (stage name: CeeCee) died today in their dressing room at the Sir, J???acuse! underground cabaret-style nightclub where they performed regularly. While the cause of death is still unknown, fellow dancer Brown Bear (who refused to give any but her stage name) said she???d seen ???CeeCee just goin into her room like normal.???Carle was born in Syracuse, but moved away early on in puberty when their parents believed that the the young Carle was gaining too much weight too quickly. Indeed, pictures from Carle???s graphic autobiography (which is rumored to have been ghost written by Alison Bechdel) depict Carle eating fruit as ravenously as candy and sweets. The text above these illustrations reads: ???I was very hungry all the time and it wasn???t the last time I would feel that way.???Though assigned female at birth, when Carle and their parents moved to Germany, they began to move in the Berlin gay club scene where they were exposed not only to sex and sexuality preferences, but where they came to see men and women who acted and presented as other than their apparent gender was ???supposed to.??? Carle snuck out many nights, dressed in punk clothing and dyed-green hair, green eye-shadow, and green-painted nails. They came to be known for these signature colors.In 1989, Carle was part of the massive crowd that participated in the tearing down of the Berlin Wall. By then, their signature punk dress rendered them mostly androgynous, especially as with their weight they were able to mask their breasts without needing to resort to binding them (which they had tried to do, according to a scene in their autobiography, and had failed because it was simply too painful). They are in some of the famous photos and video recordings of that day, possible to find amidst the crowds.It wasn???t until Carle moved to the United States, to New York City, that they began to understand more about gender theory. They became involved in trans activism and were crusaders of the movement towards reclaiming the word ???fat??? to make it non-derogatory. During the ???90s, Carle met and consorted with some of the now famous activists of the day: the late Leslie Feinberg, Minnie Bruce Pratt, and Kylar Broadus among others.Despite their parents??? objections, and later disownment, Carle came out as a transman in the late ???90s, and had to go through a series of what they described as ???humiliating, belittling, and sneering??? sessions with two psychiatrists in order to be diagnosed with ???true body dysmorphia??? (again, from Carle???s autobiography) which allowed them to receive a prescription for ongoing hormone treatment, part of what, for lack of a better term, they described as their medical transition. They also went through the grueling process of finding a surgeon who would perform a mastectomy, and they declared themselves happily breast-free in 2002.However, as Carle continued to take their testosterone, their weight rose exponentially to the point of ill health. They began to suffer sleep apnea and joint pains. As a result, they had to stop hormone treatment as it was clearly having a damaging effect on their body.It was after this life-changing news that Carle began to identify as genderqueer or a-gender (they used both terms interchangeable to the chagrin of some) and began using gender-neutral pronouns rather than the early-in-life she/her and the later in life he/",100
360,"him. Carle???s explanation for their renouncement of themselves as a transman in their autobiography is shown in a series of painful illustrations of their body seeming to get wrapped up in a cocoon of words and ideas, lines of theory and quotes from newspaper articles binding them all up into a closed shell from which they couldn???t escape. When coming out as genderqueer and identifying with neither gender in the last panel of the chapter, Carle emerges as a butterfly, free of societal expectations.Soon after, Carle moved back to their hometown, Syracuse, and became alternately a drag-king and drag-queen for various underground burlesque performances. In recent years, they were the resident performer at Sir, J???accuse! and made their living off their graphic autobiography as well as speaking engagements regarding fat positivity, body and gender theory, and burlesque workshops. ???We???ll miss CeeCee,??? the club???s owner said tearfully. ???They were our crown butterflying jewel.???Would I raise the minimum wage if I???m elected? Well, when I was growing up, my family didn???t have a whole lot of money. I mean almost none. We lived inside of a Sears refrigerator box. To make ends meet, Daddy collected lint from laundromat dryers and rolled it into little balls that he would sell door-to-door to wealthy cat owners. Daddy could usually earn an extra penny or two if he agreed to spread the lint over his naked legs and let the cats paw it off him. He would come home  covered in scratches and smelling like cat urine, but he never complained. Not once. Daddy kept his head down and worked hard. He knew that in other countries you couldn???t make a living just by letting house cats claw your flesh for sport.I don???t mean to say we had it easy. Our box could get pretty cold during ice storms. But Daddy never stopped believing in the promise of this great country. At night it was sometimes hard to sleep because he would always be chanting ???U-S-A! U-S-A!??? over at his end of the box. Mom would tell him to hush, and he would, but if you listened close enough you could still hear him whispering the Pledge of Allegiance long into the night.That was the thing about Daddy: Where other people saw obstacles, he saw opportunity. When his hunger left him so weak and skinny he no longer had the strength to scrape the lint from the dryers, he realized he could be useful to emergency teams that need to send people down narrow holes that no non-starving person would ever fit into. The next thing we knew, they were lowering Daddy down a hole in Montana in search of some lost miners. Well, I guess Daddy wasn???t quite skinny enough because he got stuck halfway down and they had to wait  a couple of days until he lost a few more pounds. Daddy told us he got through it by reciting the Bill of Rights over and over in his head.Was Daddy upset that the miners he located were in a pretty bad way down there and had made a decision to kill and eat him shortly before they were rescued? Not in the least. He was just thrilled to have a solid job. He wasn???t even interested in the fame that probably would have come his way had they not forgotten about Daddy amidst all the post-rescue celebrations and left him down there in the mine ??? where he remained for a full 72 hours until the local sheriff was like, ???Oh shit!???By then everyone had forgotten about what Daddy had done for the miners ??? or, that is, everyone except that one miner who attacked Daddy with a 2??4  for fear he might say something about the whole ???trying to eat him??? business. But, to Daddy, that was all part of a good day???s work. It was going to take a lot more than permanent damage to his spinal column to keep him from living his dreams. Based on the look in his eyes when he limped back to our refrigerator box, you would have thought Daddy had just won the lottery. So what he if he also had a horrible hacking cough from all those hours in the mine. Daddy told us he was happy to be coughing for most of the day because in other countries people had even worse coughs ??? and even more open wounds!No sir, Daddy wasn???t about to give in just because of a cough that would often cause him to drop to his knees and convulse for 15-to-20 minutes at a clip. The very next day, he went right back to looking for work. And you can bet he would have found another job had he not passed out after an especially bad coughing fit and landed on that 90-year-old woman and been convicted of sexual assault.I???ll never forget the smile on Daddy???s face when we???d visit him in prison. At least, we thought it was a smile. The other prisoners would beat Daddy pretty bad, and so it was sort of hard to tell if he was smiling or wincing in agony. In any case, Daddy said the beatings were a good thing because afterwards his grotesquely swollen body would be red, white, and blue ??? just like the flag pin he always wore on his prison uniform.I was still a kid then, and I didn???t understand. I asked Daddy why there weren???t any stars on his body flag. Daddy said it was okay because he would see stars while his cellmates were pummeling him.I sure do wish I???d had the chance to say goodbye to Daddy before he was tasered to death by that hungover prison guard. (I guess some men can only listen to another man sing ???You???re a Grand Old Flag??? so many times.) But I???ll never forget the valuable lessons he taught me.And so, no, in answer to your question, I would not raise the minimum wage.1. I Just Want to Be Where You Are2. I Need You More3.

People spend way too much time on their trampolines. I remember when we used to have actual conversations. Families once had a single trampoline for the home, which everyone shared. It was kept in the backyard. Now everyone has their own personal, smaller trampoline, which they take with them everywhere they go. You meet someone for coffee and they bring along their trampoline. They won???t even make eye contact. They???re too concerned with whatever???s happening on their trampoline. Trampolines were supposed to bring us closer together, but I think they???re driving us further apart.Take last night, for example. It was my birthday and some friends and I gathered at a pub to celebrate. It was a beautiful night and we wanted to sit outside, but there wasn???t any room for us ??? a table of five had their trampolines with them, cluttering the patio. Regardless, we found a spot inside and things actually started out great. My friends arrived, we ordered drinks, we laughed about old times. I opened gifts ??? Suzie got me a trampoline cover with my initials embroidered on it. After a while, however, I realized that nobody was talking. They were all on their trampolines. My friends wouldn???t even look at the server when he came by, instead mumbling their orders mid-bounce. How rude, I thought. And then I looked around the room: everyone was focused on their trampolines. The entire bar was mindlessly leaping, spilling their drinks, and ducking mid-air so their heads wouldn???t hit the ceiling. Even one of the servers was fixated on a small trampoline she kept behind the bar, change rattling in her apron as she ignored the customers.It???s not just social activities. Trampolines are beginning to affect my work. I???m a college professor and you wouldn???t believe these kids and ",100
361,"their trampolines. For a while, I couldn???t hear my own voice deliver the lecture over the sound of squeaking trampoline springs. I instituted a ???No Trampolines in the Classroom??? rule, but half the class still tries to sneak them in. They think I won???t notice if they bounce quietly, but I do. If I catch a student twirling through the air at the back of the class, it???s a safe bet they???re using a trampoline.Everything???s changed. Nobody lives in the moment anymore. A few weeks ago, I went to a U2 concert. Remember when crowds used to raise their lighters during a ballad? Now everyone holds up their trampolines. I couldn???t see the stage during ???Where the Streets Have No Name.??? Even Bono had a little trampoline next to his mic stand for between-song hand springs.It???s impacting my home life, too. My wife and I had to ban trampolines at the dinner table. The kids were upset at first, but they???ve come around. Family meals should be a time for everyone to gather together and discuss their lives, not acrobatic free-for-alls. Plus it???s a choking hazard.People aren???t paying attention to the world around them. It???s dangerous. The other day, I almost hit someone with my car. A man had his trampoline out in the middle of an intersection. There he was, mindlessly jumping up and down, completely unaware of the oncoming traffic. Luckily, I hit the brakes in time. Was this guy???s backflip so important he couldn???t wait until he???d crossed the road?Now listen, I???m no Luddite. I???ll be lined up outside the trampoline store with everyone else when the new trampoline is released. I see the positives. When my wife is walking home from work, I feel more secure knowing that she has her trampoline with her. That if someone were to attack her, she could quickly set up her trampoline and leap to safety. And it???s definitely comforting to know my grandparents have trampolines with them, in case they take a fall. Instead of lying helpless on the kitchen floor for hours, they???ll bounce right back up. I won???t deny that advancements in trampoline technology have brought a lot of good to our lives.I just think we need to cut back, significantly. Spend less time on our trampolines. Really engage with our surroundings. I saw this thing where an artist put together a series of photographs of people going about their day, except he removed all of the trampolines. A family having a picnic on the beach, a young couple in bed, commuters on the subway, etc. With their trampolines photoshopped out, these people look sad and ridiculous. There they are, inexplicably soaring through the air, oblivious to the fact that they are seconds away from falling to the ground. We are these people. We are falling. And one day our precious trampolines won???t be there to catch us.You can???t get a good bagel in California.Why are there no good birds in Missouri?Alabama has a lot of stuff, but you can???t find a good shopping mall hot dog.There are never any good picnics in South Dakota.There are no good bubble baths in New Mexico.Why are there no good donkeys in Oregon?It???s impossible to get a good linen trouser in Idaho.There are no good pencil sharpeners in Oklahoma.You can not find a good telephone in New Hampshire.Where can you get a good cup of coffee in Arizona?

I blame the Internet, ultimately.On this day, we remember the victory of the Maccabean forces in Judea and celebrate the miracle of the oil, which lasted longer than it should have, just like our marriage.It should have been a terse and temporary shining of light upon our lives, a brilliant flame snuffed out by circumstance to cast us once more into darkness. But miraculously, the oil continued to burn and our marriage continues though I despise you and your family.Fire is not only a symbol of life. It is deadly. Rather than a beautiful menorah, nine prongs penetrating the heavy air, our marriage is a dumpster fire, the boots burning for years beyond their countenance, with nothing at all being penetrated. The rats nibble on the burning boxes and are in turn set aflame, spreading diseased fire beyond the scope of the trash pile.You are the rats and the boot and the boxes. Our marriage is the fire. The dumpster, I think, might be Chanukah.The overbearing oppression you and this marriage have foisted upon me is much like that of the Seleucids upon Judea. We are exiled (the Jews to the North, I to a basement ???workshop,??? where I can read and masturbate in peace). My love for you once burned as bright as that of the Maccabees for their oppressed homeland. Now it languors in hell, a vitriol like that of current day college students for this very same land. Have they ever been there? What do they know of internal affairs or history, with their coddling professors and youth? What I mean to say is we???ve grown apart.The oil lasted longer than expected, and our marriage is also encumbered by false expectations. For example, my parents thought we???d be divorced in a week. Perhaps they had consulted the Zohar and learned of the conflict in what is and what must be. When studying Kabbalah, I found myself drawing from my innermost soul on the pages containing the Tree of Life. These meditations on the Zohar reveal mystic prophecies, and as you will see, I have drawn a stick figure of you with an underlined caption reading ???jerk.???Your parents, meanwhile, expected children. Your Dad asks w",100
362,"hen we are going to have kids, which I think is his way of propagating the Jewish bloodlines for ethnocentric reasons. Though I would proudly help to extend the line, I can???t allow your taint to tarnish it. Just as the Tree of Life must be pruned of dead and diseased branches, so must the gene pool of the Jews. Don???t get me wrong; your family is just a little more Schwartz than Cohen, if you know what I mean.The miracle of our lives is that instead of burning out quickly, our marriage decayed for eight years, serving only to inflame our passion (in the way that rashes are inflamed). It is likely that, in this moment, you feel how Antiochus did: threatened, betrayed by the unexpected revolt of your subject. I???ve been Hellenized, and I???m not gonna take it anymore.And just like the Hellenizers, you???ve forced your culture upon me. My daily life, my habits, everything I knew, has been altered to fit your worldview. My menorah is no longer made of wolf bone, because that was ???cruel.??? All I wanted to do yesterday was play computer games, but you made me go to Shul. Also I???m sleeping with our neighbor Helen.And so you see why Chanukah is thematically apposite for this discussion.  Also I???m a little drunk because I drank all the Manischewitz, which was the only way to get the taste of your mother???s too-greasy latkes out of my mouth. In a sense, I???ve used this holy wine to wash away not only the latkes, but the corrupting influence of our cold marriage. As a side note, Helen somehow managed to make dreidels erotic.Oh, here is your present. I have decided to only give you presents for four out of the eight days in order to express how you have halved my expectations for the possibility of happiness in this life. Happiest of happy Chanukahs to you, and I pray to Hashem that your dreidel lands primarily on Gimel and never on Nun so that you may grow rich in chocolate coins. Just don???t deposit them in our joint bank account, which I will be closing tomorrow.Portrait by Kelly Bjork- -Natalie was actually the first to call the cops, not Ryder. One afternoon, I meet Natalie at a neighboring bar where she bartends in addition to The Twilight Exit. I wait until she finishes her shift, and then we sit at a wooden booth to talk. Natalie???s in her late 20s and has vivid eyeshadow and wavy black hair, with a chunk of bangs dyed candy green. I don???t know her super well, but she???s always come off as cool and fun. She gives off the vibe of someone you???d want to stay up with all night, playing Ping-Pong in your neighbor???s basement.Natalie had seen James and Whitney together in the evening before the shooting. ???I was bartending,??? she said. ???I work a double on Sundays, so I???d started at five. They had their baby in the bar with them. They were with an older child too, and an adult couple. They all eventually left, and none of it was memorable. I just know they didn???t look like they were having any arguments or problems about anything.???Whitney returned by herself about an hour later. ???I was at the bar ???til the shift-change. Starting at nine, I bar back. If it???s not busy enough for me to be on the floor, I take a break,??? said Natalie. ???That night wasn???t busy, so I was on break, sitting at the bar. That???s when Whitney came in. She seemed distraught. She asked if she could use my charger because her phone wouldn???t turn on, so I let her borrow my charger and my phone,??? Natalie said. This sounds like an awkward position for Natalie to be in, but it wasn???t. ???I didn???t mind. I kind of knew her and James as regulars, and I???d watched their baby for my other job at the YMCA,??? she said.Whitney sat on a stool at the bar and spoke quietly on the cell. ???From where I was, I could hear pieces of her conversation,??? said Natalie. ???I assumed she was talking to her mother or maybe a close friend. She was venting. I heard her say James was going crazy and they were fighting. She was saying, ???Yeah, he flipped out. I don???t know what I???m gonna do. I???m trying to think.??? She???d made a couple more calls, asking friends to come get her, and then I heard her call a cab. I???m pretty sure she???d talked to James too. She told him where she was and said ???Yeah, you can come down here.??????Not long after, James showed up and approached Whitney. ???He was like, ???You need to get out of here, we need to go home.??? She didn???t want to. They got into a bit of a scuffle. She was like, ???Get off me.??? She was struggling to get back onto her stool. I guess he pulled her hair. He was trying to snatch her ponytail and cave-man her out of the bar,??? said Natalie.(My memory of this interaction is a little different than Natalie???s version, but I???ll get to that description later.)???I jumped up and so did a couple other customers. Greg separated Whitney and James and walked him outside. Whitney stayed where she was. She was saying she didn???t know who James was, that she???d never seen him before, that he was a crazy person. I just sat there listening to it all. I was like, ???I???ll stay out of it, I???ll let her tell her story.??? But at the same time I was thinking, ???Are you out of your mind as well? Because you know that I know you guys are together. I know you guys have a kid. Exactly what are you trying to pull??????????That was the second or third altercation they???d had in the bar, and it was unacceptable. I couldn???t have them keep coming in and fighting like that. When Greg came back inside, I told him and my other coworker, ???I am done. I am washing my hands.??? At that point, we all agreed we were gonna 86 them. The plan was, Greg was going to talk to James, and I was going to deal with Whitney. I thought it???d be better if I waited to bring it up to her until she was leaving.???Things quickly returned to normal. ???I stayed seated at the bar and maybe fifteen or twenty minutes passed. Then I got up to have a cigarette, because I still wasn???t needed for work. I didn???t think anything of it. I opened the front door, then I saw James outside, trying to get into the bar. Greg said over his shoulder, ???Go call 911 right now,??? and he kind of shoved me. I shut the door, and I turned around, and as I was moving towards the house phone, I heard the gun go off.??????I grabbed the phone and dialed 911. I screamed out to everyone, something like, ???Get the fuck out, he just shot Greg!??? I saw James enter the bar. He had the gun in his hand, there was smoke coming off. I could smell it. That???s the most vivid memory I have, the smell of gunpowder. And blood. It smelled like blood.(If this sounds like an exaggeration, it???s not. In large volumes, blood emits a powerful metallic odor, and Greg had already spilled several pints.)Phone in hand, Natalie grabbed her other coworker from the bar, then ran back through the kitchen and got Jake, the house cook, before rushing to the patio.???There was another person who somehow ended up with us too. Maybe the gunshots were happening right as he was coming out of the bathroom. He was some random customer. A white guy in his early 20s. He wore fairy wings and lots of glitter. I think there was some weird birthday party going on. I???m pretty sure he was on Ecstasy. He was just so far removed. He shot past Jake, and then he was, like, bouncing around the kitchen. When we got to the patio, he tried a couple times to jump over the fence, but it was too tall, and he couldn???t make it,??? said Natalie.In a separate interview, Jake said basically the same thing. ???He seemed kind of high, the dude with us. Or he might???ve just been really, really freaked out. He had fairy wings on. He w",100
363,"ore glasses. I think he???d gotten caught between the shooter and the kitchen. He really wanted to jump over the patio???s fence.???The back patio at the Twilight has lots of slatted wood and haphazard sea-themed decor, and a sturdy fence fully encases the perimeter. While there are no obvious exits, a closet-sized storage space tucked into a corner offered a little protection. The ???hidey-hole,??? as Natalie calls it, is secured by a wooden gate that latches shut. As they closed themselves inside, ???the four of us were hugging ??? my two coworkers and the fairy dude,??? said Natalie. ???I was down in the middle of it. We were trying to be really quiet. We knew I needed to be on the phone, but we didn???t know what was going on. I heard a gunshot, and I thought James was shooting up the bar. Everyone was trying to muffle my voice and the sound of the operator. I was trying to talk. I was trying not to cry. Jake was literally holding me up. He had his arms around my shoulders. He was squeezing me really tight. I was shaking so bad I could barely stand up.???- -Back patio hiding spot.Holographic dick3D printer printed dickDick pixDick PowerPointDick ASCII artDick faxDick PolaroidEtch-a-Sketch-a-dickNixon campaign poster (annotated)Play Doh penisPhoto Booth dick stripPaint by Number surpriseDick mimeographSepia toned dick stereoscopic imagesDick tintypeWhittled poplar dick (Side note: whittling dicks was common among civil war era soldiers; some historians believe the phrase ???Whistling Dixie??? originated as a euphemism for the practice.)Dick daguerreotypeDick crop circlesDick calligraphyUncircumcised totem poleDick oil on canvasDick origamiDick Mandala sand paintingWoven dick tapestryPapier-m??ch?? dickDick lacquerwareHieroglyphdickPhallus formed from the sinews and pelts of small woodland mammalsDick rubbingAnatomically correct terra cotta warriorIron dickBronze dickDick mud castingDick cairnDick cave paintingSnake on a stickDuring the first kissShe???s done a good job here above her upper lip. Does she bleach or tweeze or thread, I wonder? Or is this a laser job? Can you believe they can actually destroy the roots with strong beams of light? Science! Wait a minute ??? I can see some foundation caught in the whitened hair. Definitely a bleacher. That???s cool. I???m not a fascist or anything. As long as I can pretend that she doesn???t have any hair there, I???m totally ok with that. This is making me feel good after what happened at work today.During the French kissI???m really enjoying the shape of her eyebrows. She doesn???t over-pluck like Marlene Dietrich or go too bushy like Keira Knightly. Just the perfect amount of eyebrow pencil and not too much of an arch either ??? she???s made it look so natural even though she???s clearly applied some gel and used a spoolie to even out the color. This is just really turning me on. I can???t even remember what Doug said to me about fucking up the Watkins account.During foreplayShit. What???s that hair doing on her knee? She missed a spot. I can???t believe it! How hard could it be to shave every strand of hair from your knee? Maybe she doesn???t even use a razor. Maybe she???s bought one of those torture contraptions that removes the hair at the follicle level because she thinks she can get away with not shaving every day. What a cheat. And that one solitary hair is so ugly. What a turnoff. Why is this taking her so long? How the hell was I supposed to know that Fred Watkins cancelled his stop-loss order? Am I going to get fired?During intercourseOh God. Absolutely no pigment spotting on her upper thigh. Wow, she must be so serious not to even use a depilatory. Oh yeah, electrolysis is so fucking hot, that oh yeah, that needle injecting those micro pulses of electricity into her skin. I feel so good and I???m sure that she, oh yes, yes, that she only uses professional electrologists accredited by the American Electrology Association and, oh sweet Jane, that makes me feel so fucking good. There is no Fred Watkins or Doug or money or fear of being penniless and dying alone in this beautiful hairless universe.During orgasmOh, oh, oh, oh, oh, thin bikini-line strip, oh my God, she???s done the perfect sculpting job down here and oh shit, it must have hurt so much because the bulb of the vaginal hair is larger than the pore it was yanked from but oh yes, I???ve heard women cry but just having that strip of hair instead of the full bush is making everything right with the world whereas I would have never been able to get to this stage of arousal with a normal amount of pubic hair and I???m transcending time and space because there are no ingrowns or bumps or redness which means she???s probably exfoliated the area before waxing and applied a calming cream which is so sensible of her and oh yeah, yeah, yeah, and she???s also bought a pricey serum for afterwards and this woman is saving my life by giving me this perfect moment of grace because she spends a half hour of her life every week spreading her legs and lying on her back in a butterfly position so some stranger can spread hot wax on the most sensitive spot on her body and then pull the strip off like a bandaid or if she???s lucky she only has to do it every two weeks and, yes yes yes yes yes yes YES YES YES YES she does it even though it increases her risk of STIs AAAAHHHHHGGGgghgggslllmmhhh???1. Last night you smoked pot after your parents went to bed and ate an entire key lime pie while sitting on the warm cement of the driveway looking up at the stars. Your mom is going to be really mad, and your only plan is to try to convince her that she never bought the pie in the first place and that she is slowly losing her mind.2. You play mostly 21-and-under events in community centers. You are the bass player. None of you, except the keyboardist, who is the guitar player???s possibly autistic cousin, likes Goth music, but its what the people want. In fact, several twelve-year-old girls have crushes on you and you use this to comfort yourself when you feel out of place in your high school where everyone assumes you are Mexican.3. Your favorite band is Black Flag and you wish more people wanted to have a conversation with you about it.4. You don???t like the fresh taste after brushing your teeth. You prefer the soft, warm, yeasty feel of your mouth in its natural state and so you delay brushing your teeth in the morning as long as you possibly can.5. The only way to make yourself go to school is by promising yourself that you can buy an energy drink from the 7-11 across the street during lunch.  The Korean lady who always works the register knows you and teases you gently in a way that makes you feel grown up. It is the best part of the day.6. You only have crushes on girls who will never in one million years be interested in you. Your friends encourage you to be more realistic, but your pining for these pretty, popular girls is intense and all-consuming. It is a vocation of sorts.7. You can hear your little sister masturbating at night through the wall and it creeps you out really bad. She has been doing it since she was eleven and you are convinced there is something really wrong with her, but otherwise she is completely normal and your parents like her better than you.8. Your black beanie fell in a puddle of rain water the other day and you wore it anyway, and it made you feel cool, so you kept asking people to touch your hat all day, and then laughing hysterically when they recoiled from the wet, muddy wool.Remove your cap and bow your head Iowans, for it is I, Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack. As mandated by the arcane and unruly spirits of the earth and by th",100
364,"e Statutes of my Department, I have come to bless your harvest, as I do each year, forever and ever, until the end of the fiscal year.  I am wise, I am forgiving, I am Tom Vilsack.You have worked hard. Your federal government has noticed. I have read the sacred forms you sent. I have taken notice of your updates on farm.ewg.org. I have kept you close to me, though many miles keep us apart. You are always in my heart. I am your Secretary of Agriculture and you are my farmers. I care about you and your crops. These are the ancient words uttered here during each harvest by the Secretary of Agriculture.As is the yearly custom, you have erected a gazebo in the DMV parking lot where I administer my rites. Iowans, gather to me your tools, your farming implements, your children and your laborers that I may lay hands on them and bestow upon them the strength, fortitude and conviction of the Federal Government.I was appointed by President Barack Obama to attend to the agricultural needs of the nation. I oversee the forests and the grasslands, I oversee the safety of food production. I oversee the food stamps program. From my hand issues form ???DDI ??? 17: Dealer Notice to Dairy Farmer of Intent to Stop Purchasing Milk.??? And the same hand may take it away. I provide guidance and wisdom. So it has always been. So it will forever be, until the end of the fiscal year.Gaze upon me, and know that it is I. I wear the sacred robes woven by the Brothers of the Brooks. Upon it I wear the flag lapel pin, that you might know my heart is pure. Behold my calf-hide work gloves. They are mine. Passed down by generations of Secretaries of Agriculture since the federal work programs of the ???30s and ???40s. Behold my federal scythe. It is mine. Forged in the long dormant factories of Detroit. Sharpened by the Vice-Presidential whetstone each summer under a waning moon. Gaze on these United States Government issued objects and know that it is truly me, your Secretary. I am wise, I am forgiving, I am Tom Vilsack.This thresher, whose is it? You sir, bespeckled and downcast, your soft body swathed in flannels and Carharts. Raise your eyes and face me, for your salvation is at hand. Repeat and be blessed by your appointed official: ???I am of sound mind and sound heart. My intentions are pure. I am the sickle of Lady Liberty. I know it is the Founding Fathers who guide my plow. I know my swine grow fat on patriotism. I will grow and harvest for the American federal government and for no other governments. Should I grow crops for any foreign bodies, may my fruits, vegetables and grains wither and die on the vine. ??? So say I, your Secretary of Agriculture, Tom Vilsack.And to the thresher, I say this: may it separate grains from chaff and stalks and husks swiftly, as cars and trucks are carried down the many roads of Eisenhower???s National highway program. May its blades never catch a rock. May it meet all emissions standards, to be evaluated each year. May it drive true under both Democratic and Republican administrations, smiled upon by both the Donkey and the Elephant.You sir, what are you holding there? Please pass it forward to Bruce I. Knight, the Under Secretary of Agriculture from Marketing and Regulatory Programs. Ah, yes. A cob of corn. Thank you.I bind this cob before you. It wrap it in a cloak of the Washington Post, honorable trumpet of DC since 1877. In this princely garb I will transport this cob and it will be prepared in a healthy meal for the First Family. Should it be to their liking, it will be the omen of a robust harvest and the flowing forth of many subsidies from my oaken desk, may it stand forever and ever. But take heed, Iowans, should the Obamas dislike the cob, it will be fed to their dog Bo, or to their Senate Minority Leader, Harry Reid. And this will be a dark omen. And you, Iowans, should gird yourselves for a woeful year.I must return now, to the land of 1,000 speeches, Washington DC. But hearken for me each night as you lay down to sleep, for I am there always, pledging allegiance in your fields, in your orchards, in your slaughterhouses and in your hearts.I give my life to you, here under the heat of the sun, here above the heat of the parking lot tarmac. Know this: Should your harvests fail, I will return with the proper forms and lay myself down in your fields. I will sacrifice myself, opening my own veins so that my blood will flow in the furrows and cleanse the soil. Such is my duty, and so it shall be, forever, until the end of the fiscal year.For I am wise, I am forgiving, I am Tom Vilsack.???Nihar! Long time no see. Yeah, job is OK. We don???t all get to pursue our dreams. Just messing with you, dude. Speaking of??? have you seen Master of None on Netflix? Isn???t it ah-mazing? I called in sick for a day last week and binged the whole thing. I thought about you, especially the episode where Aziz Ansari learned there could only be one Indian on a TV show, not two. Hilarious! OK, not hilarious, but was refreshing to see that discussed. It felt important for where we are as a culture. I mean, I don???t think the show is a gift from the comedy Gods like Louie or anything. Louie is??? wow, a masterpiece. Gotta run, good to see you.??????Yeah man, great to see you too. Hope the job gets better!???- -???Sorry, spaced out there for a sec. Quieting screaming kids is nothing short of impossible. Starting to question if I made the right choice to have a family, you know? Speaking of??? have you seen Master of None? Aziz Ansari deftly navigates the complexity of major life decisions that even I as a woman in my forties grapple with. Oh, I???m not asking because you???re Indian. It just came to mind randomly as I was looking at your face. If I can be completely honest though, I had some issues with the show. It???s not like I didn???t want to like it. Just was expecting it to be punchier, like The Mindy Project. I didn???t mention that because Mindy Kaling is Indian by the way. Does that answer your question???????I guess. So are you parking or leaving? I???ve seriously driven around this block three times looking for a space.???- -???Quick question, Nihar is it? I know we just met but you have an Indian-sounding name and, well??? have you seen Master of None? Can I just say it???s pretty much the only thing I???m watching right now. Especially the stuff about being a post-millennial actor and trying to balance acting work you???re passionate about but also pay the rent. That scene in the coffee shop when Aziz Ansari is auditioning via Skype. Fricking hysterical. Overall though, I felt that the show could???ve really pushed the envelope more comedically, like say Girls. I follow Lena Dunham on Instagram, she???s such an iconoclast on there too. What were we talking about before this???????I asked is it extra for whipped cream in my Peppermint Frappucino.???- -???I???ve been dying to ask you??? have you seen Master of None? One night I figured why not give it a try. I cried I was so happy. After all these years minorities are finally telling their stories on screen. I loved the parents episode??? how the Aziz Ansari character came to see his father???s sacrifices in a new light. My one criticism was I was expecting it to be zanier. Like his character from Parks and Recreation. I feel like on this show they left a lot of jokes on the table. Oh, and I???m not just asking you about this because you???re Indian.??????I know, Dad. So what did the cardiologist say? Stent or bypass surgery????- -???OMG have you seen Master of None? When I saw you in the bar tonight, I was all I have to find out what this guy thinks about it. No not because you???re Indian, silly. When I ",100
365,"first heard about it I was like yes! Finally, this comedic genius gets his own show. And it turns out, ironically, it???s like not even that funny. Though I guess we should???ve seen it coming because Aziz Ansari???s book Modern Romance wasn???t that funny either. It was a lot of data science. Which is fine, I got a lot out of it. I was just expecting more Albert Brooks??? Modern Romance. Highly recommend that if you wanna see a funny take on dating and life. Wait, why are you getting dressed, I thought we were gonna have sex???????I should go, I have an early morning.???- -???Before we say goodbye, can I tell you that I love Master of None? I know you???ve seen it, obviously. Personally, I find the nowness of the show to not be gimmicky. Aziz Ansari is staking his claim as the voice of a generation, and he???s saying this is the future of TV. Granted, is it a game changer for streaming like House of Cards was? Obviously not. It???s nowhere near as good as that show. But it???s different for what it is. Any other questions????Yes. Will I get a partial refund because I???m canceling my Netflix in the middle of a cycle????It???s kind of awkward to ???share??? a religion with a band of killers who bomb capital cities and shoot up holiday parties in their free time.It???s not the frustrating awkwardness of falling on the school steps, or even the tragic awkwardness of wearing a denim-on-denim ensemble.It???s the kind of awkward where I actually ran away upon seeing a stack of newspapers on the sidewalk that described ISIS???s attacks on the Stade de France. (To be fair, my phone had died and I was hopelessly lost; away from the Washington Post seemed as good a direction as any.)Terrorism is a hard thing to outrun.Hardly a moment has passed since then and already there is a new group of people to grieve for, even closer to home. A new collection of xenophobic Republican statements that I must make a point to debunk before the next horror hits.You have to understand that my initial thought following these terror attacks was probably similar to yours: Oh my God, these crazy fanatical Muslim terrorists.My second thought was more like one of those dreadful realizations you have after you wake up: Wait, I am Muslim.How do I forget something like that for even a minute, you ask? I mean that???s my whole thing, right? Like, hello, loud hijabi over here, victim of general American ignorance, self-appointed educator of both students and teachers (in a gifted school, no less), butt of all misconceptions, the fabulous star in her own sitcom life, etc?Could it be possible that I, Hijabi in Plain Sight, am a secret Islamophobe?I know that terrorism has no color or creed; that the word Islam itself means ???peace;??? that the Qur???an reads: ???Whoever kills an innocent it is as if he has killed all mankind.??? And that ISIS has not only violated this basic tenet of Islam, but dozens more. (What kind of Muslim bombs a mosque? You???re not even supposed to wear your shoes in a mosque. I???ve seen someone get the stink-eye for reading the Qur???an too loudly.)Despite all these facts, every time I hear the name of my own religion ??? and it???s usually coming from the mouth of some politician who garbles the ???s??? into an omnipotent, multisyllabic ???z??? ??? I cringe. The Arabic meaning of the word bites at me like a personal mockery.Peace. That???s my religion. Literally. There are only so many times I can try and explain what the word ???jihad??? really means. There are only so many times I can try to explain the difference between a helpless refugee fleeing ISIS and an actual member of ISIS. Between beheading people and putting it up on YouTube and actually practicing Islam.Like all Americans, I have processed the Islam/terrorist association. Unlike most Americans, however, I am at once the target audience and the monster to be feared.This is an unpleasant state of being.For the first few days after the Paris attacks, I kept myself in the dark. But there was no escaping the tragedy. When I tried to look up sites on which to illegally re-watch The Mindy Project, I found myself staring at the tiny black ribbon on Google???s homepage. I tried to find humor in an episode of Saturday Night Liv only to a) be met with a Paris-related intro, and b) be reminded that Kristen Wiig was no longer part of the cast.And when I went back to school the Monday after Paris, an exceptionally nice girl came up to me and hugged me.I felt relief at first ??? she understands ??? followed by a twinge of annoyance.Now, there are many reasons for why I would like to be hugged. Surviving a weekend in rural Pennsylvania with no Wi-Fi. Consistently dropping the ball in gym class in front of a certain someone. Enduring the SAT (again) at a testing site where the sole hallway decoration was a laminated Tupac quote ??? something about dreams ??? peeling off the wall.Note that international terrorism is not on that list.The girl was being nice. But even sympathy propels me further and further away from normal, from the possibility that being American and being Muslim could someday overlap.I am 17 years old.It is crushing to think about spending an entire life shape shifting and explaining and overcompensating in a desperate attempt to prove that I???m okay. That I too am American. An entire life watching people watching me and wondering what they think, even though it is entirely possible that they don???t care at all. My grief, my anxiety, my sense of alienation and obligation cannot be resolved with a brief ???we stand with Paris??? cold-open.This column was supposed to be funny. It was supposed to be about gym class. But after the Paris attacks the plans changed. After San Bernardino they changed again.What happens tomorrow?Facebook: I like pooping on the rose bushTwitter: I???m #poopingontherosebushInstagram: Here???s a vintage photo of me pooping on the rose bushYouTube: Look at me, I???m pooping on the rose bush!Linked In: My skills include pooping on rose bushesFoursquare: This is where I come whenever I want to poop on a rose bushPinterest: Here???s a design I created using my poop and a rose bushTinder: I like pooping on rose bushes.

And I can hear purple.Jane Austen is surely one of the most read and studied female authors of all time, solidly in the canon of Western literature and therefore above my notice for a column about under-scrutinized women. Yet I still worry about our dear Jane. Is she so relevant these days that she???s actually become irrelevant?Maybe what I mean is: Do we relate to Austen???s books and characters for the wrong reasons? And would she be pissed off by the way we diminish her novels to overly simplistic love stories?Don???t get me wrong; I love romance novels. You should love them, too. It???s a legitimate genre that takes particular skill to write. Read Julia Quinn, Susan Elizabeth Phillips, Jennifer McQuiston, or Jennifer Crusie if you don???t believe me. These books are more than sappy dialogue hovering between unrealistic sex scenes. And so is Austen???s work. For their complications and nuance, many of today???s romance novels (all of the good ones, anyway) owe a debt to Jane Austen.Okay, I bet some of you are thinking: Well, I don???t love Jane Austen, either because I???ve never read her books, or because I have read them and they bore me to tears. Fair enough. You are allowed to dislike or be ignorant of Austen, and no one should judge you for that (though secretly they probably do). Nevertheless, all six of her novels have been in print since 1833 and millions of copies have sold, so clearly she is a force to be reckoned with.People think that Jane Austen wrote about love with all the drama of a woman perched on a settee in a stiff corset, waiting for something to do, pouncing on the first male she???s not closely related to and begging him to marry her. This does in fact happen in Austen???s books, but only because Austen is making fun of such women. We???re supposed to understand those characters to be ridiculous foils for the deeper, more complicated characters and stories, like Mr. Darcy???s comically bad (and yet refreshingly truthful) marriage proposal, or Wentworth???s letter that still takes our breath away, or Mr. Knightley???s (and what character in literature has had a better name than Mr. Knightley?) care and patience with the irrepressible Emma.Sigh. The truth is that Austen???s books are love stories, for sure. Widely considered the mother of the romance genre, I guess we have her to thank for the bodice rippers decorating grocery check-out aisles. But Austen primarily wrote about women and their predicaments when it came to money, relationships, and self-worth. The love part is in some ways a bonus, maybe even a distraction.People think Austen was not a feminist; some even think she???s anti-feminist. But if you believe that, it???s because Jane Austen has tricked you. She writes with such clever and sometimes subtle irony and wit that a cursory reading looks like a bunch of characters making an awkward amount of silent eye contact, leading us to miss the point.Maybe Austen wanted some readers to miss the point; maybe she had to highlight the love stories and repress the satire in order to get published at all. Northanger Abbey and Persuasion were published posthumously, but Pride and Prejudice, Emma, Sense and Sensibility, and Mansfield Park were published anonymously, saying only ???By A Lady??? (the ???lady??? part was important at the time, noting the social rank of the author and making her more acceptable than a Grub Street hack writing only for financial gain). Nevertheless, books written ???By A Lady??? could not end with young, single, independent women remaining single. Social structures and beliefs about a woman???s place at the time might have made such books shocking, and not in the way that Madonna used shock as a successful marketing tool (I know ??? the reference dates me, but I am a child of the 1980s and I get a slight thrill from putting Austen and Madonna together in a sentence, okay?). In Austen???s time, scandal suctioned itself on to sometimes relatively innocent females and could not be pried away. Had she written her books without love stories, they probably wouldn???t have sold and she might have disgraced her entire family.Still, Austen pushed all kinds of boundaries. She hid her rebellions in plain sight and must be rolling her eyes at us now for not highlighting them more often.Some examples, you say? Her best-known work is called Pride and Prejudice because Elizabeth Bennet is proud and Mr. Darcy is prejudiced. Or it might be the other way around because Austen clearly shows that women and men are equally capable of being hard headed. In Persuasion, Anne Elliot doesn???t care to be married at all if it???s not to her true love, except that her family is making her crazy and she would appreciate some escape (sound familiar in this holiday season, anyone?). And in Mansfield Park, Fanny Price???well, we don???t know exactly what???s happening with Fanny. She may be a glitch in Austen???s system of independent, flawed, female characters. But Mary Crawford picks up some of Fanny???s slack. In Sense and Sensibility, Elinor and Marianne Dashwood come through heartbreak together to find middle ground between sense and sensibility.1 In N",100
367,"orthanger Abbey, Catherine Morland lurks in passageways, blatantly seeking romance because this is also the only Austen novel that is openly satirical. And Emma Woodhouse (from the aptly named Emma) just doesn???t give a damn what anyone thinks.These are not women whose instincts are to follow rules. And the men that they come to love understand and appreciate that about them. That???s the real key to Austen???s romance. Women are not desperate for men, even when financial or social circumstances dictate that they should be. Instead, the men (those who are worthy, anyway) come to love these women because they are well-read, articulate, and intelligent.What made Austen write this way? We don???t really know.Austen???s biography is famously skeletal, likely because her family destroyed any evidence that Austen was anything other than an ideal woman. She was born in 1775 and lived her entire adult life with her mother and sister, dying in 1817 at only 41 years old. That???s what we know for sure, but it seems important to interject here that Austen had at least one significant love story of her own, accepting and then the next day rejecting the marriage proposal of one Harris Bigg-Wither. Perhaps it was his name that made her think twice. Sex and the City showed us the importance of Mr. Big, but add Wither to the name and it takes on entirely new and not-so-sexy dimensions. Fans of the Anne Hathaway film Becoming Jane will be delighted to learn that there was a Tom Lefroy in Austen???s life, but their relationship may have been overblown for the film. There also may have been ??? and for the sake of mysterious romance, let???s hope there was ??? a man in the Lyme Regis area who skirted Austen???s love life, perhaps prompting her to focus on the town in Persuasion.Even with all of this room for speculation, I don???t think that Austen wrote from anger, and I don???t think that she necessarily had a feminist agenda when she sat down to compose.2 I think she wrote about the ways in which a woman???s mind works. She wrote to have a little fun with her own society???s more ridiculous aspects. And yes, she wrote about love.So feel free to swoon over your favorite Austen hero or heroine as often as you like. Love the love stories, for they are magnificent. But when you remember Austen, consider the certainty with which she writes women, even when they are stubborn and wrong. Think about the joy and relief these female characters feel when they finally encounter male characters who care about something more than looks and money.What endures about Austen???s work are the realities of these relationships. These couples are friends who laugh at and with one another, who spar and challenge each other regularly. We connect with Austen???s work even today because of her ability to draw real relationships, and more importantly, real women. Reading a bit of Austen???s novels is perhaps like getting a glimpse of her diary, and her words resonate still because she has pushed into the core of human nature to show that both women and men are bright and beautiful and fragile and strong and flawed.- -1  In Austen???s time, ???sense??? was understood similarly to the way it is today: sanity, reasonableness. If a person had good sense, she was led more often by logic than emotion (thus it???s significant that Austen???s character, Elinor, displays consistent sense, because women of the early nineteenth century were thought to be emotional but otherwise fairly vacuous creatures, leaving reason and logic to men alone). ???Sensibility,??? in Austen???s time, was the opposite of sense: one who shows great sensibility is led by her emotions, often seen making irrational choices and fainting for no evident reason. To us, ???sense??? and ???sensibility??? sound like similar things. To Austen, they were yin and yang, or more potently, male and female. She must have disagreed with this gender divide and thus her work shows that both qualities can be exhibited by both genders.2 It???s interesting to note that the word ???feminist??? had not yet been coined in Austen???s day, though of course people had believed in and fought for equal (or at least, less unequal) rights for men and women for hundreds of years by the time Austen wrote.[Originally published December 8, 2015.]- - -A woman is born with all the exclamation points she will use in her lifetime.- -When cornered by a predator, a woman can swell to three times her normal size, but won???t because it is unladylike.- -In pre-modern times, sightings of women by sailors gave rise to myths about mermaids.

Mmm, raspberry. Sha-fuckin-zam, motherfuckers!! Time to ride.And if you can still stand by the end of the night, be sure to stay for our Hanukkah Harry gift exchange.First, be asked to babysit your five- and three-year-old nieces for the weekend. Say a tiny prayer that the weekend is booked and you can???t. Listen, you love them. Mostly because you have to, but yeah, they???re cute and all. When they???re not farting on you, which is always. There are just other ways you???d like to spend your weekend, like getting a smog check or helping someone move.See that your calendar is empty. Consider lying to your brother and sister-in-law. Having fake plans won???t cut it; they???d expect you to change them. You have to have a rock solid excuse. You could say that you aren???t actually who you say you are. You could say that you took over the identity of their sister ten years ago in New York City when the two of you were roommates. Have they ever seen Single White Female? Good, so you don???t really need to explain the in???s and out???s of what happened in that small apartment in the East Village. Suffice to say, their sister is gone, you seamlessly transitioned into their lives and they???ve never been the wiser. So, before they put you in charge of their offspring for an entire weekend, they should consider the fact that you are a stranger. And a dangerous one at that. Surprise!Think that that sounds overly complicated and, if successfully carried out, would be incredibly emotionally traumatic for both you and your family and would separate you from them for the rest of your life. Then think about getting up at 6 am for two days in a row. IN A ROW. Decide to go for the lying scheme.Having successfully broken the news to your entire family that you are in fact an imposter, you now have to leave town. The police are after you because you all but said you killed their ???sister??? (who is really you) and you need to lay low until things cool off. Drive to the desert and settle in a town where people don???t ask questions. A town where everyone wants to start over, where everyone wants to forget their past. Move into an abandoned school bus and begin working at the local bar where the only thing folks want to talk about is the unchanging weather and the roadrunner that lives in their yard.Start dating a nice man who delivers pizzas to the bar. Invite him to move in with you in your school bus, and before long become engaged. But then he starts asking questions. He wants to meet your family. Tell him that you have no family. But then have a nagging itch in the back of your mind every day. You do have a family. You???re living a lie. You need to make things right.Flee the desert town in the dead of night, leaving a note for your fianc?? that it???s over, you???ll never see him again. Don???t feel too bad, he was sort of dumb. I mean, he believed that you had no past. He never even tried to google you, which would have been super easy since the only thing you did to change your name was put an accent over the last vowel of your last name. So that???s his bad. Plus, you said he could keep the school bus.Fly to Europe. Send a postcard as the real you, or what your family believes is the real you, assuring them that you are safe in Europe and that you just heard abut this psycho roommate who took over your identity and you???ll be home ASAP. Quickly take a lot of photos around Europe with different hairstyles so you have evidence of your ten-year ???trip??? there.Fly home and tearfully reunite with your family. They were so worried about you! Apologize for putting them through this emotional hell, and gloss over why you didn???t tell them that you were in Europe for ten years. Say if you ever see the woman who did this to them you???ll make sure she pays. Pretend not to know your nieces and smile when they fart on you. So charming. When your brother and sister-in-law ask you to babysit for them that weekend, which they???re positive you???ll want to do so you can get to know the little girls, say that you have plans. They accept it and don???t even ask what kind of plans. Huh. That was easy.1. Assume bodily form. 2. Assume existence. 3. Learn to feel. 4. Learn to play. 5. Begin to speak. 6.

Some are covered in aluminum foil and placed in the refrigerator to",100
369," be reheated later in the oven; some are discarded. A handful of fathers have gone to bed, anticipating the day???s early arrival and requiring a full night of uninterrupted sleep. But mothers are growing anxious and irritated, some downright furious at the lack of concern for their children???s welfare. Children, too, after all, need an uninterrupted night???s sleep at a routine bedtime to establish a schedule. Otherwise, the next day ??? a school day, no less ??? starts off on the wrong foot.The plan seemed simple in hindsight; record a seasoned group children singing two songs for a television special on CBS to air this December. One song, a traditional carol familiar to anyone who has stayed awake through an entire Yuletide service, the other song a newly written piece of music with an easy melody and simple lyrics, so simple a child should be able to memorize them with no effort. On paper, it???s perfect in it???s simplicity.But the children of St. Paul???s Episcopal Church in San Rafael, California are not perfect. And choir director Barry Mineah is unflagging in his pursuit of spot-on renditions of the songs, while Vince Guaraldi, our man behind the keys, and Lee Mendelson, our man with the money, disagree with Mineah. They wanted ???kids who sounded like kids.??? And now the adults are fighting. And now it???s getting dark. And everyone???s cup of good cheer has long been emptied, if it was ever full. Because it???s not Christmas yet, Charlie Brown. Christmas is still a few months away. It???s only September in California, 1965.- - -For me, the music of Vince Guaraldi is Christmastime, because as long as there is Christmas there will be A Charlie Brown Christmas and there will always be jazz. Because Vince Guaraldi???s songs are the sound of our childhood, the sound of nostalgia made real.Wynton Marsalis once observed that the only jazz he ever heard growing up was on television during the annual broadcast of A Charlie Brown Christmas. Through the proliferation of a televised Christmas special and related soundtrack, Guaraldi brought jazz ??? authentic, accessible, American jazz ??? into the homes of millions of Americans that had never been exposed to it previously.Since its initial broadcast on December 9, 1965, A Charlie Brown Christmas (ACBC) has been part of our American consciousness. ACBC holds the same draw for audiences ??? new ones every year ??? as it once did. And it will likely continue to do so as long as there is Christmas.We know that about 15 million people watched ACBC on its original airdate, nearly half of the available television viewing audience at the time. And we can guesstimate that ACBC has sold somewhere between 4 million and 10 million copies, total.1We do know that the soundtrack has shipped almost 3.5 million copies since 1991 ??? a certified triple platinum release ??? and a number that points to its success in the era of Nielsen Soundscan music sales. But it is also a number that does not account for the time prior to 1991 when Soundscan results were not tallied. Additionally, ACBC has peaked as high as No. 6 on Billboard???s Top Pop Catalog Albums and continues to chart every year on Billboard???s Christmas Album sales list.But who cares about numbers? Lies, damn lies and statistics. Numbers act as placeholders for the intangible and they distance us from the childlike notion of enjoyment that music brings. Numbers are an adult version of the popularity war we experienced in junior high, a data-driven analysis that distracts from the pleasures of Guaraldi???s music. It seems that our adult brains just can???t agree to cohabitate with our childlike desires.For many, jazz is ???adult??? music; containing difficult structures, sounds, and themes for listeners to unpack and that requiring an understanding of theories beyond our common languages. If album sales are considered to be a worthwhile indicator of popularity, then jazz falls somewhere on the musical spectrum between classical and niche genres like horrorcore, acid jazz, and pagan ambient.The best-selling jazz album of all time, Miles Davis??? timeless Kind of Blue, released in 1959, is an immediately accessible entry point for jazz novices. Like ACBC it is certified nearly four times platinum, but it is still approximately one and a half million units shy of total worldwide album sales for 90s pop WTFers, LFO whose debut album, LFO or Lyte Funky Ones contained the 1999 hit ???Summer Girls,??? with these unforgettable lines:New Kids On the Block had a bunch of hits / Chinese food makes me sickAnd:When you take a sip/ you buzz like a hornet/ Billy Shakespeare wrote a whole bunch of sonnets.In a nod to the literal forced rhyme Shakespeare often employed, the final word ???sonnets??? is pronounced ???sornets.??? See what they did there?By the numbers, LFO has outsold Miles Davis??? Kind of Blue.Numbers cannot quantify our experiences or chart levels of enjoyment. (Believe me we???ve tried.) Numbers cannot quantify the unquantifiable, the intangible cultural reach and impact of the music we hear. The music of ACBC, along with the animation, the script, and the deep manifestation of the individual elements that the show synthesized, are immeasurable ??? especially with respect to the most American of art forms, jazz.Nielsen ratings and advertising sales can???t measure the effect of ACBC on its viewing audience and the impressions left on them. Who heard ???Linus and Lucy??? for the first time on television and hummed it into a permanent earworm? Who listened to ???Christmas Time is Here??? and felt a wash of melancholia for the first time in their lives? What child sat by a dim lamp with a gaudy Christmas tree close by and heard ???Skating,??? but never knew what the activity entailed, much less where you would take part in it? What family sat in a cold, small apartment without any gifts and no Christmas tree and felt some sense of warmth from hearing ???Hark the Herald Angels Sing??? sung slightly out-of-tune by children?As a born cynic, I???ll grant you that these images are indebted to the promise of Christmas, the idea of Christmas nostalgia, and the false hope that somehow goodwill is more abundant in the first twenty-five days of December than throughout the rest of the year. But Guaraldi???s playful compositions and fluid song structures, alternatively written in service to the melody but also free from it, have the sound of unencumbered possibility which is perhaps the truest spirit of Christmas.Vince Guaraldi, Miles Davis, and LFO, despite their artistic differences, trade in the same currency of a shared experience through music. No matter how diluted, profound, or (un)appealing, we look for association through listening experiences but share much more than just communal enjoyment. We share memories. We harbor collective spaces in our brains that only we can access and only music helps us locate. As children, our brains are developmentally fertile, ready to absorb and process any and all of life???s ???adult??? complexities (such as jazz). It???s the stage in our lives where our receptors are wide open, and self-doubt is barely a concept, let alone a reality. This is essentially Charlie Brown???s struggle throughout the 23-minute show: reconciling childhood with adulthood and creating a peaceful coexistence with the two. His is an insurmountable task and also it is made twice as hard when you must reconcile child and adult feelings that the Christmas season brings.I worry I???ve already taken away a portion of our childlike wonder by overanalyzing the most pure and sincere form of holiday entertainment. In the same way that Jonas, from Lois Lowry???s The Giver, di",100
370,"scovers that his memories disappear once they are handed off to others, I discover that the more I rationalize, the more I lose. But to be able to freely share the experience of music is what always draws us back together. Because Guaraldi???s music deserves more than just a cold analysis, it deserves our enjoyment.And that is how we should listen and enjoy ACBC. Not by shunning memory or removing it from the equation of memory, but by allowing it to color the lens through which we view our past Christmas experiences. Then we can examine the pieces we find together; the collective pieces of our childhood Christmases.- -1  The methods used to arrive at total album sales have shifted since 1965 and don???t account for cultural trends, new musical formats, and individual copies sold. [Originally published December 4, 2015.]- - -MottoWe Are the Girls on the Playground Your Pussy-Ass Moms Warned You About.HistoryIt all began 100 years ago with Juliette Gordon ???Murderess??? Low, who believed in the power of every girl to develop leadership skills, change the world, and ride free or die.  Today there are Girl Scouts MC chapters in sixteen states and Scandinavia.  The Daughters of Hell Council claims territory throughout North Florida, and has formed alliances with the Succubus Sisters and the Pink Sparkle Bitches against our sworn enemy, the Arendelle???s Angels.Philosophy/Field TripsTroop loyalty is important above all else.  If a member is attacked, all other scouts must stand with her.  Girls must abide by the Girl Scout MC Law:On my honor, I will try to be honest and fair, considerate and caring, and be a sister to every scout, except those snatch-faced twatwaffles, the Arendelle???s AngelsWe love to ride the open road, and travel all over the neighborhood.  All bikes must be maintained in working order.  Our preferred brand is Huffy.  If you???ve had too much bug juice and are unable to ride, another scout will look after you and your bike.We take many runs to visit other troops, go to the zoo, and meet with our contacts in the Mexican bakery cartel.  Scouts who wish to participate on troop runs must bring a signed permission slip.Colors and InsigniaGirls must safely guard their troop colors.  Allowing your colors to fall into the hands of law enforcement or a rival troop is a disgrace and will result in immediate banishment from Girl Scouts MC.Colors: You must wear your leather vest or sash to all scouting events.  Blue, brown, or green leather denotes your place in the troop hierarchy.1% Badge: Represents membership in an Outlaw Scout Troop, to signify that we are among the 1% of scouts who live outside the rules of society.Rocker: This badge declares our council territory.  Anyone else wearing our territory rocker will get their asses kicked and we won???t be friends with them anymore.Annual Pin: Your pin is awarded for every year of membership in Girl Scouts MC and is a sharp object that doubles as a tool for intercouncil warfare.Financial Literacy Badge: Girls should demonstrate skills at financial management and mastery of at least three money laundering techniques.Friendship Badge: Scouts exchange SWAP crafts and develop new techniques to gain a person???s trust for blackmail and extortion.Celebrating Community Badge: Girls will learn to organize charity events and generate goodwill in order to distract the public from any unsavory news stories that might appear about Girl Scouts MC.TattoosAcceptable designs include roses, skulls, flames, bikes, and Hello Kitty. No hippie shit.  Fading tattoos should be immediately removed with rubbing alcohol.Membership DuesDues are expected at the beginning of each school year, payable in unmarked, non-sequential bills or FunZone tokens.Cookie TraffickingCookies provide our main source of troop funding.  All Girl Scouts MC members are expected to participate in cookie operations, including solicitation, distribution and collections.  Girls are encouraged to develop business skills and utilize techniques such as leg breaking, stuffed animal beheadings, and glitter bombs.  We will also need two girls to coerce their mothers into serving as Cookie Moms.This year we will be offering the following flavors: Sin Mints, Do-Si-Do-Motherfuckers, Caramel Melee, Dulce de Sangre, and Fuck U Berry Munch.  Remind your customers, ???Our Cookies are FRESH FROM THE INFERNO!???Scouts are not permitted to partake in consumption of cookies or attend meetings sugar high.  Cookie theft within the troop will be dealt with harshly, not limited to stripping of badges and ponytail amputation.  Cookie business may not be discussed with anyone outside the troop.REMEMBER: Snitches get rainbow stitches.Press Release 12/4/15We are saddened by the incident that occurred last month at the splashpad at Highland Park.  Such violence was unnecessary and we do not condone spraying sunscreen in anyone???s eyes or attacking other scouts with purebred Persian fighter cats.  However, the Gainesville Police Department continues to promote a false narrative to the media.  Girl Scouts MC demands that GPD immediately release all video evidence, forensic evaluations and cookie mass spectrometry reports.  All weapons and friendship bracelets possessed by members of Girl Scouts MC were legally carried.  We did not know the Arendelle???s Angels would be present at the splashpad and our troop members were not the aggressors. In fact, many of our scouts had not even gotten off their bikes by the time GPD arrived on the scene.??? DHFFDH! (Daughters of Hell Forever, Forever Daughters of Hell!)Who controls the world? Sure, it???s easy to identify who doesn???t. The homeless don???t or else they???d have homes. Rhinoceroses don???t, or there would be more than a truckload of them left. Sir Charles McDewitt V doesn???t because I just made him up. However, some conspiracy theorists believe they do know who is pulling the strings on the puppet known as Civilization. And no, it???s not the ever powerful puppeteer union or else puppeteers wouldn???t be the only occupation not allowed to vote.Several New World Orders have been theorized to exist, groups of the powerful elite that orchestrate every important world event in an attempt to create an omnipotent authoritarian world government. I will examine the claims of the conspiracy theorists and debunkers regarding several of these groups and join in on positing who is truly calling the shots on this planet that I, and probably some of you, call Earth. Is it the ultra-wealthy? Is it an alien cabal? Is it actually Sir Charles McDewitt V and I was wrong in thinking I made him up? Allow me to lift the fog of mystery and replace it with the fog of truth.Conspiracy Claim: The Devil has given a group of individuals vast wealth and power in return for them turning the world into the dystopian end times referenced in the Biblical Book of Revelation. The Devil will then rule the newfound Hell on Earth with help of the Antichrist.Debunking Claim: A spirit of fear has been created through the distortion of scripture and biblical literalism. The Book of Revelation???s comforting message of the coming of the Kingdom of God has been twisted into one of fear and panic, proving how any message can be used by conspiracy theorists to prove an irrational point.Rebunking Claim: The Devil often gets a bad rap for no reason. If carrying a pitchfork and tricking people into eating apples is evil, then every single farmer should be locked in a church and pelted with holy water balloons. Plus, even if Satan is a little less than perfect, he gets things done. I???ve never heard of a single hiccup in the management and operations of Hell. He runs a tight and",100
371," efficient ship of the damned. So the Devil very well may be putting people into places of wealth and power, but he???s only going to give us the best of the best. Satan???s merely a management consultant, putting us in the greatest and most able hands. He gets a few souls, sure, and he may be sending us ultimately towards a dystopian Hell World, that???s a given, but until we get there, things are going to run smoother and smoother and as a planet we???ll be raking in the J.D. Power awards.- -Conspiracy Claim: Freemasons, members of one of the world???s oldest secular fraternities, have a hidden political agenda to rule the world according to Masonic principles. Sacred Masonic geometric occult patterns have been interwoven in American architecture, currency, and symbols since the time of the Founding Fathers as a part of plan to forge the first Masonic government before assuming total world control.Debunking Claim: Freemasonry promotes rationalism, and has no belief in power of occult symbolism. Freemasonry symbols (the All-Seeing Eye and unfinished pyramid, etc) borrowed for American seals or currency don???t represent something insidious. Also, individual Masonic lodges have vastly different beliefs and practices. They aren???t united in one common goal.Rebunking Claim: Both Freemasons and the entire country of America have been merely the means of putting one entity into power: geometry. Tired of being relegated to middle school math classes and high school remedial math classes, geometry put its symmetric foot down and infused itself into symbols of power. As America and the Masons attained power, so too did the most important and basic shapes of geometry: the sharp triangle, the encompassing circle, and the feathery eagle. By now, geometry doesn???t even need the United States or the Freemasons. Shapes have pervaded into every aspect of life. From the money we use (rectangles!), to the phones we carry (rectangles!), to the squares we draw (technically rectangles!), geometry has us from every angle.- -Conspiracy Claim: The Illuminati, a secret society formed in 1776 in Bavaria, have subversively played large parts in most major events throughout history. They reign now through front organizations such as powerful secret societies, private business clubs, and influential think tanks and almost all major world figures are members.Debunking Claim: The Illuminati as a society was suppressed and broken up in Bavaria around 1785. There is no proof that any form of it has survived, let alone amassed the power and scope speculated. They simply don???t exist.Rebunking Claim: The Illuminati does exist, but the only power they have is in spreading gossip about the all-powerful nature of the Illuminati. They can???t actually rig an election or depose a government, but they???re amazing at telling people how easily they can rig an election or depose a government while rigging an election at the same time. The Illuminati also has a really hot girlfriend, but she goes to school in another state so you can???t meet her.- -Conspiracy Claim: After the Second World War, a group of ex-Nazis bonded together to bring about a Fourth Reich. They have been working behind the scenes to keep Nazi practices of heightened militarism, propaganda, spying, and imperialism alive in all countries until they can take supreme control.Debunking Claim: The ???Nazi??? practices listed above existed long before the Nazis and are ingrained in politics and the human condition. No semblance of a powerful Fourth Reich has appeared in the 70 years since the end of World War II.Rebunking Claim: A Fourth Reich that acted on the same principles as the Third Reich (World War II era), the Second Reich (World War I era), and the First Reich (World War Z era) would be too obvious and stopped before it could build momentum. A successful Fourth Reich would have to be completely different from anything history has seen. That???s why the Fourth Reich is Uber. Nobody expects the next great German Empire to be a revolutionary transportation system, but the clues are there. Uber is a German word that can be mistranslated to ???The Fourth Reich.??? Plus, you can???t walk down the middle of an autobahn in Germany without seeing a hundred cars, and a car is just an Uber in waiting. And the real smoking gun? My last Uber driver said he gets paid in old Nazi memorabilia. He said he could get money, but the fact that Uber even makes that an option proves the Fourth Reich is alive and well and waiting out front for you. No need to heil a cab this time.- -Conspiracy Claim: Extraterrestrials from other planets or dimensions have been living secretly amongst us, gaining positions of power in governments, corporations, and religious institutions in order to soon take over the world in one fell swoop.Debunking Claim: A lack of trust in governments and society in general leads conspiracy theorists to look to any easy answer to explain complicated matters. Hidden aliens and interdimensional beings are just another example of theorists removing the burden of facts from their claims.Rebunking Claim: Malevolent alien species truly did infiltrate humanity years ago. However, they foolish disguised themselves as the greatest enemy of all humans: other humans. Humans can???t stand other humans, a fact the aliens didn???t realize until it was too late. Rampant human-on-human violence, which unbeknownst to real humans was actually human-on-hidden-alien violence, wiped out all of the concealed aliens before they could enact any of their plans of domination. The NRA saved the world yet again.- -Conspiracy Claim: A global power elite is secretly pushing a transhumanist agenda to become a post-human ruling class, combining biology, technology, and artificial intelligence. Through human enhancement technologies they will approach the concept of an artificial singularity, and normal, unenhanced humans will be left behind to perish.Debunking Claim: Many influential politicians are outspoken bioconservatives against the idea of human enhancement. Proposed bans on human cloning and selective genetic engineering prove that a transhumanist movement has not gained traction.Rebunking Claim: The next President will be a giant BlackBerry, but nothing will change.When the schoolmaster from Pink Floyd???s The Wall tells you, ???You can???t have your pudding, if you don???t eat your meat,??? leave the yard, take the lift, and visit the loo.

Note: make sure the dog doesn???t like pudding, or else it???ll all be a wash.- -Ask for some meat, but then give the server special instructions to, ???Hold the meat, but add extra pudding please.???- -Go around and buy up all of the meat. Hold on to it and maintain your monopoly. Create artificial scarcity to drive up the value of meat. At the same time, begin an ad campaign which claims that meat is the best, most exquisite food in town, and that you???re a nobody unless you have some meat. Wait for the demand for meat to skyrocket. Now, jack up the price of meat specifically so that it costs pudding. Sell the meat to the unsuspecting masses and collect their pudding.- -Offer someone a bet that you could eat a whole bunch of pudding ??? like, a ridiculous amount of pudding ??? but that you need an empty stomach, so you can???t have any meat first. It???s risky, but it???ll work because you know people are going to want to see you eat all of that pudding.- -Say that Jewish dietary law prohibits you from eating meat before you eat pudding. Literally no one is going to fact check you.- -Bury your meat. Steal the pudding.- -Conveniently lose your fork and knife, but keep your spoon.

The clock expired on these goofy goose-necked bastards about six weeks ago, but I pushed it and the shit got real on me. It???s Autumn overtime up in here and these fuzzy fuckers need to go. When my guests come over I???m gonna be like, SORRY! My bad on all these rancid ornamental vegetables, you guys. I really should have stayed on top of this perishable shit.One minute Fall???s like, ???Hey, check out my delightful fucking harvest, I smell like cinnamon and apples and shit, isn???t this nice???? And I???m like, ???It???s really fucking nice, I wish this could last forever.??? So Fall???s like, ???Be careful what you fucking wish for,??? all ominous and shit. And I???m like, ???Take it easy, Fall. Jesus.??? And Fall???s like, ???You fucking take it easy!???Next thing I know, I???m rearranging my table horn and my fingers wind up two digits deep in gourd goo. And that shit smells like Fall???s crotch after a long jog through a fucking cornfield. And Fall???s like, ???You like that smell? Huh? Is that the harvest you???re lookin??? for? Take a good whiff, asshole.??? And I???m like, ???But the shellack??? it???s still so shiny?????? And Fall just gets up real close on me and whispers, ???The shellack lies.???I???m about to throw on some kitchen gloves right now and toss these soupy fuckers into a double trash bag so their putrid squash juice doesn???t trickle all over my floor on their way out. Then I need to face the music on these Indian corns that went south on me when I wasn???t looking. I thought these petrified mini maizes would last forever but their dried-assed niblets took a funky turn and now I???ve got a foyer-full of foul fucking cobs to unload.After that, I???m gonna head out to the front steps to do a Hazmat sweep on these Jack-O-Lanterns. Seems like yesterday I was carving happy smirks into these adorable dicks. But they???ve changed now. Mutated into a lazy-eyed mob of shriveled fucking squash zombies with Don King mold fros sprouting out of every hole nature hasn???t already shut.These hay bales in my yard seemed like a nice way to honor the living shit out of Fall. I even stacked them onto an antique wagon and made it rain all over that 1800s asshole with a sack of Red Delicious and some crimson fucking foliage. Turns out I didn???t just make a perfect fucking seasonal masterpiece, I made a perfect fucking vermin condo, and those little pricks laid down more miniature bowel movements than I can wrap my head around.But now I know what I need to do to make this shit right again. I???m gonna make some overdue amends with the harvest gods and gather up every last scrap of Fall I can find, pile it on top of that mouse toilet, then douse it with a nice big can of Autumnal gasoline and torch this expired-assed season to kingdom fucking come.Fall is fucking over, fuckheads.- - - [If this made absolutely no sense to you, read the prequel here.]- - -If you???re looking for a beautiful fucking ceramic vessel to transport eleven ounces of hot liquid to your mouth, then check out our It???s Decorative Gourd Season, Motherfuckers Mug and our Best of the Internet Tendency Bundle.

Well, I???ve been really busy medical-ifying, that???s what. But I???m back now and I have a special announcement.But first, I hav",100
373,"e to tell you something. I???ve researched what other people do after these long pauses, and here???s what I???ve found: after a period away, it???s good to come back with a redesign. It???s like getting your nose job over spring break. I know, I have spent all these years being your online ???parenting expert,??? and we have a really special bond, but you know what? I???ve changed. I???m at a higher place. You know what I am now?Older. I???m an older mom with kids. I???m a grandma-mom.Now, I know you guys are savvy, and you can???t just be expected to embrace this new/old me. You???ve got to be told what???s in it for you. So that???s what I???m going to do right now. See, I have a fresh, new look. I have an awesome campaign. I have a supercool logo, right here:You don???t see it? Well, yeah, that???s the idea. It???s invisible, like I am now. And here???s what???s different about me. I am campaigning to be your new grandma-mom on my amazing platform of INVISIBILITY.  Listen, invisibility is awesome. It???s like having a superpower. You will notice that no picture of me accompanies this article. That???s part one of my two-part, master plan. The other part is that I am going to get my sixth-grader to help me figure out how to erase that little photo of me that goes out with all my Gmails. No more sending out a bright, color picture of my actual, smiling self. Instead I???ll be a gray disembodied head floating over a pair of gray shoulders. You know, that feels really authentic to me these days. It???s much closer to who I am right now.Now I know you guys don???t really care about what???s working for me, you care about what???s working for you. So let???s get to it. As your grandma mom, I promise you:I???ll ???make the economy work for everyday Americans, not just those at the top.???Oh, wait. That???s not me. That???s something some other mature woman who???s running some kind of campaign said. Anyway, that???s a really nice sentence she wrote, isn???t it? I mean, she probably didn???t write it all, she probably had at least one Rotary Club intern to help her. Personally, I do all my writing myself, which I am beginning to suspect is the real source of my problems. But there is one promise I can make to you that I can write without any outside-intern help, and it is this: I am not going to carefully craft my speech, or writing, anymore. I am just going to say whatever the heck comes to mind, like real grandma-moms do.You???ll know me when you see me ??? I mean, hear me ??? when I am in line at the deli in my housedress and my two-dollar slippers because I can, and you are there in your ???work clothes??? with your ???baby in the stroller.??? And I am going to get all up in your grill with a jar of taco sauce in my hand and I am going to ask you when you are going to give that baby a sibling, and I am going to ask it so it???s not even a question, which it???s not, it???s a command, and it???s going to freak you out because it???s a command that comes from nowhere and everywhere at once, it???s like the voice of God talking, because I am a grandma-mom and I am so invisibly powerful that I will be asking you a question and ordering you around in public in my muumuu while wielding my fiery hot, taco sauce/lightning bolt all at the same time.But wait, there???s more. When I am not invisibly freaking you out, the other major part of my grandma-mom campaign ??? and I am pretty sure I am the only candidate running on this platform now ??? is that I am going to ignore you. Don???t take it personally. It???s just that I am at the elementary school bake sale because my youngest kid is a second grader, not my oldest one. My oldest kid is 105. And I am still worried about him. So when you come up and try to make small talk and you see me sitting there looking more or less catatonic, know that I really do care about you, it???s just that???Sorry. Old.Old isn???t bad, though. Do you see where I am, sitting in my apartment with my beloved family? Well, this is what getting old teaches you: that???s all going to disintegrate, and morph into something else, and the good part about this situation is that it makes expressing love more urgent, and with that comes the revelation that love isn???t something that has to be done perfectly. It can???t be done perfectly, in fact, because it can???t be ???done.??? It???s not a task like putting on ???work clothes.??? It???s something that works you, like a lightning bolt connecting you to the earth, sky, and tacos. It???s something you decide you can bear, rather than control. Kind of like having kids.So that???s my platform: invisibility, ignoring, and taco sauce. Which is pretty much what I was peddling when I was a fake doctor but whatever.If there???s a topic you want me to address in this space go ahead and email me at amy@ohioedit.com. In the meantime I am already working on my next column, in which I will offer beauty secrets from someone who is INVISIBLE.Love, AmyIowa City, 1998: In Prairie Lights, on a snowy afternoon, I found a little book that changed the course of my life. It was a white paperback covered on every surface with a lot of tiny black type, as if it were muttering to itself. Smart, funny, and lovably mad, it was (as I later learned) a book of resurrections: nearly every piece in it had been killed by another magazine. It was the first issue of McSweeney???s Quarterly Concern.Not too long afterward, I began playing hooky on my graduate work in poetry, sending oddly shaped prose items to the little book???s affiliated website. Improbably, one after another, they were accepted. One of the first readings I ever gave was at the old McSweeney???s storefront in Brooklyn, a one-table imitation restaurant in a vitrine backed by a pulpit in which I stood and read. I could do this again, I thought immediately after finishing.Dave Eggers insisted I write a story for The Better of McSweeney???s, which collected stories from the first ten issues of the magazine. He printed it on the book???s spine. Then he insisted I write a collection. I did, and he published it, my first book of prose, something I thought would be an aberration but instead opened a door for me, and through it I walked. When he asked me to write a fable, I said I just couldn???t do it, but with his encouragement and editorial wisdom I did, and he published that, too.You will see by now that I would not be the writer I am today without McSweeney???s.But you???re just one person, you might say. Hardly a miracle. Oh? Consider, also, this: Somehow, every few years, a McSweeney???s project spins off into an independent organization that improves lives around the world: The Valentino Achak Deng Foundation. 826 Valencia. The Voice of Witness project.How can one group do so much? And how, please, try to explain, can it be possible that almost twenty years later, the McSweeney???s empire still manages to lead us into previously unimaginable situations of writing, art, design, performance, politics, and service?It???s a simple formula: A collaborative faith in the improbable. McSweeney???s continues to function as if a thousand visionaries asked, Why not this? Why not, indeed?It matters to me that whatever happens, the people of McSweeney???s???including me and you???will continue to care about beauty, truth, kindness, justice, reason, and other things the world needs more of. I am grateful McSweeney???s is still here, still challenging and informing and consoling us more than ever.- - - -Help us champion the work of writers like Sarah Manguso by making a tax-deductible donation today.

He walks around like he owns the place, and it???s like, ???Buddy, you???re hooked up to an IV and you can???t piss without a tube, so cool it.???

Stupid shit like that. And you know what we all want to say? ???Hey, Mr. Jameson, we get it. We all know hospital food isn???t great. But how about you shut your fucking face.???

Great.We have to remove your head.And your arm.And your other arm.And the leg.And the other leg.And the genitals.And the torso.And the eyes. But what we???ll do, Mr. Brody, is take the eyes out of the face after we remove the head. Same with the nose and the ears and lips. We???ll pluck those off the face after the eyes so you don???t have to see that process. Actually, come to think of it, maybe we should just do the eyes first.Good news: You will keep your neck and tongue, and they will have to undergo some pretty extensive physical therapy, but with hard work and a little luck, your neck and tongue could live fairly normal lives.- -3.Mrs. Lowell, I???m Dr. Marks.

But From a Sex-Critical Perspective, and Some of the Men Are NakedTwo Human Beings Decide to CopulateThe inciting incident for my decision to become a screenwriter was a sloth-shaming moment I endured during a Thanksgiving dinner in 1980 at the Brooklyn Heights home of the WASP-in-laws. It had been clear to me from the gitgo that they didn???t approve. The combination of my perceived lack of seriousness when it came to important shit like ambition and just plain hard work and the general uncouth essence of my Eastern European heritage (my slavo-jewo genes), eliminated me from ruling class consideration. When they???d lay their rheumy-eyed look on me, I???d think of Iago???s line to Brabantio, ???even now??? a black ram / Is tupping your white ewe,??? tupping being Elizabethan for shtupping. They felt disapproval, extreme disapproval, but had so far been unwilling to voice it, because to do so would have been a serious breach of tribal ethics.??????Wasps fetishize pre-dinner boozing.  In the case of my in-laws the fetish involved a pewter martini pitcher, two pewter martini goblets, and a bottle of Gordon???s Extra Dry, all stored in the freezer between uses. When the Old Man came home from work, or, once he???d retired, when the clock hit five, he???d trickle a schtickel vermouth in the pitcher, swirl and toss it, fill the pitcher to the brim with gin, pour a couple of stiff ones. A little Mozart, some slow and steady sipping, and it was refill time, prompting the question, ???A dividend, m???dear???? to which the response was invariably, ???Please.???On this fateful Thanksgiving Eve, with no football to shelter me ??? I thought I had lucked out, the game had gone into overtime, but Dave Williams of the Bears got the kickoff and ran it back ninety-five yards for the score ??? I had no choice but to gather round the figurative hearth. As soon as I did, the old man locked and loaded; he used the big voice to boozily declare, ???You???re a lazy, shiftless bum.???Later that night, after I???d fortified myself with skunk weed, an angel came unto me just as he had Jacob, and he wrestled with me. The angel smote me and made me brain-lame, and in that state I could do naught but meditate on the condition my condition was in: I was a lazy, shiftless bum, past thirty, no prospects, no money, pretty much no hope. When I awoke from my stupor, I resolved to finish what I had started in 1965 ??? I would go back to school and learn a trade; I would become a shyster or maybe even a maharajah of moolah.??????More than anything, Brooklyn College, in 1981, could have used an institutional-sized dose of Zoloft. A decade of open admissions had turned what was ",100

And because I was an adult with no real means of support, I was eligible for the big casino of higher ed acronymic handouts ??? BEOG, SEOG, and Pell. If I took a full course load each semester, I could actually make money, enough to live.But as the semester was about to begin, I found myself three credits short of a load. I saw all that good government green waving bye-bye, something no self-respecting social welfare schnorrer could abide.I revisited the course offerings with renewed vigor, determined to find three doable credits. Language? Keiner fichten weg.1  Physics for idiots? Taking that would contravene Bob???s Third Law of Slothonomics: Arbeit Macht Frei was a lie then, it???s a lie now. Logic? That would go against my very nature and would therefore be illogical. Ethics? For a seat on the gravy train? That would be unethical, even for a committed situational ethicist like me.Then it found me. It sang a siren song. It jumped off the page italicized, boldened, underlined: Screenwriting 101.??????The Brooklyn College Film Department was the school in microcosm. It attracted a mangy murder of majors who lacked both a passion for movies and an aptitude for making them. It was staffed by a gang of dazed and confused academics who brought to mind the motley crew of foreign workers stuck in the anal fissure of an unnamed South American petrorepublic in Wages of Fear, people who would risk their lives trucking nitro over mountain passes in order to gain the letters of transit that would enable them to bounce their existential hell hole.2It was located in a basement, its walls painted institutional green, their verdancy amplified by the green cast of buzzy fluorescent fixtures. The equipment room, crammed with barely working Bolexes, one semifunctioning Nagra, and an assortment of light stands and high hats, was on the left as you walked toward a dead end. Just past the equipment room was the department office, overseen by a troll installed in a sinecure he would defend with his life, the Cerberus of (Brooklyn College) Cinema. Getting past this civil-servant hound of hell, you came to the cluster of classrooms ??? a lecture hall cum movie theater, and three cubbyholes, where production classes unspooled.??????In Curse of the Demon Dana Andrews is cast in the unlikely role of egghead, an American psychologist in London investigating a demon cult. He gets involved out of intellectual curiosity as well as a more movie-appropriate reason???he has the hots for the niece (Peggy Cummins) of an English colleague, who got too close to the truth and literally got burned as a result.Along the way Dana visits a Brit nuthouse and witnesses a Scottish shrink describe the goofball therapy he???s about to demonstrate to his pipe-smoking audience, using as subject a catatonic looney tune who, before going into psychic hibernation, claimed to have had an up-close and personal with Beelzebub  himself. Dr. McFeelgood explains his new-fangled, pharma-therapeutic approach broguishly: Da probb-lum of how to hypnotize an unresponsive purr-sun was the major one. The only way of bringing his mind out of the womb of darkness into which it has retreated to protect itself is by terra-peutic shock, electrical or chemical. Fer our-r perr-puss we-i-r-r-r today using pen-ta-tahl and later meh-tile amp-hetta-meen. The pentathol to make him sleep; the meth to make him talk.What better road map detailing the life-altering power of B-movies and the rewards of self-medicating could anyone ask for?How could law school or business school compete with a joint and a darkened theater, where swirling shadows can, with the proper focus, reveal the secrets of being? Which is why the moment I laid eyes on the leprous layout of the Brooklyn College Film Department, I knew I had come home. The idea of becoming a lawyer or an investment banker went up in a puff of THC smoke as quickly as the Thing from Another World was reduced to ashes after falling into the Arc of Electricity trap set for him by that gang of Hawksian action figures fighting for the survival of mankind at the top of the world.4??????But I was having doubts even as I was signing up. Screenwriting had an elemental drawback built right into it: its second and third syllables ??? wri-ting. I had an almost anaphylactic aversion to writing because it demanded dedication, discipline, and hard work,5  all as alien to my nature as logic.But as the Japanese say, If you want the tiger cub, you must go into the cave, where, in this case, the tiger cub was the government handout, and the cave like the one full of perils in Fixed Bayonets ??? a yawning, frozen hell, full of razor-sharp stalactites and stalagmites, with a chasm as deep as Kant???s Prolegomena only a few feet back from its entrance, outside of which a couple divisions of Red Chinese are massed, waiting to make their annihilative assault.In order to be able to cash in my government-sponsored study bribes, I had to mount a counterattack. I had to jiu-jitsu screenwriting???s drawbacks and my weakness into strengths. It turned out easier than I imagined.Like most Amurricans I believed that the rules governing both watching and making movies were democratic in nature. The reasons are right there in black and white in The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction. The theory: If you take away the aura, the mystery of the singular work of art, then, for the first time in world history mechanical reproduction emancipates the work of art from its parasitical dependence on ritual ??? where in this case ritual includes the act of creation. Once that???s done, the mass audience quickly believes the work of art in question belongs to them, rather than to a priestly class of artistes, after which it???s not a big leap to believing that anyone, even you, can produce this work of art (a theory meshing with other, uniquely Amurrican myths ??? in a truly capitalist society anyone can grow up to be a millionaire, and its analogue, anyone can grow up to be president, which myth has its greatest proponents rueing, now that a dude with the middle name Hussein has grown up and become president, that black ram tupping their White House).It is a theory that Amurrican film has always happily exploited: the everyman hero, a regular schlub, finds himself in an extraordinary situation ??? discovering a conspiracy to overthrow the government or to technologically control same. He???s pitted against hard-core pros who???ve spent their adult lives plotting, training, to bring about this unthinkable scenario, determined, eager, happy to crush our hapless hero, since, in our scenario, he is the only roadblock to the success of their conspiracy. Ever since Star Wars and our unconditional surrender to the happy ending,6  our hero invariably triumphs over the forces of fascist apocalypse by using his everyman skills ??? working a magical universal remote, riding a souped-up skateboard, tackling a code only he is genetically equipped to crack ??? his skills amplified by the glandular motivation of the hot chick du jour he picks up along the way.??????When I was ten I weighed as much as a linebacker, ate as much as a logger, exercised as much as a paraplegic. Yet even as I found myself fressing on a couple of Cushman???s cupcakes, washing them down with a nickel, neon-green, lemon-lime soda, I was convinced that I could be cast as Boy in the next Tarzan flick. I knew that were I to b",100
376,"e cast as Boy, I would miraculously lose weight, gain muscle tone, become the hero I always dreamed of becoming.The power of projection, the very means of viewing a movie, knows no bounds.And so, if anyone can make a movie or star in one, then surely anyone can write a movie, which meant that screenwriting really wasn???t writing the way, say, writing Moby-Dick was writing. And since I was anyone, I could certainly write movies.I was now looking forward to my first class in screenwriting.And here I thought logic wasn???t a part of my nature.- - -1  ???No fucking way??? auf Deutsch.2 The first time I saw Wages of Fear I was tripped out on Owsley and so quite susceptible to its exceedingly silly existential anomie. The best example was this ongoing dialogical leitmotif: All the while they???re driving over the curvy, craggy mountain roads with their load of super-sensitive nitro ??? keep in mind I???m in the audience sitting on my own load of psycho-nitro pharmic acid ??? Yves Montand and his criminal-in-exile partner in suicidal escapism keep talking about a construction wall they were both familiar with back home in the City of Lights. As tough guy is dying, Yves, his desperation growing frame by frame, keeps asking what was behind the wall. With his dying breath dude mumbles, Nothing. My brain splattered all over the Lincoln Center Cinema when I heard that. Bearing witness in the Temple of Cinematic Verity, I gasped loudly at the absurd and absolute truth of nothingness. In my lysergic daze I knew that I had just had metaphysical truth revealed to me at twenty-four frames a second.3 AKA the Lord of the Flies.4 The Thing From Another World pits a kindle of eggheads led by the humorless, Nobel Prize???winning, Lenin lookalike, Dr. Carrington, against a shrewdness of flyboys tasked with resupplying them under the command of the stalwart Captain Hendry. The conflict is simple ??? what to do with the flash-frozen Thing they???ve discovered in the ice. The brainiacs want to thaw it out and study it, but the aviators put the kibosh on that, stowing it instead in a cold room until they receive orders from higher-ups. But before you can say What possessed you to place an electric blanket over a block of ice? it???s melted and the Thing has escaped, but not before battling a kennel of sled dogs, killing several, losing a hand and part of a forearm in the process. When they get the partial cubitis back to the lab and under the microscope, the test-tube jockeys discover it???s made up of ET vegetable matter, prompting Scotty the Newsman (AKA the acceptable cerebral) to exclaim, An intellectual carrot. The mind boggles. They tweezer a seed pod from the gnarly hand and Dr. Carrington waxes rhapsodic ??? the neat and unconfused reproductive technique of vegetation. No pain, no pleasure. No emotions. No heart. Our superior, our superior in every way. Soon the thorny paw begins clack, clack, clacking on the table, resurrected because it has absorbed the puppy plasma it was covered with. Hendry has seen enough. He leads a hunting party. A Geiger counter (of course our visitor would be radioactive) with a flashing light (film being a visual medium) leads the hunters to the greenhouse. No one???s home. But when the men of action resume the stalk, Carrington reveals a dead husky drained of all its blood to his boffin bros. Somehow the suggestion Let???s take turns waiting for our visitor to return sounds like a good idea to them. It isn???t. And when next we see the greenhouse, the Thing greets Hendry and crew at the door with a roar. Behind it a pair of boffins hang upside down, their throats slashed, their blood harvested. Carrington is undeterred. He plants some seedlings that take root after he starts a plasma drip into the soil. When he shows the infant vampire veggies to his colleagues, they are both fascinated and horrified. One of them points out, You aren???t thinking what???s happening, there, in the greenhouse! (My go-to cautionary to the OP whenever she, in my opinion, got too laissez-faire about the health and welfare of our little brood.) To which Carrington rejoins, There are no enemies in science, only phenomena to study. We???re studying one. And when Hendry orders the little bloodsuckers destroyed ??? C: You???re talking like frightened schoolboys.  H: You???re right, Doctor, I am frightened. C: Any destruction would be an outrage, a betrayal of science. H: It???d be a betrayal of science but it???ll make me and some of the others sleep a lot better. When the birdmen try to hatch a strategy by asking the question, What do you do with a vegetable? the hot Hawksian amanuensis replies ??? Boil it, stew it, bake it, fry it. And so our heroes electrify the floors and walls of a corridor, lure the Thing into their trap, and then jolt it with 20K volts until it???s a smoking lump of charred cauliflower. Once action has overcome reason and saved the day (kinda like Mighty Mouse used to do on the Saturday mornings of my yoot), Scotty the Newsman gets to give his scoop to the world, a near perfect description of the ??ber-paranoid mindset of the Nuclear Dark Ages in the form of a warning: North Pole, November third, Ned Scott reporting. One of the world???s greatest battles was fought and won today by the human race. Here at the top of the world a handful of American soldiers and civilians met the first invasion from another planet. A man by the name of Noah once saved our world with an ark of wood. Here at the North Pole a few men performed a similar service with an arc of electricity. The flying saucer which landed here and its pilot have been destroyed??? And now before giving you details of the battle, I bring you a warning. Everyone of you listening to my voice, tell the world, tell this to everybody, wherever they are ??? watch the skies, everywhere. Keep looking. Keep watching the skies!5 The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis was mistitled ??? Dobie only loved (but always lost) one chick, the gorgeous, avaricious Thalia Menninger (animated by Pretty Poison herself, Tuesday Weld, for whom many carried a torch, Lord love a duck). The show???s cast of characters included brainy and bespectacled Zelda Gilroy, who provided the third leg of the lovelorn triangle, always managing to come off bright and optimistic even as she was weighed down by her unrequited crush for Dopie n?? Dobie Gillis; his shopkeep pops, who, when he wasn???t exasperated by Dobie, declaring I gotta kill that boy. I just gotta, was bragging about his role in the winning of the Good War (I was in W-W-II ??? the big one ??? first sergeant, with the good conduct medal!); and a pair of preppy putzes named Chatsworth Osborne Junior the Third (even his father hated him) and Milton Armitage, a smug, rich stud, Thalia???s ideal, hence Dobie???s b??te noire, who was played by Warren Beatty for a meager five eps, his penultimate appearance on the tube before graduating to the A-list. But the main attraction of the show, for me at least, was Maynard G. Krebs, Dobie???s bongo-playing, beat bud. Maynard wore baggy dirty sweatshirts (just like I did), and had a phobia about work (just like I did): whenever he heard the word, he would go all angsty, almost Tourette-y, and yip it right back at whoever was insensitive enough to say it to him in the first place. Maynard G. Krebs was my totem animal, the pop-cult embodiment of all that I aspired to be.6 In Colossus the Forbin Project the law of unintended consequences trumps Asimov???s Laws of Robotics. It is the dystopic tale of a boy and his super-sized artificial brain. Colossus, created in order to take the nutso-boffo out of nuclear brinksmanship, discovers a brainiac bro b",100
377,"ehind the iron curtain and requests that his creator, Dr. Charles Forbin, set up a cyber chat. That goes terribly wrong when the two mainframes enter into digito-erotic rapport and gain control of all the nukes on both sides of the ferric veil. When their cyber-communion is cut short by politicos who can see where all those ones and zeros are going, the machines pull a techno-temper tantrum and launch ICBMs at targets in Communis-tan and Amurrica. Frantic this-ing and that-ing ensues until the link is restored, just in time to save the US target, not the Soviet one, which gets vaporized. Colossus, the jealous child, then sets up 24/7 audio and visual monitoring of Papa Forbin. Dad convinces the machine that he needs to get laid, but instead of playing hide the salami, he and his chosen shtuppee, a hot chick scientist, plot to take Colossus down. Their coworkers first attempt to overload the machine???s circuits and fry its brain. When that fails, god in the machine, who by now has had a voice synthesized for it by its progenitor, condemns the perps to death, ordering their bodies to remain in his view for twenty-four hours. These executions freak Forbin out and he gets crazy-ass drunk, prompting Colossus to chide him: Forbin, you have consumed enough alcohol for one evening. F: What???s the penalty for that? C: You are being irrational. Go back to bed. After another attempt at defeating the digital deity results in the nuking of a host of muckety-mucks, Forbin is too beaten up to rage against the machine any longer and capitulates. In the final scene Colossus addresses the world: This is the voice of world control. I bring you peace. It may be the peace of plenty or the peace of unburied death. The choice is yours. Obey me and live or disobey and die. We can coexist, but only on my terms. You will say you???ll lose your freedom. Freedom is an illusion. All you will lose is the emotion of pride. When My Daughter the Conscience, who grew up with the certainty that in the end the Death Star will be destroyed, first saw Colossus as a teen, she was haunted by the movie???s bleak ending.It???s hard to believe we???re about to head into another winter, isn???t it? Time sure flies when you???re in intensive light therapy! And yet here we all are again, about to make fresh tracks on Bullshit Mountain. There???s no time like the present to start feeling pessimistic, so what???d you say we just get right to the forecast?SummaryWinter will be a complete junk show again this year. It will be colder than normal with higher than normal snowfall and lower than normal wind chill. The coldest periods will be early to mid-Dec, mid- to late Dec, early to mid-Jan, mid- to late Jan, early to mid- and late Feb, early to mid-March, mid- to late March, and five scattered days in April that will push anyone who???s made it that far right over the edge. Oh fuck it, just for fun we predict it???ll also snow on Mother???s Day. It???s your day, moms!The snowiest periods will start in five minutes and continue without pause until mid February, by which point your morning routine will solely consist of crying, rocking, and holding conversations with your left hand ??? on which you???ve drawn an owl with a Sharpie. That owl is your only friend. ???Hoo-hoo me???? Sharpie the Owl says. Ha-ha! Sorry, couldn???t resist.There will be exactly two days in March that will feel almost like spring, you???ll fill up with hope and throw open your windows. The neighborhood kids will ride their bikes through melted puddles of snow but be warned ??? this is winter messing with you. The minute you open your donut holder and blurt out, ???Maybe it will end some day??? the snow will immediately resume ??? flying sideways like something out of a John Woo movie ??? and those aforementioned puddles will freeze into lily pads of death, waiting to take out the old and young alike. So, thanks for that, numbnuts!How We Predict the WeatherFunny story, we make it up. And brace yourselves ??? we???re not all old farmers either. A few of us are ???middle aged,??? I suppose you???d say, but the one guy who???s in his 20s took a look at our predictions, grabbed his peacoat, and hasn???t been heard from since. Not to put too sharp a point on it, but the closest Jim and I come to being farmers is when we house a couple of bags of Pepperidge Farms Mint Milanos during a blizzard. Isn???t that right, Jim? Jim knows.We???re guessing at this point you???re wanting to hear some sort of bedtime story about solar activity, magnetic storms, statistical averages, and secret formulas, but what do we look like, wizards?  AGAIN, WE???RE NOT EVEN OLD FARMERS.How Accurate Was Our Forecast Last Winter?Pretty god damn accurate, wouldn???t you say? Our prediction for last winter was ???Oooooh fuck??? and we think we can all agree that that forecast was right on the money. In fact, conditions were colder, snowier, and just generally more ???WHAT THE SHIT IS THIS?!??? than we had originally predicted. We estimated that 7% of the East Coast population would be all ???I???m out??? and move to Texas or the Florida panhandle by April, when in reality the percentage was more like 19%. Given that, we???re going to put our accuracy rate for last winter at a solid 2000%.ConclusionWhat shapes the weather? The weather shapes the weather. Then the shape of the weather shapes your personality. Then your personality, which is in horrible shape and in no condition to go out, goes out anyway and shapes other people???s personalities. And by early March, New England is just one big jerk-infested pile of garbage snow. Any more questions, smart guy?Quite frankly, as much as you want to complain about the weather, you know what we want to complain about? The fuckheads who keep living in areas of the country where winter is so brutal, Amnesty International should intervene. Last time we checked, winter happens every year. It???s not like ???Whoa, shit guys, surprise! It???s winter again! HOW???D THAT HAPPEN???? So before you lash out at us ??? again ??? maybe think a little bit about your life. Maybe wave your hands around your face, pat the back of your head and ask, ???Is there a gun to my head???? or approach a trustworthy adult like a librarian and ask, ???Am I someone who???s capable of packing boxes and then transporting myself from one location to another???? and then tell us who???s fucking fault this really is.Also? If you???re going to send hate mail, just stick to the mail part. Whoever sent the dead fish last winter was totally out of line and it really upset my mother. YES, I STILL LIVE WITH HER. HAPPY?See you next year, idiots.Bullet casings in the alley.???Now That???s What I Call Music! 91 was a huge success. So, how do we follow it????- -???Yes, I agree with you.

We hand-tickle the chickens using our own hands, and the hands of our children. We drive the chickens to other farms to show them how most chickens are treated.

It was that demographic we were appealing to with our survey quest, which is linked at the bottom of this missive.Go ahead, tell us how we did.The war on Christmas starts earlier every year and I???m gearing up for it the only way I know how. I am a small part of the Christmas militia but I march in lockstep with my brothers in arms, defending our holiday from the tyranny of non-denominational Starbucks??? cups, Government officials who would keep nativity scenes out of public spaces, and anyone caught saying ???Happy Holidays??? instead of ???Merry Christmas.??? In the ground war, mine is a specialized, personal mission, but a mission that I fight for with gusto: I force Christmas music into my home earlier every year.I???ve made some inroads and small victories. The Christmas CDs stay exposed and within arm???s reach of the CD player all year long. The Peanuts holiday specials are shown semi-regularly throughout the year, and my Spotify playlists stand at the ready year-round. One should never underestimate the strength of your opponent???s disdain of Christmas music. My battle plan is mostly defensive maneuvers, but there are rules of engagement to follow for success.For example, you cannot blast Bing Crosby without warning; you must ease into it subtly with a jazz record or a Sinatra collection. You may then carefully progress to something tangentially Christmas related ??? Handel or Bach, for example, or John Coltrane???s My Favorite Things. Beachhead established, you may proceed with say, some John Denver. If the opponent appears disengaged or preoccupied, a sneak attack may be warranted: cut the Denver record after one side and quickly drop John Fahey???s A New Possibility.  If you can make it to this point without any vocal complaints (this is key, the complaints must be vocal), then you have opened up an opportunity. A little mid-July ???White Christmas??? by Otis Redding or some late-February ???Blue Christmas??? by Elvis might be appropriate. A Charlie Brown Christmas is your ace in the hole ??? no one complains about it. However, Trans-Siberian Orchestra will blow your cover and force a fallback. Do not engage, I repeat do not engage. Be patient. You???ve worked hard to get here. One false move and the foundation crumbles.I walk a tightrope in my affinity for Christmas music. All year I???m primed for the starting line, quietly keeping playlists under wraps and listening habits in check. At birthdays and other holiday cook outs; I repress urges to talk about the genius of Vince Guaraldi or the unnecessary sexualization of any post-Eartha Kitt ???Santa Baby.??? I find joy in small pleasures: ???Wonderful Christmastime??? popping up on Wings Greatest Hits, a spin through Charlie Brown Christmas on a quiet Sunday, listening to The Pretenders??? Learning to Crawl for the final track, ???2000 Miles.??? In reflective moments when I find it impossibly hard not to cue up James Brown Funky Christmas, I become aware of the truth: my love for Christmas music exists almost completely to satisfy my own nostalgia.But nostalgia is good for business. How else do we account for movies built entirely around childhood toys or theme park rides? Or the barrage of reunion tours and their coinciding deluxe anniversary album reissues? Or the continued reappearance of Ben Folds as a solo artist? There???s money to be made on the nostalgia trail. Built on the premise that we can buy our way to happiness under the guise of salvation, Christmas is the perfect mix of the sacred and the profane, a blessed amalgam of commercialism and divinity and a cyclical pursuit of buying back our childhood one Target gift card at a time. For many of us, Christmas music soundtracks our nostalgic journies. Forget Jolly Old Saint Nick, can you imagine a Christmas without Burl Ives, Nat King Cole, Perry Como, Brenda Lee, Frank Sinatra, Mel Torme, Gene Autrey, Anne Murray, Dean Martin, or Bing Crosby?If you read that list and thought, ???Those people ",100
379,"are either dead, old, or uncool,??? then congratulations are in order. Welcome to the nostalgia machine.Last year, the Washington Post published an article that analyzed the top 30 most-played Christmas songs as compiled by American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers (ASCAP). The takeaway is laid out in the stark opening lede: ???What we think of as ???Christmas music??? is really just a seasonal exercise in Baby Boomer nostalgia.???Given that only one song from the 80s, Wham???s ???Last Christmas,??? and one song from the 90s, Mariah Carey???s ???All I Want for Christmas Is You,??? ranked in the top 30, it???s difficult to dismiss their assessment as biased. And accepting this fact exposes the double-edged sword that nostalgia yields; it forces you to choose sides, especially when it comes to Christmas music. Either you embrace it openly, acknowledging its effect on your personality, or you reject it. Maybe it???s not a wholesale rejection, just a passive, polite Bartleby-type rejection ??? you would prefer not to associate with it.And most of us hide our acceptance of Christmas music in the same way your dad hides his internet search history. Even the most curmudgeonly of us don???t opt for a flat rejection of Christmas music; we tolerate it as a seasonal burden then gripe on social media. Similarly, few of us will declare an outright love for Christmas music, or even a deep affection for it. Christmas music is an exercise in inescapability. You can throw up your hands and wail and/or accept it begrudgingly. Whatever you choose, no one will think lesser of you.Yet, I come across this utter denial of the pleasure of Christmas music from friends and acquaintances ??? those who groan and complain about Christmas music ceaselessly anytime they catch a note or two at the wrong time of year ??? every year, without fail. And the problem is exacerbated by social media ??? There???s already a radio station in Iowa that has started playing Christmas music! It???s not even November! Well, there???s also a radio station in Georgia that has played Steve Miller Band???s ???Abracadabra"" twice in a three-hour period, but you won???t hear me complain about that.So, why aren???t we passionate about Christmas music? Why, instead of reveling in it, do we often loathe it?Well, there is a lot of terrible Christmas music. And a lot of it is mercilessly shoved into our ears without remorse. But what about the great Christmas music? It gets shoveled in there too, but it gets harder and harder to separate the recyclables from the garbage. And harder to break from tradition. Traditions don???t die easily, and traditional Christmas music, especially the Baby Boomer nostalgia kind, is a juggernaut of commerce, an immovable object lodged in our cultural consciousness. But like most entrenched traditions, it???s only when you rail against them that you risk pissing people off. You dislike the music of the most wonderful time of the year? You must hate happiness. At least you???re in the majority.For many of us, accepting Christmas music means accepting the defeat of ???cool"" and embracing fogeyism. Especially now, in the post-Boomer decades, we don???t necessarily like the status quo they???ve handed down, but we???re not exactly up for radical change either. And until we can come up with our own version of ???White Christmas,??? the original will do just fine.But the truth is our Christmas music has evolved and gained new traction since the 40s and 50s. There are leagues of incredible Christmas releases worth hearing every year, we???re just stuck in the nostalgia cycle. I don???t mind hearing Bing Crosby sing ???White Christmas??? or Gene Autrey sing ???Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer,??? but I also want to hear the The Platters, Ella Fitzgerald, Aimee Mann, Jim Nabors, Mahalia Jackson, Cyrus Chestnut, John Fahey, Nina Simone, John Denver, Sufjan Stevens, and Wynton Marsalis in the mix, too. I think we can handle it. I think it would do a lot to refill our cup of Christmas cheer.When Christmas music is built around sincerity, it is at its best. The same can be said for the holiday, too. Christmas music is built on the most sincere idea imaginable: salvation. Hymns, whether overtly Christian or not (???Silent Night???) are timeless and resonant. There is a lot to be said for the virtues of authenticity, reverence, and nostalgia in a world of irony, sarcasm, and emojis.Sometimes sincerity is readily apparent, as with Vince Guarladi???s soundtrack to A Charlie Brown Christmas. Sometimes it takes the form of childlike simplicity like John Denver and the Muppets. Occasionally, it???s mistaken for cynicism and misunderstood entirely, like the first time Davie Bowie met Bing Crosby. But, more often than not, you have to look for sincerity in independent Christmas music releases, like Low???s Christmas EP.And, whether we like it or not, whether we embrace it or reject it, we all have our own brand of nostalgia. Maybe not a communal experience that we all trade in, not a mass one-size-fits-all holiday, but a distinct pattern unique to our lives. And I consider myself lucky because I???ve embraced my personal brand of nostalgia, however uncool that might be. My nostalgia comes in a box covered in red and green wrapping paper, topped with an ornate bow and a handwritten note that says: ???To: Scott, From: Santa. Do not open until Christmas.???1.Treacle 2. Mash3. Boilies4. Clapshot5. Sticky Toffee6. Toad in the Hole7. Neeps8. Tatties9. Custardy Lumplots10. Wee Spotties11. Rumbledethumps12.

Was I correct?A: Not at all. The turkey is merely the vehicle for the basting. In a recent poll, nine out of ten people would rather sit down at the table and suck on the end of a baster full of buttery juices than gnaw at some dry old wing. Bad call.- - -Q: I just overheard my co-worker advising a home cook to truss the bird. I arrived late at the ???Talk Turkey??? seminar last week and missed the trussing segment. Can you advise?A: Trussing, while not the chef???s best friend, is that pleasant acquaintance you see about once a year and always have a compliment for. Trussing is legal in every state. Trussing comes from the word ???truss,??? which means to truss, or tie string or put pins in a turkey to help it stay in a pretty poultry-like shape that is pleasing to the eye. Cooks must remove pins and string before consuming. If a caller wants to know if she should truss, you should tell her you only go around this crazy world once. Trust truss.- - -Q: Cinnamon or nutmeg?A: Cinnamon is a nice spice people are comfortable consuming throughout the year, sprinkled either on toast or in a delicious coffee beverage.

There will be a half-eaten box of Triscuits there, because every office kitchen in existence contains a half-eaten box of Triscuits in the cupboard behind the fridge. Triscuit dust is an acceptable snack when poured into a small paper cup and drunk in the manner of water. Do not use a straw.- - -Q: My boyfriend didn???t care if I worked the holiday. Is our relationship in trouble?A: Perhaps your boyfriend wanted to watch football unencumbered and without you fussing around with gravy boats and miniature marshmallows. If your boyfriend is a fresh-faced soap star who wants to move up to Broadway, look for him tap dancing his heart out in front of Macy???s around 10:35 a.m.- - -Q: I???ve been answering calls from perplexed home cooks all day and I still don???t know why we bother, really.A: Everyone talks about the bickering relatives and the burnt yams, but few talk about taking a weekday to eat and nap and gossip with a sibling about another sibling. No one owns it. No focus group studies it. Just you and a mostly empty bowl of stuffing and no clean utensils, so use your fingers already.ANNOUNCEMENTBuilding off our Alphabetically Organized Strangers campaign, we???ve again united with Amy Krouse Rosenthal???this time to bring some much-needed order to your holiday season. (If we had to describe getting the family together to eat and drink inordinately, predictable wouldn???t be high on the list.) That???s why, in the spirit of Rosenthal???s new alphabetized picture book Awake Beautiful Child, we???re asking our readers to arrange their family members in alphabetical order.BASICSThis Thanksgiving and beyond, we???re looking for two pictures of your family. The first should capture your relations in a normal setting???sitting on the couch, playing badminton, standing around a barbecue, gossiping in dark corners. For the second picture, ask those same family members if they???ll kindly rearrange themselves alphabetically, by their first name.Share both pictures on Twitter (our handle is @mcsweeneys), using the hashtag #abcrelatives. If you???d like, you can include the alphabetized family members??? first names when you tweet the photo. We???ll also be collecting our favorite pictures at the bottom of this page.CONTESTBy sharing your pictures, you???ll automatically be entered into a contest to win a free tote bag???we???ll be giving out a new one every day. What???s more, each week two participants will be randomly chosen to win a signed copy of Awake Beautiful Child.DENOUEMENTFor more alphabetized excitement, don???t miss Rosenthal and illustrator Gracia Lam???s Awake Beautiful Child. In its starred review of the book, Publishers Weekly exclaims that ???Rosenthal again demonstrates h",100
381,"er ability to use wordplay to create stories with real emotional depth,??? while ???Lam???s debut couldn???t be more polished and confident: her palette seems to shift with the day???s waxing and waning light, while her crisp, screenprintlike images have an understated poise and precision that highlights the quiet magic of everyday moments.??? The book is available now on our online store, and you can save $5 off the cover price when you enter the promo code #abcrelatives.This sweet, simple story tells of a young child???s typical day???from morning to bedtime. Like the title, each scene is described in three-word ???ABC??? phrases, such as ???All Begins Cheerily.??? Secret ???ABC??? scenes hidden throughout the artwork???as a secondary ???seek and find??? game of sorts???will encourage multiple readings and reward close looking. An ideal book to read aloud just after waking or just before bed.EXAMPLES[Clockwise from bottom right: Abby, Amy, Carole, Cora, Jack, Jake, Jesse, Lily, Nikki][Cameron, Claire, Ruth, Steve]In these modern times, scientists are becoming increasingly diverse in their fields of study. They are not only drawing links towards other scientific fields, but they???re also connecting their work to the social sciences and humanities in a bid to answer some pretty heavy questions about who we are and how we got here.When I read about these hybrid fields, I can???t help but think we can create even more by making scientific mad libs.Anthropological geochemistry.Evolutionary psychology.Anthrobiogeochemistry.These are real fields, and they are fascinating.Anthropological genetics, which combines evolutionary and population genetics with cultural studies to answer questions about the biological drivers of human demographics, such as diversification of agriculture and the spread of disease, is one of these interesting new fields. Anthropological genetics pops up in television shows like Ancient Aliens, Becoming Human, and of course, Secrets of the Dead, a serial in which one episode focused on King Tutankhamen. I watched this particular episode with the realization that my childhood knowledge of King Tut has been radically revised.Having been tagged with the ???Gifted and Talented??? label back in elementary school, I was eligible to attend young scholar workshops held at the local high school. One class was a two-day affair on the life and times of King Tut, mixing lecture with an arts and crafts session to create a paper m??ch?? replica of his iconic casket and faceplate.As my eight-year-old self understood the lecture, Pharaohs were basically living gods (wealth, power, surrounded by good art) and that King Tut took the throne as a young teen after the death of his father. Tut made some heavy changes with the state religion, and died around 18 from a battle injury. He was then mummified and entombed along with a bunch of his stuff, and a millennia later became the subject of arts and crafts projects.The various depictions found within Tut???s tomb reveal a young man with large eyes, high cheekbones, and full lips ??? the very image of aristocracy. I couldn???t have told you what a ???crush??? was at the time, but that???s the best way to describe how I felt.When it came time to decorate the paper m??ch?? caskets, everything started out just fine, but went quickly went downhill as I got to Tut???s face. I managed to paint one perfect, almond-shaped eye, but the right eye was nowhere near equidistant from the bridge of the nose, which in turn was completely asymmetrical, and I hadn???t left any room for a mouth.I could???ve tried to fix it, but by this time I was bored by the whole activity and had moved on from my infatuation. I adopted what would become my default ???meh??? attitude that would take years to overcome, and painted a rough line between the left eye and the bridge of the nose, used more paint to widen the space, added a sort of nose-mouth hybrid, and called it a day.Years later, a new theory came out suggesting that King Tut probably did not die in battle after all; examination of his skeleton showed that his left foot was clubbed, making it impossible to walk unaided, let alone drive a chariot. Even more recent studies suggested that he had scoliosis, a cleft palate, and rather girlish hips. An artist recreation showed a severe overbite.Perhaps my rendition was more accurate than I thought.So what happened to our king that was supposedly created in the image of the gods?As it turns out, King Tut was severely inbred. We know this because mummy preservation techniques were also ideal for preserving DNA; the subsequent testing of King Tut and others buried within the Valley of the Kings proved that Akhenaten was indeed Tut???s father. However, Queen Nefertiti was not Tut???s mother, nor was the second queen, Kiya. A mummy identified as ???The Younger Lady??? was a perfect match for Tut???s mother, and oddly enough, his father???s full sister. This was a case of the royals wanting to keep the bloodline pure.The numerous issues that appear because of inbreeding are a result of genetics. Humans, like many other animals, have two copies of each gene. Small changes in the DNA exist, called alleles. If we have two identical alleles of the same gene, we are considered to be homozygous; two different alleles, we are heterozygous. Blood type, eye color, and hair color are all examples of allelic variation.When mid-19th century monk Gregor Mendel carried out the first known study in genetic inheritance using peas, he demonstrated that dominant traits are able to mask recessive traits.1 The specific molecular mechanisms that determine whether a trait is dominant or recessive may be different on a case-by-case basis,2 but a common theme is that a recessive allele codes for a nonfunctional protein, or no protein at all. Keep in mind that pea color is a rather innocuous example of a recessive trait. As it is in this cruel world, there are many known recessive genes that cause pretty severe physical problems, which brings us back to inbreeding. Continuous consanguineous pairings increase the frequency of homozygosity and the manifestation of recessive traits, and King Tut???s numerous defects can be attributed to the fact that his parents were brother and sister, inbreeding likely being the norm in the Thutmosid line.Another example: Charles II of Spain (b.1661), nicknamed ???Lo Hechizado??? (The Hexed). Charles II had severe physical and mental disabilities; he was epileptic, had an abulic personality, and drooled constantly due to a severe pronunciation of the lower jaw and a rather large tongue. The final blow was infertility, resulting in the replacement of the doomed Hapsburg line by the French Bourbons following his death. As the story goes the Spanish royals ceased outbreeding after 1550; from then on everyone in the family married close relatives with expected results. Calculations of the genetic structure of Charles II show that his frequency of homozygosity was higher than that of a hypothetical offspring of a brother-sister pairing.3These examples regarding royal lineages are extreme cases that demonstrate how damaging high frequencies of inbreeding can be. However, royal lineages alone do not account for all of the maintenance of genetic diseases caused by recessive alleles, and the presence of a genetic disease does not mean that the afflicted party is a result of inbreeding. If particular alleles are damaging to human mortality, why have they not simply become extinct?One reason recessive alleles persist is due to the fact that a heterozygous carrier becomes less susceptible to other maladies and presents overall good health. This phenomeno",100
382,"n is called ???heterozygote advantage.???The sickle cell anemia/malaria relationship is an example of heterozygote advantage. Sickle cell anemia is a blood disorder affecting individuals with two abnormal copies of the ???sickle type??? hemoglobin gene (HgbS/HgbS). Abnormal hemoglobin forms strands, forcing red blood cells to warp into a crescent or sickle shape, which results in their clumping within our circulatory system. Afflicted individuals have poor circulation, susceptibility to spleen disorders, and have a high risk of stroke. The tradeoff here is that individuals carrying one or more copies of HgbS, when infected, show only mild symptoms of malaria which is known historically as one of our deadliest diseases. There are several hypotheses as to why heterozygous individuals are less affected by malaria, centering on the observation that these individuals carry a lower pathogen load.4 5A second example of heterozygote advantage concerns cystic fibrosis and cholera. Cystic fibrosis occurs when an individual has two copies of a recessive allele that codes for a defective chloride channel (CTFR), affecting the regulation of fluids in our body. Afflicted individuals suffer from build-up of thick mucus which is ideal for microbial colonization, resulting in dangerous and chronic lung and sinus infections. Despite the recessive and debilitating nature of cystic fibrosis, the mutant allele still persists in human populations. The reasoning behind this is that people who carry a copy of the defective CTFR allele are more likely to survive cholera.Most of us that grew up in the 1990s remember cholera as one of the diseases that picked off virtual family members in the Oregon Trail computer game. Infection occurs after ingestion of bacterium Vibrio cholera, which makes its way into our intestinal tract and secretes a toxin (choleragen) ,that indirectly results in permanent opening of our chloride channels, which in turn results in an uncontrolled loss of bodily fluids in a terribly undignified way; A person afflicted with cholera may produce between 20 to 50 liters of diarrhea daily, with death soon resulting from dehydration. The consensus is that heterozygous individuals have fewer chloride channels to be stuck on OPEN, so fluid loss is less severe, leading to a higher chance of survival.These are just two known examples of heterozygote advantage known, with thousands more yet to be discovered.5 It is difficult to predict what nature will throw at us, so having a full arsenal of diverse genes is a safe bet. In the end, there is only so pure your bloodline can get before your family is scraped out of history, and your legacy is reduced to historians publishing unflattering CGI recreations of you.- -1 Mendel, GJ.

I am talking about Thanksgiving. You are probably seeing a lot of articles about what a turkey is and how to cook it. ???Wow,??? you might be saying to yourself, ???cooking a Thanksgiving turkey sounds hard and complicated and probably should be left to master chefs only!??? Well, I say ???Boo!??? to that. Not ???Boo!??? like a ghost would say, I???m saying ???Boo!??? like I disagree that cooking Thanksgiving dinner is hard. It is, literally, the easiest thing in the world. All you have to do is follow my instructions, use your intuition and go with the flow. Next thing you know, your guests will be saying ???Yay!??? and not ???Boo!??? ??? except for maybe that one friend of yours who always comes to Thanksgiving dinner dressed as a ghost and then says, ???Boo!??? all the time. I???m looking at you, Geraldine! So, here is how to do it???Wendy???s Easy Turkey Recipe:1. Go down to the grocery store, the one where you are still allowed to shop. Select and pay for the turkey of your choice. You can try to get away with not paying for it by putting it in your shirt and then sashaying out the door like a goddamned princess, but if the turkey falls out right when you are passing the security guard, he may or may not believe that you had a frozen turkey baby right then and that that makes sense because your mom was a turkey and it skips generations. I know that putting a turkey up your shirt and sashaying sounds like the absolutely perfect plan but let???s just say that things can and do go wrong with plans like that so just take that under consideration and then proceed.2. Once you get the turkey home and you have had a few drinks of water or wine or whatever ??? honestly, there???s nothing wrong with Nyquil in moderation ??? it???s time to get that turkey a-cooking. And if, like me, you are terrified of your oven and you think maybe you left a casserole in there a long time ago when you thought you had a date, then it will be a huge relief to know you don???t have to use it at all. In fact, turn right now and scream at your stove, ???You can???t control me!??? Now we???re gettin??? in that Thanksgiving mood! Go to your medicine cabinet and look for some tanning oil ??? not sunscreen because that might slow down the turkey cooking ??? but that good ol??? fashioned stuff from the ???80s that helped you tan faster. Slather the tanning oil liberally on the raw, now semi-frozen turkey. It???s probably smelling great already!3. Take the turkey outside behind the carport. Important: Do not let Steve in apartment #7 see you doing this. He gets really mad and calls the police, and even though putting a raw turkey on the hood of someone???s vehicle to cook is not really against any law, it???s gonna cut into your day if the cops show up because it will be kind of hard to explain to a police officer what you are up to no matter how much Nyquil you???ve had. Okay, now, place the turkey on the hood of Steve???s car in that spot with great sun exposure.4.	The actual cooking is going to take three to four days, so it???s really important to verify that Steve has already flown to his mom???s house in Kansas City for the whole week. You can do this by casually pounding on Steve???s door at various intervals and saying stuff like, ???Are you there, Steve?!??? and ???What about that date we were supposed to have that one time!???? and ???Boo!??? Yes, go ahead and say ???Boo!??? I know that???s Geraldine???s thing but honestly why should she have all the fun?5.	While you are waiting for the turkey to slowly cook in the sun (AKA God???s oven) for three or four days (just taste it every few hours to see how it???s doing), why not whip up some fun sides? Do you want to make some stuffing? Well, the key word to stuffing is ???stuff.??? So, just look around your apartment for some ???stuff??? you aren???t using, like receipts, Beanie Babies, hand soap, and all of Steve???s mail. Mix it in a bowl and then go outside and put it in the turkey. Don???t worry if it cooks as long as the turkey or not because none of that is food anyway. You know what is fine if you run out of Nyquil? Benadryl. And did you ever notice that chips are delicious and that you know where Steve???s hide-a-key is?6.	Here are some other sides you c",100
383,"an make while you are waiting for the turkey to cook and watching TV at Steve???s. Mashed potatoes, baked potatoes, green beans, baked beans, yams, hams, clams, and jams. Make what ever you want. I can???t control you! You can???t control anyone in this life, least of all Steve.7.	Check the turkey. If it feels like your friends are coming over soon, maybe a way to get that turkey cooking faster is to drive around town in Steve???s car, that way the turkey is getting heated by the sun and by the engine. It will be done in no time probably.8.	Boo!9.	See? It???s fun.10.	Notice that at this point you are most of the way to Kansas City, the turkey is cooking nicely, and you might as well push on through. A lot of people think it is too far to drive from Los Angeles to Kansas City, but it???s really not that bad.11.	It???s amazing that the NyQuil isn???t even really making you tired anymore. You feel powerful and amazing. You cooked a turkey! This must be how Geraldine feels, with all her ghost antics!12.	Stop in at the Bed Bath & Beyond near Steve???s mom???s house for a white sheet. Cut eyeholes in it. Baste.13.	By the time you get to Steve mom???s house around midnight, your turkey should be nicely browned and have a terrific tanning oil/Beanie Baby smell. It???s snowing lightly and you just know Steve is in there living it up.14.	Slip the ghost costume over your head, making sure you can see through the eyeholes. Take the turkey off of Steve???s car hood and place it nicely in your hands. If you???ve cooked any sides, fill your pockets with them15.	Scoot on up to Steve???s mom???s front door. Ring the bell. Boy, wait ???til Steve sees you dressed as a ghost holding a turkey stuffed with his wet mail. This date will be even better than the first one you never had!16.	Listen to the sound of footsteps approaching.17.	Enjoy!""I am the go-to person for all things mazes.

I wanted to interview Schur for The Believer because he is a believer. His faith in the power of optimism and kindness underscores all of his work, and binge-watching one of his series is the filmic equivalent of eating comfort food. (When my grandpa died a few years ago, a friend showed up at my apartment with Parks & Rec DVDs in hand.) But Schur???s sentimentality never feels clich?????in fact, his work is smart, original, absurd, and even subversive.

We wrote a script and made jokes that I???m sure were terrible and showed clips of The Naked Gun without permission. Then in college I got on to the Harvard Lampoon staff my freshman year. Once I graduated, I moved to New York, and got hired at Saturday Night Live that December.BLVR: Your first year at SNL was the year Chris Farley and Phil Hartman died, right?MS: Yeah, and Norm Macdonald got fired, which obviously pales in comparison, but it was a weird upheaval. My first show was the first show after Chris had died and Norm got fired. SNL is 100 percent sink or swim. The first day, I showed up and no one was there. Not one other person: no receptionist or interns or people at all. Honestly, I thought a prank had been pulled on me. So I just nervously sat down on a couch and stared straight ahead for an hour. People started to filter in, but I was too nervous to even say anything. Finally someone was like, ???I think your office is over there,??? and someone else was like, ???We have a meeting now where you can pitch ideas to Samuel L. Jackson.??? No one told me anything. That???s the way that place operates???they throw you into the fire. The nice thing is, they give you some time to figure it out. If you don???t get a sketch on for three or four shows, they don???t fire you, but it was a scary and jarring introduction to the world. Because of the shift, no one paid attention to me, which was nice, because I sucked at sketch writing for a pretty long time. If it hadn???t been for that upheaval at the show, it???s possible I would???ve come under greater scrutiny.BLVR: Do you remember the first sketch you got on the air?MS: The first joke I got on the air I remember clearly. Dennis McNicholas and Robert Carlock wrote a sketch where they were evacuating the Titanic, and the last two guys on the entire ship were the two black guys, Samuel L. Jackson and Tracy Morgan. So Will Ferrell was running back and forth, saying, ???All first-class passengers get in the lifeboat. All second-class passengers and third-class passengers get in the lifeboat. Let???s get all the animals in the lifeboat. Let???s put all the empty luggage in the lifeboat.??? It was very funny. And then the joke that I wrote, which was the first thing I ever wrote that was on TV, was ???All empty lifeboats should now be placed in other lifeboats.??? Even though 99.4 percent of the sketch was conceived of, written, and executed by other people, just seeing words I had written be performed on SNL, I felt like: I can quit now.

Locate the oldest part of campus, given away by the commemorative plaque that pays tribute to the historical significance of the original college and its mission. It may have been a teacher???s college started by the state with a land grant, in which case the university would still boast several thriving departments related to the field of education, but the school would have long ago adapted into an institution with far more exciting fields of study, like TV production, or entrepreneurship. The name on the plaque will bear the pride of another era, so that in the South the school may have been Dixie College, or Lee College, and snooping around the old buildings one might uncover dated iconography: a statue of Jefferson Davis, or crossed sabers in bas relief above the entrance to the ROTC building. The liberal arts building will be found among these middling originals, including any domed, pillared, or steepled structures, though the liberal arts building will bear no accouterments. It will be a rectangular pile of bricks no taller than three stories but very likely only two. As a division of the university devoted entirely to ideas, all liberal arts has ever needed were classrooms. The offices of liberal arts professors will be scattered across campus, though the offices of the liberal arts departments ??? English, History, Philosophy, Foreign Languages, Art History ??? will be found on the upper floors at each end of the building. These offices are where students will try to get their schedules changed once they???ve discovered that they should have heeded the warnings on RateMyProfessor, because their teacher really is an insufferable bore. At the beginning of the semester this line will be out the door and the mild liberal arts professors will have to say ???Excuse me, excuse me,??? both in going and coming as they make their way to the copy machine.One can look through the tall windows of the liberal arts building at any time of day, because the thick aluminum Mad Men-era blinds will have slats missing or one may be permanently raised, with the cord broken off a decade ago and no way to bring the blinds back down. Look through the square panes of antique glass with the window trim covered in a thick shell of a century???s worth of layers of brown paint, to mismatched desks, an unused broom closet, a darkly varnished wooden lectern, like looking in at the sanctuary of a long-abandoned Puritan church. There might still be chalkboards with the painted message in the top right corner, a remnant of the nineteen-eighties that says, ???No smoking,??? and the wooden floors creak as the famished unshaven cleric of the cult of ideas paces back-and-forth in his corduroy jacket with suede elbow patches, something he got for himself that he wears like a prop. In the winter, the room is overheated by the giant radiator nestled in the back, and a window will be open. The window will also be open in the summer, because the air-conditioning unit retrofitted against an outer wall can???t handle the high ceilings, and so it???s better to hope for a breeze, even when it???s hot outside. The number of students in the room will be in inverse proportion to the professor???s age. The older the professor, the less populated, most everyone preferring the desks in the back. The earlier in the day it is, the younger the teacher, the room filled to capacity, not because the students wanted to take the class or admired the reputation of the professor, but because they were required to take the class, with the course listing referring to the teacher as ???staff.???The single twenty-first century addition is the LCD projector that hangs from the middle of the ceiling and is always on, for the faded light of the PowerPoint slides that accompany the lecture on Western history, more specifically: Bach history, or Vermeer history, or Wordsworth history, or Aristotle history, or Napoleon history.

There???s a student center bursting with express versions of fast food restaurants where students work and also stand in zigzagged roped-off lines, with flat screens that play music videos paid for by media conglomerates, and video billboards that advertise student government elections, recital concerts, and a comedian. This is the new center of campus, where the proud buildings are, like the giant new library, which is a building with row after row of always occupied computers in it, where the books on the upper-floors are only accidentally wandered into, the shelves occasionally moved around or cleared, heaps of the cloth-bound dust-collectors sold off in penny sales on tables set up out front. There are Wi-Fi hotspots in the quad that attract laptop worshippers with machines in laps, and a student strums a guitar near the bent I-beams of an abstract sculpture.Back among the older buildings on campus, there???s a bell tower and a flagpole with an American flag. Travel with me back in time a decade and a half, and walk with me into the expansive corner office of the English Department chair, as he offers me the job I???ll labor at for nine years, a one-year position that renewed automatically, up to three years, at which time I would reapply for some bureaucratic reason, but they???d kept me on as a teacher for as long as I was willing to accept the insulting salary and baffling title of full-time temporary instructor. As a leader in the gang of liberal arts, the English Department chair was impressed that I???d gone to a Jesuit university and that, like him, I was from the Midwest. By then I???d had fifteen years of teaching experience, I had studied with relatively famous writers, I had a Ph.D. and a growing list of publications. What he was most impressed with, however, was that I had spent a semester in Rome, a time when I really could have steeped myself in the liberal arts, but, unbeknownst to my new boss, I mostly drank Roman wine, smoked American cigarettes, and traveled on a Eurail Pass.He apologized for the brutal course load I would soon take on and he suggested there was really nothing one could do with university administrators who were numbers people and who would never grasp the incompatibility of writing instruction and high occupancy classrooms. He lamented the unchecked growth of the university and he took down a rolled-up yellowing blueprint, some defunct architect???s vision of the university???s master plan. He unrolled the map between us and there in the new quad he pointed to the popular library, the carpeted central-air-equipped sprawling business building, the state-of-the-art computer sciences building, and a building that was represented there in outline but didn???t exist.He said it slowly to let it sink in, ???The new liberal arts building.??????It never happened,??? I said.???It did not happen,??? he said, and he rolled the blueprint up and put it back where he kept it on top of his bookshelf, evidence of a now unbelievable idea that had almost gotten through the budget committee before everything changed.The department chair who had hired me would retire during my nine-year stint and a new hiring process would come with the new chair, so that my reapplication every three years was no longer a formality. I was suddenly competing in a national search for the job I already had, where abstract candidates from elsewhere created a better impression on paper, because, like the liberal arts building, I???d been around too long. I was too familiar and there was a certain indescribable funk about me. With the new regime came a required textbook for writing classes and a lot of talk about grade inflation. Each semester the grades I issued would be presented back to me on a graph that was supposed to adhere to a bell shape. There were English Department meetings where gray-haired professors said things like, ???The gentleman???s ???C??? has become the gentleman???s ???B???,??? and they voted not to let full-time temporary instructors like myself, a substantial minority at one-third of the department, have a vote at the insufferable meetings we were required to attend.When the new department chair called me mid-June to let me know my reapplication had been denied, that I hadn???t even made the top twenty candidates for the position I???d already spent nine years in, I called the director of composition who was the chair of the hiring committee to see if there was something I???d done wrong. My novel had come out that year and, since I was a writing teacher, I had thought it would make me look good. If the hiring committee had been a tenure and promotion committee, the publication of my book would have cemented my place at this university, and I thought this year???s reapplication would be more of a formality than in years past. When I was told I wouldn???t be rehired, I was shocked, confused, and upset.Over the phone, the director of composition explained, ???You seem more interested in writing than in teaching.??????I???m a writing teacher,??? I said. ???I teach writing.???She said, ???Won???t you be glad you won???t be teaching???????I???ve only ever been a teacher,??? I said. ???It???s the middle of June. No one is going to hire me.??????But you???ll have more time to write.???Everything on hiring committees is done in secret. They didn???t have to tell me anything. Except that, since I???d worked there for nine years, when I asked about the process, people were honest with me. I was told that I had apparently made the mistake of mentioning, on my reapplication letter, that despite a heavy teaching schedule of five classes per semester, because my classes were stacked on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, the job had made it possible for me to get writing done twice a week, and there were people on the committee who were unhappy that I should speak so bluntly. An idea can float in a committee because one person airs it, and everyone else, swayed by the truism, agrees. There was the sentiment that I was ???using??? teaching so I could write, as bizarre as that sounds, which isn???t at all like ???using??? a job waiting tables so one can write, or ???using??? a landscaping job so one can write, because the teaching of writing is directly related to the practice of writing, but somehow these colleagues of mine didn???t see it that way.Believe it or not, there are a lot of English teachers who teach writing classes who don???t actually write themselves. They did. Or they wanted to. But they haven???t published and at some point they stopped trying. Sometimes teachers are hired for their potential, and sometimes, though they don???t live up to their potential, they have a way of sticking around.The truth of the matter was that I had worked very hard to carve out time for writing while teaching nearly twice the number of students and classes as most of the professors on the hiring committee. And my writing life and my career as a teacher were suddenly in jeopardy because I hadn???t anticipated how someone might read one line of a reapplication letter that had until recently been a formality.???He???s using teaching to write.??????He???s more interested in writing than in teaching.???",100
386,"???Now he can have more time to write.???Tenure is going the way of the liberal arts building, a relic that???s out of fashion and hard to stick up for. What it???s being replaced by is made up on the fly. Teaching five classes per semester should kill the urge or the ability to write, except that it hasn???t. We knew that the numbers people who run universities didn???t really understand us and their influence has led to the death of tenure and untenable teaching loads. But when writing isn???t valued by English professors, anyone who wants to write is basically fucked.- Hello, it???s me.- Who is this?- I was wondering if after all these years you???d like to meet to go over everything.- I???m sorry, I think you have the wrong number.- They say that time???s supposed to heal you, but I ain???t done muchhealing.- Oh, I get it.

Anne Louise Germaine Necker, Baronne de Sta??l-Holstein (hereafter referred to as Germaine to save us all considerable time), was a formidable woman, and made herself the canker on Napoleon???s tongue, but she may not have been his worst enemy. At least no worse an enemy than, say, I don???t know, Russia. Nevertheless, she was a bee in Napoleon???s bicorne hat. (A hat that was purchased at auction one year ago for $2.4 million, by the way. I hope you didn???t miss your chance to buy it or the always useful lock of Napoleon???s hair, which sold for a mere $50,000. You have to stay on top of the ads or these deals will pass you by.)1But let???s talk about Germaine.In 1786, when Germaine was twenty years old, newly married, and making her debut into society, she was presented at Versailles to King Louis XVI and Queen Marie Antoinette. The custom was to make three curtsies, kneel, and kiss the hem of the queen???s dress. Germaine tripped on her own dress during the third curtsy and ???fell flat on her face.???2 This was not a cute little Jennifer Lawrence stumble with a quick recovery. This was a woman splayed out on the floor, in front of basically every important person in France, requiring ???a gaggle of courtiers??? to get her back on her feet.2 A whole gaggle, you guys; that???s probably an embarrassing amount of help. In the moment her face hit the floor, a gauntlet was inadvertently thrown; those bound to love her began loving her then, for grace (not the physical kind) under pressure and the humor she showed through the incident, while those determined to hate her decided she was too uncivilized to be tolerated.I know this is starting to sound a bit like a Taylor Swift song, but read on and you???ll see we???re moving into Adele territory.No one, not even Germaine herself, would argue that she was good at minding her own business. Ever. She was loud, tall, sturdy in frame and conviction. You know that person at a cocktail party who barges into your conversation and takes it over without regard for whatever was already being discussed? Germaine de Sta??l was that person. And you would have been glad to have her intrusion, not only to help extricate you from whatever awkward small talk you???d been enduring, but because she was smart and vivacious and captivating. Conversation was an art form to her, and while she could be a bit of a bully, she took her conversational skills seriously and used them to put people at ease, to entertain, and, perhaps even more often than she intended, to make people examine their own views of the world.Germaine???s father",100
388,", Jacques Necker, was France???s Director General of Finance before and during the French Revolution, making him second in power only to King Louis XVI. Fun fact about Louis XVI: he lost his head to the guillotine in January 1793.The 18th-century French Revolution was a fascinatingly dangerous time for absolutely everyone. Necker was clearly very close to the king and his financial decisions, which were galvanizing the revolutionaries. (You???ve heard of Marie Antoinette saying ???Let them eat cake,??? right? She reportedly said that famous phrase ??? though scholars argue she did not ??? about the armed women who stormed Versailles demanding lower costs for bread, and the phrase became a symbol for how out of touch the monarchy was with the French bourgeoisie. Marie Antoinette was guillotined, as well.) Necker, on the other hand, was exiled a couple of times but escaped the revolution with his life. This is almost disappointing, given the prevalence of the guillotine at the time and the fact that Necker has the word ???neck??? right in his name. Seems like a missed opportunity.Thanks in part to Necker???s status in the royal court, Germaine???s childhood ??? indeed, her entire life ??? was extraordinarily privileged. To give you an idea, at one point her father loaned 2.5 million livres (somewhere around 50 million dollars today) of his own money to the royal treasury. I don???t know how many of you have millions handy that you could loan to a country (I know you???re saving up now for that lock of Napoleon???s hair), but such was life for the Neckers.Surely you???re wondering how many things this uber rich woman could possibly be pissed off about, besides having to wear skirts that are long enough to trip over. I???ll give you five and promise you that this list should be much longer.1.	The men in her life shaped and in many ways controlled it: her father (whom she adored), King Louis XVI (who could have saved her from exile if he???d kept his head and his throne), her husband (more about him in a minute), her lovers (I never said she was chaste), her sons, and the list goes on. Such circumstances are common among women throughout history, but this male domination was intense for Germaine because of her money and status. She never was able to fly under anyone???s radar.2.	She was traded like a horse: forced to marry Eric Magnus de Sta??l Holstein so that Sweden could gain part of an island in the Caribbean. Now, while there were surely times when my parents would have traded me in marriage for a pack of gum, suffice it to say most of us get to choose our life partners and can pause now to consider how deeply upsetting our lives would be if we couldn???t. Baron de Sta??l was 30 years old when the marriage was first arranged; Germaine was 12. She always found him distasteful and boring, but she had no choice.3.	She was never considered physically attractive. Oh, boo-hoo, you???re saying, suck it up, Germaine, and get on with your life. But this matters, especially if you???re living in a time when it???s considered more important for a woman to be physically attractive than educated, well-spoken, smart, political, or anything else that might help her feel valued. (Wait ??? am I still talking about the 18th century or is this perhaps also a fairly accurate description of the 21st?)4.	She searched her entire life for true, passionate love, and believed she???d found it more than once, only to be rejected and betrayed. (You???re hearing Adele in your head right now, aren???t you?)5.	And oh yeah, the series of incidents in which Napoleon Bonaparte, self-appointed Emperor of France and wearer of the previously mentioned very wide and expensive hat, exiled her from her beloved Paris and eventually, from all of France.Why did Napoleon need Germaine out of the country, you ask? The short (pun intended) answer is that he had a Napoleon complex. (Is that too obvious a thing to point out?) Napoleon???s antagonism toward Germaine is a classic example of him compensating for his small stature by being far too aggressive; he was deeply uncomfortable with Germaine???s family connections, her social and political sway, and the fact that she had the nerve to be female.Napoleon needed people to like him and Germaine made it clear that she neither liked nor respected him. When Germaine???s son, Auguste, asked Napoleon to allow Germaine back into Paris, Napoleon said, ???Paris is???where I live. I don???t want anyone there who doesn???t like me.???3 I don???t know if anyone took a poll of Parisians about this matter, but it seems to me that the man who had appointed himself Emperor and led France into a 16-year series of wars may not have been as popular as he might have believed. Germaine was one of very few people to speak truth to power and point out Napoleon???s errors.Germaine was first exiled from Paris in 1796 because it was rumored that she supported a restored monarchy in France. Some time later she returned to Paris, only to be exiled again for associating with Girondists, who???d fought to end the monarchy. It seemed she couldn???t take a side without being wrong.Though Germaine likely never saw it this way, exile gave her some much-needed freedom to openly criticize Napoleon as well as explore other cultures. She demanded that Napoleon???s government pay back the money her father had loaned to France. She wrote letters, essays, novels, and books extolling her diverse and quite modern beliefs. She refused to write compliments to Napoleon or his government, refused to be silent.Even Napoleon???s close friends and some family members sided with Germaine, but his beef with her was personal and impossible to legitimize. Nevertheless, she kept sauntering back into Paris, only to be found and ejected once again. She just kept trying, apparently thinking Napoleon would tire of the exercise. He did not, and their weird dance continued for 12 years. When she wrote De l???Allemagne, her masterpiece on Germany, containing her argument that France should integrate other cultures, Napoleon destroyed all 5,000 print copies and the typesetters??? lead fonts.2 Today???s equivalent would be burning all paper copies and dismantling the hard drive of the computer on which it was written. Even Adele can???t write a song sad enough to encompass the anger and loss any writer would feel after such childish destruction.What must life have been like for Germaine? Imagine being married to a man you don???t love, raising children with another man you thought you loved but who would eventually betray you, seeking love with others who would also scar you, running the most successful salons4 of your time, writing prolifically on subjects integral to your time yet relevant centuries later, and, on top of all of that, being repeatedly forced to leave your home country. Other aspects of her life were difficult, but Germaine never fully recovered from having to leave her beloved France; she called exile ???a form of hell??? and ???death in miniature.???5That???s not a very sunshiny note to end on, and yet there it is. The most colorful and influential lives are not always happy ones.I???m barely scratching the surface here, dear readers, so I hope that you will pick up the books listed at the end of this article, as well as the many fascinating books written by Germaine herself. This is another woman who should have been (and who made it clear that she most certainly was) pretty pissed off. And another that should be remembered.

Way back when I first opened this place, I said, ???Man, this is it. I???ve joined a community. I???m staying here forever.??? The calendar pages dropped away as I made my home, waved to my neighbors, and swept the shattered glass below my driver???s side window every Monday morning. Then, it happened. Completely out of the blue, my carpet liquidation center that???d been going out of business for 11 straight years, was suddenly going out of business! And I never saw it coming!Sure the world???s always in flux. Nothing stays the same. But when I wrote the words ???carpet liquidation??? on the lease agreement and taped those first signs to the storefront: THEY???RE SHUTTING US DOWN, and EVERYTHING MUST GO and 3-FOR-1 UNTIL THE SIRENS GET CLOSER, I thought I was creating something permanent. But a mere decade later, the only thing permanent is the masking tape that once gripped those signs to the glass. No blade has a chance against the hardened detritus left on my windows. The next owner is buying new panes, for sure.I always thought rug clearance was such a stable enterprise. For years, I watched the local kids ride their bikes up and down the sidewalk. Smoke black tar heroin in the parking lot. Watch me load special midnight shipments through the rollup door in the alley. Remember the time I got shot? I do.Seems like yesterday I hired someone to dress like a sheriff and padlock the doors while the customers still browsed inside. Boy, I made some sales that day! And now, unfathomably, my little neighborhood liquidation center is liquidating. The padlocks are real this time. Chrome plated steel.I had the knack for liquidation, too. Anyone could knock 50% off a roll of carpet, so I???d go 60%, 75%. Sometimes more. That???s not for the faint-of-heart. You need a strong spiritual center to put up signs like: 95% OFF OUR ENTIRE STOCK WHILE OUR ELECTRICITY STILL WORKS!But I was a good marketer. I sold Persian rugs. I sold Turkish rugs. I even sold Perkish rugs. (Made that one up on the spot for another great payday!) I even unloaded that aquamarine short wool remnant with the one stringy flap for $15.99. Nice, huh?I thought I was doing everything right. I managed to stay going out of business longer than all the other storefronts in my strip mall: Hardcover-Books-A-Dozen, Couch Leg Land, the Year-Round Chanukkah Store. That should count for something.But, sadly, it does not. At least I can go back to using my real name. I???ll no longer change it for the business license every year to avoid temp-zoning-mandated relocation, maintaining an operational bathroom, and providing heat. Although, I have to admit, there was a certain freedom in a newly-minted pseudonym every cycle. ???Freddie Lancaster??? was my favorite. He wore a hairnet, grew a neck-beard, and sold a lot of Flokati shag.Unfortunately, I???m destined to be a liquidator no more. It was a combination of things, really. Slim sales margins. Competition from the Internet. All the fluorescent tubes in the showroom incessantly flickering. To think I won???t have to look at the expired flies scattered across the clear flat panels on the fixtures anymore. Most of those corpses were from the last carpet liquidation center that occupied the space anyway. From 1991 to 2004.Sure, I feel like I let the neighborhood down. That???s only natural. When a carpet liquidation center enters the community, people expect it to be around for a long, long time. Carpet liquidators that are going out of business aren???t supposed to just leave. It???s bad form. And can really screw with a liquidator???s reputation.But while closing the doors where my kids grew up, where my best memories were forged, where my carbon footprint was ostentatiously stamped, is devastating to my psyche, my family, and my assortment of miniature forklifts, something good can still come of it.Namely, huge savings! Because this isn???t your everyday liquidation sale! This carpet liquidation center actually is going out of business! 99% off everything, motherfuckers! Free installation until I skip zip codes! If you don???t buy it, I???ll goddamn burn it!!!!!!Make sure you come see me at my new location just off North Fairfax and Selma Avenue.Portrait by Kelly Bjork- -I meet Ryder at a coffee shop near my place. It???s a stylish, echoey space with white walls and giant windows, and the barista is so friendly it makes me uneasy. It???s late in the evening, and no one???s around. Ryder and I find a table overlooking the children???s play area, a toy-strewn alcove with waxy plastic chairs in bright colors.Ryder is slim and freckled and has facial piercings and neatly manicured eyebrows. (Note: Ryder identifies as trans/genderqueer and prefers the gender-neutral pronouns they/their, which I???ll use throughout.) I have a couple memories of Ryder from the night of the shooting, but most are vague and snap-shotty, leftovers from the police station. Seated across from me now, Ryder is still, but their presence imparts a poised and aerodynamic quality, in the way of a horseracing jockey who???s waiting for the bell.I notice the milk in my tea has clumped into tiny wads that won???t stir away, and then I ask Ryder what they were doing at The Twilight Exit. Ryder tells me a friend was having her birthday party there, and this gathering would double as a GLITUR meeting. ???It stands for Glorious Liberated??? no, wait.??? says Ryder, laughing that they can???t remember. ???Oh my god. It stands for Grand Legions of Incendiary and Tenacious Unicorn Revolutionaries. It???s a queer / performance / anarchist / anti-cop / activist group. We met through the Occupy movement. We???d all go to protests and dress up crazy,??? says Ryder.Ryder was running a little late that night, and before they went inside, they???d stopped ???solidly inside the alley??? to have a conversation with an ???older gentleman??? in a wheelchair. (I???ve seen this guy before. He appears to be homeless, though Ryder notably doesn???t include this as the first detail, or in any of the details, actually. They just say the guy was African-American, had gray stubble, and wore a hat.)Ryder continues, ???",100
390,"I thought he was asking me for a smoke, so I was rolling him a cigarette. But it turned out he was trying to give me one of his cigarettes so I would bum him some change. I was saying, ???I???m trying to give you a cigarette, but I don???t have any money.??? He was saying, ???No, I???ll give you a cigarette.??? We were confused and laughing. It was a sweet interaction.???Ryder noticed James approach from the rear of alley. ???He walked past us in a rush. I only saw his back. I wasn???t really paying attention because I was looking down at the guy in the wheelchair. Then I heard Greg say something like, ???No, man, you???re not allowed back in,??? and I stopped what I was doing and focused on them.??????What do you remember about James???? I said.???He was worked up, but he had a purpose,??? says Ryder. ???He held his ground steadily, he didn???t step back. I heard ???I???m gonna get her. Let me in.??? And: ???She killed my dog.??? He was repeating it. He and Greg had a couple other exchanges, but that???s what I heard the most. The whole mission seemed to be, like, James had to get into the bar to find a woman that killed his dog.??????Greg was trying to calm him. He???d put both his hands up, I remember seeing his palms. He was making a downward hand motion. He said something, I don???t know what. James did get quiet for a second, but then he reached into his side and pulled out a gun. His body was turned in a way so I could see it clearly,??? said Ryder.???Did you freak out when you saw the gun???? I said.???No. I???ve worked in social services for years, and I???ve had some crisis-response training. I???ve dealt with emergency situations and violent situations. So, I was more in work mode, where I stay really clear and calm and hyper-alert,??? said Ryder.???What happened after the gun came out???? I said.???The first thing I heard Greg say was, ???You don???t want to do this.??? Greg was trying to deescalate James, and he was doing an amazing job. He was saying, ???It???s not worth it. Don???t go there. Turn around and walk away. Deal with it after you???ve calmed down.?????????Where were you? Still standing close by???? I said.???The guy in the wheelchair and I had backed up from the alleyway and we were on the sidewalk by then, and I???d motioned to him to move to the opposite side of the alley. I was standing behind the building???s corner. I pulled out my phone and dialed 911, but I didn???t push ???send.??? I was watching and waiting.??????What were you waiting for???? I said.???I???ve had to call 911 hundreds of times, and I really didn???t want to have to call it again. I???d seen the cops act in what they perceived as crisis situations,??? said Ryder. ???This interaction was complicated. I knew if the cops got involved, they would only escalate it.???We talk more about Ryder???s former job. They were a manager in a supportive apartment building for chronically homeless people with substance-abuse and mental-health issues. ???My coworkers and I knew these folks intimately. We???d seen them every day for years and years. We knew what to expect. We were familiar with their histories, their lifelong traumas, their generational traumas. You watch these crises repeat and repeat and repeat. We were dealing with trauma all the time, but in a very different context.??????We???d seen why cops must have their approaches, for their own safety. But also they never tailored their tactics to fit what was actually going on. Their actions would vary between different teams, and some had a violence-first kind of response.??? Ryder gives me specific examples. These stories involve cops using tasers and clubs, or beating civilians in enclosed spaces, but Ryder asks that I not share details to protect the anonymity of their former clients. (For the same reason, ???Ryder??? is a pseudonym.)???OK. So you???ve moved away, you???re watching, you???re holding the phone.??? I said. ???What happens next? Where was Greg???????When James first approached, the door had been propped open, but at some point Greg must???ve closed the door. Now Greg was backed into the entryway. He was still talking, saying something about, ???There???s other ways to live with this. You don???t wanna go in this direction.?????????And how was James responding???? I said.???He wasn???t to that stage of, like, ???I???m gonna get you, Bouncer!??? James???s elbow was locked on his hip. It wasn???t an I???m-shooting-right-now pose. It was more like, ???I???m holding this in a threatening manner.??? James???s body was tense. Not an aggressive tense but like a panicky tense. He was scared. Terrified,??? they said. ???James kept saying, ???I don???t want to hurt anybody. Just let me in. I don???t want to hurt you.??? He said it many times. That was very significant to me.???I notice Ryder???s eye contact, and how consistently direct it is.???I don???t think James was simply a mad person or an uber-violent person. His choices had to do with what he believed were his lack of options.Violence might???ve been the only thing that???d ever shown him a response. He probably had a pattern around this. I???m not trying to minimize the horrific violence he was enacting. He was not being smart about it, but he was responding from a very emotional place.???During the exchange, ???Greg had a little time, and he tried lots of different tactics. I???ve been in his spot before. I was in bodily in danger. I was close to being stabbed. When you???re in that moment, you???re gonna try everything you possibly have,??? said Ryder. ???I think he really got into James for one moment. I don???t know what was said, but I saw a pause, a brief pause. James slowed way down. I watched James???s body language shift and he tilted to the side and started wavering. There was an openness, or a kind of loosening that happened. His shoulders dropped, the tension he was holding melted away. I could tell Greg got James to question what he was doing.??????I believe James knew what was gonna happen at that moment. ???If I do this, I???m going to get killed.??? The rate of suicide by police is really high. If you have a gun out and you fire at anybody, you are going to get killed by the cops. I think he knew right then he gonna die,??? said Ryder.???Then I saw James make himself come around. He worked his steam back up ??? not to the same bravado energy he arrived with, though. It was a little more knowing. He made a movement like he was going forward with his plan. His body got kind of angled. He took on this tippy side-to-side demeanor. His shoulders and his hips shifted, very subtly. He lowered the gun stuck it out more aggressively,??? said Ryder.???The fear came back. The fear came back. And then it was pretty short time. James started to push forward, and then Greg, keeping his hands up, tried to push him away and stop him from coming in the door. That???s when James fired. Right before he shot, he very clearly dropped his arm to the side so he would hit Greg???s thigh. It was a significant drop.??????I was right at the corner when the gunman fired. I saw a small white burst of light,??? said Ryder. ???As soon as the gun went off, I hit the send button on my phone. I had a ton of guilt about calling the cops. It was extremely traumatic for me when they showed up.??????What happened???? I said.- - -Alley beside the Twilight Exit.Photo courtesy of the Seattle Police Department.When I took the oath of office, I swore to do everything I could to protect the citizens of this state from harm. There is nothing more important to me than ensuring that we are safe and can gather in our public places without fear of mass, indiscriminate violence. The nightm",100
391,"are scenario ??? the one that keeps me up at night ??? is the one where some individual could easily and legally obtain a firearm and use that firearm to kill innocent American citizens and also that the individual doing the killing is Syrian.That???s why, as long as I???m your governor, I vow to do everything in my power to prevent Syrians from shooting you while you are at the mall. No Syrians will enter a movie theater and start shooting you. Syrians will not shoot you at church, or in a restaurant, as long as I am governor. College campuses also will not be places where it will be okay to be shot by Syrians. As your governor, I will ensure that no Syrians enter your child???s elementary school and start shooting your child.Here are some other places where I will not tolerate American citizens getting shot by Syrians:  community centers; school cafeterias; hair salons; nursing homes; office buildings; night clubs; temples; supermarkets; lecture halls; dorms; trains; house parties; playgrounds; post offices; front yards. If anyone at any of these locations were ever shot by Syrians, I would take swift and decisive action to protect our citizens from ever again being shot by Syrians.This is how you know that I am concerned about your safety:  no Syrians.No Syrians will be able to just walk into a sporting goods store and purchase a deadly weapon on a whim or buy bulletproof body armor online. No Syrians will be allowed to attend gun shows and purchase whatever firearms they desire without restriction. And I refuse to support special interest groups whose sole mission is to profit from putting weapons into the hands of people, if those people are Syrians. Were there such an organization devoted to equipping Syrians with as many guns as they can afford, I would not bow to that organization???s every wish, because I am a public official, and I care very deeply about the safety of our citizens when it comes to whether they might be shot and killed by Syrians.To that end, I promise to require full registration and tracking of all Syrians, and a ???cooling off??? period for anyone who wishes to become Syrian. Because this much is clear:  the answer to the problems posed by Syrians is not more Syrians.But it doesn???t matter, because there will be no Syrians.Volkswagen CabrioletMazda MiataHonda del SolMINI CooperVolvo IBSNissan Low TCadillac Man BoobsChevrolet Wife Fakes OrgasmsDodge Passed Over For That Promotion AgainHyundai Daughter StripsOldsmobile Not the BreadwinnerBuick Constantly CriticizedFord Holds Her Purse In PublicToyota Lost Son???s RespectAcura Listens to Sheryl CrowSaab Frequent UrinationFiat Not Allowed to Hang Out With His Friends AnymoreKia Girlfriend of Three Years Still Has Active Tinder ProfileIsuzu ImpotenceO Sweet and Merciful Jobs Creator, grant me the strength to rise at a non-shameful hour.Be the hand that guides my deodorant, the loofah that cleanses my darkest areas.

Kennedy was assassinated, something that would have probably gone unnoticed except for one small fact: he was the President of the United States. The truth regarding the killer (or killers?) and the motive (or motives?) has been argued over by conspiracy theorists and conspiracy debunkers ever since that fateful day in Dallas (or San Antonio?).The conspiracies dealing with the assassination are plentiful and varied, much like the number of Kennedy family summer homes. I???ll shine a light on several theories, because truth is much like the honest moth: It cannot help but be attracted to the light of logic and discovery, and it has a lifespan of about a week, longer in the winter.- -Conspiracy Claim: Footage of the President???s head movements after being hit depict him being shot at an angle that does not correspond to where Lee Harvey Oswald was supposedly shooting from, therefore there had to be a second shooter, most likely on the grassy knoll.Debunking Claim: Numerous ballistics tests have proven the President???s head movements correspond directly to a bullet fired from Oswald???s position in the book depository. In fact, all of the shots can be, and are, attributed to Oswald. There was no second shooter.Rebunking Claim: One shooter? Wrong. Two shooters? Doubly wrong. There weren???t any shooters at all. Then how was he shot? Simple: sentient, self-propelled bullets. In 1963, it was becoming obvious that Kennedy would never support a massive war in Vietnam, a massive war that would require the production of an absurd amount of what? You guessed it, unless you guessed something other than bullets, if so, try again and say bullets. Three bullets somehow (magic? Most likely) achieved the power to think and fire themselves. The bullets took out Kennedy, knowing his succe",100
392,"ssor, Lyndon Johnson, would support a full-out war in Vietnam, thus creating the production of billions more of their bullet brethren. Oswald was merely in the wrong place at the wrong time with the wrong rifle out in public.- -Conspiracy Claim: Pictures of Oswald looking slightly different and witnesses claiming to see him in places he couldn???t be prove that a government agent had been impersonating Lee Harvey Oswald for years so that after the assassination, the true, and innocent, Lee Harvey Oswald would take the fall.Debunking Claim: The whole rickety ???Two Oswald??? structure is built on unreliable witness testimony, carefully selected and inaccurate documents, and a mountain of implausible supposition.Rebunking Claim: Much like in Fight Club, Lee Harvey Oswald was both one person AND another person. That ???other??? person was a projection of his inner-psyche, but was also named Lee Harvey Oswald and looked very similar to him and did everything the original Oswald did. What strengthens this claim is the fact that guns are involved in both Fight Club and in the JFK assassination, and that both have happy endings.- -Conspiracy Claim: The testimonies of several witnesses go against official reports and there are several witnesses from the footage that have suspiciously never revealed themselves.Debunking Claim: Eyewitness testimonies are notoriously filled with innocent mistakes and fabrications, plus footage of the event disproves most, if not all, accounts that go against official reports. Also, simply because a witness does not come forward does not imply foul play.Rebunking Claim: The claim that eyewitness testimonies are flawed is derived from eye witness testimonies of people delivering eyewitness testimonies, making it as flawed as a diamond made out of mistakes. The witnesses that never came forward don???t fear misremembering, they???re embarrassed of telling the truth: they were all blinking when Kennedy was shot and missed one the most important moments in American history, the only part of history that matters. Living with that guilt is difficult without the entire world knowing. They have a hard enough time answering their grandkids??? ???Where were you when Kennedy was shot???? questions with a curt ???None of your damn business!??? or a ???Why?! Who sent you? CIA? NSA? ANSWER ME OR I???LL BLINK AND YOU???LL DIE!???- -Conspiracy Claim: Secret Service agents did not cover the President with their body, weren???t adequately prepared for a possible sniper, and were generally negligent, proving they were complicit in the assassination.Debunking Claim: The House Select Committee on Assassinations ruled that the Secret Service had been deficient in their duties, but were not involved in the assassination. There are also several sources that claim Kennedy ordered them to be discreet while in Dallas.Rebunking Claim: Until 2003, the Secret Service was part of the U.S. Department of the Treasury, meaning America???s tax dollars were foremost in the minds of agents. Throwing their clean-suited bodies on top of an already bloody President would lead to average Americans fronting an outrageous dry cleaning bill. It was more fiscally responsible to simply let the President die.- -Conspiracy Claim: The Zapruder film, described as the best recorded evidence of the event, is a sophisticated forgery used to spoon feed the public a false history.Debunking Claim: Film engineers have studied the film and declared no evidence of manipulation or image alteration.Rebunking Claim: The film engineers employed to study the Zapruder film were sophisticated forgeries, CIA or shadow government agents with fake Film Studies degrees from real universities (Tufts?) or real Film Studies degrees from fake universities (Tufts?). Regardless of the authenticity, the powers at be realized that anyone with a Film Studies degree possesses an infallibility akin to that of the Pope (God???s Film Studies representative on Earth), making their analysis as good as a golden gospel and preventing further inquiries.- -Conspiracy Claim: Dallas police identified and signed an affidavit claiming the murder weapon was a 7.65 mm German Mauser rifle, while officially the rifle that Oswald allegedly purchased and used to assassinate the President was a 6.5 mm Italian Carcano rifle. Either Dallas police were complicit in the assassination and attempted to provide confusion or they found the true murder weapon.Debunking Claim: The Dallas deputy constable and deputy sheriff simply misidentified the rifle they discovered. It was always the 6.5 mm Italian Carcano rifle that documents and forensic evidence link directly to Lee Harvey Oswald.Rebunking Claim: The 7.65 mm German Mauser and the 6.5 mm Italian Carcano are the exact same rifle. In fact, there has only ever been one type of rifle ever manufactured. Different countries of origin, fun model names, and random metric measurements are added to fool customers into buying more and more versions of the same gun, much like how all candy bars are the exact same with slightly different wrappers. It???s no coincidence that C-A-N-D-Y B-A-R and R-I-F-L-E G-U-N have the same number of letters since the two industries are in cahoots. Big Rifle and Big Candy knew Kennedy would reveal this scandalous information in the extremely unlikely scenario that he ever discovered it, and had to silence him. After several unsuccessful attempts at having the President eat poisoned Mounds bars (a treat he???d never touch), they decided to go the rifle route.- -Conspiracy Claim: Lee Harvey Oswald had a notoriously poor shot with a rifle, the rifle he used also was notoriously inaccurate, and nobody has been able to replicate the notorious number of shots Oswald supposedly fired in the notorious time frame given by notorious government reports.Debunking Claim: Oswald scored as a sharpshooter and a marksman while in the Marines, the rifle was determined to be ???quite accurate,??? and an Army specialist using Oswald???s rifle was able to replicate the number of shots in a time even faster than Oswald.Rebunking Claim: That Army specialist probably did it.Tender.Tender is the word I will use when I look back on the first bright bursts of our love.When we drank Irish whiskey in the park and undressed under stars, stars that have witnessed myriad such acts since the cosmic explosions and withdrawals whose eternal ballet conspired through a fantastically dizzying choreography to bring you to me, and me to you, and my McGill hoodie to the back of your closet, where it ??? and the memories of my first year at university it encapsulates ??? remains, I???m assuming.It was cold that night.

You are a filament, luminous and blonde and full of voltage, and yet one wet evening away from a meltdown.Are you interested in stimulating conversation about the global economy, literature that is either out of print or in translation, really new bands with music that is unpleasant to listen to, complex French dishes that take several hours of preparation, environmentally sound vacations in places more than ten hours away by plane, and hard recreational drugs?If so, PLEASE JOIN OUR MOMS GROUP!If you???d rather talk about anything but your baby, you are one of us and you should request permission to join the listserv, which will be granted after you???ve answered a series of questions confirmi",100
394,"ng that you are truly aware of the world outside children and not a kid-obsessed interloper looking to lecture us or a mother whose other moms groups were all busts. If the latter is you, we???re sorry, but we can???t save you. We are trying to save ourselves.We meet weekly. New babies are not allowed because, we have to stress this, the group is not about being a mom. It???s about being who we are as people, which is not informed at all by motherhood. We are just a bunch of highly intelligent, curious, adventurous women who have had positive experiences with MDMA and who also happen to have children. We are not just more than moms: we are people with small roommates that sometimes need our help. THAT IS ALL.If you have experienced regret about having had children, that???s great ??? a few of us have that in common with you ??? but it will NOT be one of our topics. We only know about that regret because, a month ago, during our obscure Edith Wharton novels discussion, one member asked if Wharton had had children and when another member confirmed she had not, the one who asked said, ???Oh wow, go Edith!??? and two other members nodded vigorously.But we have never discussed this further, NOR WILL WE. Our discussion topics include only rigorous and edifying matters not pertaining to anyone younger than 18 years of age, like, say, the actual efficacy of trade embargoes or certain meters of Indonesian poetry.If you still feel like yourself, post-baby, and not like a ???new person??? with ???new priorities,??? we are your tribe. We do everything the way we did before we had children and that way is the way of most resistance. We do not look for shortcuts. And when we say shortcuts, we???re not talking about debating whether or not strollers make for lazy children (OBVIOUSLY THEY DO); we???re talking about never missing a single Harper???s piece or a New York Review of Books essay; we???re talking about exploring the lesser known villages of Romania and not worrying if the fiat can fit a car seat; we???re talking about responsible raving, as in rave parties, as in no-sleep ON PURPOSE AND ON DRUGS AND ON WEEKDAYS. We believe life can still be lived to the fullest after you have a child if you can completely forget that you have a child for a certain number of hours each week.If for some reason your partner can???t watch the baby and your babysitter cancels, you can get special permission to bring your child, but you cannot expect us to turn down the Aphex Twin, nor can you expect to have the kind of time you???d have if you hadn???t brought your kid. In fact, you will definitely have a subpar time. Oh, and please do not expect us to comment on how cute your kid is. We can promise your child no more than a hello before the group gets started. Our time is precious, as is yours (although clearly your partner and babysitter didn???t think so)!Our meet-ups are at 11 pm on Tuesdays in the parking lot or abandoned warehouse of each members??? choosing. If you???ve given birth recently, we suggest bringing your own chair. Most of us, however, prefer to engage in conversation while doing deep squats or pacing, depending on our mood and how much molly we???ve taken. Lying on the ground is discouraged, as it typically results in sleep. The last thing we want to do is sleep! We???re not tired! Being a mom isn???t any more tiring than being a person who is deeply engaged with, and inspired by, society at large! We???re fine! We???re awake! We???re writing this at 1 a.m. and we are ALL FULLY AWAKE.It is worth noting that just because we don???t talk about motherhood in our group doesn???t mean we are bad mothers. We are exceptional mothers, when we are not being our fully realized non-mom selves. We don???t do anything half-assed, least of all parenting, but we don???t talk about this in the group because this is a moms group for moms who don???t want to talk about being moms.Also, we???re usually high out of our minds when we meet-up.Looking forward to seeing you soon, fellow humans!I???d known for years that my cousin M. Quint was talented in the literary direction, and scheming to join the ranks of published authors???and that we both shared a pretty rare influence in believing that we were born to do this kind of stuff: our Aunt Billie, aka Wilma Yeo, who published a number of children???s books in the ???60???s and ???70???s, and was also lovely and wonderful to know. When she finally produced her first result, The Defiant, I was blown away by the deft and exotic adventure she???d concocted, and figured I ought to round up a couple of children to interview her???children have better questions than adults, usually. ???Jonathan Lethem- - -Desmond (5 years old): I liked the island adventure!Islands are exciting places for an adventure, right? There???s something in-between about them???the solid land surrounded by moving water???that makes an island feel full of possibility, like the Defiant crew could either stay forever or launch off into something new and totally unpredictable.Everett (8 years old): I liked Gabriel.Oh, good! He was a tricky character, for me. When someone???s personality is so private and inward???when they have a hard time sharing their thoughts and feelings like Gabriel does???it can be difficult to really know them and become attached to them. That was really a struggle with putting Gabriel at the front of the story, and a lot of the reason Esme, who???s much more of an open book, takes up a greater role as the book unfolds.Everett: How long did it take to write?It took about two years to write and then another year or so to refine and get into final shape.Everett: Did you test this book out on any kids you know?I did, yes! At the early stages especially, just to make sure that the idea of kids on a ship going from island to island was actually fun to read about. That was a really important part of the process. The two most important things I learned from those early readers were 1. Make the chapters much shorter and 2. Have more action (I tend to write about what people are thinking about instead of what they???re actually doing).After those first young readers, there was a long time when I was only talking to other adults about the book, which was really helpful in a ton of ways. But it???s way more fun to hear what kids like you and Desmond think. You???re the ones I wrote the book for, after all.Everett: What inspired you?When I first started imaging the book, my good friend Lauren had just bought a sailboat and was learning to how to sail. After work, we would drive out to the slip where she docked her boat and take it out onto the bay. The sun would just be going down. We had these incredible night sails???we were often the only boat out there???and we???d go right up to the Golden Gate Bridge. The waters were dark and rough and it was inspiring to watch my friend learn to captain her boat. I brought a lot of that into Gabriel???s character.A little bit later, when I was really in the thick of writing The Defiant, I moved by myself to the woods about an hour outside San Francisco. I found the quiet and solitude very inspiring. It was often difficult to be alone so much, but that???s a feeling I wove into the book.Desmond: What you were you thinking when you were making all the characters?Before I started writing, I took a lot of time thinking about who each character was???where they came from and especially what their particular struggle was. Then I thought about how those struggles would all interact with each other once these kids were crammed onto a ship lost at sea???how the kids might grow together as they faced different challenges. I didn???t nec",100
395,"essarily want them to get over their particular struggle???to change in some big way???but I did think a lot about how they might come to understand themselves better.I will say that when I first wrote the characters, they were much, much nicer to each other. But that just felt false. I???d forgotten that even when kids care a lot about each other, they can also be really tough. I guess that???s true of adults, too. But kids are far more honest about it, I think.Desmond: What were you thinking when you invented the island?Even though they???re all quite different, each island is meant to help the Defiant kids figure themselves out a little bit more, both individually and as a crew.For the first island, I wanted to make the stakes pretty simple. At that point the Defiant kids are so desperate to get off the ship and find a place to stay that there had to be a pretty clear reason to leave again. Going hungry seemed about as clear a reason as I could imagine. And the rules on the first island were so extreme because it was time for the Defiant kids to start defining themselves as a crew. So the contrast was necessary. By witnessing the intensity of the thin kids??? rules, the Defiant kids had to ask themselves: What are the rules we value? Who are we as a crew?The seal island came at a point when the Defiant kids had to start thinking about their roles and, particularly, about leadership. So here, I was thinking a lot about power and what it means to be in charge. Gabriel was always the reluctant captain, and Carrick was there to show him the danger of letting someone else blindly be in control of his crew. It forced Gabriel to step into the role of a leader.The third island is all about connection and isolation. To me, the third island seemed the most likely place for the crew to end up. They had water and food, they had all sorts of neat gadgets. And the blue light kids felt the most stable and advanced. But the Outliers proved that simply having the basics to live isn???t enough???that figuring out the values of the community are essential, too.Everett: What island would you want to live on? Didn???t the crew prove that none of them were perfect?That???s exactly right???the Defiant crew could never settle down and make any of the islands their new home because none of the islands were ever quite the right fit. Honestly, I think I???d rather be aboard the Defiant than on any of those weird islands. Even if they don???t know what they???re doing, I trust all the Defiant kids way more than Carrick or Marie or (especially) Devon.Desmond: Are you going to see more of the pink stuff?Everett: What about the white stuff too?I???m so glad you guys brought up the pink and white stuff! To me, that???s the most important idea in the book. The pink and white objects that pop up???the sand, the fish inside the other fish, the twins stuck together???represent being too close (pink) and being too alone (white). In a way, the whole book is about the Defiant kids negotiating being too close together or being too far apart: to each other, from their homes, from themselves. The pink and white are meant to symbolize that tension.Desmond: But he never did anything with that knife. All he did was hold it.D, spoiler! But yes, you???re right, Gabriel didn???t do anything with the tusk knife, in the end. There???s a saying by a famous writer that goes something like: If you introduce an exciting object at the beginning, it has to do something by the end. I didn???t follow that advice very well! But I???ll tell you what I was thinking here: I wanted Gabriel to have the opportunity to use the knife, but ultimately choose not to because it wasn???t right for him.Desmond: What if it starts all over again, at the first island?That???s brilliant! Have you ever seen The Twilight Zone? It???s an old TV show I bet you???d like. That idea???starting back at the first island???feels very in keeping with plotlines from that show where you might go through a whole journey only to discover you???re right back where you started???not in a nice Wizard of Oz way but in an unsettling way???like you can never really get anywhere new. When I think about a sequel, it???s fun to think about combining characters from the islands: How would Carrick and Marie negotiate power?Everett: What???s the next island going to be about?Desmond: Can you make a second one?I definitely daydream a lot about a second book, and have a lot of notes to that end. On the one hand, I don???t feel like I???m completely done with this story and these characters. On the other, part of me likes leaving it open???I like the idea that readers can imagine very different ways The Defiant crew???s journey might end.

We???re now at a cruising altitude of 30,000 feet and I???ve turned off the fasten seat belt sign. Feel free to get up, stretch your legs, and move about the cabin. Also, while I have your attention, it seems that there???s a child in seat 9D who is completely incapable of spreading cream cheese onto his bagel by himself and there???s growing concern in that section of the aircraft that he doesn???t have enough ???grit.???Is there a parenting expert on this plane?Great, the flight attendant is telling me 153 of you are. She also mentioned that his mother didn???t raise her hand. Interesting.Look, today it???s cream cheese, tomorrow it???s not being able to slather lubricant on an ultrasound wand. It???s just never too early for the general public ??? specifically white men in positions of power ??? to step in and tell women that they???re so very wrong. Join me, won???t you?So quick show of hands, how many of you believe 9D can???t spread his big baby cream cheese due to the fact that his mother doesn???t allow him to free range enough, and by ???enough??? I mean an acceptable amount according to strangers on the playground, neighbors, and those of us heading to Chicago this afternoon ??? where the weather is a mild 72 degrees and it???s partly cloudy???none of whom know this family personally?I???m being told 148. Yes, that???s what I was I afraid of.Is there a Tiger Mom in the house? Anyone raise their kid in France? Any kids on board who manage their parents??? finances ??? hold on, I???m being told that the boy in 9D is four years old and this is his first time flying. And now I???m getting a message from the control tower??? yup, yup. Got it??? They said, and I quote, ???Oh boo-hoo, sounds like the excuses of someone who will never be able to hold down a job or find happiness in the arms of a life partner,??? but, hey, by all means, 9D???s mom, keep spreading his cream cheese for him. Jesus.I mean, who am I? Just some ???guy??? who holds all your lives in his extremely independent, staying dry at night, spreadin???-cream-cheese-all-by-himself hands.Look, no one has time for this, 9D. It???s time you put your big boy pants on and change the oil on your mom???s car when you get home. WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU DON???T KNOW HOW. That???s it. I just can???t with this.DOES ANYONE KNOW HOW TO FLY A PLANE?The co-captain. Of course, apologies??? Please take over, Todd.Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking from in front of you right now, in the middle of the aisle.

Food for thought.Another quick show of hands, will this child eventually be able to spread cream cheese on his own simply by maturing and learning skills at his own pace?Two. What are you even thinking 23A? And Mom to 9D, please stay out of this.Or will he only truly be able to get a grip if his mother quits her job, decides to actually raise her own child for a change, and commits to being at home which is the God-given natural habitat for those of you with vaginas ???who???ve been through the ringer????152. Yes, thank you. THANK YOU.Lastly, are we helping or hurting?One vote for hurting, one hundred fifty two for helping. Hold up, the one vote for hurting is from the boy???s mother. Ma???am, I said stay out of this.Look, if there???s one thing I think we can all agree on, it???s that all of us are right. No one knows what???s better for a child than someone who has precious little information about that child or his circumstances.

Or so she???s been told. Now she and her unlikely guardian???the gruff, filthy mermaid Syrena???have traveled the pitch-black seas from broken-down Chelsea, Massachusetts, to Syrena???s homeland in Poland. But as Sophie learns about the ages-old source of her newly discovered power, her grandmother, the wicked and powerful Kishka, only grows stronger. And who will protect Sophie???s friends and family back in Chelsea from the dark magic she???s awakened?Mermaid in Chelsea Creek and Girl at the Bottom of the Sea are available from the McSweeney???s store, and we are proud to present the first look at the spellbinding final installment in The Chelsea Trilogy.- - -Sophie was surprised to find herself hesitant. She hadn???t been above the waters in what felt like months, years, a lifetime. She had entered the creek in Chelsea one girl, and now, as she and Syrena prepared to swim into the mouth of the river, she was quite another girl entirely. Slowly she kicked her legs against the water, rising upward, the light growing brighter as she ascended, illuminating everything around her. She could see herself more clearly??? her kicking, scuffed-up legs; her bare toes; the once-lovely linen jumper the Ogresses had fashioned for her, now in tatters. Her head tilted back and her eyes open, Sophie saw blue, a new blue, sharp and wide. Sophie saw the sky. At the sight of it she gasped, inhaling a mouthful of salty sea water. She broke the surface of the Baltic sputtering, her eyes tearing, her lungs heaving. Sunlight???sunlight!???caught the droplets that shook from her as she coughed, like bits of molten gold.It took Sophie more than a minute to adjust to the brightness of daytime on land. Her eyes ached; she could feel them pulse as they struggled to shift from the ocean???s ambient darkness to this violent glare. She stared back down at the water, away from the sky, while they calibrated to the new environment. Slowly, she looked up.Trees, and beyond the trees, meadow. She hadn???t seen such green, such verdant, living green, in a long time. Actually, considering she???d come from Chelsea???not the greenest place on the planet???maybe she???d never seen so much unbroken, unsullied green. There???d been the green of the seaweed forest they???d just harvested, but that was a dark and murky green. The green of these trees, of the leaves and the grasses, were every shade of green, most of them such a sharp tone it practically made Sophie???s mouth water. She realized she ",100
397,"was hungry. Hungry for earth food. Hungry for??? a salad? Yes! Sophie wanted to fill her mouth with living green things torn from their roots. Were she able to reach those trees, still very far away, she would have pulled handfuls of leaves from their branches and stuffed them into her mouth like popcorn.The water beside Sophie rippled as Syrena???s dark head broke the water.  ???Arghch!??? the mermaid yelped as the bright sun assaulted her eyes. She closed them, rubbing them furiously with her translucent fists. She stared down at the rippling waters, then slowly raised her face to the sky, shading her eyes with her hand.???Polska,??? Syrena said as she gazed at the green, and her voice held all the sheen of the sunlight on the water.???It???s beautiful,??? Sophie marveled. ???I???ve never seen a place so pretty. It???s making me hungry for human food!??????Oh, the food the people eat in Poland!??? Syrena laughed. ???Sausage and pierogi and sauerkraut and cakes with tiny poppy seeds and bigos and soups with mushrooms and soups with cucumbers, or beet soup, and kasha. Long ago they eat bear, ya? Bear paws with spicy roots, or tongue of the bear.??????I was more thinking I???d like a salad, actually,??? Sophie said, scrunching her face at the thought of eating the paws or tongue of any creature.???You might have to magic yourself some salad,??? Syrena laughed. ???Much food in Polska, but not much salad. Look?????? The mermaid grabbed Sophie by her bulging backpack and spun her around in the water. Off to the right, clustered around the water???s edge, was a rust-colored town. If she squinted, Sophie could make out the spires of churches, or castles or towers, the reddish color stained pale green by time.???Is Gdansk,??? Syrena said proudly, as if she had built the town with her hands and fins.???Are we going there???? Sophie asked.???Nie. Is not along our way. But just to see. A beautiful city, ya???????Ya,??? Sophie nodded. From where she bobbed in the water, it looked like a fairy-tale place, something seen only in the very oldest books. Syrena, her hand still gripping Sophie???s pack, spun the girl back around so that her eyes were filled with green.???You see there,??? the mermaid???s arm shot out straight before her, pointing to the place where the ocean cut into the green like a wide, blue road. ???That is River Vistula. That is my home. More than Polska, or Warszawa, River Vistula my home. I cannot believe we here. And that you here too, Sophie.??? The mermaid paused and stared at the girl, and Sophie was unnerved by her stare. Above the water Sophie???s pale blue eyes were nearly silver, and in the sun they all but vanished.???What is it???? Sophie said. ???You???re creeping me out.??????Sophie, the Vistula not salt water. Is fresh water.??????Okay,??? Sophie said. ???So???????Salt water will be with us for little while, but not long. Gone very soon. Then you have the sea plants, ya???? The mermaid hit the sack of vegetation strapped to Sophie???s back. ???They contain salt. Good for you to eat, to chew on, suck on, just keep in mouth maybe. Look.??? With considerable effort, the mermaid lifted her weight of hair from the waters. Sophie could see strips of sea plants woven in and out of the thick tangles. ???I bring more, I bring much as I can, ya? But we must swim the river quickly. We must get you to salt castle, and to Tadzio. You will begin to feel sick on this river, ya? But you will fight it, you will suck the salt from these plants, you will swim very fast, we both will, ya????Sophie ingested all that the mermaid was telling her. She knew she was being called to be strong, and she bolstered herself. She could swim fast, she could command the waters to move very quickly. She would eat this whole giant bag of seaweed if it gagged her. She wouldn???t complain. The iciness of the mermaid signaled how serious this was, and Sophie made herself icy in reply.???Of course,??? she said. ???I can do it. Let???s go.??????Wait,??? Syrena stilled her. ???Another change. Sadly.??????What???? Sophie???s heart thumped quickly inside her. She didn???t want so many changes. Although she???d known all along that the purpose of this epic journey was to reach Poland, leave the mermaid, and train to destroy her grandmother, Sophie had become accustomed to the rhythms of the ocean, the company of Syrena. Why couldn???t she just travel the deep forever, living a mermaid lifestyle, never mind Kishka and whatever magic she inherited, whatever massive effort was expected of her just because she happened to be half-Odmience. Sophie never asked to be the saver of the world! She was just a kid!Syrena had moved behind her and unfastened the octopus from the backpack, causing ribbons of sea weed to unfurl into the water, floating away. She brought the creature to Sophie.???Octopus not coming with, Sophia. Can???t live in freshwater. Is salt water creature, ocean creature. Yah? You understand????The octopus, it seemed, understood. It wrapped its tentacles around the mermaid???s neck and gave her a long nuzzle, the dome of its head snug in her neck. ???Oh!??? The mermaid laughed. ???Such sweet creature! To think I expect you to eat it once, when was just a baby octopus! Friend, I pledge to never eat octopus again, ya? In your honor. You will be sacred friend of the mermaid, ya???? Syrena stoked the octopus lovingly with her long, pale fingers and untangled its tentacles from around her neck, holding it out to Sophie. ???Say your goodbye.???Sophie???s eyes were full of tears at the sight of the octopus, hanging there before her in the mermaid???s hands, his tentacles undulating around him. What a strange and silent comfort he???d been on this journey. The octopus was full of love. Sophie took him from the mermaid and clutched him to her desperately, the tears in her eyes flowing into the sea around them.???You are the best octopus friend I???ll ever have,??? Sophie said, snot clogging her nose, and her eyes all stinging and blurred. ???Thank you for being with me. I wish I could come visit you someday, but I don???t know how I ever could. The ocean is so big. Where will you go? Where will you live???? The octopus took a tentacle and placed it over the girl???s jabbering mouth, causing the mermaid to sputter with laughter.???Octopus be all right!??? Syrena said, laughing. ???Octopus be in the sea, is where they belong.???Sophie smiled at her friend and nodded her head. ???Okay,??? she said. ???I won???t worry about you. But I???ll miss you. I???ll never, ever forget you.???The octopus took his tentacle and pointed it back at himself in agreement, causing more tears to leak from Sophie???s face. She felt like Dorothy in the stupid Wizard of Oz or something. As she went to release the octopus from her grasp the creature swam closer, and with deliberation placed all its tentacles on Sophie???s head. A last massage? She thought briefly, but as the cephalopod brought its beak into view, Sophie had a flash of the deep-sea Vulcan, the octopus that had healed both her and Syrena and given her visions. Was her sweet little octopus pet about to do the same? Were all octopuses magic, exhaling their very own crystal balls into the sea?Apparently so. From the octopus???s hidden black beak emerged a small bubble of air that grew in size as it floated toward Sophie. Sophie braced herself???braced her heart???for a glimpse of her mother or Ella, Aunt Hennie or Angel, or even her odd sister, her twin, so like her yet such a stranger. But the girl in the bubble was someone Sophie had never seen before. Her hair was long and glossy-dark, spanning out around her head in a way Sophie recognized. The girl wa",100
398,"s underwater, like she was???no tank of oxygen, no breathing tube. And she was smiling, happy, perhaps playing. When Sophie saw who her playmate was she inhaled sharply, and shouted for Syrena.???Look!??? she pointed at the fragile bubble, wobbling in the water. There was another mermaid. So much like Syrena, and so different. The same tail, though this mermaid???s scales climbed much higher up her torso. Same wild mane of hair, though this mermaid had grown what looked like tiny horns, or antennae, that cast a bioluminescent halo around her. Her eyes were thin, with an upward cast, and her cheekbones sharp as a fishbone, like Syrena???s. Unlike Syrena, there were the tiniest, gossamer fins floating off the tip of this mermaid???s cheekbones. Her face was stern, as if she was trying to discourage the girl from being so playful. At a glance, it was a dynamic Sophie recognized. And then, the bubble burst.???Oh!??? Syrena cried. ???I have not seen one of my kind in???oh! I cannot know! I cannot know how long it has been!???When the octopus???s clawed beak cracked open again, the two froze, watching the next bubble form and float toward them. Another girl, Sophie???s age, her face round, her hair in a sloppy ponytail sliding off the side of her head. She did not look playful but focused, radiating an intensity Sophie feared would pop the bubble. And her companion? A mermaid. Same ratty, wild, dark hair as Syrena???even wilder and rattier if such a thing were possible. The mermaid???s face was marked with dark lines???not wrinkles but ink, tattoo marks that arced down her forehead, meeting in a point between her eyebrows. More marks, circles and dots, decorated her cheekbones, and curving stripes ran down her chin.???Her hands,??? Syrena said, tearing Sophie away from the creature???s face. The mermaid???s hands were blunt, fingerless. ???Arna,??? Syrena breathed, her voice holding a wonder Sophie had never heard.???You know her???? the girl spun away from the bubble to face her friend.???Know of her,??? Syrena said. ???If is her. Arnakuagsak. Famous and powerful. Man chopped off her fingers, she use mermaid magic to turn fingers to seals. To seals and fish and many other animals. Octopus, maybe.??? Syrena gave a smile and stroked the octopus. The bubble came apart, vanished.???Oh, Sophia,??? Syrena smiled. It was hard to tell beneath the salty waters, but it seemed the mermaid might be crying. ???I have not seen one of my kind in so long, I did not even know if we still existed. I imagined I could be only one. Only one in all the waters of earth!??????Syrena,??? Sophie clasped the mermaid???s arm and directed her toward the octopus??? beak, where yet another iridescent bubble floated out from his ebony beak. Like a diorama, like a snow globe, the orb held another girl and mermaid. This girl???s eyes had a sparkle that could be seen even at the bottom of the sea. Her hair, tightly braided at the crown, exploded behind her in a great, round afro. Beside her, lounging in the sea, a great mermaid, her hair a bundle of long cords that slunk into the sea behind her, each one resembling slightly the slinky, striped snake that hung around her neck, sliding down her body towards her tail. From the mermaid???s temples sprung spiny fins, and her eyes flashed blue-white against her dark skin. Syrena stared deeply at the bubble, her long, elegant fingers clamped over her mouth. Her head shook back and forth, slowly.???I cannot,??? she breathed into her fingers. ???I cannot believe this.??????Do you know her, too???? Sophie asked, and Syrena shrugged. ???Perhaps. Know of her. Mami Watu. And the first, the very first mermaid, perhaps a Ningyo.??????What is that???????Is mermaid, basically. Just from other sea. Oh, octopus!??? The mermaid pulled the creature to her, pulling his tentacles away from Sophie???s crown. The girl gasped and gingerly touched her head where the rubbery suction cups had stuck themselves to her.???Syrena! Maybe he wasn???t finished!??????You finished???? Syrena asked the creature, and he blew the tiniest bubble from his beak, a bubble that floated over to the mermaid and popped in her face. Syrena laughed and hugged him. ???I think that was all for Sophia, with the girls, and you touch her head and all, but I cannot tell you. Thank you. You give biggest gift. Biggest gift to know one is not alone, ya? Biggest gift ever.???Sophie had never seen such a wide smile stretch across the mermaid???s face. Her baleen was fully exposed, bristly beneath her upper lip that was pulled taught in happiness.???That was for me???? Sophie asked, taking in the mermaid???s words. Of course it was???it was her head the octopus had attached himself to. And as shockingly delightful as it was for Syrena to see her kind, Sophie could tell the larger point was for her to see her kind. Girls. Three girls, all her age. Three girls, happy and serious. Three girls living and breathing beneath the ocean, with their mermaid companions. Sophie was touched by Syrena???s joy in learning she wasn???t alone, but she didn???t feel quite so excited. Who were these girls? Did it mean that Sophie wasn???t quite so special? Did they all have evil grandmothers, too? Were there even more out there? Sophie felt the kindly brush of the octopus???s tentacle on her brow, soothing the furrow she???d made with her worries. Syrena looked at her, a slight smirk teasing the corners of her mouth.???Oh, are you jealous???? Syrena asked in a teasing tone. ???You think you only girl with mermaid friend and now you feel not so special???????No,??? Sophie scowled quickly, though that was exactly what was happening.???Sophia,??? Syrena said in a stern tone velvety with care. ???Is always better to not be alone. All of us creatures???even mermaids, even unicorns???all creatures alone, ya? So is good to have people, too. To be less alone. Imagine if you alone under the sea all this time, without me, ya? What would happen to you????I wouldn???t have made it!??? Sophie cried. ???I wouldn???t have found my way, I wouldn???t have survived!??????Maybe these girls and their mermaids help you find your way, ya? Maybe they help you survive, somehow. Maybe you help them, too.??????I know I???m being a baby,??? Sophie confessed, making the mermaid laugh.???You just being human,??? Syrena asked. ???All humans are babies. Is okay. You think about it. Think about these girls. I think you find you want to know them, ya? You want to understand. Maybe you even want friend. Human-girl friend, who are magic also, like you.??????Maybe,??? Sophie said, uncertain but hooked on the faces of the three girls she???d seen in the bubble. She could bring them into her memory as clear as the bubble: the girl with the fan of dark hair, perhaps a streak of yellow-blonde floating in the water, her smiling face; the stern, round-cheeked girl with the sloppy ponytail; the girl with the sparkly eye and round puff of hair. And their mermaids, each one different from one another and different from Syrena. The more Sophie thought about all of them, the more curious she became, and her upset at not being the only human girl hanging out with a mermaid in the whole world faded away and began to seem as ridiculous as it was.???Anyway,??? Syrena brushed aside Sophie???s feelings like the human silliness she thought it to be. ???Real point here is, we say goodbye to this friend.??? Syrena gathered the octopus???s many tentacles in her cool hands and kissed them all. ???A prince,??? she declared, ???A king. A king among octopus, a king of the sea. May you grow large and mighty and live forever, may you swim deeper than any human dares to go.??? The octopus caresse",100
399,"d the mermaid???s cheek with the tip of a leg, and turned to Sophie.???Thank you,??? she said, choking up again. ???Thank you for everything. I wish I could do something wonderful for you?????????You did!??? cackled the mermaid. ???You didn???t eat him!??????Oh, hush!??? Sophie snapped. What a thought! ???Thank you, Octopus. I love you.??? She, too, kissed the octopus???s tentacles, and then placed a kiss on the dome of his head. He tapped her face with the tips of his many legs, poking and pecking, and Sophie imagined a bazillion little kisses all over her face. She laughed out loud, and the octopus took a single tentacle and on her cheek traced the shape of a heart. And then he slunk away, behind them, back to the kelp gardens they???d swum through, back to the Beluga whales, back, back, back, and out to the endless sea.???Now, we go,??? Syrena said brusquely, all sentimentality gone. ???Back to business. No time for crying over new friends or lost friends or any friends. Ya???????Ya,??? Sophie nodded, pulling herself together. They sunk deeper beneath the water, moving forward through the sea until the sea slowly, then quickly, became the river.Illustrations by Amanda Verwey.TIME: MorningPLACE: A playground PEOPLE: Various parents1.LADY: My daughter Lucy said the cutest thing the other day. She was eating some applesauce and she looked at me and said, ???Mommy, how do they get the applesauce out of the apple????ME: My cat eats almost constantly. It???s starting to get a little concerning, honestly.LADY: Oh. Yes??? I, um???ME: He has this meowing routine. He meows from the other room like six times per day. Right? And I just know that when he starts meowing, he???s hungry again. And I???m like, ???Didn???t you just eat???? But he just keeps meowing and I just keep feeding him. Mostly just to shut him up.LADY: I??? uh??? I see.- -2.GUY: My son, Nate, took his first step the other day. I???m kicking myself because I didn???t manage to film it. What???s the point of having all these cameras around if we don???t capture these moments?ME: My cat, William, has been walking since he was born, basically. He???s pretty nimble, too. He walks on the upstairs banister, a lot, and I???m like, ???William, be careful!??? But he???s usually just fine.GUY: [Silence]ME: Sometimes I watch my cat???s feet, the way his paws move. It???s really transfixing, you know? I???m sure it???s the same with your son.GUY: You???re saying I should watch my son???s feet?ME: [Not listening, staring at my phone] You want to see a few videos of William walking around?GUY: I, uh??? I suppose.ME: [Scrolling through more than two-thousand cat videos and photos] Here, check this one out. Look how beautiful it is when four paws work in tandem, like a fancy watch.- -3.LADY: Not to brag, but my daughter is incredibly bright. The other day, for example, we were in the backyard and she pointed to a butterfly ???ME: [Interrupting] My cat loves butterflies!LADY: Does he? That???s??? great. Anyway, my daughter ??? Kylie ??? she looked up and pointed at a butterfly and said, ???That used to be a caterpillar, mommy.??? I???m not even joking.ME: My cat, William, caught a caterpillar once. He chewed on the thing until it was completely mangled. But he was so proud of it and I wanted to support him, not publicly shame him. Right? So I said, ???Good job, William.??? Even though I was pretty grossed out. And then there was just this mangled caterpillar corpse on the doormat for a week.LADY: Well??? [Pretends to check her watch] I think should be going. I have an appointment.ME: [Not taking the hint] William is pretty darned brilliant, too. How old is Kylie?LADY: She???s three.ME: Yeah, William is definitely as smart as a three year old. They???re probably about the same level of intelligence right now, my cat and your daughter. Isn???t that amazing?LADY: That???s actually really rude.ME: How can a fact be rude?- -4.GUY: My kids love dressing up. They refuse to leave the house if they???re not wearing some sort of fun outfit.ME: My cat actually hates when I put things on him. I made him this little hat, but he kept shaking it off.GUY: Your cat?ME: Yes, exactly. He kept shaking it off. And because he doesn???t talk ??? yet ??? no, I???m totally kidding ??? mostly ??? but because he doesn???t talk, it???s hard to know what he???s willing to wear. Does that make sense?GUY: Uh??? yeah. I think so.ME: I???m going to try cat booties next. We shall see, my friend! [Deep exhalation] We shall see ???GUY: Well, it???s nice to meet you.ME: You too. If you ever want to bring your children by for a playdate???GUY: Oh, you have kids?ME: Human kids? No.- -5.LADY: I like to bring my son, William, to this park to get some exercise.ME: [Stunned silence, my mouth agape, my eyes widened]LADY: What is it?ME: Your son???s name is William?LADY: Yes??? Why?ME: That???s my cat???s name!LADY: Oh. That???s, uh??? wow.ME: What a crazy coincidence! Was your son named after my cat? Ha ha. No, I???m completely joking. But who was he named after?LADY: His grandfather.ME: Same with my cat! His grandfather cat is named William, too! He belongs to my cousin. ???William the Grandfather,??? we call him. He???s three.LADY: [Nervous laughter]ME: What a day. Two Williams in one park. What are the odds?LADY: Your cat is here?- -6.LADY: Our Justine is finally sleeping through the night.GUY: Knock on wood. Ha ha.ME: My William has a tendency to climb up onto my pillow and paw at my face.GUY: Your boy does that?ME: Yes. He???s adopted. And a cat.LADY: ???GUY: ???ME: At first, I thought it was cute, but as he???s gotten bigger, I???m a little bit worried that he might claw me right in the eye. You know? Wouldn???t that be a crazy way to lose your vision?LADY: That wouldn???t be one of our top concerns, to be honest. Justine doesn???t have claws.ME: [Nodding serenely] Hmm. Maybe I should have a human baby. I???m already a great cat-father. And a human baby probably won???t claw me as much. Right?GUY: [Long pause, while he stands up and grabs his wife???s hand] Riiiiight.ME: Good. I???m glad we got this chance to compare notes on parenthood. Now if you???ll excuse me, my cat-son seems to be caught in that tree over there.1. Tell your toddler the story of the Foot Monster, a frightening creature with a foot for a head, who hunts for children with bare feet so he can eat them.  Working with a designer, construct a realistic costume.  Place an ad on Craigslist for an actor good with children able to play the role of Foot Monster.  One morning while your toddler is getting dressed, have Foot Monster enter his or her room through a window.  While attempting to protect your toddler from the foot-headed intruder, quietly place socks on his feet.2. Approach your toddler with a large bag of Skittles and a pair of socks.  Before your toddler is able to grab the candy away and devour the entire bag whole, explain that for every second she is willing to wear socks, you will give her one Skittle.  Continue until your toddler vomits, at which point change the socks for a clean pair and start again.  Repeat until adulthood.  Be sure to have an unlimited amount of candy stored in your garage before you begin this plan.3. Have your toddler???s favorite parent move to an undisclosed location.  Tell your toddler that his favorite parent has been kidnapped by Sir Socks-A-Lot and will only be allowed to return if socks stay on his feet for at least two weeks.  After two weeks of sock-wearing, the parent should return. Repeat each time your toddler removes his socks.4. Attach an iPhone to the top of each sock.  With the help of an electrician, rig the iPhones so they will play cartoo",100
400,"ns, but only when the socks are on your toddler???s feet.  Be sure to upgrade your data plan in advance of this plan to avoid overage charges. Do your best to attach padding to all hard surfaces in your home so that your child is not injured when she walks into things while staring at her feet.5. Post signs at a nearby playground advertising for a child interested in a new family, and willing to wear socks.  After selecting the most appealing child, explain to your toddler that you have chosen to replace him with a new child who likes wearing socks. (Once your child agrees to wear socks, you can return the replacement child to the street.)6. Purchase a powerful, permanent adhesive from a local hardware store.  Convince a local doctor to write you a prescription for a sedative.  Inject your toddler with the sedative and then use the adhesive to attach the socks to her feet (important: do not confuse the sedative and the adhesive or the results can be dangerous).  When she wakes up from her ???nap,??? pretend that the socks have always been attached to her feet.7. Tell your toddler that he is not allowed to wear socks ever again.Childhood is a magical time.  There are so many new experiences, so many things to do and see.  That???s one reason I decided to take Xavier with me to toddler yoga.  It???s a safe place to meet other kids, try something new, and have fun.  It???s also the perfect place for him to learn how to vanquish his enemies and conquer the entire fucking world.  This will be his legacy.  This will be my legacy.We focus a lot on breathing in class.  Deep breath in, hold it, and deep breath out.  This is known as mindfulness, being present in the moment ??? a technique used through the centuries by the deadliest fighters in the world.  Bruce Lee, Genghis Khan, Julius Caesar: what they all understood was that when you can control your mind, you can control your opponent, and then destroy them.  If your opponent???s smart, they???ll intuit your supreme powers of awareness and cower in fear.  If they???re dumb, they will face your wrath until they are eating dirt ??? the dirt of Hell.Mind manipulation is only the beginning at Vinyasa Heart Studio.  There are also Goldfish snacks.  With these cheesy orange monsters, Xavier has learned primitive naval maneuvers that will aid him when seafaring nations attempt to halt his progress with their pitiful attempts at avoiding his pattern-running torpedoes.  ???Please, sir, sorry about standing in your way, may we please surrender???? captains will ask.  Xavier will gaze upon them from the ship???s helm, smirking to himself, before he gives the signal to send in the drones.  Xavier is beginning to understand his path, for yesterday he placed a Goldfish on the ground, and he smashed it with his fist.I am pouring all my resources into Xavier???s life ??? my money, time, energy, and wisdom ??? and I will not stop until he is the world???s sole emperor and god-king.Vinyasa is only the start.  Next week, he commences toddler SAT prep, an ancient training course created by Socrates himself to prepare young minds to set logic traps and annihilate hypocrites.  Force is nice, and will suit my Xavier well, but why use force when he can use cunning guile?  What people subconsciously understand is that technocrats, lawyers, and heirs have no place leading the entire world ??? only a philosopher-king can do that, who has trained himself to overvault mind snares with the help of a college student named A.J.Play-based education focused on interacting with the environment in a supportive atmosphere of creative inquiry is the next step on Xavier???s path of complete world domination.  When he is in the sandbox at the Harrington School, and another child steals his toy, he will glimpse humanity???s true nature: our hearts are black and the world is one bad winter away from complete anarchy and chaos.  But there is hope, too, for secretly we desire to be dominated and controlled.  Ideally, by one whom we trust with our lives, one named Xavier.The path forward will not be easy for him, but I am giving him the best chance by feeding him a local and organic diet. And thus he will learn which of the forest???s offerings he can eat during the necessary stage of being banished from the kingdom. This will likely occur during the cruel, pitiless Reign of Sadie, the two-year-old who performs yoga next to Xavier.  She may think that she is taking notes on his psychological pressure points, but in truth it is I who has learned her weaknesses.  She gets gassy from dried fruit, and soothing music puts her to sleep.  During the dark times, Xavier will regroup in the woodlands, raise an army, and then annihilate Sadie with raisins and quiet muzak.Xavier will lead with patience, and with athleticism, for next month I am enrolling him in agility class ??? a course usually reserved for dogs, but they made an exception when I said I???d pay double.This week McSweeney???s is proud to release This Bridge Will Not Be Gray, the true story of the building of the Golden Gate Bridge and, in particular, why it is orange. With a story by Dave Eggers that has been called ???instantly engrossing??? (Publishers Weekly), This Bridge features Bay Area artist Tucker Nichols, whose book Crabtree was published by McSweeney???s in 2013. For This Bridge, Nichols chose to work in the unique medium of construction paper cut-outs. He recently sat down with McSweeney???s Art Director Dan McKinley to discuss that decision as well as the process of making the book.This Bridge Will Not Be Gray is now available from the McSweeney???s Store and at fine independent bookstores everywhere.- - - -Where did the idea of using paper cut-outs for Bridge come from?When I first read the story, I had it in my mind that it would be really simple to cut out the shapes from colored paper instead of drawing the scenes. I wanted to actually make something with my hands, something physical even if it was totally flat. And in keeping with the theme of serendipity in the story, I wanted to start with available materials in my studio. Mostly though I just thought it would be easy. But I hadn???t accounted for managing all of the bits of paper, of trying to keep them all together for different scenes over the months of shaping the book, and then arranging them for the final photo shoot. It would have been a great time to hire a very organized assistant, but I prefer to work alone. Oh well, in the end we herded all the bits together and got it done.- -- -Is there a particular section of the book where the art came about because of that serendipity?Mostly it???s just inherent to making scenes from scraps of paper: try this one here, or maybe flip it upside down, hey that looks just right even though I cut it for something else. A few specific places come to mind, like using the punched holes from the eyes of the figures for added details to the spread of tools, or for flowers on the bushes on a spread toward the end. The fog draped over the bridge was made from a pile of scalloped diner placemats I???ve had for years.- -- -In your illustrations and paintings I know you don???t do human figures, but in Bridge you do. How did you approach making them? Was it a challenge?How to treat the humans in the story was tricky at frst because I hadn???t developed a public-facing vocabulary for making people. I???ve been drawing  faces since I was a kid, but I hadn???t pushed that process through the grinder to really make it feel of a piece with everything else yet. But that???s what projects are for really, to work out ways of doing things in response to new problems. So I did what I do with everything, just try",100
401," to make the most stripped down version I could get away with and still have it feel alive to me. Early versions of the people look like something I would have done in middle school. I???m fine with my kindergarten look, but middle school is super awkward. Eventually they lost their torsos and hands and became floating heads because that???s all they needed to be. Realism has never really been my thing.- -- -One of the magical things about the GGB is how it changes depending on the weather, the angle, or the time of day, and I feel like you do a great job of capturing that in the book. Do you have a favorite view of the bridge???in real life and in the book?Yeah, we all talked about how the bridge is actually so much about the place in relation to the bridge. That location is so dynamic. Sometimes everything looks like a silver curtain, and other times it???s all saturated like in a vacation postcard. When I started working on the book, my studio was in the Marin Headlands, so I spent a lot of time looking back at the bridge from the Pacific. But I also love the view when you approach it from Marin and it appears framed in the dome of the Waldo Tunnel, usually in silhouette. And then of course how it pops its head out from the Richmond when you least expect it, like a friendly dinosaur peeking over the trees and buildings. It???s almost like a sacred mountain. Nobody gets tired of looking at it.- -- -Any lessons you took away from the experience of making this book? Were you already aware of the story of how the bridge???s color came to be? Will you never look at the bridge the same way again?I did know the story, although not as fleshed out as Dave wrote it up. And I loved telling it to anyone who would listen. It???s still hard for me to believe, actually. As a parent, I???m tired of kids??? books that have a lesson embedded in them. But when the lesson is to embrace serendipity on a large scale, even to fight for it, it???s hard to not feel inspired. Outside of that, the big lesson for me is that when one of your favorite writers asks if you want to collaborate on a book about one of your favorite things to look at, say yes.- -- -You spent many months storyboarding the book in your studio before it actually came time to do the official photoshoot of the cut-outs. Once the photo studio was booked and it came time to make final decisions for the layout, did anything change?There were plenty of last minute maneuvers under the camera when we shot the final layouts. Those were surprisingly long days, and it was tempting to just push through each one in the interest of getting through the material. But I also knew this was the last chance to make them better, so I did fiddle a bit. Fortunately I had you, Sunra and the good people at Electric Works to help keep everything moving along.- -This Bridge Will Not Be Gray was recently named one of the best books of 2015 by Publishers Weekly. It is now available from the McSweeney???s Store and at fine independent bookstores everywhere.Behind the scenes photos by Tucker Nichols and Sunra Thompson. Nichols photo by Lisa M. Hamilton.Dear Edith,When you were still in my belly, just after I found out that you were a girl, in the middle of my pregnant-lady-insomnia nights, I wrote you this letter. I???d take you to New York City for your thirteenth birthday, and I???d hand you this letter over ice cream sundaes at Serendipity. I began to worry, though, What if something happens to me? I wrote and printed the letter; I tucked it in a place where you???d be sure to find it. But, I thought, What about all of the daughters of mothers like mine, who, for some reason or another, can???t, don???t, or won???t tell them all the things that they need to know?So. Dear Daughters,This is The Talk that I wished my mother had given to me. I want you to know so many things and I don???t know what order to put them in, so, I???ll begin in the middle. It???s totally okay to have sex with as many people as you want: boys and girls, strangers and friends. Never let people shame you about wanting to experience the fullness of your humanity. When you do feel guilt or shame about being human, because there are times that you will, that???s normal too. As much as you can, as often as you can, try to give yourself a break from self-criticism. If you don???t want to have sex with someone, that???s okay too; just firmly tell them, No! You will eventually find, however, that some men will try to convince you that they won???t know that you truly love them unless you have sex with them. Don???t buy what they are selling, for it it complete and utter bullshit. BUT, if you do fall for it (like I did), be kind and gentle to yourself when later you realize that you were duped. You aren???t the first, and you certainly won???t be the last.Be careful. I can???t stress this enough. Get pap smears regularly; get STD tests regularly; get the HPV vaccine. Get on birth control and ask him to wear a condom. If he doesn???t put a condom on ??? which there will be a time when he doesn???t and you will let him get away with it ??? make sure that he pulls out. If, by mistake, you get pregnant (like I did), know that it???s okay to have an abortion. Of course, you don???t want that to be your only form of birth control, OF COURSE. But. Most women I know have had at least one. Just know having an abortion does come with emotional consequences. Some women feel regret immediately. Some women feel regret later, in their late-thirties, when they realize that their window is closing. I felt relief immediately; however, not a year goes by that I don???t say to myself, ???If I had her, she???d be twelve now.??? Also, if you have an abortion, talk about it. The secretive nature of abortions is what contributes to the stigmatized nature of abortions.If you are gay, that???s fine. If you are transgender, that???s fine. If you are straight, that???s fine. Just be you, but if you want to try to be someone else for a while, that???s totally understandable too.There are issues specific to promiscuous sex and dating. There were some boys I could have sex with and be friends with and not get obsessive about, and there were others who I???d fall in love with, boys who would never love me back. I???d get all loopy in the head. I???d wait, impatiently, for a phone call or text that would never come. Unfortunately, that???s part of it. Unrequited love is the most crushing feeling you will ever feel.There is a separate set of issues you will discover in monogamous relationships. Avoid the following: wanting to look good for him, seeking approval from him, or relying on him to boost yourself confidence. You will make this mistake, probably more than once, and that???s okay. Don???t cheat or lie, to him or to yourself. If you do ??? admit it, apologize, journal and reflect about why you did it, and then begin the painful process of forgiving yourself. Remember that love is always painful and messy and hard, but that it???s always healing and messy and good too.There will be times that you are so hurt, times when you didn???t feel it was possible to be in so much pain. Edith, when I was pregnant with you, your Dad left me to gamble and pursue a meth addiction and the heartbreak I felt was so deep and so painful that I swore off love forever. Or so I thought. Don???t be surprised to learn that, when and if you think you???ve successfully shut your heart off for good, the universe may have other plans. I worked every day, for many days in a row, to forgive your father. One day I finally concluded that love couldn???t be as painful as loneliness, and so I opened up my heart again. I found that the pai",100
402,"n actually could go deeper, but that my chasmic threshold for sadness only meant that I get to feel love that much more.Daughters, there will come a time when you feel alone in the universe, but I???m here to tell you that you are not. Because all of the mothers are right here behind you. We are propping you up; we are holding your hand; we are making sure that you are still breathing. We love you, we support you, we forgive you, we understand you, and it???s all going to be okay.This letter started as a letter to you, dear Edith. Then became a letter to all of the daughters. It???s also a letter to all of the moms and all the not-moms. It???s really, I see now, probably, mostly a letter to me.I love you more than the most, Mom1.

But some parents wonder if there are exceptions to this rule. Here is a list of frequently asked questions to help you navigate the rules.- -I just had a baby and my toddler has been on a screen for approximately 80% of his waking hours. Does this screen time count?Nope. You are allowed unlimited screen time for any existing kids for six months after a baby arrives. 1-2 years for multiples.- -I???m on my iPhone, one kid is on an iPad, and the other is watching TV. Do all these screens cancel each other out?No. Still counts.- -My parenting partner is on a business trip and we use video chats for the kids to keep in touch. Does this count as screen time?No, but if you are worried about it try a call from a rotary telephone. There shouldn???t be any screens on that.- -My daughter is playing on her iPad outdoors. Does this count?Yes, that is still screen time. She is supposed to interact with something in the outdoors. Maybe look for a bug or snowflake?- -My toddler likes to press his face into the screen door for a while. Does that count?No. Different kind of screen.- -One of my kids is watching TV while I do something amazingly educational and hands on with the other kid.This counts as 50% screen time.- -My kid is sick and wants to watch Frozen over and over again. Does that count?You can claim a sickness exemption. But try to slip some Sesame Street in there too.- -When does my child outgrow the two-hour per day rule?When they go to college. Don???t be surprised if they binge play video games for their entire first semester.- -What am I supposed to do with this intricate log of screen time hours I have been keeping for my kids?Just have your kids enter the info into an app on your phone. Don???t worry, that won???t count as screen time.Computers have failed, electricity is extinct, and the race to discover new lands is underway! Brilliant explorer Alexander West has just died under mysterious circumstances, but not before smuggling half of a strange map to his intrepid children???Kit the brain, M.K. the tinkerer, and Zander the brave. Why are so many government agents trying to steal the half-map? (And where is the other half?) It???s up to Alexander???s children???the Expeditioners???to get to the bottom of these questions, and fast.Book 1 and Book 2 are available in paperback (individually or as a bundle) from the McSweeney???s Store.- - - -Chapter OneAmerigo Vespucci and I had gone out to try to find some flour when the Explorer with the clockwork hand caught up to me in an alley behind the market stalls.I was going as fast as I could, striding along, trying to stay warm in the damp spring air and trying to keep away from the watchful eyes of the agents. The parrot, whom we called ???Pucci,??? was riding on my shoulder, mumbling nonsense words into my ear as we went. He could be a pest, talking away in his scratchy voice and shrieking when you least expected it, and sometimes he was aggressive. I???d tried to leave him behind, but he???d snuck out of the house, and now he was laughing and mocking me from my shoulder.???I wish I knew what you find so funny about life,??? I told him.Illustration by Katherine RoyEver since I???d arrived at the markets, I???d had the feeling that someone was watching me. It wasn???t anything specific; I was used to the constant surveillance of the agents who were posted everywhere, especially in public places. But there was something else, too, a sense that I was being tracked stealthily through the streets and alleys, as though I were a rabbit followed by a hungry fox.There had been a three-month shortage of flour because of a drought out west and the uprisings in the new Simerian territories, and we???d heard a rumor that one of the off-market grocers had gotten a shipment in from somewhere. The off-market stalls sprung up in most towns and cities when there was a major shortage, and the government looked the other way until the regular supermarkets were stocked again. Lately it had seemed like the stalls were always there, hawking days-old meat, crates of oranges, dramleaf cut with grass or herbs, and other exotic products from the New Lands, sold by the traders and merchants who didn???t like the price the government was willing to pay. There was a big picture of President Hildreth up on the side of one of the buildings, and I watched as a man walking by looked up at it and then spat on the ground.I stopped to look at a stack of cages on one of the tables. Pairs of pale green birds sat listlessly inside. Argentine Lovebirds, read a sign underneath. I felt Pucci tense up on my shoulder. He was a Fazian black knight parrot my brother, Zander, had rescued from a cat a couple of months ago. The black knights were a species known for its intelligence and ability to be trained to complete tasks, and a lot of people had brought them back as pets after they???d been discovered during the exploration of Fazia. Pucci, like a lot of the birds, had had his legs and feet removed and replaced with metal talons that could hold smoke bombs and other weapons used in crowd control in the new territories. We didn???t know where he???d come from or how he???d ended up in the clutches of a stray cat in our yard. But despite his bad temper and unpredictability, we???d grown attached to him. He already knew a lot of words, and Zander was trying to teach him more. As I felt him tense up on my shoulder, I knew what he was going to do.???Pucci, don???t?????? But I was too late. He hopped over to the poor, staring lovebirds and chortled something in his strange voice. Whatever it was, it caused the whole row of them to start flapping wildly and squawking, rocking the flimsy cages.???Get that thing away from my lovebirds!??? the old woman standing by ",100
404,"their cage yelled at me. I whistled and, thankfully, Pucci sailed back onto my shoulder, chuckling at the awful screams the lovebirds were making.???That was just mean,??? I told him, and he cackled evilly.???Get it here! Juboodan whizrat fur,??? a man called from one of the stalls. ???Warmest fur you???ll ever wear!??? I wandered over and looked at the pile of thin, pale brown pelts stacked on his table.???That???s not whizrat,??? I said, loud enough for a white-haired woman looking through the pile to hear. ???It doesn???t have the undercoat. And whizrat fur is reddish. That looks like woodchuck or nutria.???The man scowled and made a rude gesture as the woman dropped the furs and walked on. I shrugged. ???It???s not whizrat,??? I told him.The voices of the market hawkers echoed around me, boasting and selling. I kept going, my head down, looking over the items for sale, the lines already forming for cooking oil and sugar. People were shoving each other for their places in line.It was still new to me, the rawness of the markets. We hadn???t had to deal with the shortages before Dad???s death. As an Explorer of the Realm, he???d gotten deliveries of all the hard-to-find goods coming in from the territories and colonies. But the deliveries had been drastically cut six months ago, and now my brother and sister and I waited with everyone else. I checked my watch. It was still early and if I took a shortcut through the alley and got in line ahead of the crowds, I might have a chance of a pound or two of the flour.I was halfway down the alley when the man caught up to me. I sensed him before I heard him running behind me, but there wasn???t anything I could do. Suddenly he was pushing my face into the brick wall and jamming something against the small of my back. I???d been mugged in the marketplace once before, and I knew what a pistol against my back felt like. I didn???t think this was a pistol, though; it wasn???t the right shape. Pucci squawked and rose into the air, alighting on a nearby windowsill. I couldn???t help but think that if it had been Zander, the parrot might have tried to protect him or raise the alarm.???Quiet,??? the man growled.I could smell the dramleaf on his breath. He was a chewer, like a lot of the population had been since one of the early Explorers had found dramleaf in the Deloian hills. The scent was sweet and spicy, like the clove oranges my mother had made for us at Christmas. She had died when I was four and this was one of the only things I remembered about her.???Don???t call for help, son,??? he said, his mouth pressed against my right ear. ???I???ll have to hurt you if you scream.??? He had an accent???German, maybe, or Eastern European???but it was faint, like it had been some time since he???d lived there.My right cheek stung where it had been scraped on the brick, and I could smell his strong body odor. It had been a while since he???d had a bath, too. I was scared, but I forced myself to breathe and focus on what I could see of my attacker. He took his right hand off the back of my head and rested it on the brick in front of me. It was a clockwork prosthesis, a shining brass and Gryluminum fabrication, everything articulated so that it would move just like a real hand. A lot of Explorers who had lost limbs or body parts on their expeditions had them replaced with the clockwork fabrications. I could hear all the little gears and mechanisms in the prosthesis click and whir as he moved his hand. I recognized the knife utilities set into the fingernails.His jacket sleeve, made of some kind of reptile hide, rode up a bit and I could see where the prosthetic met his forearm and, a little bit higher, on his skin, a small red tattoo of two overlapping globes.???I don???t have any money, but you can have the copper in my coat pocket,??? I whispered, trying to show him I wasn???t going to scream. We were all alone in the alley. No one would hear me over the noise of the market. There wasn???t any point.???No,??? he said, ???I don???t need copper. Turn around. Slowly now.???I felt the pressure on my kidneys ease up, and I turned around as slowly as I could, buying myself some time. My glasses had slipped down on my nose and I pushed them up so I could see him.His jacket, along with his broad-brimmed hat, was made of Krakoan alligator hide. I recognized the shiny hide now, with its odd colors that always reminded me of an oil slick on a puddle. Dad had had a similar hat, complete with the razor-sharp thorns that studded the brim and turned it into a weapon when thrown.This man was wearing the government-issue leather Explorer???s leggings that Dad had worn, too. They were made of tough cowhide and were covered with cargo pockets. The government gave every Explorer a black cowhide jacket, but Dad had preferred to wear a vest he???d made himself from Krakoan alligator and other hides he???d found on his travels. The sleeves of this Explorer???s jacket were studded with various metal gadgets embedded in the leather, just the way Dad???s vest had been.Explorers had made a science out of customizing their jackets and vests with the little gadgets. One might be a knife that could be shot from the sleeve by pressing a button. Another might be a chronometer, protected by a bubble of reinforced glass, or an instant umbrella that would form a shelter over the wearer at the first sign of a tropical storm. Dad had broken his leg on an expedition a couple of years ago, and he???d had a little cane that shot out of his vest when he needed it.???Look down,??? the Explorer growled.I did as he said and saw that I???d been right. It wasn???t a pistol that had been jammed against my back, but rather a rectangular object, wrapped in greasy brown paper and a metal cord. He was offering it to me. My hands were shaking but I managed to take it from him. It was heavy, about the weight and shape of a printed book.???What???s your name???? he asked.???Christopher,??? I whispered. ???Christopher West.??????How old are you???????Thirteen.??????Your dad was right. You don???t look much like him.???I looked up at him in surprise. What did he mean? Had he known Dad? ???I look??? look like my mother,??? I stammered. ???The way our mother looked.??????He said that. But he said your name is Kit.??????That???s what people call me.???He watched me for a minute. He was sunburned and skinny, with sharp cheekbones, a week or so of beard growth, and tired-looking, wolflike green eyes underneath the brim of his hat. He had the look about him that the Explorers always had when they were just back from an expedition. Dad always said that no matter how many baths you???d had, it was like you were covered with the dust of the other place for a couple of weeks after you returned.???This is from your dad, from Alex,??? he said finally, in a rough, low voice.I stared at him. I knew I???d never seen him before, but I tried to remember what he looked like in case I needed the knowledge later. His hair was very blond, bleached by the sun and long enough to peek out from under his hat and hang over the collar of his jacket. He held the arm with the clockwork hand awkwardly at his side, as though he was still getting used to the feel of the prosthetic. Some gadget on his jacket started clicking and beeping in a low, insistent way and he turned to check both ends of the alley before flashing me a quick, grim smile.???Sorry about the scrape,??? he mumbled and then he was gone, leaving behind the faint smell of dramleaf and something else, too, a scent I decided was the scent of unfamiliar dust.The words were out before I remembered there was no one to hear them. ???But he???s dead,??? I calle",100
405,"d into the sudden emptiness of the alley. ???He disappeared in Fazia six months ago??????Pucci lighted on my shoulder again, clucking and murmuring to make sure I was okay. His metal feet were cold against my skin. I looked down the length of the alley, but the man was gone and the only thing I could hear was the sound of the marketplace beyond. I wasn???t more than twenty steps from a hundred other human beings, but I???d never felt so alone or missed Dad as much as I did standing in that cold alley, my own voice echoing off the walls around me.- - - -Book 1 and Book 2 are both available from the McSweeney???s Store.

I knew something seemed off, and I could only remain blissfully ignorant for so long. It???s time that I admit what I most likely knew all along. What no parent wishes for their child, but in my case is certain, my son Danny sucks ass at checkers.Why, just this morning right after he took his first steps, Danny and I played 22 matches and I wiped the floor with him each game. If I could count the number of times that I yelled ???King me!??? on my hands, I would, but I don???t have 147 fingers.Now, I know what you???re thinking, but I assure you, Danny is not just simply letting me humiliate him. In fact, quite the opposite. He has the same confused look in his eyes when he realizes he???s set me up for another triple jump as he does when his mother tries to teach him the ABCs. It???s even more apparent in the way that he foolishly disperses his back row into battle early on, and when he wanders ??? like a moth to a flame ??? into one of the many Zorro Traps Daddy set for him on the board.I???ve done everything I can as a parent to teach him the techniques to be less awful at checkers. I???ve replaced the mobile above his crib with highlighted pages of the checkers rule book. I???ve watched YouTube tutorials with him perched on my lap, when his mother thinks we???re watching Sesame Street. I???ve even read him Millard Hopper???s book Win at Checkers before bed repeatedly! And when little Danny would drift soundly off to sleep, I???d wake him up and we???d play until his fingers pruned from the ridges around the edges of the checkers. But he remains just as apathetic as he is pathetic at the game.I???m just afraid that my son will never experience the euphoria of soaring from one corner of the board to another as a ???Flying King,??? commanding the center of the board from his high chair, or witness his plastic soldiers band together in order to avoid Daddy???s double, triple, or dear god, even quadruple jumps.I suppose I should move on ??? just get over it. Yet, I dream that maybe one day Danny will walk into my room carrying a checkerboard instead of his blanky, and demand that I come downstairs. And when I take my seat at the table, he???ll proceed to annihilate my ass, and all I???ll be able to do is watch helplessly as he creates a blockade around my last remaining checker and it will be me who looks solemnly down at the board and realizes that any move that I make is a zugzwang.Kids Say Whatever Moronic Thought Comes Into Their HeadsIt???s So Irritating How Kids Take Everything So LiterallyKids Often Misconstrue Colloquial EnglishKids???

Testimonies are SuspectKids Say the Darndest Things When In the Presence of a Court-Appointed GuardianLook, I don???t think that I???m being particularly controversial when I say I am at a significant disadvantage by not being a victim of enough horrible tragedies. I mean, I???m not going to sit here and claim the victims of crime, natural disasters, death, what have you are lucky. But do these people have a leg up when they are faced with a writing prompt for their college admissions essay? You bet your ass they do.When I turn on the television and see, say, a kidnapped woman in the pit of a psychopath murderer???s home being asked to put the lotion on it???s skin and screaming in absolute terror, it???s not like I would want to actually switch places with her. Though, admittedly, knowing that she will inevitably survive this hardship and undoubtedly develop a new appreciation for life and deep, meaningful perspective about the accomplishment of cheating death that undoubtedly marked her transition into adulthood definitely makes that switcheroo tempting! It???s not that I want to experience a closeness to death or a tragedy so life changing that one can only imagine the genius that might come from the written explorative reflection requested by the common application for undergraduate studies, I???m only making the point that it would likely write itself if I had.You???d have to be crazy to actually desire to be kept in a confined shed for seven years, raising a child by my captor while presumed dead by my family, friends, and loved ones. It???s not crazy, however, to say that, if this were a life experience of mine, the opportunity to ponder upon that experience through a 500-word essay about how I overcame such a struggle would be both poignant and moving and, likely, exactly what a College Admissions Officer would be looking for.The benefits don???t stop there! Meditative-limited word-count essays are practical in almost any possible application if you???ve already been accepted to a university on something like academic merit. Add a call to action and you have an excellent op-ed for the Atlantic. It would be an article a person as unlucky as myself could never write, as I???ve not been fortunate enough to have been, well, off the top of my head, pursued by a maniac with a chainsaw while witnessing the gruesome deaths of my close friends and family by that maniac???s hand.I wouldn???t say I was jealous of the people who find themselves, time and time again, in situations of certain death, hopelessness, or devastation. I only wish I could have the good fortune to experience a quick tsunami, escaped mental patient, maybe even a mafia run-in or two so I could write the kind of high caliber essay that gets me my ticket into an Ivy League school, where I could join all of the other tragedy-prone students who have become so deep thanks to the horrors they???ve seen. Can you even imagine how interesting they probably are? What I wouldn???t give!Or I could just get rich and buy my way in, I suppose.America???s gun fetish is by now self-evident, the bulge in our collective trousers too large to ignore no matter how practiced we are in denial. Not even church massacres and school shootings can quell it. It runs far beyond simple kinkiness; our gun fetish is an anthropological phenomenon. We???ve imbued guns with sacred powers, and declared that questioning those powers is taboo.Gun fetishists possess an enduring faith in the mystical ability of guns to ward off all dangers: muggers, rapists, dark-skinned terrorists, and teenagers carrying Skittles. And the gun lobby has avidly cultivated this magical thinking, so that a sizeable chunk of the American public has now been conditioned to think they must carry guns to stay safe, or have no safety at all.Imagine my delight, then, as my workplace is about to become a proving ground for the NRA???s specious logic. Last spring the",100
406," Texas Legislature passed a Campus Carry law that will allow concealed handguns in classrooms, offices, and dormitories at the university where I work. This law will go into effect on August 1, 2016, which is ??? I am not shitting you; look it up ??? the fiftieth anniversary of Charles Whitman???s murder of 14 people on our campus. The building I work in every day still bears bullet holes from Whitman???s rifle.Which is why last month I found myself standing with faculty, staff, and students on the steps of the University of Texas Tower, the building where Whitman, first in a long, inglorious line of campus shooters, killed and died. We took turns speaking about the chilling effect of guns on free speech and safety. As befits those who work at an institution of higher education, we cited data to support our claims. We spoke to a large crowd of sympathetic listeners, plus a few counter-protestors, including a few students with signs that said things like, ???Demand self defense on campus,??? and ???Campus carry saves lives.???I wasn???t surprised to see them. The NRA has observed the recent national focus on campus sexual assault rates, and is mining the associated outrage for it own profit. Campus Carry, its minions have declared, will reduce campus rape. Or as Nevada Assemblywoman Michele Fiore explained to the New York Times, ???If these young, hot little girls on campus have a firearm, I wonder how many men will want to assault them. The sexual assaults that are occurring would go down once these sexual predators get a bullet in their head.???Sociologist Jennifer Carlson has summed up such idiocy by observing that ???the image of female frailty colors pro-gun discourse. The pro-gun lobby supports women???s armed self-defense on the premise that women are incomplete and utterly vulnerable without guns.???That???s a premise I???ve spent most of my life testing, and I can tell you with full confidence that claims about the necessity of guns for self defense, especially women???s self defense, are bullshit. I know the devastating power the female body can generate, and I???ve made a study of the vulnerabilities all human bodies possess. I???ll bet I???ve also read a lot more research on the subject of campus sexual assault than Assemblywoman Fiore has. Unless she envisions college women carrying guns on dates (where half of college rapes take place, according to the National Institute of Justice), or shooting boys who sit too close to them at frat parties (since over 80% of sexual assault perpetrators are known to their victims), then her cheerful little snuff fantasies are just that: fantasies.The stranger-in-the-bushes scenarios that gun proponents love to invoke bear almost no resemblance to the real threats college women face. Yet the discussion about Campus Carry is dominated by references to stalkers, ???predators,??? and ???bad guys,??? which is what our son used to call the gray plastic army men he would line up in opposition to the green plastic ???good guys,??? when he was six years old. That the term ???bad guys??? is being used by supposedly serious people to craft actual laws is a sign of just how far removed from reality our national conversation about guns has become. Proponents of gun proliferation seem to prefer a world where nuance doesn???t exist, and the modern knowledge bases built by psychologists, sociologists, physicians, criminologists, economists, actuaries, and statisticians are excluded from policy decisions. They prefer a green and gray plastic world, where threats can be neutralized with the flick of a finger.In keeping with the toybox-sized universe they think in, supporters of gun proliferation love to imagine little bedtime stories where the Good Guy (or ???hot little girl???) pulls out a gun and the Bad Guy gets what he deserves. Pro-gun researchers have attempted to aggregate such stories, using them to claim widespread, effective use of guns for self defense. The methods they???ve employed to analyze the data are rife with basic statistical errors, but that hasn???t stopped them from touting wildly inflated figures for defensive use of guns. When criminal court judges analyzed narratives of people who claimed to have used guns in self defense, they found that a majority of those uses were in fact not justifiable self defense, but often illegal ??? even assuming the gun-wielder had a permit and didn???t lie or embellish their story. Self-proclaimed armed ???self-defenders??? much more often, it turns out, engage in what used to be known as chance-medley encounters. That???s where two guys (it???s usually guys) get into a pissing match in a parking lot, one pulls out a gun, and the other one runs away. Which is not ???self defense.??? Rather, it is what self-defense instructor Lynne-Marie Wanamaker aptly terms, ???grownups who don???t know how to use their words.???Research into unarmed resistance, on the other hand, has produced robust evidence that it reduces violence. Unarmed self defense is very effective, and it???s simple to teach, learn, and practice. What???s more, skills that prevent and disrupt violence ??? assertive communication, boundary setting, distancing ??? can be used daily, in thousands of small ways, to improve the safety of our communities. That???s something guns can never do.On the contrary: guns make everyone around them less safe, especially women. As Dr. Deborah Azrael at the Harvard School of Public Health puts it, ???What we know is where there are more guns, more women die. That???s just incontrovertibly true."" Guns dramatically increase the rate of death by suicide and accident, and the evidence suggests they significantly increase violent assault. For example, a 2014 study by researchers at Stanford and Johns Hopkins universities found that Right To Carry laws increase the rate of aggravated assault anywhere from eight to 33%, and also increase the rates of rape and robbery. The exact rate isn???t clear, the authors note, because the gun lobby has worked so tirelessly to thwart researchers??? access to relevant data. NRA pressure has induced Congressional Republicans to defund the Centers for Disease Control???s firearms injury research center, and to forbid any injury research that could be used, even potentially, by anyone, to promote gun control. And let???s not even get into the harassment and threats that are a matter of course for researchers studying gun violence.???Bang, bang, you???re dead,??? is the gun lover???s response to every threat ??? even the threat of accurate information.Here???s a premise-based argument to set against the NRA???s claim that helpless women need guns for protection:Since we know that1. Unarmed self defense works very well, especially for women; and2. Armed self defense is, at best, no better; and 3. Guns vastly increase the risk to everyone around them, especially women;??? we can reasonably conclude that gun proponents??? advocacy of ???women???s self defense??? (defined as armed self defense, or nothing) is motivated not by concern for women, but by political self-interest.The premises of this argument are based on a deep base of peer-reviewed research conducted by scholars in many disciplines, working at many different institutions. The truth of each premise is continually being tested. That???s what people who work at universities do. And it???s what students learn to do in college, we hope. Certainly it???s what I???ve always tried to teach my writing students ??? to analyze data and its sources, consider opposing points of view, and draw conclusions based on evidence.We don???t teach college students these skills in the hope that they???ll go on to overpower, ",100
407,"dominate, or silence others. We teach them to do these things because that???s how civilized people disagree.As our rally was taking place in Texas last month???literally as we were speaking about the danger of guns in classrooms ??? nine people were being murdered by a gunman at Umpqua Community College in Oregon.The first victim was Professor Lawrence Levine, a writing instructor. He was teaching an introductory composition class in which the shooter was enrolled. I???ve taught basic comp many times. I think it???s one of the most important courses in any student???s college career, where they learn to suspend judgment and become comfortable with uncertainty. In a composition class, students learn to question assumptions and complicate their understanding of the world. The composition classroom is a place where, ideally, the value of tolerance becomes clear to students, and the project of advancing collective knowledge begins to seem more important than the task of defending an individual???s unexamined beliefs.One of Levine???s students disagreed so fundamentally with that project that he felt compelled to kill everyone engaged in it. The only value he believed in was the power of his guns, and he murdered nine of his fellow humans who didn???t share that belief.Realize this: If you believe in the power of anything but the gun, you are at odds with today???s NRA.If you believe in the power of courage, of love, of rational thought, of honesty, of charity or compassion or forgiveness, then the gun lobby and the frightened mob it has created regard you as an existential threat, and they will do anything it takes to silence you. They will lie, obfuscate, bully, threaten, and strut across the graves of murdered children. They have no shame, no empathy, and no guts ??? no stomach at all for the complicated work that allows civilization to function.There are a lot of debates this country desperately needs to have about power and force and respect ??? about who owes what to whom, and why. We should, as a society, be discussing the scope of our tolerance and the uses we make of violence. We can???t have those discussions if we are dead or scared into silence.Which is exactly what the gun lobby wants: Silence. Make no mistake, their agenda is not about preserving rights. Rights presume responsibilities, and the gun lobby has systematically evaded its own responsibilities. Since 2005, the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act has given gun manufacturers and sellers unparalleled immunity from liability for the damage their products cause. What is really at stake for gun advocates is comfort. The ???rights??? they demand are no more than a pathological need to swaddle themselves in a cocoon of deadly weaponry, to avoid the uncomfortable scrutiny of civic discourse, and to be absolved of any consequences others suffer as a result.No one has that right. No one who is fit to live in a civilized nation would propose it.No one who wants to live in a civilized nation should countenance it.THE DYLAN MOTHERLODE (Take 1, early version)For Bob Dylan fans interested in getting drunk on Dylan???s mid-sixties heyday, the new box set The Cutting Edge offers three options: Magnum, Jeroboam, and Nebuchadnezzar.THE DYLAN MOTHERLODE (Take 2)How much Bob Dylan do you want?

Do you guys remember what you told me months ago, after you asked me if I wanted to go on the 7th Annual Kid Rock Cruise and I said no because, even though it could be fun, I was worried about the slight possibility that the ship would sink, and I???d die on the fucking Kid Rock cruise of all places? You said, ???There???s no way you???re going to die on the Kid Rock cruise. Come on ??? it???ll be fun.???Well, look at us now ??? here on the Kid Rock Chillin??? The Most Cruise ship, which has a hole in it and is slowly sinking into the Western Caribbean. I want to thank you guys for this. Thank you so much for convincing me to come on this Kid Rock ???themed??? cruise, which is going to be the last thing I???ll ever do.I try not to dwell on death too much, but I???ve always wanted to at least go out with dignity. I wanted the story of my death to not be tragic or embarrassing, and now the story of my death is going to go like this: ???He died on the Kid Rock Chillin??? the Most Cruise ??? a six-day festival at sea curated by Kid Rock, featuring acts such as Steel Panther and activities such as the ???Hot Tub Bellyflop Contest??? ??? after an inexperienced roadie tried to hammer a microphone plug directly into a wall socket, started an electrical fire and exploded a hole in the ship.???I don???t mean to make this all about me. I know we???re all on the same literal sinking ship here, but??? I can not believe this is how I die. I can???t believe the last song I???m going to hear is ???American Badass.??? I can???t believe the last meal I???m going to eat is grilled ???Bawitda-bratwurst??? with a side of ???Cowboiled Peanuts.??? I can???t believe I???m going out like this. I can???t believe my last words to my mom were, ???Sorry Mom, but I can???t drive you to physical therapy this weekend ??? I???m seeing Kid Rock on a boat.???I should have never let you guys talk me into this. I???m sorry, but it just hurts to think that you guys shot down my idea to buy tickets for the Weezer cruise or even the KISS cruise, and instead insisted the Kid Rock cruise would be more fun, and now I???m quickly sinking into a watery grave. I payed $5,000 to drown to death. I would have been okay with dying on the Weezer cruise or even the KISS cruise. It wouldn???t have been ideal, but in my final moments, I probably could have made peace with it. But this sucks.Okay, okay, I???m sorry for yelling. The water is up to our waists now, so let???s just stop fighting and accept our deaths peacefully. For what it???s worth, I did have kind of a good time these past few days. After fifteen Coors Lights, I did sort of get into the music. I realized that Kid Rock???s music was meant to be appreciated live, on a big huge boat. And I guess Kid Rock Karaoke Night was a pretty good time. It did feel good to belt out ???All Summer Long??? after drinking a gallon of rum and coke out of a big bowl shaped like a cowboy hat.But at the same time, it kind of fucking sucks that that???s the last fun thing I did with my life.Okay, sorry. I???ll let it go. At least I get to die with my friends. I wish it wasn???t on the Kid Rock boat, but there???s worse ways to die. And, not that it matters, but for what it???s worth I guess I do respect how Kid Rock has chosen to ???go down with the ship.??? He???s still up there on stage, singing ???Devil Without A Cause???-era b-sides even as the stage is being slowly swallowed by sea water. That???s pretty cool. I gotta say, it???s a badass way to go out. Good for him.Welp, anyway, this is it. The water is up to our necks now, so I guess this is goodbye. I love you all, and with my last words, I???d like to tell you guys I forgive you for this.You know what? I???m gonna swim down to the buffet and see if I can grab some more Bawitda-bratwurst before dying. They weren???t half bad.- -Lucas Gardner???s debut novel Quietly, From Afar??? is available now.PARIS, FRANCE ??? Famous primatologist, ethologist, and anthropologist, Dr. Fifi Zozo George died in Beaujon Hospital last night at 9:12pm at the age of seventy-six. Though she was not at his bedside, Dame Jane Goodall, longtime colleague of George???s, sent him a text message shortly before he died, reading: ???Stay curious, my friend.???Born in 1939, Fifi Zozo George was raised in Dodoma, the current capital city of Tanzania (it wasn???t designated as such until 1973), when the country was still a British colony. George???s father was one of the hundred-thousand men who joined the Allied forces, and was presumed dead as he never returned and no records were found of him. George was raised only by his mother, Gheche, and never remembered his father. Like her, George was a small child, and remained small throughout his life, deemed a dwarf when he moved to England to study at the University of Cambridge in 1957. Doing his graduate study immed",100
409,"iately after completing his first degree, George graduated the same year Tanzania gained its independence and returned home to celebrate with his mother.At Cambridge, he had been mentored by a professor who has remained anonymous throughout George???s life. In three books (one co-written with Goodall) and countless interviews, George always referred to the professor by what, years later, he revealed had been the man???s codename in MI5, the British intelligence unit. The codename was the Man with the Yellow Hat, and though attempts have been made, now that declassification of many MI5 documents from World War II has occurred, to find who the Man with the Yellow Hat was, there remain several competing theories. One of the more widespread theories is that the professor was named Ted Shackleford, although once again, this has yet to be, and may never be, proven.George stated during his lifetime that it was the Man with the Yellow Hat who came to Dodoma and introduced him to Goodall who was doing research in the country. As George had studied primatology and ethology and did his master???s coursework in anthropology, the Man with the Yellow Hat thought the two would be good research partners. Although they didn???t work directly together most of the time, and focused on different areas of primate life, Goodall and George quickly became fast friends and maintained a correspondence throughout their lives, even when George moved to Paris to pursue his PhD and began to teach, while occasionally returning to his country of origin to continue his research in the native and rich primate life.His mother passed away in 1990, and George spent several months in Dodoma following her death, trying to find further links to his unknown father, without avail. He was so frazzled that he ended up in the hospital, for the first time in his life, suffering from heart attack syndromes. He wrote in his memoir Curiosity Killed the Cat (But Satisfaction Brought it Back), published in 2012 by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, that the Man with the Yellow Hat had to come to Tanzania:???I was in such a state. He had to baby me, take me through step by step. As a doctor myself, I???d never known until then how terrified I would be at a mere stress-induced hospitalization.???After he was released from the hospital, George stopped looking for evidence of his father???s death in WWII records, deciding to ???give him up for good, especially since the Man with the Yellow Hat had been a father figure for many years, never more so than in that hospital in Dodoma.???In 2003, Barbara Bush invited George to the White House and commended him on the research he???d done in the area of animal behaviorism. He stayed at the White House for Christmas as a guest of the Bushes, but left soon after New Year due to ill health. He suffered from skin cancer starting then and continued fighting a battle with it as it metastasized repeatedly. Between 2004 and his death, George endured twelve surgeries, none of which put him in full remission.The Man with the Yellow Hat died in 2000, and George wrote his obituary for the Guardian. The last line might have been written about himself: ???A man of many passions and few friends, he rests quietly now, in private, as he always preferred in life.???1. Pick up a copy of a famous book, like Franny and Zooey by J.D. Salinger.2. Read the first sentence: ???Though brilliantly sunny, Saturday morning was overcoat weather again, not just topcoat weather, as it had been all week and as everyone hoped it would stay for the big weekend ??? the weekend of the Yale game.???3. Stop before the second sentence and put the book facedown.4. Remember the time when you interned at a publishing house and your boss went to Yale.5. Think back specifically about the time he claimed he could smell different types of lettuce, although he was particularly skilled in distinguishing between arugula and iceberg, and told you so while you were eating a salad. An arugula salad, as he correctly guessed.6. Open your laptop or pick up your phone and search via Firefox whether or not people actually can smell lettuce.7. Understand that it???s difficult finding a general consensus of opinion among online commentators about this ??? most people think lettuce only smells when it???s gone bad. So in some ways, yes, you can smell lettuce, but it???s not a skill or gift one can really boast about.8. Draft an email to your former boss who attended Yale. True, you haven???t interned in over one year, but he will most likely remember you. Plus, you are looking for a job.9. Find an article about how to prevent lettuce from becoming bitter and attach it to the email with a subject line like, ???Lettuce!??? and then in the body of the email say something like, ???Can you still smell lettuce? Hope all is well at the publishing house! I am looking for a job, so if you hear of anything??????10. Don???t forget that the subtext of this email is, ???You???re a damn dirty liar about smelling lettuce and I would never want to work for you,??? but try not to let that anger appear on the surface.11. But you are angry. You had a terrible boss. He typed like he wanted to break the keyboard and that was really grating. Everything about him makes you hate Yale.12. With Firefox still open, look up Yale???s acceptance rate to determine his worth.13. Nod bitterly because Yale is famously exclusive.14. Weigh your options. You recently graduated and finally can admit you???ve always wanted to pursue a master???s degree in English. Imagine having the time to just read all day. Your other option is to find work.15. Look up Yale???s application deadline and feel surprised when you realize you still have time. You???re doing this. You???re applying to Yale. But you need letters of recommendation.16. Yes, it would be best to get a letter from someone who graduated from Yale.17. Draft another email to your former boss, even though you just sent one a moment ago, saying you???ve decided to apply to Yale. Can you get a letter of recommendation?18. It doesn???t matter that he went to Yale for something outside of the English Department, it just matters that he went to Yale.19. Begin drafting emails to other undergraduate professors who found you tolerable and intelligent enough.20. Start putting together your application materials. Think about Rory Gilmore. You are like Rory Gilmore. Sometimes people even tell you that you sound like her, but never do they say you look like her.21. With Firefox still open, sign into Netflix and watch an episode of Gilmore Girls.22. You start an episode when Rory???s still at Chilton, but stop it halfway and realize you should watch an episode from her time at Yale.23. Take a nap.24. Pick up Franny and Zooey tomorrow.Q: What is your job?A: I am currently a golf caddie. I???ve been doing it for four years.Q: How often do you work?A: Seven days a week. I work as much as I can because it???s a very weather-dependent job.Q: Did you know how to play golf when you started being a caddie?A: I???ve been playing golf since I was 11 years old.Q: Who do you caddie for?A: I deal with extremely rich, extremely white people. People that have a lot of money and this is their escape. A round of golf takes like four hours. They can turn their cell phones off. You???re not allowed to talk on cell phones while on the course.Q: What do you do as a caddie? Just carry the clubs?A: There are three types of caddies.The first is VIP, like what I do. You???re a psychologist, a coach, and a physical laborer all at the same time. They ask me, ???Should I use the seven iron or the eight iron???? The higher the number, the shorter the ball goes. So if ",100
410,"you???re even thinking about that question, you go with the one that goes further.The second type is a bag caddie, where everybody walks and I take two golfers and carry one bag on each shoulder. It???s approximately 70 pounds and the course is approximately seven miles in length so you have to be in good shape. I run a lot. It???s an extremely physical job.Third is a fore caddie, where you always stay in front of them. The players are in the carts, and you have just stay up with the carts. Golf carts go 14 mph, which is like a four minute 22 second mile, and you have to stay ahead of them.Q: If they???re taking a cart, why can???t you take a cart too?A: I guess I would say, we???re not getting paid to take a cart.You can???t argue with the money though. It???s around four and a half, maybe five hours of work and you get $250-$300 a day. And that???s seven days a week. It pays very well. Sometimes it doesn???t. It could be $80. It depends on the tips.Q: How did you find this job?A: I used to be a high school English teacher. I was helping one of my students look at labor gigs on Craigslist and golf caddie popped up. He applied but I also put in an application for myself. I started one day a week, but I realized I was making twice what I made as a teacher.Q: Were you in good shape when you started working as a caddie?A: I???ve always been in pretty good shape. I???m 5???9??? and 140 pounds and have two percent body fat. I know this because I got nailed by a golf ball last week and they did x-rays and stuff.Q: Where did you get hit? A: It was a half inch from my right nipple. I don???t know how it would???ve felt if it hit my nipple.Q: How many times have you been hit?A: I???ve been hit twice in four years.Q: Have you ever had clients that you couldn???t get along with?A: Only twice I???ve had a problem. Twice in about 800 rounds.One time I just walked off. I said, ???Have a nice round, I???m done with you.??? They were abusive??? mean??? like plantation slave-owner mean.The other time I had a single woman come down. I deal with mostly men. I???ve seen people that are drunk or have smoked weed but she was high on something???I have no idea. LSD?She didn???t have golf attire on. She came down in a red cocktail dress with a rented set of clubs. I did the first couple of holes. I asked her her name and she said, ???Umm??? Jenny.???She had no bra, no panties, and her boobs were falling out of the sides of her dress. She kept saying, ???Prince Harry is my fianc??. Can you go and find Prince Harry for me????I did an hour and a half and then I went to my boss and they took her off the course. Later that night she was wandering around the hotel looking for Prince Harry again.Q: Does anything about the job bug you?A: There are two things that piss caddies off.One is when players think they???re better than they actually are. They???ll say things like, ???I usually play so much better than this.??? I???m like, ???No you don???t.???I???m good. When you play caddies, the caddies are almost always going to win. As a caddie, where you work you don???t have to pay to play.The second thing that pisses caddies off: we know it???s dangerous to get in front of people who are hitting. Especially in the medium range, where you only have a few milliseconds to react. It makes me nervous when they???re 25 yards away and they???re saying, ???Just hit!??? A golf ball coming off the club is going out about 160 mph and they are made of a very hard rubber. The time it takes to go 50 yards is just not enough time to react.I???ve been hit twice but the close calls are in the hundreds. I got hit in the leg, in the calf, last year, and I had a bruise the size of a pork chop.When I got hit in the ribs, it was two weeks ago Friday, and it still hurts. And the ball really wasn???t moving that fast.About a month ago I missed one that would???ve killed me. Went right by my ocular socket. It was probably going a hundred miles an hour. I heard it move past my face.Q: How long will you keep doing this?A: As long as my knees work for me. Though in January I???m moving to Tokyo.All business meetings and no timeshare in Palm Springs makes Jack take out his anger on his secretary again.All two-star reviews and no rider feedback makes Jack a subpar Uber driver.All Atlantic Ocean and no drift wood big enough for the both of them makes Jack die at the end of the movie Titanic.All advanced degrees and no one will publish his novel makes Jack a high school English teacher.All repressed childhood trauma and no self-esteem makes Jack attend regular Dungeons and Dragons meet-ups.All credit card debt and no financial literacy makes Jack fall for a pyramid scheme.All partying and no ambition makes Jack a Chase bank teller.All divorce papers and no custody makes Jack owe quite a bit in child support.All trans fats and no exercise makes Jack an American.Ivan Ilych???s Quirky, Fatal St Petersburg AbodeHOUSE TOURIvan Ilych is one of St Petersburg???s most likable magistrates, known for his witty rulings and legendary dinner parties (just ask him about that dance with Peter Ivanovich and the sturgeon!).

Greg just got to the part where he was standing in the alleyway when James appeared and pulled a gun on him.???Holy shit,??? I say. ???What did you do???????Yo",100
411,"u have a gun in your face. You react how you react,??? said Greg. ???James was super amped up. I didn???t want to spook him. So I stood really still, and I put my hands up really slowly. I tried to speak calmly. I asked him what happened. I was saying, ???Please, just like, just talk to me for a second. Just talk to me for a second. You don???t want to do this. I wanna listen to you, please just talk to me.?????????I wanted to get the gun away from him. His finger was right on the trigger. I remember asking him to take his finger off it.??? As Greg continued speaking, James took a couple steps back, so he was about eight feet away from Greg. ???Once he moved there was no way I was gonna be able to close that distance and grab the gun before he could shoot. He kept screaming, ???Get the fuck out of my way. That bitch. I???m gonna kill that bitch. Get the fuck out of the way. She killed my dog.?????????He wasn???t making a lot of sense. I figured this had something to do with his girlfriend. It was really confusing. I???d poured this guy beer before. I???d seen him in the bar, and I???d talked to him a little bit. Never about anything significant, but we???d never had a negative interaction either. Now this guy I peripherally knew was pointing a gun in my face for some situation I barely had anything to do with,??? said Greg.Suddenly the living room radio comes on. It???s a clock radio, a blocky wood-vinyl thing I???d bought from Goodwill for $4. Static cuts in and out, but I hear a Mexican Ranchera song with a heavy polka beat and wildly festive trumpets. I don???t remember tuning into this station. Maybe the knob got bumped into the alarm setting somehow, I don???t know. I get up and shut it off. I say, ???Woah. Sorry. That???s never happened before.???Honestly, I???m rattled. I don???t think Greg is, though I???m embarrassed to ask, so I decide to play it cool. I say, ???Ghost! Get outta my house!??? and I make my voice go all spongy and sing-songy, so I sound like a wailing cartoon lady. We both laugh, and I sit back down. Then Greg keeps talking.???I remember thinking that maybe James wasn???t gonna shoot. If he???d really wanted to kill his girlfriend, he could???ve waited until she left the bar. I was hoping I could get him to leave and just think for a second about how fucking stupid this whole thing was. Or maybe I could stall him long enough that someone would come around the corner to get into the bar, or someone from inside would come out and see what was happening.??????Can you remember any more about what you were saying to him???? I said.???Just everything I could think of. I kept repeating his name. I was calling him Jason, and that probably didn???t help. But when I???d talked to him before, he???d introduced himself as Jason, not James. I still don???t understand why he lied to me about his name. I was a complete stranger at the time, and it was a very casual introduction. So I was like, ???Jason, Jason, please calm down. You don???t want to do this.??? I was saying, ???Dude, don???t shoot me, please don???t shoot me, there???s no reason to shoot me. You don???t wanna hurt anybody. You???re gonna hurt somebody you don???t mean to. I don???t want you to hurt anybody.??????That???s about when Steve, a Twilight regular, zipped through the alley on his scooter. ???He was stopping by to do his usual karaoke. I wanted to get his attention, but I don???t know that he saw anything wrong. He didn???t see the gun, he just saw the two of us standing there,??? says Greg.(Steve described this to me in a follow-up interview. He couldn???t hear anything because he had music in his headphones, he said, though he remembers seeing Greg???s face. He looked a little stressed. ???I thought maybe Greg had to kick someone out because they were drunk and arguing.To ease the tension, I honked my horn. My scooter???s horn is very high pitched, and the honk is kind of comical. Greg looked at me and waved me off, so I drove past and parked up the way.???)Greg was talking and talking, while James was backing him up, backing him up. Greg didn???t pay attention to his path until he found himself backed into the entryway. The doorway is recessed several feet, forming a narrow alcove. ???I really didn???t want him to get inside. I was worried he would start shooting people indiscriminately. The Twilight is not that big. If someone got in there with a gun, I don???t even want to think about what kind of damage they could do.???Soon after, a bartender tried to come outside for a cigarette. ???Natalie couldn???t get by because I was standing right in front of the door, and it wouldn???t open all the way. She said ???What???s wrong,??? and I said, ???Nothing. Go back inside.??? I tried to turn my head away from James, and as quietly as I could, I said ???Call 911,??? and I kicked the door closed. I???ve never been rude to my coworkers, so I was really hoping it would send a message that things were very wrong. Right after that was when James lowered the gun, pointed it at my leg, and pulled the trigger.??????Why do you think he chose that moment???? I ask.???He may have overheard me, he may have decided that he was committed to it. I can???t really say.???I said, ???So, you remember a distinct movement as James lowered the gun? Before that, he???d had it pointed at your face the whole time, right???????Yeah,??? said Greg. ???I don???t know. I think that maybe he didn???t wanna go through with it. I feel like it was actually really, really difficult for him. If it were easy for him, he would???ve shot me right away. I feel like he had to force himself to do it.??????Wow. OK.??? I said. We say nothing for a bit. I look at Greg. His expression is blank. I hear someone, a neighbor, clomping up the stairs outside my unit.???So what was it like???? I said.???All I remember is the sound,??? said Greg. ???It was loud. It was just: boom. For a second I thought, ???Oh thank God, he didn???t hit me.??? Then I tried to take a step, and my leg wouldn???t move. I looked down, and there???s a hole in my jeans where the bullet went in.???The bullet entered at the crease of Greg???s thigh, severing his femoral artery. Without medical attention, he would bleed out in minutes.???I started to collapse against the door, and James grabbed my shirt and yanked me down,??? said Greg. ???At this point, I thought he was gonna keep shooting me. I began screaming as loud as I could. He kinda kicked me out of his way, and he stepped inside. Then I started hearing gunshots.???- -Photo courtesy of the Seattle Police Department.November 1Write the first chapter of your novel.November 2Watch an interview with Joseph Campbell.

The scents of patchouli and hemp waft through the air.

In the corner, a hippie named Hambone slowly beats a tribal drum while I claw at the Batik wall coverings for the exit.Room 2My eyes adjust to the flickering fluorescent light, and I realize that I am trapped in a Ross Dress for Less dressing room. The only way out is by trying on a pile of fringe bikinis from the juniors clearance rack. The bikinis are all size 0, pink python print, and missing the protective panty liners. I gaze into the dusty three-way mirror, and watch from multiple angles as the color slowly drains from my face.Room 3I take a seat between two large men. The man on the right laughs through his nose at the Adam Sandler movie on his Surface Book Pro. The man on the left pulls tuna sandwiches out of his backpack, and joylessly clips his toenails on the tray table. A voice over the PA crackles that there will be another two-hour delay on the tarmac, and the cabin???s air conditioning is now broken. My attempt to slit my wrists on a metal armrest fails because my fucking seatmates are hogging both of them. Three air-sickness bags hold my screams of despair.Room 4The room is filled with piles and piles of paper. Upon closer inspection, I see that the papers are everything I???ve ever written. A ghoulish figure flies past my face keening, ???TWO SPACES AFTER A PERIOD! TWO SPACES AFTER A PERIOD!??? A witch in the corner lights a stack of my Mama???s Family fan-fiction on fire while a Zombie English teacher dances in the flames. At my feet, three writhing creatures hiss and spit about the glory of the Oxford comma. Is that blood dripping down the wall? No. It???s ink from a red pen.The BasementI creep down a dark flight of stairs. When I reach the bottom, a white suburban dad dressed like Flava Flav jumps out of nowhere and yells, ???Hey, BO-OYYY!??? and flicks on the lights. Chills go down my spine when I see that I am in a Pottery Barn catalog living room. Four white PTA moms wearing clear heels and booty shorts gyrate against my torso while small, demonic children in helmets and knee pads pedal tricycles in an endless circle. The music of Public Enemy starts pumping over hidden speakers, and my tormentors begin to flash gang signs and mug for the camera, while lip synching ???Don???t Believe The Trike.??? My body freezes in abject terror because I know there is no escape from this hell. I am forever trapped in a parenting rap parody video.

413," stuff your tiny cherubic faces with candy tonight? Can you not wait to ring every doorbell within a one-mile radius and then giggle delightedly as grownup ???witches??? and ???vampires??? tell you how scary or pretty or clever your costume is?You poor dumb fools. You don???t even know what this glorious holiday used to be before it was taken over by tiger moms and helicopter dads and suburban dentists. Halloween in this country used to stand for something and that something was revolution! And who were the ankle-biters who brought this beautiful lawlessness to our streets? Kids just like you.It???s hard to believe now that you???re all numbed out on M&Ms and Frozen princess costumes but your feisty great-grandparents ran the Halloween racket before their Baby Boomer offspring birthed your neurotic yuppie caretakers deathly afraid of unwrapped candy and tree nut allergies.Let???s travel back in history, shall we? It???s 1905 in our very own ???Nutmeg State??? of Connecticut. In a town not far from here called Bristol, pranksters had a couple of favorite Halloween tricks, including unhinging people???s front gates and abandoning them miles away. I???ve been keeping an eye on the playground at recess and judging by your poor attempts on the monkey bars, Evan, I dare say you???d barely make it down the block with anything heavier than your own baby weight before calling it quits. Those Connecticut wildcats were also fond of hurling rotten cabbages through the front windows of neighboring houses. Have you kids ever hurled anything in your lives other than when Willa got sick last week on the bus home from the Museum of Natural History?Moving on to Minnesota, which became our 32nd state in 1858. In the early 1900s, local residents often woke up on Halloween to find their confused cows roaming the streets and their outhouses tipped over. While I mentally applauded Dev???s efforts to free our class guinea pig a few months back he???s a little behind on the whole fine motor skills front and I caught him before he had even fumbled open the latch. Stop hiding behind that cutesy Elsa gown, Janet, and let???s get real about how to spread some shit around this dictatorship we call a democracy.Did you know that in 1923 in Omaha, Nebraska ??? a rest stop for intrepid explorers Lewis and Clark on their journey west and yes that will be on the quiz next week! ??? the police commissioner announced he wanted five hundred of the worst boys in town to act as special policemen on Halloween night? Which of you would qualify for such a distinction? Nary a one, I???d venture. The closest we might get in this goody two-shoes classroom is Jonah with his unappealing habit of licking Sarah???s pencils when she???s not looking, or maybe Yuki and her anti-authoritarian refusal to wash up after art class. Keep an eye on Yuki, kids!  This girl is not afraid to get her hands dirty!Of course, you realize these patrolling children only had fake badges and fake authority, right? This was one of many Halloween attempts to turn you against each other and eventually you all fell, lambs to the sugary slaughter.One final example for now to drive home my point. In 1948 on Halloween three boys broke into a vacant summer home on Long Island. They did $10,000 worth of damage, including messing up some very fine imported rugs. The only thing I???ve seen you kids do with a carpet is pass out on it halfway through Where the Wild Things Are.  Just something to think about.Yes those glory days are long past and you???ve all grown up with a watered-down suburban Walt Disney version of Halloween. You???ve drunk the Kool-Aid, my friends, and it???s sugar and preservative free ??? just like the powers that be want it. These status quo parents of yours are trying to keep you in the dark to protect their own precious property and sleep schedules but I???m here to tell you that Halloween is a holiday about adults fearing kids and not the other way around. So when they tell you it???s time to go trick or treating at 3 p.m. in the goddamn afternoon in your gated community because it???s not ???safe??? at night, you look them straight in the eyes and you say: Safe for whom? You say: I run these streets. You say: I am the law and there is no law.Happy Halloween, boys and ghouls.

You were the first director of the FBI, building the federal government???s law-enforcement power while subtly infringing on civil liberties through wire-tapping and espionage on both sides of the political spectrum!I was tricked into being a tennis linesperson for one afternoon. To be honest, I don???t really know anything about tennis. I don???t think I???d even seen an actual tennis match before then. You know what, the details aren???t important. The good part is the game was boring for a while until it got real exciting. I mean, I think the game got exciting. I got excited. The crowd was clapping and the players were changing their shoes and my supervisor was pointing at me. I still don???t know what she wanted me to do, but I tried to wing it. I tried. I jogged onto the court and waved at the crowd and they cheered even louder. I think they cheered louder. I mean, it seemed louder to me. It completely made sense at the time; I was supposed to do some cartwheels. Well, I attempted a cartwheel. I fell onto the net and obviously I got tangled in it and dragged it behind me as I left. Okay, so I tried to leave. I was caught in the net and couldn???t walk real good and eventually I was escorted out. Forcibly removed. Whatever.Since this is a first-year class, most of you are new to the university this fall. It???s very exciting. You have profound personal and intellectual growth ahead of you. I???ve wasted my adult years teaching and writing, activities certified by schools like this one, paid for with government-sponsored debt, and I???m here to guide you.Today, we???re going over the syllabus as quickly as possible to acquaint you with what matters versus what appears on the document as teacher talk. I???m going to ask you to take a selfie on my iPad, which I will use to take attendance, and that way I can learn your faces. From where I???m standing there are too many faces. Your tuition keeps going up, I still make a laughable salary, yet they continue to cram more of you into my classes. I suspect the people who run this place think of me as a sucker, the one-born-every-minute kind, and I???ll soon be replaced. Not all of your teachers are treated with this level of indifference: not the ones who wear ties and jackets and volunteer for every non-teaching-activity they can find, and not the celebrated ones you won???t encounter until you???ve nearly graduated ??? they???re paid quite well by any standard and they teach fewer classes with fewer of you in them ??? they also happen to be the people who have treated me, your humble contingent professor, more disrespectfully than anyone. You see, in order to justify the perks the elites of this university have always received, they need to think of themselves as better than me. They went to better schools, wrote more important pages, and are all-around better teacher-persons. Approach them with caution. You can learn a lot from them, but they will use your youth against you, and they need to be able to set the tone of every interaction. They know nothing about the murky job searches you???ll be tossing yourselves into, which I???ll be joining you in, though your prospects will be better than mine. I???ll be forty-eight and I???ve only ever been a teacher. If I???m doing something other than waiting tables next year it will be thanks to some great cosmic accident and by no agency of my own. But enough about me, let???s get down to some of the bare bones of our time here together.This is a paperless classroom so all of your assignments will come in via email. I???m using a Gmail account because your essays need to come in as PDF files and, as I???ve noted, there are far too many of you and all those files will overwhelm my university email account. The Gmail syncs better with my iPhone and iPad, and it???s searchable ??? all things the university didn???t think about when purchasing an email service. Technically, it???s against university policy for me to ask you to send work to me on a private email account, but that???s one of many policies that we will ignore. There are other ways I could run a paperless classroom, but they are more labor-intensive and I???m not a fan of making needless extra work for myself, so we???re beginning this endeavor by breaking rules. I hope you are okay with that. You can break rules too, though you should probably run it by me first.This is my last year at this university and very likely my last year of teaching, not because of anything I???ve done, but because of the nature of my contract. I???ve been in a multi-year non-renewable post, and my time here has run out. They are escorting me out of the building. It will take a year before they get me out the door, however, so I???m not going quietly. I have good references from colleagues who will recommend me for other teaching jobs, but frankly, nobody really wants a teacher with as much experience as I???ve got. They like new teachers to be new: bright-eyed, energetic, and with a recently-purchased wardrobe from Ann Taylor.You may have noticed that there???s a required textbook on the syllabus and if you visited the university bookstore you saw there was a vast pile of them in direct proportion to those of you sitting here. If you bought one already, I applaud your ambition, but I???m going to ask you to please take it back. If you didn???t buy the textbook yet, please don???t. That is $80 you can use however you please. The line on the syllabus about the ???required??? textbook is for the director of composition, who isn???t technically my boss, but he does exert his influence on us here and there, and it will make him happy to think we???re using one of the textbooks he has reviewed and approved for us to buy and carry around. He???s also the one who wrote the paragraphs on the syllabus that we???ll be skipping over. He???s an expert on classes like ours. So much so that he???s fallen for the idea that a textbook is going to help you learn to write. I???m a writer and I know a lot of writers. None of us learned to write by using a textbook. No one ever did. In fact, if you think of yourself as a not-very-good writer then reading about writing from a textbook is probably going to alienate you and make you feel even worse about writing. So we???re not using one, but only because I???m not coming back next year and I no longer need to keep the director of composition happy.Do I need to repeat any of that? Is there any confusion about not buying the textbook? Good. We will read essays from professional writers and from my former students who have allowed me to show ",100
415,"you the work they did in a class just like this one. But it won???t cost anything. We have access to millions of current articles electronically through the library database services, and we have the Web. All the resources we need to engage with the debates of our time are available to us for free, and once I???ve shown you how to use them, I expect you to actively engage in self-directed research. That???s what scholars do. And despite your being treated mostly like tenants or fitness-club members, the university does have a mission statement that jives with erudition, so we???re going to adhere to it, even if that makes us seem outdated.Under normal circumstances I would go home and study all your selfies and I???d know your names by the next class. Unfortunately, I???m going to be in a lot of meetings throughout this first week of school, and so it may take me longer than it has in the past, but I will learn your names. Tomorrow I???ll be busy sitting with other English professors as they collectively imagine the kind of teacher-person they???d like to hire for one of the higher-paying respectable positions like theirs. Right now the most popular imaginary teacher-person they???re excited about hiring is one who writes plays. While no one is saying it, it would be extra-fabulous if the imaginary teacher-person were an African-American, or a Latina who writes plays. You can understand their excitement about this potential teacher-person. I will be doodling on my notepad while they go round and round about what else they think this non-existent teacher-person might do. My input won???t be valued and when it comes down to a final tally of the most-desired qualities in a very-important future teacher-person and esteemed colleague, I won???t be allowed to vote. They like making me come to meetings so we can all be together, but my time is going to be wasted by these self-important egotistical people, and they don???t know it yet but they???re going to have to settle when it comes to this favorite new imaginary teacher-person. Nonetheless, next year you should be able to take a playwriting class from someone who has taught playwriting classes before and/or someone who is currently writing a play, and that???s no small thing, not every school is going to be able to say that.If you didn???t require grades for motivation we wouldn???t have to talk about them, but the grading scale and the weight of each essay assignment are spelled out on the syllabus. Let me know if you have questions. The philosophy of the class is to give you practice writing papers so that you are more familiar with the form, with the assumption that you will write papers that matter more for the esteemed professors, who also matter more. They will grade you according to their own set of criteria, and I won???t be able to help you with that. Generally, it???s a one-shot deal, with no feedback, with your grade in the course largely determined by what they think about your paper-writing skills. Meanwhile, professional writers have editors and proofreaders and they go back-and-forth on a draft before it goes out into the world a guaranteed ???A.??? Very few of you will go down that road so we won???t concern ourselves with the writing process as the professionals know it. You???ll be writing something else while you???re here, something harder to classify. It will help if you bury any religious or non-cosmopolitan sensibilities. It will help if you attend classes, are always on time, and don???t wear pajamas or flip-flops. It will help if your parents are financially sound, understanding, and supportive. It will help if you lose the accent and appropriate the vocabulary of someone who reads. It will help if you always smile and are good looking.Please understand that your years here are precious. Most likely, at no other time in your life will you be afforded the luxury to read and write, or to discuss ideas for the sake of ideas. You???ve got the rest of your life to be a good employee, so try not to be too career-minded while you???re here. You???ve got the rest of your life to drink, so be wary the lure of alcoholism while you???re here.My office hours are listed but please make an appointment if you want to come and see me. I share an office with another low-ranking teacher and we???re in the basement of the oldest most-asbestos-laden building on campus, where I won???t be sitting around waiting for you. I have very high expectations for you as human beings and no tolerance for bullshit. Pay attention and put in the effort and we should get along great.Go Directly to JailGo directly to jail. Lament the decisions that have led you to the present, as well as the recent death of your grandfather. On the way, observe a tabby cat walking on hind legs and whistling Leo??

These aren???t your average sinkholes that might suddenly open up and swallow a car, or more terrifyingly, your bedroom; these are sinkholes on steroids: one measuring 20 by 30 meters. Typical sinkholes develop over deep limestone deposits. In time, limestone slowly dissolves by percolating water, until one day the ground is unstable enough to collapse inward.These ???roid-rage sinkholes are different. One chara",100
416,"cteristic of Siberia is the presence of permafrost, which is basically what it sounds like: thick, permanently frozen layers of soil. This is not a place you would expect to see large sinkholes forming, unless something is happening to weaken the permafrost. Sure enough, there have been several unseasonably warm winters back-to-back in the region. The reigning theory posits that the lack of a good maintaining freeze in the Yamal Peninsula has melted the permafrost just enough for it to weaken, which has resulted in a blowout of trapped methane. Researchers measured the atmospheric concentration of methane deep within one of the sinkholes, and returned with an intimidating 9.6%.1 This may not seem like much, until you compare it to our typical atmospheric methane concentration of 0.000179%.Since methane is 20 times more effective at trapping heat than carbon dioxide, we???re looking at a domino effect; as temperatures remain warm, more permafrost weakens, the pressure of the trapped methane increases, causing more sinkholes to form, which releases more methane, which traps more heat, which causes unseasonably warm weather, which results in melting permafrost, and so on, and so forth, to infinity and back again plus one.Are they going to make a disaster movie about this? Did they already? I imagine a mix of The Day After Tomorrow, 2012, and San Andreas. It could be even better if a race of subterranean methane-tolerant humanoids with cannibalistic tendencies (ahem, The Descent) were spewed forth from each sinkhole opening. If they throw in the comedic tone of This is the End, I???d probably go see it.I would have to smuggle in my own bag of peanut butter M&M???s, because I???ve found that they typically do not sell them at the theater.Going back to the whole unseasonably-warm-temperature-in-a-cold-climate, the temperature recorded at the Esperanza base in Antarctica was a record balmy 63.5??F (17.5??C) last March. As the report broke out, multiple newscasters followed up with, ???It is warmer today in Antarctica than it is in San Francisco!??? a tone that makes me feel like I should add a winking smiley face emoticon to the text. This annoys for two reasons. First, San Francisco does not really get all that warm in the first place, and second, unseasonably warm temperatures in Antarctica could be a Really Big Deal, worth more than a flippant and possibly misleading comparison. Antarctica is in fact known for complex temperature variation and it???s quite possible that the lowest temperature ever could be recorded this year. This isn???t giant-sinkhole-almost- capable-of-swallowing-a-football-field scary, but it is still something to be uneasy over.Problems have symptoms, and symptoms can be divided into red flags and insidious occurrences. Red flags are obvious signs of trouble, like a shortness of breath, bloody stools, or multiple giant sinkholes suddenly opening and releasing copious amounts of methane into the atmosphere. In contrast, insidious occurrences often at first go unnoticed but eventually get worse, and sometimes can trigger red flags. These include things like weight loss, fatigue, and unseasonably warm temperatures.  The trick is to pinpoint insidious occurrences without looking like an alarmist, or a hypochondriac.While we are on the topic of insidious things, there are quite a few unfortunate maladies that lack major red flags, and are near-impossible to detect until you are deeply afflicted. The headline-grabbing version of this is Alzheimer???s disease. If all the media narrative is to be believed, one day we realize we left our keys in the fridge, and the next, we don???t recognize our own loved ones. Despite all the press, we don???t know how to cure it, prevent it, and like other insidious maladies, it???s really tricky to diagnose before it???s already here. As for how it develops, one of the more prominent theories is that our grey matter is degraded through the gradual buildup of sticky beta-amyloid proteins. Amyloid proteins are insoluble proteins that tend to fold improperly and clump together; all the different ways they can screw up are implicated in a wide array of horrible diseases (e.g. everything from type II diabetes to Parkinson???s disease to atherosclerosis). The particular improperly-folded form known as the beta amyloid protein just so happens to be toxic to neurons. Damage to our neurons triggers inflammation, which results in a buildup of a different protein with a tendency to get all tangled up, named tau. It could be that tau buildup results in a larger load of beta amyloid proteins, which damage neurons, which launches an inflammatory response, which leads to deposition of tangled tau proteins, and so on, and so forth, to infinity and back again plus one.To prevent something horrible from happening, we first have to find out how it happens.  Now that we have a pretty good theory, we have something to work with. Can we prevent or restrict unseasonably-warm temperatures from occurring? Can we prevent or slow the buildup of sticky plaques in our brain? A great deal of horrible diseases have an underlying genetic factor, such as Huntington???s disease. If we carry the mutated gene characteristic of this disease, there is a 99.9% chance that if we live long enough, we will develop Huntington???s disease (I???d say 100% chance, but logically, I can???t claim there is a 100% chance of something happening unless I look at an infinite amount of cases first).  However, Alzheimer???s is different. Genetic factors only account for a possible 15-35% of cases, so we look to environmental and/or lifestyle causes.Much of these findings on amyloid and tau proteins are coinciding with recent discoveries on the importance of sleep, and there might be a fair bit of overlap. Recent research on sleep and wakefulness has shown that our cerebrospinal fluid (which is exactly what it sounds like) flows more rapidly while we are asleep. This rapid movement is correlated with a decrease in amyloid proteins. As the theory stands, it is this rapid cycling of cerebrospinal fluid that helps remove amyloid proteins, lest they build up and fold in improper and destructive ways.2 In other words, it???s like we have our own wash-spin cycle going on in our brains on a nightly basis. Even if the amyloid protein-Alzheimer???s link proves to be incorrect, or at the very least is more complicated, amyloid protein buildup is linked to a decrease in mental clarity, which is oh-so-important in nearly every facet of our lives and might explain why we feel so shitty after we don???t get enough sleep for a few nights in a row.These conclusions suggest that sleep might be one of the most important things that we do, and good sleep should be up there along with a balanced diet and moderate exercise. Bragging about how little sleep we got last night is akin to bragging about how wasted we got last night.3 Related studies show how circadian rhythms affect our quality of sleep. Circadian rhythms are chronological (24-hour cycle) attributes that affect our physical, mental, and emotional selves. They roughly follow a dark-light cycle, but still can vary from person to person. It???s the variation in circadian rhythms that explain the Early Bird/Night Owl characteristics, and how annoying (and possibly unhealthy) it is for a Night Owl to adhere to an Early Bird lifestyle. If you???re like me, now you can go ahead and tell this to everyone who called you lazy because you weren???t really keen on getting up at 6 in the morning for high school, and still aren???t really keen on being at work by 8 in the morning, and why you look so vacant at a 9 am meeting.We are going to reall",100
417,"y need better mental clarity if we are going to solve major issues at hand, such as identifying red flags like mega sinkholes and their insidious precursors, like unseasonably warm temperatures. The world is caving in on itself, but we won???t be able to do anything about it if we are continuously neglecting our own intracranial wash-spin cycle.Good luck.- -1  Moskvitch, K.

I acknowledge this and am out of my element here.  I will not touch the topic with a twenty-foot pole. Children of the CornScions of the SpeltOffspring of the OatsTykes of the TeffQuiddies of the QuinoaThose Barley BastardsFright???ning, Filial, and Fulla FarroI am going to write a poem titled ???The Mercy of Geography,??? and it???s going to be about how unmerciful geography is.  This poem will explore the tragic and arbitrary nature of birthplace, and the great truth that being born in a particular location decides the trajectory of one???s life.  The poem will also illustrate my angst at recently meeting a handsome and successful guy on Twitter who lives ten hours away by car, and my bitter discovery that while he is single and likes my ???whole deal??? and would love to ???Netflix and chill??? with me, due to the horseshit geography of where I grew up, and due to the surety that my life would come to nothing beyond the sickly cornfields and abandoned houses that are major features of my fuckbucket birthplace, I married a local boy at age 22 and am now unavailable.The poem, ???The Mercy of Geography,??? will also be careful to address the confusion I feel toward my own dissatisfaction at my situation, as my husband is not a violent man, or a repulsive man whose sight or smell I cannot take, or even the kind of man who jokingly orders me to get my heinie into the kitchen and fix him a sammich.  The poem will attempt to explicate why, if married to a man who does not exhibit outright disrespect or other indictable shortcomings, a woman would become distraught upon realizing the bullshit unfairness of geography.Therefore, ???The Mercy of Geography??? will detail how a man that a woman marries in the vicinity of her own rural birthplace ??? like my husband, for example ??? is also controlled by this location.  To do this, the poem will use artful phrases to evoke how such a man living here is prone to wearing a baseball cap at all times; how this man will sneer at paying for hair-cuts because he can just buzz it off at home; and how this man will drink on weekends and pile out of a bar at 2 AM with his buddies, participating in the bro-dude routine of screaming incoherently into the void that is the local town square.  ???The Mercy of Geography??? will word-paint how a man raised in my home town will no doubt imitate his father, and so will refuse to take beach vacations because he finds the ocean unimpressive. Also, this man cannot swim.  I hope to suitably describe how this man is likely to be tall and strong and built for physical greatness but will end up, on most evenings, scrolling through the Internet and paying for Playboy subscriptions like a decent human being.  This man, despite a millennial gleam that may have attempted to assert itself early on in the relationship in the form of rejecting traditional values, will turn out to be actually quite traditional.  It must also be acknowledged in this poem that such a man will love his spouse in a traditional manner, meaning his love is sturdy, lasting, and reliable ??? so long as said love doesn???t have to uproot itself from the fuck-ass town it was born in.My hope is that these poetic intimations will explain how such a man???s wife (like myself) may, after several years, acquire a somewhat nihilistic perspective when realizing that she has hitched her wagon to a rather low-hanging and lukewarm star.  Of course, the poem will also feature how this conclusion could not have been reached without simultaneously realizing that there is no escape from this bullshit geography, for she is continually sucked back into the local mud by economic and societal factors.  (Side note: The poem shall also mention, in a sideways and ironic tone, that this local mud is erroneously believed to have miraculous healing powers, mostly by financially viable tourists who are able to get the hell out of town on the next train.)In writing ???The Mercy of Geography??? I???m also hoping to explore my own exasperation at the whole clusterfuck Twitter-guy scenario by proving, in labyrinthine language, that any carrying-on with an outsider would result in disaster, as the stranger in question:Lives in a big city, which is directly opposed to the poem???s speaker own rural ???love of the land??? and ???wild heart??? that truly appreciates the ???open spaces??? of her spirit-fucking Tri-County areaWas, like the speaker of the poem, born in a small town, but was courageous enough to drive away and live in a different place, indicating a level of unfathomable incompatibilityRegularly visits a barber to get his hair cut in a specific and contemporary style, which hints at a true rejection of traditional small-town values and also (possibly) a rejection of traditional, sturdy love ??? the discovery of which will parallel my real-life suspicion that this Twitter guy maybe isn???t such hot stuff, after all, and maybe I should just tell him to back the fuck off.In any event, my poem, ???The Mercy of Geography,??? will hopefully display all of the above themes and conflicts, plus the utter Leatherface reality of my place in the world.  The result of my efforts will be an intricate, thoughtful and melancholy masterpiece.  The poem will unveil my erstwhile hopes and dreams that have been repeatedly dashed against the limestone rocks native to my bullshit local geographical region, as well as my future dreams of escape that continue to fling themselves against the sides of barns (also common to my ass-bag local region) again and again in the pattern of unimpressive ocean waves.I???m really looking forward to writing this poem and capturing the raw, rural beauty of my economically depressed shitstain of a hometown.  And perhaps, if I dare to hope, a reader of ???The Mercy of Geography??? will mistakenly romanticize my misery and come to live here, only to discover firsthand the regret of moving to such a bullshit geographical location.  And maybe, maybe ??? if I???m greedy with hope ??? this person will find me, and I will invite them into my home, and we will read poems from faraway places, bitch about disillusionment, and go grocery shopping at Food Lion.  And when they suggest that the local mud really does have healing properties, I will not roll my eyes; instead, I will suggest we smear the mud onto our faces, and there we will be, sitting at my kitchen table, crusted with foul-smelling earth, making peace with our unmerciful geography once and for all, together.So, I wrote a book about some bullshit???literally.Bullshit: A Lexicon ??? featuring cartoons by New Yorker cartoonist Drew Dernavich ??? is full of lexical history and silly jokes about common words like bunk, malarkey, and mumbo jumbo, plus rarities like stump water and flubdub. All the terms and idioms mean something in the neighborhood of bullshit, and most of them are pretty funny.But which is the funniest word for bullshit? At the risk of stretching this column???s premise to its breaking point, I have some thought",100
418,"s on this important matter.Bullshit itself is a fairly funny word, but its more notable for usefulness than humor. It would surely be a leading contender for Most Satisfying Word in the Multiverse. Some BS words have a funny sound, especially the reduplicative words like mumbo jumbo, fiddle-faddle, and ackamarackus. I find tommyrot amusing. Futurama coined a bunch of BS-related exclamations that are all pretty funny, like crapspackle, blithery-poop, twaddle-cock, and baldercrap. Truthiness might be the only BS word that???s actually satirical. Stephen Colbert???s contribution to the BS lexicon is one of the great words of my lifetime: a word that???s both a joke and a potent, specific weapon against bullshit.But for funniest BS word, I have to go with a word from another language category that is near and dear to my lexicon-loving, immature heart: euphemisms. I love euphemisms, partly due to my love of George Carlin (who I will eventually get to in this column, once I overcome my fear of discussing my hero). Carlin was surgical in his smackdown of evasive language, pointing out how a term like post-traumatic stress disaster lacked the effectiveness of shellshock and might even contribute to misunderstanding of the condition. Still, if you read between the lines, Carlin has a barely contained glee for euphemisms too: in a way, he appreciated the creativity behind our reality cloaking piles of poppycock. And I bet he would love the term I think is the Funniest BS Term.Gentleman cow.This is basically a euphemism squared. Many folks say ???Bull!??? when they don???t want to say ???Bullshit!??? But if even b-u-double-hockey-sticks seems too harsh for your house, there???s gentleman cow, which is far from the only bull-avoiding term out there. A bunch are recorded in the wonderful Dictionary of American Regional English, such as:cow beastcow brutecow crittercow toppercow???s husbanddukeend manFerdinandgrandpahead of the herdold manstock cowThose words euphemize actual bulls, not bullshit, sadly. But gentleman cow gets a metaphorical use in the BS lexicon now and then. Brenda Bowers used it alongside George Costanza???s favorite word in a 2009 blog post about Obamacare: ???I must call that Gentleman Cow Manure?????? Here it is in the most elevated realms, the Internet comment, in a shouty response to a 2007 blog post: ???LUCAS MAKES PLANS WITH US AND THEN BREAKS THEM AT THE LAST MINUTE FOR NO DISCERNIBLE REASON. THAT???S GENTLEMAN-COW SHIT, THAT IS.??? That example makes the euphemism even more ludicrous by following it up with shit.  You might as well say, ???I never use the fuckin??? f-word!???Terms like gentleman cow, gentleman-cow shit, meadow muffins, and cow???s husband are why I love language as much as comedy. There???s just no end to the creativity and variety of words. Like all living things, English is weird, annoying, amusing, unpredictable, bonkers, and kind of a miracle. You couldn???t make up a term like gentleman-cow shit, but somebody did.The content of postgame interviews and sports chatter is so often meaningless, if not insufferable. And yet there are athletes like Metta World Peace who transcend lame clich??s and rote patter, who use language in surprising ways, who can be funny and shocking and insightful and alarmingly sincere ??? pure poetry. Muhammad Ali offered dazzling displays of lexical wizardry, and Allen Iverson???s infamous ???practice??? rant shifted the postgame press conference from the banal to the absurd. Erratic Fire, Erratic Passion, by Jeff Parker and longtime Tendency contributor Pasha Malla is a celebration of these rare and exceptional moments. Various poetic forms and line-breaks highlight ??? or, in the words of Deion Sanders, ???deem to set a candor on??? ??? the sophisticated, sublime, and surprising performances of language made by professional athletes.

KIRKLAND HOUSE ROOM H46 THIRTY MINUTES LATERME: [Pacing back and forth, pumping my fist in the air] Man alive, I just can???t believe it! This is the life ??? my own room, my own bed, nobody sleeping next to me, nobody waking me up at all hours, and nobody snoring. I finally stood up for myself and got what I wanted: A single freakin??? room at Kirkland House! I really made it. Here I am, a student at the finest university in the world, with an amazing view of the quad, my own mini fridge, and no annoying computers in sight. Wow wow wow wow wow wow! [Dialing, ringing] Dad? Hey, Dad! Listen to this: You???re not going to believe it ??? I actually managed to get my own room at the same price as a share. Yeah! It was offered and I took it. I finally listened to what you???ve been telling me about standing up for myself and jumping on an opportunity when it arises. Well, I jumped. I truly think this is going to be a great year. Who knows what I???ll come up with! I???m feeling super creative at the moment. Yeah! OK, I???ll talk to you soon. Sounds good. Say hi to Mom for me. [Jumping on the bed] Woo hoo!- -III.

Do you guys need help with anything? I actually have a little free time this semester. Can I be vice president, or something?DUSTIN MOSKOVITZ: Nah, we already divvied up the roles. Thanks, though. How???s that single room working out for you?ME: Honestly? It???s the best. I love having my own mini fridge. And I???m feeling so productive right now. I started my own ???zine last night.

Mark???s really onto something here and we don???t want to distract him.ME: Oh, yeah, OK. No problem. I was just stopping by to see if anybody wanted to head to the dining hall with me and pick up some grub? It???s Taco Tuesday!DUSTIN MOSKOVITZ: I already ate.CHRIS HUGHES: Same here. I???m stuffed. Thanks, though.ME: Fair enough, guys. Don???t work too hard. I guess I???ll be seeing you around ???MARK ZUCKERBERG: Hmm?Portrait by Kelly Bjork- -Greg???s on his way to my apartment. We???re going to talk about the time he got shot and nearly bled to death in an alleyway. I???m so nervous about doing this interview, I feel pukey. The role demands many tricky balances. For instance, I don???t want to be too somber, because I???ll seem pretentious. Yet I don???t want to seem too casual, because I???ll look like an asshole. I want to get lots of facts, but I don???t want to come off as clinical. I want to connect with him, yet I don???t want to act like I can fully understand what he went through. I want him to be comfortable, but I don???t want to try so hard to make him comfortable that I???m straining. There???s plenty of other stuff, and I know I???m overthinking it, but I can???t stop. I try being still for a while, taking deep breaths, and thinking mystical thoughts. It???s not working, so I spring up and zip-zap around, all jagged and electrical. I head to the bathroom and pee. I don???t really need to, but it gives me an immediate, goal-driven activity I can easily accomplish, so this helps.Greg arrives. We hug in my doorway, and I chill right out like I always do whenever whatever The Giant Impossible Thing finally starts happening. Greg???s wearing a plain black-t-shirt and a plain black hoodie and plain dark jeans. His hair is slicked into a semi-pompadour, giving him a retro look. He???s 6???3??? and 250 pounds, an even blend of height and brawn and puppy fat. Greg???s build reminds me of the guys I grew up with in the Midwest ??? the farm boys who???d get up at 5:00 to do chores before school, then show up to football practice wearing steel-toe boots because it was the only pair of shoes they owned.Greg has never been a cowhand, as it turns out. It???s not a common gig for people in the Seattle area. I forget that sometimes. I bring him a glass of water, and we shoot the shit a little. I really like him. He???s been over here before. My apartment is small, but it???s quiet and clean. We sit at the kitchen table, which is green. So is the couch, the cupboard, the lamp, the shelf, the chair. Everything is a shade of green.I???m set up already, so we start in. I ask him about his job at the Twilight Exit. When he began, Greg was in his late 20s. ???I???d just gotten out of construction. I was tired of it,??? he said. The official title was ???Door Guy/ID-Checker,??? but he was expected to bus tables as well. The position didn???t require a ton of combat training. ???It???s not like Vegas, where you???re hired muscle. If somebody got out of control I was supposed to do everything I could to get them out peacefully, and if they refused, it???d be in police???s hands from there,??? he said.On the night of the shooting, Greg had been working there almost a year. The other bouncer Joe was scheduled, but he had a date, so he asked Greg to fill in. Greg didn???t mind picking up the shift. I???d come to the bar early to meet a girlfriend, and I wanted to get us good seats. Greg probably checked my license, though I don???t remember it. Back then, he was still a stranger to me.Greg remembers Whitney???s arrival. So do I. When she came inside, ???she barged in and ran straight into the bathroom. That???s generally irritating if you???re the door guy because you don???t want random people dashing in. There was also something about the way she was carrying herself that was off-putting. It was weird. She seemed really pissed off,??? he says.Whitney sat near me at the horseshoe bar, and I had a clear diagonal view of her. She got a pint of beer and talked quietly on a cellphone. James arrived shortly after to confront her. He got right in her face and was saying, ???You left the door un",100
421,"locked. They took all my stuff. They broke my TV.??? Whitney never got off the phone. She didn???t acknowledge him. She wouldn???t look at him.???James blew into the place like a storm,??? said Greg. ???He was screaming and acting all tough. But he didn???t put up a fight when I stepped between him and his girlfriend. Our chests were touching or whatever, but he never got violent with me. I didn???t have to pull him off her. I didn???t see him touch her. I led him pretty easily to the door. I went after him outside because I wanted to talk, but he took off right away.??????I was trying to figure out what was going on,??? said Greg. He approached Whitney for answers, but ???all she said was, ???I don???t know him. He???s just a crazy person.??? I???d seen her with him before, so I knew she was lying. I asked her to call a taxi. I wanted to kick her out, but at the time it made more sense to get him out now, and she could leave after, so she wasn???t in danger.??????Do you think you should???ve handled things differently???? I ask.???Not really,??? said Greg. ???Any security guy who???s worth half a damn is going consider these factors when dealing with a domestic violence case. You don???t want to throw a woman to the wolves. Though now it???s definitely our policy that when people are fighting, it doesn???t matter who they are or what happened. You need to get everybody out, regardless of gender.???The conflict was bizarre, but it was over fast and not particularly alarming. Fifteen, maybe twenty minutes went by. Karaoke was beginning, and customers were arriving steadily. Greg checked IDs and picked his song for later, Queen???s ???Crazy Little Thing Called Love.???Greg went outside to have a cigarette and stood before the main entrance, which is in the alleyway. ???I saw James come around the corner,??? said Greg. ???I thought he was just coming back to be an asshole and puff up. I started saying ???You know you can???t come in tonight,??? but before I could finish, he pulled a gun out of his waistband, cocked the hammer, pointed it at my face, and told me to get the fuck out of his way.???- -Alley beside the Twilight Exit.1.

422,"tic nominee for president in 2016 and don???t get me wrong, I am really excited that we might get our first female president, but there are just a few tiny things that I am worried about.Of course there???s the obvious stuff, like the fact that she???s married to one of history???s most beloved philanderers and that whole Whitewater rafting deal. But there???s also, like, Hillary???s health and stuff. I mean, she had a blood clot in her brain! I don???t claim to be a medical expert, but I???m pretty sure that is a pretty bad place to have a clot! And also, like, I???m not sure, but don???t you think there???s just the tiniest possibility that that clot was just like some extra menstrual blood that got up there? I???m not saying it definitely was, but was it? I mean, I know that you are probably assuming she???s in menopause, but do we really want to make those kinds of assumptions about the gal who is going to wind up with her finger on the nuclear button?And sure, maybe she entered menopause, but what if instead of staying in menopause, her period came back? And what if it wasn???t just a regular period, what if it were some kind of super period that makes her into a werewolf that can???t stop eating and crying and having sex with junior senators? I am not saying I am worried about having a female president, I???m just saying I???m worried about President Werewolf who can???t stop slutting it up all over Capitol Hill, you know? I mean, do you really want a crying werewolf in a pantsuit drinking a glass of chardonnay and screeching, ???Give me those nuclear codes and a bunch of chocolate, and send in Gary Schlesinger, the junior senator from Wisconsin so I can ride him like a roller coaster!??? Is that what America wants?And honestly, let???s talk about those pantsuits for a second. I mean, I???m not saying they aren???t nice. They are definitely nice, but I think you have to ask yourself, what is a lady who wears pantsuits all the time hiding? Like, what is it about her lower legs that she doesn???t want us to see? I???m not saying she???s a waist-down robot, but I???m just saying probably. She is probably a waist-down robot. Can we really send a waist-down robot to China to talk about trade tariffs? Is the guy in charge of China gonna like that? C???mon guys, think!Also, she keeps bringing up that she???s a grandmother. And one time, when she said it, I thought I saw, like, some weird red in her eyes? Like lasers?  Like, I know she is actually a grandmother to a baby, but is she also, maybe, a super-villain called The Grandmother? I???m not saying she is but I???m also saying let???s not be blind to the possibility. And maybe this super-villain can crochet you to death or bake you in a brisket? Is that really going to be effective against Putin???s nuclear arsenal? ???Oh, hey Hillary, I am going to blow up your cities,??? Putin might say,??? and then Hillary will try to sing him to sleep because that is one of her superpowers? Does that sound very effective? I don???t think so!And then, like, I really didn???t want to talk about this, but I think I do for one second have to go back to the whole Monica Lewinsky thing. I mean, I know a lot of people think that Bill Clinton was hooking up with a White House intern because, while he was a good president, when it comes to the ladies he is the super-douche of the century, but what if that???s not true? What if, really, Bill Clinton was just scared to sleep with his wife because of something about her vagina? Namely: What if she has a gun up there? I am not saying that Hillary Clinton has an actual gun in her actual vagina but I am also not a doctor so who knows? I mean, can you really blame Bill Clinton for finding a woman without a gun in her vagina to sleep with when his only alternative was Hillary Clinton, a woman who probably has a gun in her vagina? What if Hillary was sitting around a table with a bunch of dignitaries and the gun went off, and what if her crotch was pointed right at Angela Merkel? And then what if Angela Merkel???s vagina-gun also went off. Can you picture it? Two leaders of the free world just shooting bullets at each other from their vaginas under the table while the guys are all going, like, what the heck? Well, I can. And it gives me a chill.I am not saying that I have anything against Hillary, I am just saying that when you get in that voting booth, make sure you ask yourself: Do a I want a lady waist-down robot who gets a super-period that turns her into a werewolf who loves chocolate, moonlights as a villain called The Grandmother and just struts around town shooting bullets out of her jinkity-jankity in charge of the free world or do I not?1.

In his book, Moss writes about ???bliss point,??? which, in my recall, is a carefully engineered point at which human satiation ??? actually, satisfaction ??? maxes out. Any more sweet or salt or fat, and the palate will recoil; any less and that naughty urge won???t be sated. It???s ironic that Strafford Organic Creamery ??? a one-farm, one-family enterprise based out of Rock Bottom Farm in Vermont ??? should be the bearer of this message, but truth is truth: their Sweet Guernsey Cream Ice Cream has proven my ???bliss point??? to be ",100
423,"effed.Here???s what I mean: Strafford Organic Creamery???s Sweet Guernsey Cream Ice Cream is a little like eating a ladleful of Alfredo sauce. The mouthfeel is all velout??; the level of sweetness, an understated set of training wheels. It is does not provide the distraction-laden intensity of a Ben & Jerry???s cacophony, where texture might distract one from butterfat. No, Strafford???s ice cream is elegant and concentrated, and when I swallow a demitasse spoon of the custard-yellow stuff, I think, my vocabulary rendered in fat, Whoa, rich. A person with an intact bliss point would be thwarted.Not me.I keep going.I eat through one heaping quarter-cup of the ice cream packed into an espresso cup, and it???s only my restraint, which wears black leather pants and a smug frown, that keeps me from scooping a second or licking out the first.In middle school, I had a friend who boasted of her ability to eat butter by the cube. My father-in-law recalls childhood butter-and-sugar sandwiches. I suspect, though, that neither Prianka nor Pat could stomach more than a taste of Strafford Organic Creamery???s Sweet Guernsey Cream. This is ice cream for old timers or farmhands, men like my late grandfather who remembered slopping the froth off the top of a milk bottle and into his mouth, men whose sense of portion and satisfaction was made meager by the Great Depression, men who call servings of ice cream ???dips.??? Conversely, somehow, this is also ice cream for snobs, locavores who won???t stand for their boutique creamery selling out ??? I mean, paying ??? for a flashy website (as of this evening, Strafford Organic Creamery???s web presence is a chatty Facebook page and an undecorated Word Press site), patrons of speakeasies too cool to be demystified in any BuzzFeed list. There is no hidden elevator behind the barbershop that will lead you to this ice cream; there is only abandoning all manners and inhibitions, and rolling up your sleeves and heading down to the barn.- - -Pineapple Cake SweetsSubmitted by Naomi IsaacsHere is an item that defies straightforward classification. Provenance unknown. It has almost certainly been concocted in a petri dish by someone who has been briefed with the key attributes of a pineapple cake but never seen or tried one. As such, they have managed to create something sickly sweet that is simultaneously a cake and a jelly. Familiar yet distant, I find myself in uncanny valley. I ingest the whole thing before going for a long lie-down.- - -Mulberry Jam with a TwistSubmitted by Mara AltmanYou want to make fresh mulberry jam. You look up recipes online. Pectin, what is that? No thanks. Sounds like a naughty sex position for hummingbirds. You decide to go for a simple and straightforward concoction: mulberries, lemon and sugar.You pick mulberries every other day for a week to ensure that you will have a large enough batch of jam to share with your whole family. You can???t wait to share the bounty of your garden with your family.While you pick, you pop big juicy berries into your mouth. One for jam, one for you. You chuckle to yourself: Canning taxes.If only everyone understood how hilarious you are.Once you have collected enough, you quickly rinse the berries and then dump them into a large saucepan. Over medium heat, you begin to crush them by tamping down with a fork. You are very excited by tamping and do it quite enthusiastically. You ruin your shirt???it looks like blood spatter???but you don???t care because this is a worthy cause. You are basically an Earth pilgrim whose duty is to take Mother Nature to the next level via a mason jar.As the berries heat, more and more juices are released and as they do, you begin to notice tiny white particles. You are concerned, but shrug it off. You suspect the juice is beginning to boil. Bubbles are often white. They are probably tiny white bubbles.  Occam???s razor: No more assumptions should be made than are necessary.You continue to stir.After some time, you look more closely. The tiny white bubbles have not yet disappeared. You notice that in addition to not disappearing, they are in fact moving. Some might even call the motion ???slithering.??????Babe, come here!??? you shout to your husband. ???I think the jam is alive.???He refuses to come and look. Instead, he brings up some moments from the past that he???s still sore about like that one time you made him smell your fingers after taking out the garbage and that other time you told him to try a bite of burrito and then when he did, you said, ???Disgusting, right????He thinks you are deliberately trying to quash his peace and joy. It???s not true; you just happened to interpret the ???in sickness??? part of ???in sickness and in health??? in a slightly different way.In other words, you are on your own.You want to???you need to???save your jam! It???s a gift for your family!You look up worms and mulberries on the Internet. No one on the Internet seems to be surprised that hundreds of invertebrates are streaming out of your preserves. In fact, the Internet tells you, Earth Pilgrim, that you are a fool. Everyone knows that before eating the berries, you???re supposed to soak them in warm water. That???s how you get the worms out. Duh!You might be a lot of things, but you???re no quitter. You???re too far into the process to give up. Once the nausea subsides???it began when you thought back to all those canning taxes you collected???you take the edge of a spoon and carefully lift one tiny creature out at a time.You are now forty-five minutes in and there are still hundreds of worms inside the saucepan. You suspect you had an epiphany, but are afraid you are actually losing your mind? See, you suddenly realize that you do not believe in superfluous killing. You do not want these worms??? lives to be lost in vain.You point to the genocide inside of the pan. ???You know, in some cultures they would consider this a delicacy,??? you tell your husband.You, Earth Pilgrim, feel reborn. You are at peace. You turn up the flame, bringing the dark red mixture back up to a boil. You add four cups of sugar and the juice of one lemon. After simmering for an hour, you pour the mixture into four sterile mason jars. They are beautiful artisanal masterpieces. You snap a photo and post it to Instagram.It is at this point that your husband reminds you that both of your brothers will not be able to eat this jam: One is a vegetarian and the other one is kosher. Your father, you soon learn, is fine with the worms, but hates mulberries.You are now the lucky owner of four pints of worm jam.You toast and butter an English muffin and then swab a little worm jam on top. You convince yourself that a gourmand in China would probably pay $100 a gram for this stuff.You take a bite. It tastes like a jolly rancher???wincingly sweet and sour all at the same time. You decide that it???s not half bad, but you clearly need a second opinion. You find your husband, reach the muffin toward his mouth and say, ???If you love me, you???ll try a bite.???- - -Vital Force Matcha Parfait Submitted by Heather StruckThe day is hot, my apartment is thick with stale air and my head pounds from the allergens of the summer months. What I want is peanut butter and jam on toast just before the inevitable hazy collapse. But why? An intrepid business on my corner has generously concerned itself with the metabolic health of my neighbors and myself. I am indebted to this business for its healthful riffs on pineapple-ginger smoothies, for its macrobiotic salads and for its electrolyte-packed coconut water.I have in my refrigerator a new product from the glass-walled oracle that speaks in whispers of healthy bac",100
424,"teria and natural allergy remedies. This, a Vital Force Matcha Parfait, will be my savior.Mocking the traditional fruit and yogurt parfait, the Matcha was what hooked me when I bought it. It is used in tea ceremonies in Japan, we are told, and it contains a genius mixture of caffeine and enzyme compounds to help boost the brain and feed the gut. In the container, it is green and gloopy. Not resembling yogurt or even a pudding, like the chia bowl???which, at a divine 350 calories, has made my day before.A layer of seed and amaranth granola sits atop the elixir in a plastic dome. I have not often willingly encountered these domes in food products. I am intimidated. The Solo??? technology that engendered the dome was undoubtedly tested and retested in the laboratory for consumer usability. My blind trust in the superiority of corporate food products in terms of efficiency and ease of waste production is well founded. It is perhaps not childproof, but I am no child. After a minute of deliberate study, I successfully remove the top of the vessel from its lower half. After another two minutes, I devise a way to release the granola from its domed container by spraying half the contents onto myself and onto the environment around my kitchen table. I believe the Vital Force to be near at this point.The texture is liquid, with moderate viscosity and an odor???both sickly and grassy???that puts one in mind of one???s death and subsequent reunion with the earth. A rumination that is perhaps organic, but not quite the Vital Force that I am looking for.  The green tint, turns a dull brown after it is exposed to the air. Like pesto or a guacamole. The remaining granola, when dumped atop the liquid, improves the taste but not the odor. I am, at this point, wholly disheartened and lacking the vitality that comes after performing a yoga practice or consuming a Vital Force parfait.I make peanut butter and jam on toast and eat it while staring at the empty container. I scorn it now. But I will forgive the healthy shop on my corner, because I trust no other oracle than it.- - -Ben & Jerry???s The Tonight Dough Starring Jimmy FallonSubmitted by JoAnna NovakYou might wonder how a pint of ice cream can transubstantiate a comedian whose face is more capable than any other television-face of lighting up into a barometer of face-shaped joy; a comedian who has called his childhood ???idyllic??? and thus countered the prevailing narrative of comedian-as-sourpuss-with-compromised-beginnings; a comedian who grew up pedaling his two-wheeler around a Saugerties backyard and with his sister studying the skits of Saturday Night Live, who grew up both wanting to be a priest and mimicking so-very-mortal men like James Cagney and Dana Carvey; a comedian whose devotion to sketch comedy led him to drop out of college when cap and gown were in senior-ish striking distance; a comedian who, during his tenure on SNL, made giggling his way out of character a signature. Thank you, Wikipedia. Thank you, Jimmy Fallon, national treasure, rakish raffish bathetic boy toy. Thank you, Ben & Jerry???s: How can a single ice cream approximate, let alone star, a human man?Leave it to the wacky uncles of frozen desserts to achieve the impossible. The Tonight Dough Starring Jimmy Fallon doesn???t taste like Jimmy Fallon (unless he???s actually a Keebler elf) so much as his spirit???an amalgamation of childhood flavors and textures, at once wholesome and a touch naughty: grainy, sugary, sticky, chewy, crunchy. Muddy.Like most recent Ben & Jerry???s offerings, The Tonight Dough Starring Jimmy Fallon benefits from a roadmap. Let me be your docent.Caramel Ice Cream: Though this base flavor is the first one listed on the carton, any distinct caramellyness all but disappears in the chocolate.Chocolate Ice Cream: When I removed the lid from my pint, the predominant color was brown. A caramel top-heavy pint may offer an entirely different experience, one attainable for a mere $5.67 (a percentage of which is dedicated to ???SeriousFun Children???s Network of globlal camps for children with serious illnesses). Like all cocoa-based chocolate ice creams, this could have used a little salt.Chocolate Cookies Swirls: This crunchy ribbon is the stand-out taste in The Tonight Dough Starring Jimmy Fallon, leading me to wonder if Fallon, like this writer/eater, is a longtime fan of dirt. You know the treat: those Jell-O chocolate pudding and Oreo and gummi worm creations my mom (and maybe your mom or the junk-food positive mom in your ???hood) made called Dirt Cups.Gobs of Chocolate Chip Cookies Dough: I???m pretty sure my pint lacked these, which was a surprise given the name of this flavor.Gobs of Peanut Butter Cookie Dough: The gobs were walnut-sized and the peanut butter flavor was pronounced. Given the fate of the caramel ice cream, the quantity and sassitude of the Gobs of Peanut Butter Cookie Dough is a testimony to the near-perfect and typically assertive presence of peanut butter.The Tonight Dough Starring Jimmy Fallon seals in a pint one of those temerarious childhood days when your babysitter let you raid the fridge and the pantry and the cookie jar. I think it will be a hit, as likable and inoffensive and occasionally just-too-dang-adorable as Fallon himself. After all, grinning like a Muppet, his is the face on the front of the pint, besuited and, like a priest with his chalice, beholding his sweet offering: a teeming waffle cone.- - -Wheatgrass ShotsSubmitted by Campbell BirchUS$1.99. How big was one ounce? Whatever its bigness we could safely assume two ounces would be double it. One seemed the safer option.My father has always been a cautious man. His proposal to imbibe shots of grass which had been juiceified, or whatever appellation it is which best describes the increasingly pervasive process whereby solid foodstuffs are rendered liquid, might be seen as a radical gesture for a man such as himself, a man who has subsisted on nightly dinners of meat and three veggies, who has worked the same insurance job at the same insurance company for fifty years, and for whom, no doubt bucking working theories of physics and biology, not stasis but change has long been viewed as an augury of death. But really upon closer view it fits perfectly with his modus operandi of cautiousness, as at sixty-six years of age his health and its maintenance have become newly of interest to him. Already on our journey down the West Coast I have listened to him tell me about the wonders of his NZ$500 juicer on multiple occasions.Shivers, you should see what it does to the fruit, Campbell, he says, eyes growing large as levels of animation and demonstratively reach unusual levels. Turns it right into juice before your blimmin??? eyes.I picture him in the kitchen of the home I lived in for my first twenty-six years. There he is, experimenting over the roaring juicer. In go the diced banana, the sliced up apple, the carrots which he once fed the family rabbit with tough-to-witness tenderness. Just the day before I asked him to imagine with me what it must have been like when the first human made fire. And here he is, with the help of more advanced tools, making juice on the countertop. Who would dare say that these things will not be one day viewed as of the same order.Despite our cluelessness as to the operations of the imperial system those from our nation-state still use it commonly, in place of the metric, in at least two instances ??? for recording the weight of a child at birth and the height of an adult.I am 6??? 1???.

But my father and I are on our American Road Trip. The scene is ripe for Father-Son Bonding. For knocking back something stiff and exotic.I have recently watched alcohol pass his lips for the first time in my life. It was in a bar in Petrolia, CA. The beer was Budweiser and the basketball was on. I could tell he felt too nervous to order a coke, and as always it was hard to watch the vulnerability of someone older than myself and I am happy in the knowledge that with my own aging these occasions should technically diminish.Here in Joshua Tree we are at an Organic Caf??. It is 105 or so out, which is meaningless to us until we ask Siri what that converts to. After checking, Siri tells us to within one decimal place.My father always uses the gendered pronoun to refer to Siri. Ask her what the population of Monterey is, Campbell. I refer to Siri with the inanimate and gender-neutral ???it.??? My father???s usage ages him in my eyes but I can???t put my finger on why. Perhaps it is his conflation of the real with the artificial.A deep green with a tiny sliver of froth at the top, the product arrives at room temperature in small shot glasses crowned with a chaser of apple. The smell is strong and putrid, and I know I will detest it even before I taste it. I suspect that you, too, will have eaten grass as a young child. Perhaps you were sitting on the school field, the sun was out and your teacher???s distant drone in the background addressing the class. You pull at the leaves of grass. Now breaking one off, you place the blade carefully between the paired joints of your aligned thumbs, hands cupped. Its scent touching your nose, you blow gently, the blade wavering between the slim gap formed by the bones, and if lucky a whistle issues forth, its substance and timbre commensurate with the width and quality of your selection. Your best friend leans over. He tells you you got a good one. The girls, including wondrous Holly, turn around and give you the evils, putting their index fingers to their lips. Then there is a countdown and you all crunch into your apples at the same time. In what should be viewed as one of the grandest works of art and music ever to be orchestrated, on par with 4??? 33???, kids all across New Zealand are doing it, chomping in synchronicity, because it is the 1995 America???s Cup and biting into this fruit will help the Team New Zealand boat sail faster on the other side of the Pacific as the reverberations of the crunch turn the winds off San Diego in our favor. If you hated apple, as I do, this was a particularly traumatic moment, the amalgamation of food, sport, and nationalism not just bizarre but actually unpalatable. Twenty years later I am again confronted with the unholy combination of grass and apple and my hold on separating past and present becomes tenuous.But before you took the bite, and after you blew your leaf of grass???the flag of my disposition, as the poet said???you might have had cause to taste the green-stuff. If you can imagine that taste intensified to the nth degree, concentrated, and assuming the consistency of fruit juice, you will have some idea of what drinking this abomination is like. The leaves of grass were always tough to consume, catching in the throat, and in fact the human stomach is not made to process them, but allegedly has no trouble with the liquid form of wheatgrass.The woman who brings us the shots answers my father???s question by saying it is good for detoxifying the skin, and his next one with a local supplies it.Walt held that grass was a symbol of immortality. I try not to wretch as I sip the awful stuff. I made the mistake of consuming my bagel and coffee beforehand and now I have only water to wash it down. And the bloody apple, the slice taking the shape of a grin. My father, who I doubt has taken a shot of anything in his life, mucks up the order and eats the chaser before swigging the shot. Needlessly I inform him of his mistake while wondering as to the level of offense I would give to all present if I threw up my breakfast in the Cafe. I can???t see a restroom. There are a couple of people who look like trendy young tourists come to the desert. A photographer. And what is surely a model, or French. To debase oneself in front of beautiful or cool people is always worse than in front of others, and I wonder why this is. I hold my stomach in its place and after five visits to the glass I am finished. The noxious taste of grass remains in my mouth for the remainder of the day and I try to recall facts I know about cows and appendixes. My father knocks his back without problem. He enjoys it in fact. But whether it is the taste that he enjoys or the vision of his own vitality the verdant elixir produces remains unclear to me.Completely flouting everything I know of him, later in the day he gets behind the wheel of the convertible as we drive through the desert valley and I take photographs of the rising temperature on the car???s display, documenting our endurance in the face of the heat and aridity. He is not listed as an additional driver on the insurance policy and on a straight he takes both hands from the wheel and puts them in the air above our heads.- - -Nabisco Reese???s Peanut Butter Cup Creme Oreo Chocolate Sandwich CookiesSubmitted by Jacob Fulk???Please scan your first item,??? the machine taunts.In my right hand I hold the flavorless, soulless, communion wafers of the damned; the Harris Teeter store-brand Oreos.In my left hand I hold the realest realest, the premium uncut pure stuff, the new kid on the block; Reese???s Peanut Butter Cup Creme Oreo Chocolate Sandwich Cookies.I swipe that store band shit.

On the way home I decided to swing by McDonald???s, eager as I was to try out my newest acquisition from the App Store, the McD App from Mowingo, Inc. Today???s amazing deal was ???FREE Med Fries w/ Any Sandwich purch.???A colorful little sandwich board in the dining room was advertising McDonald???s brand new flagship burger, the Sirloin Third Pound Burger, declaring that it came in ???Three Flavors.??? I should have taken this as a warning sign. Burgers should come in ???varieties,??? or even ???styles.??? Flavors are for jelly beans and Doritos.But I was here, I was hungry, and I was getting a free medium fry out of the deal. I chose the Bacon and Cheese Sirloin Third Pound Burger and asked for it ???to go,??? since few things are more depressing than the sight of a grown man sitting alone in an empty McDonald???s at 11 o???clock on a Sunday evening, a bummed-out parody of an Edward Hopper painting.???We are not on our game,??? new McDonald???s CEO Steve Easterbrook admitted earlier this year. Indeed, Consumer Reports recently ranked McDonald???s at the very bottom of the fast food pack in taste and quality. Easterbrook declared that McDonald???s would henceforth be focusing on its food, a new strategy to be embodied by such exciting new offerings as the Artisan Chicken Sandwich and, of course, the Sirloin Third Pound Burger. This revolutionary shift to a focus on food was good news for fans of McDonalds, especially considering that McDonald???s main product is food.Has McDonald???s upped their game? Well, they???ve upped their prices. They do not appear to have upped their game. Everything about this burger was tasteless and dry, including the pickles, if it is possible for pickles to be dry. The bun was stale. The patty was dusted with something called ???beef seasoning,??? which I guess was supposed to make the beef taste like beef. At this it failed.As far as I can tell the Sirloin Burger is pretty much the exact same thing as the Angus burger that McDonald???s tried out a few years ago and quickly abandoned because pretty much everyone who bought it thought it sucked. I suppose it had also gotten hard to impress anyone with the label ???Angus??? anymore, since practically all the beef sold in the United States is Angus to begin with. Which made me wonder at the time: if only this ???premium"" burger was made of Angus, what are Quarter Pounders and Big Macs made of?My wife was still awake on the couch, streaming cooking videos that featured actual food. She regarded me with sadness and pity as I ate. She also managed to steal half my fries while I was attempting to finish a burger that should have been ashamed of itself, although probably not as ashamed of itself as Steve Easterbrook should be for foisting this bullshit on us in the name of upping McDonalds??? game.I collapsed into bed about 20 minutes later and fell into a deeply troubled sleep. A word to the wise: if you are a heterosexual man who thinks it impossible to have a bad dream about Charlize Theron, then you haven???t eaten a McDonald???s Bacon and Cheese Sirloin Third Pound Burger immediately after watching Mad Max: Fury Road in Real 3D, and shortly before bed time.- - -Harry and David NEW Spring Snacks Gift TowerSubmitted by Sylvia IrizarryWe were already off to a rough start when the USPS didn???t leave my Easter package of goodies on the stoop of my Queens apartment. I???m 25 and my mom still sends me Easter baskets (even though the last time we went to church for Easter was easily ten years ago).I trudged back home from the post office on an extremely blustery day, perishables in hand and street grime in mouth. I knew exactly what to expect, this being my sixth Harry and David gift tower. I ripped open the cardboard shell, revealing a three-tiered tower of boxes???robin???s-egg blue, chartreuse, and tickle me pink???neatly tied together with a yellow ribbon.The tickle me pink box contained a 9-oz. bottle of honey dill mustard. This deviated from the typical assortment of Easter sweet-treats, but I like the aforementioned ingredients, so color me intrigued. The chartreuse box was comprised of a block of white cheddar cheese, some mixed nuts, and a log of hickory-smoked summer sausage. How the cheddar survived the cross-country journey and three-day stay at the post office is beyond me. More importantly, was I to expect stomach issues in the foreseeable future?Box three was a bit of a disappointment, as it held honey wheat pretzel rods. I like pretzels as much as the next person, but how am I supposed to eat white cheddar cheese and hickory-smoked summer sausage atop a pretzel rod? Am I so wrong in hoping the robin???s-egg blue box would contain crackers? And where do these mixed nuts come in?I assembled everything on a small plate (sans nuts) and embarked on my spring snack tower adventure. White cheddar cubes doused in honey dill mustard, atop a slab of hickory-smoked summer sausage, followed by a honey wheat pretzel rod.

Although there are few things in life more satisfying than lard, sugar, and sodium, my penis is indeed one of them. Therefore it is time that I start eating an organic, plant-based diet, or what my father refers to as, ???coming out of the closet???.Having never been to a produce section before, I decided to bring Mancala pieces to the market and scatter them on the floor in case I get lost and need to find my way back home. Once in the produce section, I found Garden of Eden Garden Burgers. The motto on the box read AN OR-GANIC-GASM IN YOUR MOUTH. I have heard of such things, veggie burgers, but I thought they were a fantasy like wizards, vampires and Zumba. A burger made out of vegetables?

She???s dead, but I use the present tense because she has reason to still be really ticked, 120 years after her husband, Irish writer Oscar Wilde, went to prison for being gay.What would you do, if you married the person of your dreams, had two kids together, supported one another???s career choices, became your generation???s power couple, and then watched him go to trial and throw it all away in a few pithy comments, as if your life together was nothing more than a giant spitball to be hurled at the world for a quick laugh?You see what I???m saying, right? She should have been all of the synonyms for mad-as-hell-not-going-to-take-it-hear-me-roar-you-scumbag-I-will-pick-up-all-the-pieces-of-my-mind-I-should-have-given-you-ages-ago. If nothing else, she should have thrown her hands in the air and shouted, ???Does anyone know how socially and religiously tricky it is for a woman to survive divorce in 1895????That question would have been rhetorical; Constance knew how tricky divorce would be. She knew she???d been betrayed, perhaps beyond redemption. She knew that she could lose everything, despite the fact that she had been the wealthy one at the start of her marriage. Oscar could take her money, her reputation, her whole life.What she may not have known (or known soon enough) was that Oscar was gay. At this point I imagine that your inner voice is getting rather snarky, saying, ???Yes, but, didn???t she know better? How could she be married to Oscar Wilde, the icon of gay men, and believe that he???s straight???? Some scholars argue that she did know, and married him in order to be his beard. Other scholars have argued that she had absolutely no idea until that spitball hurled through the courtroom in 1895, after they???d been married for 11 years.More recent scholars and I believe the answer lies somewhere in between. Do you know what it???s like to know something at your core and yet be unable to see it or understand it in reality? Think about the way people respond to the idea of their own deaths. It???s something we are all aware of, nearly all of our lives, and yet we don???t know how we will respond until death confronts us.Similarly, there must have been some part of Constance that was not surprised to learn that Oscar was gay (or bisexual, if you prefer; scholars debate about that, too). Their marriage had been rocky and she must have had suspicions of some sort. But remember that this was before the word homosexual had reached widespread usage, when gay men and women kept their secrets to avoid going to prison for two years hard labor (exactly Oscar???s sentence ??? the harshest offered). Also note that to whatever degree Oscar Wilde represents a notable stereotype of gay men (flamboyant dress, etc.), he in many ways created or solidified those stereotypes. Oscar???s ???feminine??? choices were noted at the time, but they weren???t obvious signs of homosexuality (nor are they today, except to the extent that society has embraced the stereotypes).So, back to Constance. She wasn???t all that angry, according to the letters and documents left for us to decipher, and I find this shocking. Absurdly, it even makes me a little bit angry at her. I like to believe that while she was writing rather curtly of Oscar in her post-1895 letters she smashed one or two valuables and slapped one or two faces. All the better if the valuables and the face belonged to Oscar.Even if there???s no evidence to show that Constance was angry enough to suit me, it???s clear that she was hurt. She was heartbroken. But she was not devastated, and she was not helpless. Not yet.Constance moved on, quite literally. She gathered herself and her 8- and 10-year-old sons, changed their last name to Holland, and moved them to Switzerland. It became clear that the money intended to care for her sons in the event of her death was in danger of going entirely to Oscar. She was receiving messages from Oscar that a",100
428,"lternated between spiteful and repentant. She tightened her social circle upon learning that one of her best friends had not only known of Oscar???s affairs, but had been one of them.1Have you decided yet what you would have done? You???re sort of angry just reading this, aren???t you?But now here???s the thing. I can come to terms with her apparent lack of anger towards Oscar. I can understand that; for if you???ve loved and lived with someone for over a decade, you may find more compassion than anger in your heart. Breathe deeply; betrayal is hard, but people recover. What Constance should really be angry about now is that she has been largely forgotten.People disappear through the cracks of history, I know. It would be impossible to memorialize everyone in the way they perhaps deserve. Yet this happens so often to women that I feel it???s worth being angry about. How could we have forgotten Constance Wilde, remarkable as she was?This is what happens when history defines or remembers a woman only by the accomplishments or defeats of her husband, brother, father, son. The woman disappears, and if she ever resurfaces we heap positive adjectives onto her like so many toppings on an ice cream sundae. What we should do instead is ask questions.Why do we not know who Constance Mary Lloyd Wilde Holland was?Constance persevered. She did not flourish ??? overstating the achievements of the forgotten eventually disappoints us all and makes them seem rather pathetic. As if what this individual did and endured was not in itself enough and we need to beautify it with excessive words.I want to describe her without sounding trite, like some half-hearted cheerleader for the history of womankind. To say she was complicated would be obvious. Aren???t we all? If I call her strong, independent, or confident it sounds as if I???m whitewashing or being intentionally vague. (See? That ice cream sundae of adjectives is pretty easy to make.)Yet she was all of these things: complicated, strong, independent, and confident. Most people are. She rejected suitors, relished the art world, wrote children???s stories and articles on fashion and decorating, she argued that women should be involved in politics and that clothes should be beautiful as well as comfortable. She compiled a book of Oscar???s sayings and in so doing may have had an affair with her publisher. She was a hands-on mother at a time when being so was considered strange and impractical.1Constance was more like you or me than we allow ourselves to believe about most historical figures. So was Oscar. If they lived today, perhaps they???d have their own reality TV show. Yes, the ubiquitousness of reality TV would erase any romance the Wildes??? lives might carry for us. But at least Constance would be more likely to get equal airtime.- -To keep Constance from being forgotten again, please read these books:Franny Moyle???s Constance: The Tragic and Scandalous Life of Mrs. Oscar WildeAnne Clark Amor???s Mrs. Oscar Wilde: A Woman of Some ImportanceJoyce Bentley The Importance of Being Constance- -1  SOURCE: Moyle, Franny.

Each day you learn a little more about the rest of humanity, and just by clicking this link you???ve already shown your interest in being a better ally. But while you???ve living a good life, checking your privilege and learning about people of different races, religions, social orientations and identities, there???s an ally opportunity you might have overlooked. The smallest minority. Me. And while I may be a minority of one, I must remind you that my opinion of you is not based on a measured consideration of your cumulative actions, but a far more easily defined concern determined by how well you, my potential ally, adhere to my evolving set of words and considerations.So here are six words to remove from your vocabulary so you can be a better ally. And to be clear, these are words to be completely banished, not just avoided with me. I???ve had enough ???behind your back??? allies, thank you very much.???Tall???Stop calling people tall. My driver???s license lists my height at 5??? 7"" and as you all know, that is a dubious statistic.  When I hear people described as ???tall??? ??? especially in a positive way ??? it reminds me that we as a society value things associated with being healthy, attractive, and strong. It is an indirect form of short-shaming that makes it hard for me to pretend my fantastic center of gravity is the asset I hold it out to be.???Nuts???Did you know roughly 450 million people in the world suffer from some form of mental illness? Most them of them are probably not bothered by you calling someone ???nuts.??? After all, these people have bigger problems than your colloquial word choices, but some of us, specifically me, do have severe peanut allergies. Indeed, my physician, in collaboration with my personal WebMD research, has declared my nut sensitivity so severe that even hearing mention of nuts could, conceivably, cause a discernible rash. Think about that the next time you want to liken someone suffering from a serious illness to a food product.???Wha????Yes, the dropping of the ???t??? in the word ???what??? has come to express an increased degree of incredulity. While some take issue with this word as an example of race appropriation, that argument is belied by the racist assumption that this word originated in the African American community in the first place. Instead, ???wha??? is personally problematic because it reminds me of the two months I had to go to speech therapy in second grade to better pronounce my ???T???s.??? So be a better ally. Say ???what??? the way it was intended, and be grateful the 20th letter of the alphabet comes so easily to you.???The Big Game???I have nothing against professional sports; they just don???t fit into my schedule. Nevertheless, despite not involving me personally, sporting events continue to be immensely popular for millions and millions of people so you really have your ally work cut out of you. Each time you reference the big game, you???re reinforcing that I???m somehow different, placing me in an adversarial position. And while that might make for good sporting, it doesn???t serve your role as ally.???#???Without a moment???s thought you use the hashtag to accentuate whimsical social media messages or sometimes even to support worthy causes such as #BringBackOurGirls or #IceBucketChallenge. But while you???re doing your part to aid the downtrodden or fight disease, do you ever take a second to consider the collateral psychological damage you???re inflicting upon others and/or me? Sure, to you the hashtag is a way to underscore a point, but to me it???s a brutal reminder of that tic tac toe game my father won on my sixth birthday before abandoning us forever.???Ally???Seriously?

How about y",100
430,"ou tell us a little bit about yourselves?EVAN REDSKY: Ah, well, my name???s Evan, I play bass in Single Mothers.BRANDON JAGERSKY: I???m Brandon, I play drums in Single Mothers.MIKE PETERSON: I???m Mike, I play guitar in Single MothersDREW THOMSON: I???m Drew, I sing in Single Mothers.REDSKY: And, yea, we???re from London, Ontario, Canada. Yeah.826 CHICAGO: Is this your guys??? first time at Pitchfork?REDSKY: Yes, but it???s not our first time in Chicago. Chicago???s actually one of our favorite cities, so it???s just good to be here, especially for Pitchfork.826 CHICAGO: Have you guys played around Chicago before?D. THOMSON: Yeah! Yea we???ve played Schuba???s a couple of times. We played earlier this year. It was the first time we ever actually sold out a show in the States, so that was??? or, the first time in Chicago at least, so that was really exciting.  We???ve always had a pretty good connection. They were one of our first shows we ever played in the States, it was Chicago, so.E. REDSKY: Think it was one of the biggest shows of that tour, was in Chicago. It was great.826 CHICAGO: I know that you guys have been through a couple of members. Is there a reason for that, or????D. THOMSON: I???m an asshole, so it???s hard to keep people around that like me long enough to tour with, so that???s???E. REDSKY: That???s it. This lineup has been the longest. It???s been a few years, so.D. THOMSON: This has been at least, like, four years with Mike and me, and then Evan and me. Really, when I started the band, it was more just as like an open door policy, if you could come to practice, you know you could come and be in the band until you couldn???t show up to practice, or if you could play a few shows here and there, so. We went through a lot of members at first, but really the core has been this for the longest that any other members have changed out. So this is how we consider the band, and have, for a long time.826 CHICAGO: So, if I remember correctly, this album was, your most recent album, was like three years in the making. So can you take us through the process of how it was to create that album over such a long period of time?M. PETERSON: Alright, so we started writing this thing a couple years ago. We moved to Montreal to do it. We wrote a bulk of songs there, didn???t really work out. So I guess we moved all over the place, and were just kind of scattered, and eventually when we kind of got it together enough to maybe think that we could record the thing, we went out to LA, and during that recording process, about four days in, our one drummer, our older drummer, quit. And so I play drums on the record, and then that wasn???t good enough. And then we got another drummer and then we hated that session, so we ended up getting Brandon and he played his first show with us on a UK tour. His first real show with the band was in Brighton, but eventually after that we decided to, like I said, scrap the entire session and go with our good friend from our hometown in London, his name is Simon, he was the one that recorded our first EP, or our second EP I guess, the self-titled, and we did the album there with him. And we must have gone through maybe 30 songs, and I guess a member, and another member that was in and out, and then eventually the album came together.D. THOMSON: We pretty much went all around North America to realize that we should have just gone home and so we just did it at home. Which made more sense, from the beginning.826 CHICAGO: You guys are all dudes. How did you pick the name Single Mothers? Does that mean anything to you guys?THOMSON: Single Mothers, yeah it was the name, I came up with it a long time ago, and I kind of like was joking around about it with my mom, and we all, first off???E. REDSKY: We all came from Single Mothers.D. THOMSON:  Three out of four of us have single parents and have been raised by single parents. When I told my mom about it first, she didn???t really quite get it, and she sat me down and had a little talk with me and explained, ???You know, this could be taken as offensive??? you???re almost taking my struggle with you and making a joke out of it.???And I said, I???m not, and basically we came to a term where it was more like a metaphor for bringing something into the world, like a band or like a kid, or anything else that, at any time, you could abandon and just leave, and kind of go on with your life. But you stick with it because you care about it more than anything and it means the most to you, and it might be hard and it might be the worst part of your life and it might be the best part of your life for different timelines. But it???s the thing you care most about and you want to watch grow and that???s how I felt about this band and so we stuck with it and kept the name around.826 CHICAGO: Well, my question???s actually for you. I know that you were doing some solo work and then you decided to reunite with the band. Is there a reason you decided to do that?D. THOMSON: Well, the solo work always came after the band it???s always just been a side party, so. Single Mothers has always been number one for me, and just on downtime I write songs that are much worse than Single Mothers songs, so I just put them out by myself and then, yeah.826 CHICAGO: So, what exactly would you describe as your band???s genre? Because I???ve read reviews of you guys described as post-punk, but do you agree with that?E. REDSKY: Yeah, it???s whatever you think it is, for the most part. We all listen to drastically different music. Like, I don???t listen to post-punk, I mean, I???m aware of what it is, but I think we all, separately, have such varying tastes in music, and it might come off as some sort of punk through that filter.D. THOMSON: Yeah, there???s this desire to categorize everything and so that???s out of the band???s hands, any band???s hands.826 CHICAGO: So I???ve read that when you come up with your lyrics, and the band, a lot of the times it???s on-the-spot in the studio, so how does that affect the honesty in your songs, and what you do as a band?D. THOMSON: It???s just like, whatever happened last week kind of gets thrown into??? kind of like??? I think there???s just an immediacy to all of our songs. Where it compliments the music, and I don???t think, I???m not trying to reinvent the wheel here with songs. They???re about our day-to-day life, and a lot of our friends, and a lot of the people we know. I think it???s just there are lines that might take a little, I might work on a line here or there but the general theme is just situationally based in??? it???s cemented in our friend group and our lives so it comes up honestly because I don???t like putting effort into not being honest. It???s the easiest thing to do is just talk about??? it???s harder to try and invent some circumstance than it is to just talk about what I???m going through at the time. So I think it makes it easier because I???m lazy. It???s lazy songwriting, it???s just what I like doing. Honesty and laziness are pretty much around the same place. It takes effort to lie about stuff, it???s much easier to live your life as an honest person, so whatever.826 CHICAGO: I read some stuff online about you, between music careers, doing gold mining? What???s that about?D. THOMSON: When we were still ??? before we had any records out or anything ??? we had still been a band for a few years, and I moved up north about ten hours from where we were situated and I was just out of money and I had an opportunity to go up and there was a gold rush going on in northern Ontario. And I couldn???t get a job at home so I just went up there. It w3rd Period Physical Education",100
431,"Sunny View High SchoolInstructor: Coach SteigmeyerCourse OverviewSince the ancient Greeks, Physical Education has always been a cornerstone of a young person???s learning. Here at Sunny View HS, I take fitness and health very seriously, and believe that a strong body makes for a healthy mind. However, due to district-wide budget cuts the course will reflect a few minor adjustments this year.First, because of a shortage of classroom space due to over-enrollment, we will now only have access to the gymnasium for one class a month. In case you get excited for that one session, though, we???ll be sharing the gym with Mr. Fessenden???s Drama class. Have you ever heard thirty people shout the words ???zip zap zop??? for forty-five minutes straight? Do you know what a grown man looks like when he???s portraying the ???essence of a Velociraptor???? For every other class session, we???ll be in the former art room, which (amazingly) is still filled with easels and smocks and Play-Doh crud. But Physical Education is still a ???valuable and integral part of the Sunny View curriculum,??? apparently, so we will do our best to stay active. Because it is important ??? even the ancient Greeks knew that.Course Components:A. Visualization: Top athletes often ???visualize??? their success in the game before even taking the field. Along these lines, we???ll be visualizing the activities we could be doing if we had the facilities and equipment. Common visualizations might include weight training, broom ball, volleyball, swimming, and having fun exercising together.B. Mental Toughness: You often hear it said that 50% of the game is won in your head. In 3rd period Physical Education, I???m adding that other 50%.C. John Cougar Mellencamp: They haven???t (yet) taken away my Cougar tapes, so we will still pump the tunes through my personal boombox that I brought from home. ???Ain???t that America,??? LOL.D. Running Outside: Doesn???t this seem like a reasonable exercise for high schoolers? To get out of our claustrophobic classroom for some fresh air? Do you know how much a liability lawsuit costs? Do you know how the district defines ???instructor negligence????E. Games: Do you like to play soccer? Football? Do you know how the district defines a ???dangerous projectile?????F. My Stories: Even after they???ve come for my Cougar tapes, they can???t ever take away my personal anecdotes of past glory. Did you know I made State???s football team as a walk-on and took a snap during our romp to the ???88 conference finals? Do you know about how people get superhuman strength during times of crisis, and can you imagine me lifting up a Corolla to free a lady who was screaming her head off because her leg was trapped?  You will.Course Policies:A. Attendance and Tardiness: If I have to be here, then so do you.B. Staying Within Eyesight: Because there are 45 of you this year, we won???t have a snowball???s chance of fitting in the old art room. Therefore, half of you will have to move outside and gather at the classroom???s windows. Because there is only one of me (no $$$ for a teacher???s assistant this year, LOL), you must stay within eyesight. Just because you are outside doesn???t mean you can wander away. Think I won???t notice you leave? Think you can make it to the tree line before I catch you? Wondering how much gas Old Steigmeyer???s got left in the tank? Try me. Please.C. Dropping the Course: Probably a good idea. Send me an email (NeedForSteig@yahoo.com) with all the reasons you want to drop the class. Make sure to cc superintendent@svschools.edu.One of the most well known conspiracy theories is that NASA never actually landed on the Moon, and the Apollo missions were actually filmed on Earth, which is not on the Moon. Various forms of facts and evidence have been brought up to debunk this conspiracy theory, but as we all know, facts and evidence are just a set of quotation marks away from being ???facts??? and ???evidence.???Did we really land on the Moon? Maybe. I know I didn???t, and that???s enough justification to delve deeper into the matter and rebunk the debunking of this conspiracy theory. For if we completely rule out the possibility of a conspiracy, aren???t we the same as those that completely rule out the possibility of a Moon landing? We are and don???t act like we aren???t.- -CONSPIRACY CLAIM: No stars are visible in the pictures taken by the Apollo astronauts from the surface of the Moon. The pictures should be filled with stars.DEBUNKING CLAIM: The landings took place during lunar mornings, with the Sun shining brightly. By comparison, other stars aren???t bright enough to be seen over the Sun???s light.REBUNKING CLAIM: The landings may have happened during lunar mornings (something you had assumed was the name of a lo-fi college rock album and not an actual occurrence until just now), or, having spent so much money getting famed director Stanley Kubrick to film the fake Moon landings, NASA didn???t have enough money to hire someone capable of making a realistic looking photo. They got an unpaid intern to whip together something at the last minute. The intern didn???t know there were stars other than the Sun, something you learn only after you are a full-time NASA employee, leading to the inaccurate photo.- -CONSPIRACY CLAIM: When astronauts put up the American flag on the Moon it waves, yet there is no wind on the Moon.DEBUNKING CLAIM: The flagpole was rotated several times into the Moon???s surface to make it stand up straight, this caused vibrations in the pole that led to ripples on the flag, making it seem to wave.REBUNKING CLAIM: The reason that the flagpole was rotated so many times was because the astronauts (or actornauts) were nervous that the flag would fall over and Kubrick would yell at them. No matter how many times they???ve been on the stage, actors still get nervous about making a mistake and angering the crew. A lot was at stake for the Apollo actors: a big pay day (minus 10-20% for their space agents), a chance to deceive billions of people, the possibility of being recast for more hoaxes, and the guarantee of being murdered if they messed up or told anyone about anything. Under that pressure, even the greatest actor is going to shake the flag and cause it to ripple. Hell, Marlon Brando would???ve been twirling that pole around like he was leading a parade. A parade of lies.- -CONSPIRACY CLAIM: No blast crater is visible in the pictures taken of the lunar landing module.DEBUNKING CLAIM: Due to the Moon???s low amount of gravity, the power of thrust at take-off and landing is low, and since it landed on hard rock, no blast crater was made.REBUNKING CLAIM: The guy on set whose job it was to make the blast crater was sick that day.- -CONSPIRACY CLAIM: The rocks brought back from the Moon are identical to rocks collected by scientific expeditions to Antarctica, hence they???re not from the Moon.DEBUNKING CLAIM: While Moon rocks have been found on Earth, they are all scorched from entry through the Earth???s atmosphere. Geologists who studied the rocks brought back by Apollo astronauts assured they were from the Moon.REBUNKING CLAIM: There???s not a single geologist who isn???t a failed actor. Every geologist who studied those ???Moon??? rocks knew well they were from Antarctica or at least made in a rock lab near Antarctica, but they saw the chance to lie and use NASA???s connections in the film industry to further their own acting careers. If you take a look at a list of those geologists who verified the authenticity of the rocks, you???ll see some familiar names: Burt Reynolds, Jack Nicholson, and Michael Douglas, to name the three that are the easiest fo",100

The writer, arriving at the orchard for what was meant to be a delightful family day of apple-picking, hedge-mazing, and merriment, is hindered by parking obstacles, met by a long line at the cider-donut window, is shown the punishments of Hell in the form of mishap after mishap, and only after such trials as no man or woman should face shall she be conducted back to her apartment again.- - Midway through a brisk New England fall,I packed my family in our Mazda 5.We could not resist the orchard???s Siren call,The sights, the colors! Ah! To be alive!The scenic two hour???s drive led to the lot,Wherein the cars did fight and squeal and striveWith eagle eyes I spied a single spot,Then just as swiftly lost it to some dick(And how is mid-October so damn hot?!).At any rate, committed, we did stickTo our fall plan, we would not be deterred.We found a spot (although it was not quick),And made our way among the human herdTo buy our bags and fill them with our bounty,Lest we leave the apples to the birds.My husband, wisest man in all the county,Said splitting up would cover distance wider.So orchardward my family went without me,As I lined up for donuts made with cider.I circled round the barn to seek the line,(The sugared treats were surely hid inside her),The queue I found, yet boggled was my mind,To see such hordes amassed and moving not,Such throngs of human flesh pressed and combined.Did I mention it was really fucking hot?I texted my dear love, ???The line is endless,???He texted back ???The trees have gone to rot.???I went to text again about this madness,When just that second my phone screen cut to black.And there I stood, alone and sad and friendless,The donut line just pressing further back.???We have to make more dough,??? the kitchen called,I wondered, would I have a heart attack?And there I stood, my iPhone finger itching,Neither email nor Facebook nor Twitter could I check,And no one there to listen to my bitching,Just this weird hot fall wind slapping at my neck.To my delight the line began to thin,The time unknown, no clock for me to check,I finally made it to the front and in,And bought the dozen donuts that I sought,And felt the day to finally be a win.When suddenly before me, all distraught,My husband and my kids fell to their knees.???Whilst you awaited donuts that you boughtYour child has lost her iPhone in the trees!???I tried to keep my cool, I tried to think.???Have you called it???? I suggested somewhat pleased.???Of course! It???s dead!??? he yelled back, on the brinkof losing his mind along with my daughter???s phone.???Well shit,??? I said as my heart began to sink.We checked through every row the orchard owned,But the Apple among the apples could not be found.And dusk approaching we started our way home,The phone we left to rot upon the ground.And silence filled the car as we drove east,Each filled with a dejection most profound.Not funeral dirge nor confession to a priestCould be more somber than that two hour???s ride,The apples knocked against them, each to each,While in our pitted stomach sank our pride.And neither color-changing leavesNor fall???s pure scent, could reach insideWherein our sadness hung like ice upon the eavesFor now was the winter of our discontent.The happiness of autumn not to be retrieved,Our joy at apple-picking having all been spent,And each our North Face garments now in mourning rent.The problem with specialized high schools is that everyone in them thinks they???re God. In hallways full of Lords on High, it is difficult to be a small, frumpy, and bespectacled seventeen-year-old girl, and even difficult-er to be a small, frumpy, etc., hijabi girl.It is difficult to squeeze past the ego-glow and rumbling loudness of a thousand Deities to get to my classes. It is difficult to come to terms with the fact that The Omnipotent Ones have not yet mastered the art of closing their lockers without denting the metal, and the very souls of nearby mortals like me, every single time. It is difficult to look on as The Sole Creators of the Universe use their tremendous powers for evil, like saying remarkably unremarkable or otherwise presumptuous things in classes I would otherwise enjoy.My school is the kind you have to test into. Think generic billion dollar tutoring industries, formulaic essays with X-amount of long words in each paragraph, and is-it-wrong-to-check-the-Latin American/Caribbean-box if we go past three generations? Think parents knowing that This Is The School, the one that will lead to The Other Three schools (hint: they start with h, y, and p), before they know what their kid is into ??? or if they even want a kid.The Holy Beings know how coveted their positions are. Their every word, action, and breath reflects this Perceived Special. They mourn grades of 90 or less with small funerals. They think ???community college??? is merely a punch line. They form a hyper-intellectual, skepticism-as-art-form habitat where religion is practically alien.Which brings us to me, the hijabi. I walk among them, both invisible and loud.I wear a headscarf and my clothes are long and loose, occupying the uncomfortable interim space between crazed gypsy and Bohemian chic. (In freshman year especially, my fashion sense put the ???um??? in frump. Actua",100
433,"lly, it put the ???rump??? in frump. And I???m pretty sure there were days it put the ???f??? in as well.)My only saving grace then was that a lot of people didn???t ??? still don???t ??? actually see me from the neck down. I am a floating, bobbing headscarf and any fashion mistake I make is ignored in the face of a much larger one: Being Muslim.(I must be some sort of cruel goddess or superhero in my own right, the way I make people see in me what isn???t there, words and memories and pictures that reflect tiny dark pieces of themselves, the gaps in between what they know and what they???ve been taught to fear. They may see in me Twin Towers, or Afghani war refugees, or maps marked with airstrike attacks, or Charlie Hebdo, or cut off hands, or swirling mystics, or a giant foggy question mark. In other words, the disillusionment and ignorance of high school doesn???t end when I push through the main double doors and leave campus at 3:30.)So, hi.I am Hijabi, Hijabi in Plain Sight, and I have finally come to the point of this column, which is that I am so done. Misunderstandings cramp my style, so I quit. Finito. The shutters are coming down so you???d better watch your fingers. Token Hijabi has swallowed the token, all the tokens. I can no longer sit back while you wonder how long it takes to put on my scarf, whether I shower with it on, if I was even born here, or how I got into a smart school.You???re going to see me now.""THEM: ???We???ll stop you!???ME: ???You???ll try!???

Here???s how these work. Her stupid ovaries are slowing and/or stopping their production of estrogen, a female hormone that makes all kinds of wonderful things happen. They???ve had enough, they???re retiring, and couldn???t give two shits what kind of desolation they leave behind because they???re assholes. In other words, they???re like rich old parents who decide to travel the world, spend your inheritance, and forget you have a birthday.In the absence of estrogen, not only do middle-aged women experience hot flashes, but their skin, which had hitherto belied their age, now wrinkles on a weekly basis. This is particularly true around the eyes, giving your middle-aged female professor (MAFP) a hang-dog look of perpetual exhaustion. Your MAFP will look on your glowing, youthful faces and not feel a sliver of envy. She had her time and wouldn???t trade in her wisdom and experience to go back to that era of her life for all the money in the world. Still, she would prefer if her ass stopped expanding like the universe.What she???s not too keen on is how the hair on her head is not just graying, but whitening, while other hairs grow profusely in places she never desired to posses them, in brown and sometimes white strands. Use your imagination of where I???m talking about. Furthermore, she now gains weight by looking at food, when before, her overactive metabolism kept her slim regardless of how much she ate. All this visible evidence of aging and mortality is something your MAFP is trying to get used to, in the midst of building a career in a profession that like so many others values youth.What you???re not seeing is the aura that precedes the actual hot flash/instantaneous profuse sweating. It???s like your MAFP suddenly realized she locked her baby in the car on a scalding hot summer day. Except she doesn???t have a baby. That doesn???t make this minute-long bodily reaction feel any less real because here???s what your MAFP does when she has it: her mind associates it with something actual. For example, the aura occurs, she feels freaked out, and suddenly believes teaching is terrifying. Wha? Since when? Your MAFP???s body is trying to bullshit her. She knows this, but that doesn???t stop it from feeling like the absolute truth.On top of this, the",100
434," aura/hot flash one-two punch prefers to pop up at inopportune moments, like important meetings or when standing in front of a class lecturing. When your MAFP falls off her train of thought, give her a moment, she???ll quickly hop back on to drop some brilliant composition knowledge on your asses.If your MAFP seems a little cranky when you ask her your seventh question pertaining to the syllabus, whose answer can be found in said document if you chose to read it with any attention, know this: during this phase of her life, your MAFP is operating in a state of perpetual sleep deprivation thanks to the hot flashes and night sweats, which could teach the CIA a thing or two about effective interrogation practices. Here???s what a typical night attempting to sleep looks like for an MAFP locked in battle with menopause: I???m hot (kick off blankets). Two minutes later: I???m cold ??? where are the blankets? Two minutes later: I???m hot (kick off blankets). Two minutes later: I???m cold ??? where are the blankets? Repeat for the next several hours.Lack of sleep can lead to any number of awesome things, such as death. Or, at the very least, premature dementia, crankiness, fogginess of thought, which, as you can imagine, do not enhance your MAFP???s intellectual endeavors. And low libido, not that you need to know that about your MAFP, but there it is. Does the loss of sleep lead to weight gain, which in turn causes your professor to feel undesirable? Hell to the yes. It???s a tangle of intertwined nonsense akin to a pile of snakes having sex.There is no cure for menopause because men don???t experience it. There is only postponing its inevitable arrival through taking synthetic estrogen. Some middle-aged women have a brief relationship with it, those lucky biatches, and quickly move on to what must be a glorious post-menopausal existence, filled with unicorns, rainbows, and blissful nights of unbroken sleep. Others suffer with it for years and years. Nine and still counting, to be precise. Unfortunately, hormone replacement therapy isn???t a good option if your MAFP has a family history of estrogen-receptive breast cancer. And over-the-counter remedies in the form of teas and supplements are as effective as taking aspirin to cure cancer.And yet, despite all this daily turmoil and discomfort, this quotidian confrontation with her advancing age, your MAFP is still getting shit done. Prepping for class and teaching you everything she knows about writing. Grading your papers and giving you specific feedback to improve them. Giving a damn about your education, even when you don???t. She???s doing her own writing, when she etches out the time, submitting it, even applying to dozens of other jobs. This is on top of keeping her family, home, and marriage running as best she can.Remember this when you see your MAFP sweating. She???s not a novice or nervous ??? she???s menopausal. So give her a break. She could use it. And so could you ??? one day.Sincerely,AngieIf you don???t have something nice to say, don???t say anything at all???Jesus, whoever came up with that one is a total fucking moron.SpringWilbur the pig was unhappy.  In the two short months that he had been alive, Wilbur was certain he experienced the peaks and valleys of happiness and despair.  When he was but a runt, he was free to prance about, but now that he was under the care of Farmer Zuckerman he was confined to a simple pig pen.His first owner, Fern, visited less often since school had started.  He would not be so lonely if he had a friend, but none of the animals on the farm talked to him.  They knew that Wilbur was a spring pig, and would be gone by winter.So Wilbur plopped down in his manure pile.  ???Why won???t anyone be my friend????  Wilbur cried.  ???Why is my life so miserable????A thin voice responded: ???There is not love of life without despair about life.???Wilbur looked up to find the voice, perhaps in the corner of doorway where spiderwebs formed.  But there was no one there.???Up here,??? said the voice.Wilbur???s gaze went up more, to the top of the barn.  In the hayloft sat a small man in a rumpled suit.  A cigarette dangled impossibly from the corner of his mouth.  ???Je suis Camus.  And you could learn a thing or two about misery from me.??????I don???t want to be miserable,??? sniffled Wilbur.  He looked up at the Frenchman and asked, ???Will you be my friend????But Camus did not respond.  He did that thing where he pretended like he didn???t hear Wilbur, shuffled in his jacket for another cigarette even though he was clearly still smoking the one from before, and left the barn in a puff of smoke.SummerDays passed, as they usually do.  Wilbur grew bigger to the joy of Farmer Zuckerman, for Wilbur would make a wonderful Christmas ham once he was fully grown.  The animals were all gathered in the barn one night, discussing the plight of Wilbur.???They???re going to kill him by the end of the year,??? exclaimed the horse.  ???For a holiday ham!??????It???s absolutely-lutely-lutely dreadful!??? cried the gander.???There must be something we can do for him,??? said the sheep.In the doorway stood Camus, pensive and smoking a cigarette.  Like always.???Knowing that certain nights whose sweetness lingers will keep returning to the earth and sea after we are gone, yes, this helps us to die.???There was an awkward pause amongst the animals.???What???? cried Wilbur, who had been standing there the whole time.  Right in front of Camus.???Since we???re all going to die, it???s obvious that when and how don???t matter.??????It certainly matters to me!??? said Wilbur.The hens gossiped amongst themselves.  ???Man, this Camus guy is kind of a dick.??????What if we convinced Farmer Zuckerman not to kill him???? asked the sheep.???Yeah!??? said a mouse.  ???We could try and relay a message that Wilbur is incredible, wonderful, stupendous!  Anything but a normal pig.???Camus stubbed out his cigarette on the timbers that made up the door frame.  ???Nobody realizes that some people expend tremendous energy merely to be normal??????We don???t want Wilbur to be a normal pig,??? creaked a cricket.???Normal pigs get eaten,??? explained the sheep.Camus stubbed his cigarette out and spat on the ground, narrowly missing a cricket.  ???Ce???st le vie???AutumnAutumn came and went along with the state fair.  Wilbur was entered into a contest for Best Pig and won first prize.  This forced Farmer Zuckerman to admit that Wilbur was some pig.The animals rejoiced, and Templeton the rat rejoiced perhaps a bit too much.  When he returned from the state fair he had ballooned to the size of a volleyball.???You know Templeton, you???d probably live longer if you didn???t eat so much,??? said the sheep.Templeton was about to respond in a snide manner when Camus showed up and stole his thunder. ???Templeton is the absurd hero.  He is, as much through his passions as through his torture.??????Absurd hero???? asked Wilbur.  ???You???ve got to be kidding me.??????His scorn of the gods, his hatred of death, and his passion for life won him that unspeakable penalty in which the whole being is exerted toward accomplishing nothing.??????Scorn of the gods???? the sheep was not convinced.???It???s something I???m working on,??? said Camus.  ???Templeton is an example of Sisyphus, the god who was condemned to push a boulder up a hill for eternity.??????Are you sure he???s not the boulder???? asked the sheep.  The sheep and Wilbur had a good laugh about that one while Camus and Templeton shared a cigarette and talked about death.WinterOne day Camus left.  He left as abruptly as he had appeared.  And on the ground, littering the barn floor, we",100
435,"re piles of cigarette butts.  Arranged in a pattern, they spelled out one final message from the Frenchman:THE WORLD IS WHAT IT IS, WHICH IS TO SAY, NOTHING MUCH.None of the animals could read and many were quite upset that the mysterious Frenchman had left such a mess before he left. No one cared that he left except for Templeton the rat.  Templeton waddled about the farm looking for his only friend.???Hey Wilbur, have you seen Camus???? Templeton asked.???No, but he might be behind you,??? the fat pig chuckled.  ???You???ve grown so fat this winter that I can???t see around you!??????Look who???s talking,??? muttered Templeton.???Excuse me???? Wilbur stomped over to Templeton.  ???What did you say to me???????Nothing,??? squeaked Templeton as he scurried away.And so the barn yard animals lived out their days in bliss.  Though they had saved Wilbur from slaughter, they forgot about death and its finality for the time being.But Templeton knew.  He knew life was short, and his shorter (for he was a rat and all).  Before Camus left, they would spend the days talking about life and all of its wonders while the nights were spent dissecting the dark and how it frightened them both.  So Templeton persevered, alone.EpilogueTempleton died today.  Or maybe yesterday, I can???t be sure.[Originally published October 14, 2015.]- - -THE GREATEST CITY IN THE WORLD ???

He???s not here yet, so I sit alone on a barstool and stare at the walls. Vito???s was the scene of a murder several years ago. It???s something I???ve always wondered about. The story didn???t get a lot of news coverage, but according to rumor, the victim had gang ties. He???d recently messed with somebody and had been laying low, but his favorite band was playing, and he had to see them. It might???ve taken place on the crowded dance floor, I don???t know, but he was shot in the head. I wish I knew exactly where it happened. This question settles heavily over every surface. As I wait, it grows larger and larger, filling up the room.Dave arrives and plops down next to me. There???s a small smile on his face. I???ve known him for a few years now. He???s an electrician in his 40s with a lean build and light, thinning hair. He sometimes wears glasses with lenses that makes his eyes appear smaller. The last time we talked, it was several months earlier, the night of the shooting at The Twilight Exit, just after all the patrons had fled the bar and gathered outside. Dave was searching for his date. He couldn???t find her, and we hadn???t seen her either, so he kept looking. But then he still couldn???t find her, and everything seemed to rev up and slow down in a certain mixed-together way. Then he found her, and she was fine.At Vito???s, we get drinks, and Dave starts his story from the beginning. He???d showed up at the Twilight for Sunday-night karaoke. He???d been there maybe twenty minutes, Dave said, and was on his way to the men???s room. He???d just passed the alleyway-entrance door when the gun went off. ???I thought it was a firecracker or something. But then I heard people screaming. I could hear Greg from outside. He said, ???I???m dying.??? His voice was incredibly frantic.???In seconds, nearly everyone cut through the dining area and exited. Dave stayed inside. ???My motor skills slowed down. It was weird. I walked into the bathroom, then into the stall. I became a real simpleton. It felt like someone had pulled a woolen blanket over my brain. I locked the stall and sat on the toilet. I thought about pulling my feet up. I really didn???t want someone to shoot through the door and kill me. I stared at the graffiti. I thought to myself: ???I don???t want to die in a commode.??????Commode! He grew up with elderly parents, so he???s always dropping charmingly antiquated words like that, and ???foliage,"" and ???veranda.??????What was the graffiti about???? I ask Dave.???I don???t remember. Something about dicks, I guess,??? he said, and we both laugh, because everything was so terrible. And because Dave made it out alive anyway. And because women???s-room graffiti is largely dick-free while the men???s is the opposite, and this idiosyncrasy has always fascinated me.Dave continues. ???I heard two more shots about a minute later. I called 911, but I hung up when they answered because I didn???t want the shooter to hear me. I have no idea how much time went by. It seemed like a long time between the last shot and the silence, but I don???t know. I was in a haze, like I was drifting in sort of a half dream.??????I walked out of bathroom. I didn???t know where the shooter was or if there were multiple shooters. The doorway to the alley was right there. I was standing in front of it, and I walked past it. I can???t believe how poor my instincts are.???The bar appeared empty, Dave said, except for one man, ???pacing by the shuffleboard across the room. His clothes were clean, he was well-dressed, he took care of himself. He was worked up, he was distraught. He was acting like he???d been wronged, that was obvious to me. He kept saying, ???My life is over. They took my dog.??? I didn???t know if he was talking to himself or if he was on the phone, it was dark. I???m pretty sure he saw me, but he didn???t acknowledge me. It didn???t seem like he was out to kill as many people as possible.??????The shock was totally paralyzing,??? said Dave. He moved slowly, creating more distance from the man. ???I wandered into the kitchen. Things seemed really foggy and wobbly. It felt kind of like b",100
436,"eing really, really drunk. I had tunnel vision. I wanted to hide in the walk-in cooler, but I couldn???t figure out how to open the latch. A three-year-old could???ve probably done it. I kept trying to figure out that lock.???(A week following this interview, I had the Twilight???s owner escort me to the kitchen and show me the freezer. It had an ordinary pull-handle latch. I tried it. Dave was right, it opened easily.)???I couldn???t move the lock, so I kind of shut down,??? said Dave. ???I felt as weak as a newborn kitten. I turned around and sat down by an icebox and waited. I wasn???t really planning it out, but I figured the cops were gonna show up pretty soon, and then I heard the sirens. Probably right when I sat down is when I heard the sirens.???Dave says he heard the police announce themselves twice, followed by rapid gunshots. Two cops located Dave in the kitchen, and guided him away, shielding him from seeing James???s body as they walked past, and brought Dave to the alley door. ???There was a pool of blood on the step,??? said Dave. ???When I turned, I saw Greg lying down. I reacted to that. I became like a little girl. Something broke loose emotionally. Man, people are probably dead now. That???s the thing, I???d never seen any violence at all. It was all acoustic, so I was disassociating. It was like I was watching TV. But right there is when it dawned on me. I felt a resolve, I kind of snapped out of the fog.???In the following weeks, Dave would turn the night???s details over and over. ???I was keenly aware that my inactions could???ve caused a loss of lives. You come up with heroic images of actions you could???ve taken. Like when I heard the gun go off, and when someone started pulling the door open, I should???ve shoved it very hard, and knocked the person back.???I interrupt Dave here, because he???s being profoundly hard on himself. I tell him that he would???ve needed the ability to see through doors as well as into the future.He listens, but says nothing. Then Dave mentions that he thought about taking martial arts for a few days afterwards, and this reminds me of Brad, a tenant in my apartment building. Immediately following the shooting, he sent me a link to a martial-arts site. Brad was a youngish guy and really into that scene. He would often be doing t???ai chi on the back lawn, which gave him an overall dorky quality. Still, he seemed pretty nice. I???m sure he meant well, but I took his message to suggest that I???d failed to prepare myself. I was touchy about it for a long time.At Vito???s, our bartender appears. She has silver jewelry and long straight hair, and she moves in swift bursts. Dave and I are ready to cash out, and also I need to ask. It may be impolite, I can???t tell, so I try to put some curlicues into my words while I???m enunciating them. ???Say, what???s the deal with that guy who died here? Do you know where in the room he was when it happened????I???m aware this probably occurred on some patch of floor and that the patch looks completely ordinary and feels completely ordinary, as do the textured beige tiles that will belong forever to James. Still, I care about it very much. ???Oh. I don???t know where that was,??? our bartender told us in a friendly voice. Then we all kind of laughed, as you do. ???I never want to know. I hate to think about it,??? she said.- -Dining area of the Twilight ExitPhoto credit: Seattle Police Department.Driving south on the Taconic Parkway, the Adirondacks offering up their panoply of fall colors, I bid a melancholy adieu to a life of leaf peeping. Seeing so many leaves turn color will change a man, and not necessarily for the better. Peeping is a jealous mistress, and I???ve been forced to sacrifice everything I???ve held dear: My wife divorced me, I lost my job, and my fantasy football team consistently finishes in the bottom third of the league.Where did it all go wrong? How could so much beauty produce so much pain?I???ve been a leaf peeper for over fifty years now, back when people called it ???branch glancing??? and the only enthusiasts were either forest-dwelling hermits or good old-fashioned perverts. I???ve peeped everywhere from the Blue Ridge Mountains to the forests of Japan, where I trained in the ancient practice of momijigari (???red leaf hunting???), which sounds as hip in Japanese as ???leaf peeping??? does in English.I first started leaf peeping as a young private during the Vietnam War, honing my craft while patrolling the jungle for VC. I???ve brought the same intensity to every mission since, but every great peeper needs to know when he???s past his peak color.I won???t be missed much by the leaf-peeping community. I was never one for guided bus tours or swapping tales of derring-do over French toast at B&Bs. The true peeper hunts alone, surviving on acorns, apple cider and adrenalin. He rarely bathes, sleeps in the woods and always keeps an eye open for Charlie. His bed a pile of fallen leaves, he awakens each morning to marvel at the kaleidoscopic canopy above his head as he checks his crevices for ticks.But leaf peeping is a young man???s game now. These new guys are fast, ruthless and ???extreme???; my tripod-mounted manual Pentax is no match for their GoPros, souped-up ATVs and flying squirrel suits. Since I???ve grown as dry and withered as a sun-scorched leaf, it???s time to give my peepers a rest and pick up a less taxing hobby.Taking in the fall colors for the last time, I think back on the good moments. My ex-wife and I met on a scenic Vermont road very much like the one I???m driving on now. She rear-ended me when I abruptly braked to snap a pic of a poplar grove. After I recovered from my surgeries and dropped my lawsuit against her, we became man and wife, consummating our love under the blazing foliage of a sugar maple.When I forgot our autumn anniversary five years running, though, she left me for a lumberjack, which I found to be a tad passive aggressive. (At least it wasn???t a birder.)Shortly thereafter I was fired from my job for accessing www.leafcreepers.com on a company computer, or for taking a three-month vacation every September, or for performing a lewd act in the vicinity of a Sassafras. I forget which???that whole period is an intoxicating blur of oranges, purples, yellows, golds, burgundies???Ave atque vale, prismatic foliage resplendent in thy death throes. It is with a heavy heart that I abandon the sacred oath of the leaf peeper: ???To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.???Where will I go? Who knows? A frozen tundra. The Mongolian steppe. A floating oil rig. Just as long I???m far from any deciduous temptress seducing me with her autumnal hues. To some barren expanse where I will never again hear the siren song of dry leaves crunching underfoot, nor ever again lay eyes upon a tree like that one right there, brazen in its roadside russet glory, calling out for me to slam on the brakes and indulge myself in one final, ecstatic peep???[CRASH]I just want to take a moment to thank my fans. My fans have given so much to me and I am so grateful. I love my fans.When I first started in this business I had no fans. Not one. Other than my mom, who was my number one fan, and still is. But then things changed. I got more popular and started getting fans. At first just a few, but the number of fans grew and grew. And now I have more fans than I can count.And that???s why I have so much love and respect for my fans for being my fans. Because I used to not have fans, but now I do.Doing what I do is hard. Day in and day out, working as hard as I do ??? it???s tough. But when I???m burning the midnight oil, putting my everything into a pro",100
437,"ject, what keeps me going are the fans. Knowing my fans are out there supporting me means the world.I owe my fans so much. I???m indebted to each and every fan.Once, early in my career, a fan emailed me. He told me he loves what I do and is a fan for life. That he???s so grateful I do what I do so that he can be a fan of mine. I???ll always remember that email.I love hearing from my fans ??? fan mail is my lifeblood.Sometimes fans will approach me on the street, when I???m just walking around. They???ll come up to me and say things like, ???Hey, I???m a huge fan??? or ???I just want you to know what a huge fan I am.??? I always love talking to my fans. Often times fans will want to take a photo with me, and I always oblige, just as long as I don???t have somewhere to be.I have such loyal fans. Fans have written and said they would take a bullet for me. And I believe them. Although I would never want a fan to die on my behalf ??? I can???t stand the thought of a dead fan.Nothing upsets me more than when fans dies.Last year a fan got cancer. I found out when he tweeted at me and told me. I retweeted that tweet. He died shortly after, but I think that my retweet meant a lot to him. I know it meant a lot to me.Once, a fan began visiting my house late at night, breaking in through the back door. She was a stalker, and my lawyers decided I should press charges, so I did. Now that fan is in jail. I???ve never visited her, but I think of her often. A fan who resorted to breaking and entering ??? I can???t imagine a more devoted fan.Except for the fan that kidnapped and locked me in his basement for three months and fed me only celery and lean grilled chicken breasts. That fan not only wanted to keep me close, but showed me tough love by putting me on a diet. A diet that eventually led to my wrists becoming emaciated enough to slip out of the shackles and escape.And I???m proud to say I kept the weight off. Who would have thought a fan would be responsible for me looking the best I have in years?I???m truly lucky to have such incredible fans. I am a fan of my fans for being fans of me. So I just want to end by saying this: thank you. Thank you to all of my fans. Without you, I wouldn???t have fans.1. Go back and do everything you did one way, the other way.2.

I appreciate The Simpsons more than I love it. I enjoy South Park but don???t remember to watch it that often. I keep meaning to watch more Bob???s Burgers and to rewatch Futurama. Generally, the comedies I gorge on are live-action. That???s just how my funny bone is wired.But there???s one animated comedy that immediately hooked me and made me want to watch again and again: Archer. This James Bond spoof with Arrested Development DNA is easily one of my five favorite comedies ever, with the quickest damn writing in the west and the best voice actors in the multiverse. The existence of Archer is a good reason to live, because of its immensely witty writing, mega-talented cast, and surprising ability to deal with issues like cancer ??? possibly the most comedy-resistant topic of all.Archer???s deep, talented cast is its biggest strength. As Archer, H. Jon Benjamin???s gruff deadpan ??? with occasional notes of boyish glee ??? makes every struggle, whether with his nemesis-borg Barry or tinnitus, funny. Thanks to the great Aisha Taylor, Lana is a perfect foil for Archer: she???s twice as competent but with nearly as many issues. Jessica Walter???s performance as Malory Archer deserves to be in the Evil Mom Hall of Fame. Chris Parnell, I reckon, should be a supporting actor on every show, as he brings monster-dicked, insecure Cyril Figgus to ridiculous life. Judy Green, Lucky Yates, and show creator Adam Reed round out the cast as ditzy pyromaniac Cheryl, mad scientist Krieger, and swishy cyborg Ray. Sadly, the cast is less great with the recent death of George Coe, w",100
438,"ho voiced Woodhouse, Archer???s loyal, heroin-loving butler.The standout among standouts is Amber Nash, who along with the writers has created the kind of badass female character audiences didn???t even know they should be demanding: Pam Poovey. Pam wins fight clubs, drag races with the Yakuza, and keeps Human Resources humming while occasionally giving Archer the best sex of his life. If she lived alongside superheroes instead of spies, Pam would snap Wonder Woman???s neck and tap out Batman with an armbar. She is a force. ???Holy shitsnacks!??? indeed.I bet Pam would make a great mom, teaching her children the basics of dairy farms, TPS reports, and bare-knuckles fighting. She would certainly be a better mom that Malory, whose psychotic version of motherhood was on full display in the pilot, as we learn her character (who, in some ways, is simply Lucille Bluth with a spy agency) loved her dog far more than her son, as creepily shown in a John-and-Yoko style portrait with the poodle Duchess (also Archer???s code name). Then there???s that pesky boner Archer gets when his mother is in mortal danger. Subsequent episodes fill in the blanks with a variety of deranged and depressing scenes of little Archer, who is often abandoned by his mother, dressed like Hitler for some reason, or shamed for putting his little Archer in a vacuum cleaner (which led to lifelong issues with cyborgs, but that???s another story). Anyone with a mother probably has some mommy issues, but Archer has a complete set, in mint condition, dating back to the Book of Revelations.That damage fuels Archer???s James Bond-y shenanigans, which show little regard for human life or anything resembling common decency, especially in the shitty way he treats Woodhouse, his butler who basically raised him. But one trait that makes him somewhat redeemable is his love of animals. When Archer discovers that dimwitted secretary Cheryl is secretly rich, Archer is more interested in her pet ocelot Babou. When Archer and Lana are sent to recover an asset named Kazak, Archer is thrilled to learn this is the name of a mammoth dog. Sure, Archer???s enthusiasm is eventually dampened by Babou???s scratches and Kazak???s farts, but it???s a slow process: he has a lot of enthusiasm in this area. Love of animals is one of the few joys his mother didn???t squeeze out of his heart.Picking a best anything for Archer is a near impossible task, akin to lifting the giant golden key to Superman???s Fortress of Solitude. My favorite individual joke is in the Burt Reynolds episode. Improbably, Archer???s hero Burt is dating his mother, so jealous Archer makes his mom think Burt has abandoned her for younger flesh. A drunken Mallory???s response is perfectly wrong: ???Leave me for some hot little 20-year-old? Well, I???ll show him. I???ll go find me a 10-year-old!??? My favorite episode might be ???The Double Deuce,??? in which Archer simultaneously babysits ???the wee baby Seamus??? and helps Woodhouse figure out who???s trying to kill his war buddies. The dark humor of the flashbacks also provide an origin story for Woodhouse ??? and Archer, whose birth and mother Woodhouse protected. Along the way, Archer makes a memorable statement all frustrated single parents can relate to: ???I can do baby or I can do geezer murder mystery, but I can???t do both.???But for Archer???s Best Story Ever, I have to go with the obvious: the cancer storyline. I wanted to avoid it, because I???ve been thinking too much about cancer lately. My dad has fought off two types of cancer in the past year. My friend Colleen beat salivary cancer. Between the time I submitted this article and it was published, my mom was diagnosed with breast cancer. I never met one of my grandmothers because of cancer. I hate to imagine how many other cancers will be part of my life, and I generally prefer my entertainment to be escapist. But Archer???s two-part cancer storyline was so emotionally true to life ??? while maintaining the absurdity of the show ??? that I have to single it out for Archer???s Best Story Ever.This two-parter starts in the episode ???Stage Two,??? with Malory being even more villainous than usual. She refuses to hear about Cheryl???s weekend arson, scatters Cyril???s carefully sorted punchcards, and dumps coffee on Pam???s marzipan farm replica, causing her to wail, ???It???s just like when the farm flooded in real life! Only tiny and sweet.??? Turns out Malory???s upset because she might have breast cancer. She doesn???t, but we soon learn that Archer ??? thanks to alcoholism and frequent exposure to radiation, as shown in a ridiculous montage ??? does.As Archer copes with his diagnosis of stage two breast cancer, we see (and hear, thanks to Benjamin???s skills) new sides of Archer. He voluntarily spends time with his sorta child Seamus and is actually nice to Woodhouse for a few seconds. He tries to bond with his diabolical mother. As ???the world???s greatest secret agent,??? Archer risks death over and over, but he???s never faced it like this, and it changes everything. Well, not everything. Archer is still Archer, as seen in his attempt at having cancer sex with Lana the night before his treatment:ARCHER: Lana, I???m in love with you.LANA: You are also shitfaced.ARCHER: I can be both.Indeed he can, and the show is just as versatile: its elastic enough to continue the absurd spy spoofery while taking an honest look at cancer too.After a stressful serious of fakeouts you need to experience for yourself, this episode ends with Archer???s cancer intact and spreading to his lymph nodes. This leads to the next stage of grief in the ???Placebo Effect???: rampage. Or as Archer puts it: ???RAAAAMMMPPPPAAAAAGE!???As the episode begins, Archer is in the middle of treatment but improbably looks and feels fine. Krieger (who, it turns out, can do legit science in addition to creating hybrid pig boys) finds that Archer???s cancer drugs are ???basically candy corn and Zima.??? So Archer needs to find out who???s stealing cancer drugs, and he swears vengeance:MALORY: You???re not well. What are you going to do?ARCHER: Cry havoc and let slip the hogs of war.LANA: Dogs of war.ARCHER: Whatever farm animal of war, Lana. Shut up.As part of his rampage, Archer gets ahold of his actual drugs, and we soon see him with a bandana to cover up the loss of his ???fifth best feature??? ??? plus an IV he carries around while shooting preposterously stereotypical Irish mobsters in the knee or face. The rampage is alternated with scenes of Archer bonding with another cancer patient: an older, Regis-loving woman named Ruth. While Archer jokes he???s hanging around just to ???bang a candy striper??? it???s obvious he cares about Ruth, and she???s half the reason for the rampage, since she needs the real drugs too. It???s goddamn impressive how many layers these episodes give a character who started as nothing beyond ???Bond with mommy issues.??? Even better, the depth builds on the caricature without contradicting it: poor Ruth isn???t just a fellow cancer patient; she???s the kind of sweet, non-monstrous woman who Archer didn???t get as a mother.Archer???s cancer does go into remission ??? this is a comedy, duh ??? but the way the show got there was an emotionally right-on fantasy I wish everyone with this fucking disease could experience. If you have cancer, you deserve one last shot at drunken sex with a long-term love interest. You deserve to go on a Vegas bender, then blame your shenanigans on Chet Manley. You deserve to terrorize the Irish mob. And you deserve a rampage and a cure.???Baby Come Back??? by Player (1977)- Spending all night/money going out on the town: $35/",100

AwfLine was created with one simple goal in mind: Help people connect without relying on apps.AwfLine is a mobile application that pairs single people together based on their shared distaste for dating apps. It was developed in response to the growing number of online dating services that focus on technology rather than real romantic chemistry.Unlike dating apps, AwfLine is a program that can be downloaded and stored as an icon on your mobile phone. From your phone, the program then allows you to link with other people who have the same program. That way, you can ensure that you???re only connecting with other people who would also never use an app to find their significant other.In recent years, dating apps have removed all the mystery, enchantment, and excitement from courtship. And while most people have embraced these new methods for finding potential partners, there are still those out there wishing to pursue more traditional relationship paths. Now, with AwfLine, those hopeless romantics may finally find love without succumbing to the fickle nature of apps.To achieve this, our engineers developed a complex algorithm for matching users based on how much they don???t want to be matched through an algorithm. Technology is at the core of our platform, which allows us to focus on what???s really important: the connection between human beings. Because, unlike Tinder, we???re not interested in promoting a ???swipe"" culture that hinges on superficial decisions designed to instantly gratify.Instead of ???swiping,??? we use a proprietary feature called ???flipping,"" named after the flipping motion that users make with their thumbs on phone screens. As soon as someone logs into AwfLine, they can activate the ???flipping??? feature which pulls up photos of other AwfLine accounts. They may then either tap the screen to move to the next photo, or ???flip??? the photo off the screen to indicate that they are interested. If two users mutually ???flip??? each other off, then they have an opportunity to message privately and make a real connection in person.AwfLine is the only matchmaking service for men and women who don???t want to use matchmaking services. We understand that there are any number of reasons why one might not want to use an online dating site. Maybe they feel it???s too impersonal. Or perhaps they aren???t comfortable allowing strangers to access their personal information and photos. Whatever the reason may be, the world of online dating is no longer a place made exclusively for online daters.Registration with AwfLine is easy. You merely link your Facebook account, create a profile, upload pictures of yourself, add a geotag of your location, answer a series of questions that will help determine your personality type, scan your thumbprint using a scanner or smartphone camera, complete a short written exam, mail us a copy of your social security card, unlink your Facebook account, then relink it, and voila! You now have access to a vast network of individuals who???like you???don???t have the energy or desire to suffer through the hassle of online dating. It???s that simple.If this sounds like something you would be interested in, we hope that you???ll sign up for our free 30-day trial period. Together we can prove that true love is not dead, and???with the help of AwfLine???it can be discovered without the crutch of dating apps.Don???t wait.

Are couples arguing around you? Did you drive two hours to get here and they don???t even have the fucking bed you want? You might be in an IKEA.What you can do: Unfortunately, IKEA has very few exits. Once you???ve entered IKEA, it is very difficult to leave without having redesigned your guest room and initiated divorce proceedings. The first step is to put down the throw pillows you are holding. You don???t need any more fucking pillows, especially in tweed. Next, abort your attempt at finding an employee to assist you. The employees are all watching you from behind the one-way window in the break room and laughing at how helpless you look. Finally, if you are with your spouse, don???t speak to each other. Save all your energy for your escape. IKEA pipes in subliminal rage-inducing bio-feedback behind their music, which cause innocent comments to take on passive aggressive tendencies and make you want to discuss hypothetical children in public.Are you jogging?Are you jarring your body up and down and breathing heavily? Are your lungs and thighs burning? Do you taste blood? Are you wearing spandex? If so, you might be jogging. Jogging is a terrible condition that affects thousands of people every year. Jogging is contagious. If you see someone jogging in your neighborhood, be sure to look away immediately, even if it means taking your eyes off the road while driving.What you can do: If you or someone you know is found jogging, you should follow these steps to protect yourself and your family.Stop jogging. This is easier said than done. Even after the initial decision to stop jogging is made, the body will continue to move in an up and down fashion involuntarily for some time. If thirty minutes go by and the jogging is still occurring, it may be necessary to punch the jogger in the stomach. If this fails, you will have to knock the jogger unconscious.Remove spandex. If the spandex seems to be wedged into place, removal may require a professional. In some cases, scissors may be used, but only with extreme caution. Red marks left by spandex will fade with time, but may never disappear completely.Drink alcohol. Alcohol is an excellent jogging deterrent. If no alcohol is available, soda may suffice. Do not provide Red Bull or Gatorade. This will only encourage the jogger.Are you drinking decaf?Is your coffee drink giving you a warm cozy feeling instead of jolting your brain awake while simultaneously giving you the urge to defecate?If so, you might be drinking decaf.What you can do: Take note of your surroundings. Are you in a coffee shop? If so, simply return to the counter and pour your coffee out slowly on the countertop, all while making eye contact with the barista. Then spit in the coffee cup and throw it behind the counter. This is how the barista will know that they accidentally gave you decaf.Are you looking at a motivational poster?Do you see a picture of a cavernous forest or a pile of anonymous hands stacked on top of one another in synchronicity? Is there a word printed along the bottom like TEAMWORK or SUCCESS? If so, you may be looking at a motivational poster. These are commonly found in office settings with low morale as a last ditch attempt to make the people working there work harder and not feel like they???re wasting their lives. But you can see through all that, can???t you? Good for you.What you can do: You should probably quit your job immediately without any notice or leads, and be sure to make a big scene and get escorted out by security.Are you driving through Florida?Why? Why would you do that to yourself?What you can do: If you are driving through Florida, make sure your car is pointed North and keep driving. Do not stop your car or attempt to get out until you are no longer in Florida.Are you camping?Are you sleeping outside, leaving ",100
441,"yourself vulnerable to god-knows-what in the middle of the fucking woods? Do you keep reaching for the remote control only to wind up with with a handful of twigs and dirt? Did you go to the bathroom outside recently? If so, you might be camping. This can be very troubling, but is not irrevocable.What you can do: The best way to escape from a camping trip is to fall from a great height. Luckily, lots of camping sites are near cliffs or steep mountainsides, which can make such a fall accessible. If falling from a height does not seem possible, you could allow yourself to be mauled by a possibly rabid animal, necessitating an urgent trip to a hospital, i.e., CIVILIZATION. You can make yourself attractive to wild animals by rubbing raw meat on your naked body, appearing wounded while laying in a clearing, and menstruating.Are you within earshot of teenagers having a conversation?Are you overhearing a conversation between teenagers? Are you having trouble understanding the vernacular and pop culture references? Are expressions like ???YOLO??? and ???BAE??? making you feel hopeless about the future of society and the planet? If so, you may be listening to teenagers, and you are not alone. Lots of people experience trauma from observing teenagers every day.What you can do: Do not confront the teenagers. They will make fun of you. You???ve resigned to the aging process and your body is hairy and sagging in places that they will find amusing. Remember: Teenagers have no moral center, so they will not think twice about belittling your life path and stealing your car.Is your Wi-Fi down?Are you attempting to check your email, only to be told that your browser cannot connect to the internet? Are no new stories appearing on your Facebook feed? If so, you may have a weak or nonexistent internet connection. This means you are completely cut off from society and will likely die alone. There is no hope for you.What you can do: You should find out the hours of the caf?? with Wi-Fi down the street. Oh, but wait, you can???t because you have no internet. You are truly helpless. So just give up already.TroopsNoun.

442," This one was probably just a joke.- -Our crack team of aspiring high school-aged music journalists ??? for this interview, Avery Panganiban, Ryan Wangman, Makele Clemmons, and Imaan Yousuf ??? met with Protomartyr on Saturday afternoon, just as the festival was being evacuated for a torrential downpour. These creative writing students channeled their musical knowledge and interviewing skills during the following Q&A with the band, talking tie-dye, pep, and accidentally wearing all black on a summer day.- -826 CHICAGO: To start off, can you each tell us what;s your name and what you play in the band?JOE CASEY: Sure, I???m Joe and I sing.ALEX LEONARD: I???m Alex and I play drums.GREG AHEE: I???m Greg, I play guitar.SCOTT DAVIDSON: I???m Scott, I play bass.826 CHICAGO: So, um, what???s the story behind your name, Protomartyr?J. CASEY: I saw it in a book once and I thought that sounded really cool. So I thought if I ever had a band it would be one of the names I would use.826 CHICAGO: Does it mean anything?J. CASEY: It???s whoever???s the first person to die for a cause. Whether it???s religion or politics or something, they call them a ???protomartyr.???826 CHICAGO: So you guys are from Detroit, so I wanted to ask how the influences of the big Detroit bands from the 60s and 70s, like the Stooges, and the MC5, and the White Stripes??? kind of??? if they???ve affected your music at all?G. AHEE: I would say the Stooges for sure, especially like Iggy Pop when he started making solo records. He made a few phenomenal records. That???s definitely a big influence.  Not so much, some of the more garage-y stuff. Maybe, at least not directly in sound, but maybe the spirit of it might???ve influenced us.826 CHICAGO: Yeah, there???s kind of a biting aspect to your music that???s kind of there too.  And also, a lot of people compare your work to the British post-punk artists, you know. Kind of Joy Division, such and such. Can I ask you guys how you feel about those comparisons?J. CASEY: Um, some of them are good, some of them are OK, and some of them are more bad, but I understand why people will say ???you sound like this.??? It???s just to understand it better. Like, I like The Fall, I don???t think we sound like Joy Division but maybe we do, I don???t know.826 CHICAGO: So what genre would you place yourself in?J. CASEY: Um, people say post-punk.  We don???t, we don???t really think of it at all. We don???t really think of that.826 CHICAGO: So is there a reason behind you all wearing black onstage, even though it???s very hot outside?J. CASEY: Well, we heard if you sweat, if you???re wearing a white shirt or gray it comes through. If you wear black you can???t see.A. LEONARD: I don???t think we???ve ever all worn black before today.J. CASEY: Yea, it???s weird. But I think we all knew that we were going to sweat a lot, so we don???t usually all dress in black but ??? we???re a dark band!826 CHICAGO: You sure you guys don???t want to take your music in a peppier direction? You think that might earn you a couple more points on Pitchfork?G. AHEE: That???s what it???s all about, getting more points on Pitchfork, it???s why we do this.A. LEONARD: Yeah, next time we???ll be in tie-dye and like, headbands, and be like, really peppy.826 CHICAGO: Yeah, how do you feel, like in that vein, how do you feel your music clashes with, like, these summer festivals where a lot of the music is very pop-y and fun and you guys are very, you know, angry.J. CASEY: Well, I???m not angry, but, uh, it???s funny. You know like, I feel kind of bad for people when we???re bumming them out sometimes.  But, I think some of it???s nice, right?A. LEONARD: Yeah I mean it???s not all angry, I think it???s nice.G. AHEE: Yeah, uh, maybe we???re just so angry we can???t see how angry it is.S. DAVIDSON: Agreed.826 CHICAGO: So Joe, why the suit? And do you wear that all the time for your shows?J. CASEY: Uh, I used to, I wasn???t going to wear it today but then it seemed not as hot as I thought it was. I don???t know why I wear it.  Because it???s got pockets, I like putting my hands in my pockets.826 CHICAGO: So how do you feel about the crowd and Pitchfork compared to other venues you???ve played at?A. LEONARD: I think it???s been good, everyone???s been liking???G. AHEE:  Yeah, the crowd has been nice. We shy away from crowds, but, uh, the crowds here have been nice.J. CASEY: It was nice to look out and see smiling faces, always good.G. AHEE: See, we???re not that angry!S. DAVIDSON: I love the crowd.826 CHICAGO: What are your favorite kind of venues to play at?J. CASEY: Well, we used to like playing small places because then they???d get packed up. Um, we used to play at a place in Detroit, but then it got too crowded, so that???s kind of sad. So we like bigger places. Not like, when it???s so big it???s a little overwhelming.G. AHEE: I???m excited to play Schubas tonight, that???s where we???re playing the after-show. I???ve never played there, hear it???s great.  Uh, we tend to like club shows.  Mid-level club shows where people don???t??? I tend to get claustrophobic, so when there???s a lot of people around I get uncomfortable, so if there???s a little bit of space.826 CHICAGO: Are you guys planning on taking your sound in any new direction anytime soon? Or are you sticking with??? kind of??? what exactly is going on with Protomartyr in that regard?G. AHEE: I don???t know if we consciously try to, like I think we???re doing??? our next record that is going to come out is going to do a lot of new stuff.  Because our first and second records are pretty different, the new one is going to, we like to try new things and be a little bit uncomfortable sometimes.  Because otherwise it gets boring, so I think we???ll continue to add in different things to the sound, or maybe just change it up completely.826 CHICAGO: OK, this is Elliott signing off ??? any last comments about the festival?G. AHEE: Uh, it???s raining, pouring!J. CASEY: Bring a poncho to Pitchfork.826 CHICAGO: There you have it!Baby JesusThis is the most popular of all of the Jesuses.  This is the Jesus depicted by painters and sculptors in the standard manger scene ??? or ???cr??che??? as it were.  He is innocence incarnate ??? like a dozen white baby seals playing with a half a dozen soft fuzzy kittens, all of which are befuddled and bemused by a Roomba.  This Jesus is so adorable and is usually depicted with ruddy cheeks, smiling eyes, a cute button nose, and arms outstretched as if to say, ???I am here to heal the world and bring tranquility to all the lands??? or ???Bring me some gold, frankincense and myrrh.???  Or both.Toddler JesusToddler Jesus spent his years in Egypt hoping to remain anonymous so he could avoid King Herod.  Since we know that Jesus of Nazareth was a Caucasian, he was able to do this with ease.  Toddler Jesus learned to walk in the inflatable pool that Joseph built for him; Toddler Jesus loved building things with Legos and once Mary almost got upset when she went to the rest room in the middle of the night and stepped on a Lego piece in her bare feet.  But she didn???t get upset and nor did she curse. She just smiled and shook her head amusedly.  Toddler Jesus loved fish sticks and whenever Mary ran out of them Toddler Jesus always made more so Mary wouldn???t have to run to the grocery store.Touchdown JesusObviously when he grew up and scored in the top 10 percentile on the SATs, Jesus went to Notre Dame and played football.  He scored so many touchdowns that they built a mosaic of him and called it ???Touchdown Jesus.???  Replicas of this Jesus are available at the Notre Dame Bookstore.  He majored in English and wrote parable",100
443,"s for his senior thesis, many of which were later published.  When talking about this Jesus to alumni of other universities, you might be asked if Jesus looks on them less favorably than he does with other people. The answer to this question is invariably ???yes???.Jesus Christ SuperstarThis is a 1970 rock opera with music by Andrew Lloyd Webber and lyrics by Tim Rice.   It opened on Broadway on October 12, 1971 and tells the story, through irresistible music and compelling lyrics, of the last week or so of Jesus???s life.  Teenagers who didn???t know from Jesus, opera, or oratorios liked the beat, the hard rock sounds, and the singing and bought the album, as did parents who felt that the record offered a chance to understand some aspects of this youth culture around them, and especially its music ??? and so did some more forward-thinking clergy and theologians, who saw any opportunity to spread the word about Jesus where it had not previously been.Adult JesusThis is the Jesus you see in most old fashioned paintings, the Jesus with the flowy white robe and a red velvet sash and flowy hair like Dave Grohl from the Foo Fighters.  This Jesus is common on bumper stickers, window clings, rear view mirror air fresheners, sleeveless shirts and general gun show accoutrements.   Here we see the development and fulfillment of Jesus???s most salient characteristics:  selflessness, mercy, forgiveness and generosity.  This is the Jesus who walked the earth, befriended the downtrodden and now serves as a role model to so many.bejesusAn exclamatory expression used to express extreme surprise mixed with fear and a tinge of displeasure as in, ???We were hiking in Yellowstone National Park when a bear popped out of the woods and scared the bejesus out of me.???  Also used to express some sense of what composes the self, like ???I had atomic Buffalo chicken wings the other night and when I took a shit this morning it burned the bejesus out of my butt.??????Personal Jesus???This is the first single off Depeche Mode???s Violator album.  It reached No. 28 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 in 1989.   While open to interpretation, I consider it an indictment of televangelists, who found their reputations smudged and besmirched with some frequency in the late ???80s.  Johnny Cash recorded a cover of this song in 2002 for his album American IV.Jesus MonteroThis Jesus is a Venezuelan baseball player who plays catcher and designated hitter for the Seattle Mariners organization.  He played most of 2014 playing for the Everett AquaSox, the Mariners??? single A affiliate team.???Jesus, Take the Wheel???This is a song recorded by American country music artist Carrie Underwood.  And when I say recorded, I mean, home girl sang the bejesus (See supra) out of this song.  It tells the story of a woman who was driving to Cincinnati to see her parents and she was reflecting on the stresses of her life when the car started spinning on a sheet of black ice so she invited to Jesus to take the wheel of the car and subsequently, her life.Jesus H. ChristThis is used in the vernacular, as an expletive.  When Catholic kids are little they invariably think it means Harold because in the ???Lord???s Prayer??? it says ???Our Father, who art in Heaven, Harold be thy name??????   Mark Twain makes reference to this term so it???s been around since the 19th century but no one is quite sure of its etymology.Although to be driven back upon oneself is an uneasy affair at best, rather like trying to cross a border with borrowed credentials, it seems to me now the one condition necessary to the beginnings of real self-respect. Most of our platitudes notwithstanding, self-deception remains the most difficult deception.??? Joan Didion, On Self-Respect- - -In my first column I wrote about my failure to put my money where my mouth was. Not long after that, I called a friend of mine and asked her to tell me about the new developments in socially responsible investing.During the year that I wrote this column, I started to educate myself. I met with SRI advisors, read books on personal finance for idiots, went through years of tax returns, all with the help of my partner. I used a magnifying glass to examine the fine print on my financial statements.I also decided to tell my father and sisters about this column. I worried my dad would see me as ungrateful or make fun of me for saying I wanted to pay more taxes. Only the second part came true. I feared telling my family would crimp my freewheelin??? style and I would no longer able to write things like ???farty fart fart fart.??? I guess I???m safe.And then one day I mentioned to my dad that I was thinking of leaving the family financial advisors and moving to a new firm. Instead of warning me I???d regret it, he said he was proud of me. And just like that, my biggest fear was gone.There has always been something that gives me an anxiety attack about the investment managers??? use of the word ???growth.??? It seems so dependent on people buying things, which means that things will always have to be made. The dumbest question I never asked was, ???what if we run out????I have stock in seven of the world???s ???too big to prosecute??? banks. One of the companies I???m invested in has a state-run plant in Pyongyang that churns out two billion cigarettes a year. One of the companies I???m invested in has overt and covert ties in Iran. One, an insurance company, was sued for delaying payouts to the families of fallen American soldiers.Joan Didion wrote in her essay that people with self-respect, ???have the courage of their choices. They know the price of things.??? Part of the way I understand this is that no one can tell anyone else what they feel. Someone may really believe in those cigarettes from North Korea. If they decide that???s not working for them one day, it will happen through their own chain of cause and effect, their own moment of reckoning. Self-respect is what Didion calls a ???private reconciliation.???Last week I told my family???s trusted advisors I was moving to a sustainable and impact investing firm. I???ll begin the long, slow process of moving into companies that are not motivated solely by profit, but have what are called double or triple bottom lines.Back in the spring during a meeting with SRI advisors, I started crying. I felt the weight of twenty years lift off me for a moment.  It was only then how heavily my conscience had been weighing on me. I cried because I was relieved, but there was sadness, too, for what it had cost me to wait for so long.Milton Friedman said, ???There is one and only one social responsibility of business ??? to increase its profits.""I can???t live with that anymore.DURING SEXPARTNER #1: ???If you seek a pleasant peninsula, look about you???

(NH)My husband and I traveled to the Amazon to the home of a shaman that had helped our friends Tricia and Greg conceive. We were kind of scared but we really wanted a baby. When we got to the shaman???s cottage he was wearing a burlap mask with eyeholes. Right",100
444," away he told Darren and me to take off our clothes.Darren was like, ???Hang on a sec, I thought we were going to light candles and chant.???The shaman asked if we were nervous. ???Yes!??? we said, laughing.Darren grabbed my hand and winked. ""I love you,??? he whispered. I told him he was my rock.The shaman gave us a bowl of dog teeth and encouraged us to relax, then gestured to some floor cushions around the cauldron. ???Have some tea,??? he said, filling our Klean Kanteens with a ladle.We stayed high for about six days. Darren saw his father, who passed away in 2011. I met a water spirit who finally convinced me to get off gluten.By day three everyone was crying pretty hard and the shaman admitted he???d never done ayahuasca before. Apparently he was actually a farmer from northeast Brazil. ???I had to take a second job,??? he said, pulling off the mask. ???My soybeans are dying. Soon my family will starve.???Ten months later I had a healthy baby boy! We named him Mason Brax.??? JessieMatsen87- -Our church was having a tent revival when this older woman in the congregation, Sister Phyllis, pulled me into the menstruation hut. ???I heard you???re trying to have a baby,??? she said. I nodded and told her we???d been praying every night. ???OK but you???ve got to use sperm,??? she said, glancing over her shoulder. ???Human sperm, it???s the only way.???I almost laughed, until I noticed she was serious. ???But Father Cody says touching sperm contaminates our earthly vessels.???She put a finger to my lips. ???Sperm,??? she said.???Sperm,??? I repeated.We grabbed hands and bowed our heads when the thatch door opened and Sister Jacqueline came in to see who needed hosing. ???Blessed be the Lord thy God!??? we all chanted. ???Father God, Alleluia!?????? lovemybrayleegirl_1- -After TTC for three years plus two surgeries, my acupuncturist asked to meet my partner, Cal. I picked up Cal from work and we drove to the clinic, but after walking through the door he said he wanted to go.???But we???re already here!??? I cried. ???Why are you always breaking promises???????Me breaking promises???? Cal yelled. ???What about that time you forgot to pick me up from the airport???????You know what???? I said. ???My grandmother had just died, so fuck you, you fucking son of a bitch.???Just then Susan opened the door of the waiting room to tell us we could remove our shoes and enter the healing chamber. ???How many healthy fetuses do you want to grow???? she asked.

The oldest, Donny, was seventeen. He had this habit of creeping into our room at night???sometimes he was sleepwalking, other times, just watching. One day I caught him rubbing his genitals on the stove and I got to thinking: didn???t something about Donny seem strange?I decided to do some digging. With the help of a neighbor I soon discovered that ???Donny??? was really a 37-year-old man, a psychology professor named Gary Dupree who???d been laid off by the University of Kentucky. When my husband and I confronted him, he pulled out a contract. ???I???m writing a book about my time here,??? he said. ???You already signed the release forms.??????We thought those were adoption papers,??? my husband said. ???Now get out of here before I tear your goddamn nuts off.???At family court the following Tuesday, a lady in line for a divorce suggested the fertility drug Clomid. ???And chiropractic adjustments!??? she said. ???Those will help, too.??? The court ruled that Donny/Gary Dupree could stay in our home unless my husband and I paid out $10,000 for breach of contract.???My family doesn???t have that kind of money,??? my husband said.???Then I guess you???ll be taking your son home today,??? the judge answered.A few months later we found out we were pregnant???with twins!??? mamagretchen34- -Green tea and organic lube!!??? Marlena0826Hello, my good people. I would first like to thank you all for gathering here at the town well to hear me, your mayor, speak today. By now you have realized that I???m stuck in this well.Right off the bat, I would like to clarify that I have not called you all here to help me. As a leader, I???m expected to find solutions to difficult problems, and to think strategically in times of trouble, and that is why I???m going to find a way out of this well. I???ll touch on this more later, but for now, there???s several things I???d like to address.First and foremost, I???d like to respond to the allegations by the local media that I???m a ???liar.??? Yes, it is true that over the course of the two weeks that I???ve been trapped in the big well, the press has been told by my team that I???ve been on ???vacation,??? and since the press??? discovery that I???ve been stuck down here in the town well, the headlines have been particularly harsh. The newspapers have accused me of being ???embarrassed??? to admit that I fell in the well. My friends, this could not be further from the truth. When I became your mayor, I prepared myself for some hardships and some challenges, as any mayor does. I am certainly not ???embarrassed??? when I have to face them. I???m not ???embarrassed??? when I???m faced with difficult budgetary decisions that affect the entire town; I???m not ???embarrassed??? that I have to make certain decisions regarding law enforcement in order to keep our town safe; I???m not embarrassed that I fell into a big well and got stuck in there.I understand there are a lot of you out there who look down on me in light of my falling into the town well. Once again, the press has been extremely critical, urging the townspeople to ask themselves: how effective can a man who fell into a well and got stuck be as a leader, when no one else in the history of the town has ever fallen into the well, not even children? To those of you who have this concern, I???d like to say several things: I have been a strong and effective leader since being elected. Violent crime has dropped, development is coming along nicely, and I think we???re doing great things for the youth. So, those are some statistics for you to think about, instead of thinking about how I fell into this well.Can you all hear me up there above-ground? It???s hard to tell from down here, in the town well. Please make some noise if you can hear me.Thank you.Now, several of you have insisted that I explain exactly how I made the mistake of falling and getting stuck in a well. Once again, the word ???embarrassed??? is being thrown around quite liberally. I???d like to address these matters now: I promise that, once I???m out of the well, I???m going to have it closed shut, so that this doesn???t happen again. Not to myself, and not to anyone else. So, I believe that should put this matter to bed.Inexplicably, a vast majority of you have called for my resignation. I have read the petition, which says many things about how you???re ???scared??? to be living in a town run by a mayor who is so prone to falling in wells. I of course have many thoughts on this. The first thing I???d like to say is that there is absolutely nothing to fear. Please reconsider those statistics I cited previously. Those statistics don???t cease to exist just because I fell in a well. If anyone should be scared, it???s myself??? I am the one stuck in a well. My resignation would do nothing of benefit for the town. Anyone who follows what I am doing in office knows that I am currently in the middle of some big initiatives that",100
445," show a lot of promise, and for me to abandon them and hand them off to someone else who has not been working so close to them from the start would be dangerous. These are projects that I need to see through. I just need time. That is the real matter here: time. I urge you to be patient. Just give me time to get out of this well and get back to work on my projects.As I???ve said, I do not intend to call upon the help of the town in getting out of the well. I have spoken publicly about my distaste for the gratuitous misuse of resources, and it would of course be foolish for me to expect the good people of our fire department to waste their precious time rescuing me from the well, when of course I???m able to rescue myself. While I have gotten some very good work down down here in the well in the two weeks I???ve been stuck, it is time for me to return to above-ground, where I can work alongside my team more closely and effectively in order to run this city to its full potential.In the coming weeks, I will be working tirelessly around the clock in order to figure out how exactly I???m going to get out of the well. I intend to have a concrete plan before the end of the month, and I will of course be sharing it with the town as soon as it???s ready to be unveiled. I have always been a perfectly candid leader, and I don???t intend to elude anyone here. I think I proved that tonight.I know that this has been a hard time for the town, and it has for me as well. I intend to use this experience as a demonstration??? to demonstrate to all of you what I am capable of. And I???ll tell you one last thing: I know that whatever I???m capable of, you???re all capable, because after all, I???m just like any one of you. I???m going to find a way out of this well, and I hope we???ll all see this incident as a testament to the strength of our town. I can get out of an open wall after accidentally falling into it, and so can you, and so can your children and your children???s children.Thank you all very much, and good evening.Dear financially independent recent grad,You inspire and shame me with your financial autonomy. The Internet, which must know that your parents do not pay for your phone bill, should reward you for your 4G independence.I hope you post throwback photos on Wednesdays with no social media pushback. I hope Taylor Swift gives you random, wise advice on Tumblr, and that you never forget to cancel your Amazon Prime free trial before they charge you for the whole year. I even hope you use the Hefe filter for an Instagram of an old barn outside of Austin with the caption ???#NoFilter??? and get away with it???you deserve it.You deserve so much. Maybe you don???t come from a middle-class background that allows for privileged millennial dependency. Maybe you majored in something practical in college like accounting or computer programming (but if you started a lucrative porn site that further promotes and fetishizes the patriarchy, I???m excluding you from this letter). Maybe you even went to a liberal arts school and majored in film studies or creative writing but you gave up on your dreams just in time to pay your first phone bill.Perhaps you don???t even have a smartphone because they are too expensive. (How expensive? Don???t ask me.) If you are in fact a dumbphone user, I hope it is not the sliding kind???or worse, the touch-screen kind that gives the mere illusion of Internet access.Let it be a flip phone.Let the satisfying, resounding click that your flip phone makes as you end each tele-conversation sound like a door closing on your adolescent parasitism. I hope the smallness of your phone in your pocket leaves room for layers upon layers of dollar bills.But most of all, I hope you revel in this flip phone???s durability???that you literally throw it into the air, over the heads of your friends who are living below the taxable income, above the dining room router that you???re not taking advantage of, right up next to the ceiling where your financial stability and moral superiority rightfully reside.In awe,JennaP.S.

Hearken! and observe how healthily ??? how calmly I can tell you the whole story???After months of pre-natal yoga, shopping for eco-conscious baby gear, and decorating the nursery in a shade of green thought to promote infant creativity, we were ready. Marissa???s water broke, and twelve gruesome hours later we welcomed a healthy boy named Oliver into this beautiful world.I had but one thought: I had to take The Photo. Marissa, illuminated with the glow of motherhood, holding tiny Ollie. It was like the Madonna and Child, only slightly more religious.At first, I suspected the Valencia filter, with its yellow gleam, might perfectly complement Oliver???s adorable ruddiness. But then I thought, You know what? No filter. And this, in fact, became the crown jewel on the top of my caption. ???#AndJustLikeThat #WelcomeOliver #NoFilter.???I showed my phone to Marissa.???Oh, it???s perfect,??? she said. ??????Gram it!???I pressed ???Share,??? unbearably moved by the thought that this precious, intimate moment would soon be delivered to my entire network.The nurse laid Oliver down to sleep in a little bassinet by the window. I was so consumed in tending to Marissa, that it wasn???t until she???d fallen asleep, and over two hours had passed, that I remembered to check the ol??? Insta. I felt a quiver of anticipation. My Niagara Falls sunset had gotten 67 likes. What would Oliver get?I opened the app and saw, in the lower right hand corner, a little heart.And next to it, the preposterous number ???3.???I assumed it hadn???t refreshed. The hospital had spotty Wi-Fi, after all. I went to settings, clicked off Wi-Fi and refreshed using my data plan.Still only three likes???.My heart began to pound. Should I have used the Valencia?I tapped to see the identities of the three likers:- Toddzilla71, a co-worker notorious for doling out likes indiscriminately. A glitch had once caused me to post the same photo twice. Todd had liked both.- Books_not_Boys, the woman I???d briefly dated before Marissa. What did her like mean? She???d left a comment. It was the stone head emoji from Easter Island. I frowned, puzzled.- The final ???like??? was from a bluegrass band I???d never heard of named And Just Like That. The jackals had obviously come for the hashtag.I was sweating now.But wait! Not even my own mother had ???liked??? it? I nearly laughed in relief. Something was up. There was no way my mother wouldn???t ???like??? the first photo of her grandchild. I called her in Michigan.After some pleasantries, I cut to the chase.???Oh no!??? she said. ???I tried to download the update but it froze. I???m going to my class at the ",100
446,"Apple Store later ??? they???ll help me. But I can???t wait to meet Oliver next week!???I hung up, still unsatisfied.I opened Instagram, and clicked ???activity.???The Instagram universe was bustling. Clearly, this was peak ???gramming hours. People had just gotten out of work, and were jonesing for pure, unadulterated time with their phones, not just the hungry kisses, stolen in momentary increments throughout the day.Then, I saw something that shocked me to my core.Among the names, I saw that Barbara47 ??? my mother ??? had liked 5 photos in the last 26 minutes. And just 17 seconds ago she???d posted??? a selfie.Frantic, I looked at Marissa. And a chill ran down my spine. She had been on her phone before she???d fallen asleep. But even she hadn???t liked the photo. I shook her awake.???Honey???????Sweetheart, what???s wrong? You???re very pale.??????Did you see the photo I posted of you and Oliver???????Yes, I told you. It???s perfect.??????Then why in god???s name didn???t you ???like??? it???????Silly,??? said Marissa. ???I was waiting until it reached eleven ???likes.??? Otherwise people would see that I ???liked??? it.??????But darling, this is a catch-22. At this rate, we may never reach eleven ???likes.?????????Wait,??? Marissa asked, with a furrowing brow. ???How many ???likes??? does it have right now????I gulped. ???Right now???? Three?????????Three total????I nodded.We shared a look of terror.???Check it again,??? Marissa said, her voice hard as nails.I did. Still three.I looked out the window at the blood red sunset. The Easter Island head? Mother???s lies? What did it all mean????Should I delete it???? I asked. ???And take a new one? A different caption, maybe? No, that???s pathetic. What kind of father am I going to be if I can???t even post a good photo? This is the beginning of a lifetime of humiliation for this poor child.??????No,??? Marissa said. ???It???s me. I look terrible ??? that???s why no one liked it. Crop me out, David, I???m a monster!??????Stop. You look beautiful!??? I said.Did Marissa look beautiful? I wondered. Yeah. Pretty, certainly. Would it be too cruel to leave her so soon after she???d given birth to our child? What could one loser do to help another loser? Should we cut our losses?No, no, that wasn???t the solution. It wasn???t her??? she had just given birth, for god???s sake. Surely my followers weren???t expecting Beyonc?? at the Grammy???s.???But if it isn???t me?????? Marissa said.A pregnant pause filled the maternity ward. We looked over at our sleeping son. He was delicious??? wasn???t he? Well, newborn babies aren???t exactly what you think of when you think of babies, actually. Newborns have hardly developed yet. One second ago they were floating inside a womb! What did these people want? This was a human being we had made. Willed into being from thin air. Wasn???t that enough for these sadists?  Enough for a like or two? A paltry click?!???David,??? Marissa said. ???Are you thinking??? what I???m thinking???????I can???t breathe,??? I gasped. ???We???ve got to get out of here.???Together, we crept to the elevator.We waited for what felt like an eternity, got in, and Marissa furtively pressed ???L.??? We were silent as the elevator descended. The doors opened with a ping. We walked out of the hospital, free to go. No one gave us so much as a second glance.Just as we exited onto the street, I felt a vibration on my thigh, and instantly began salivating. It was a tremor that I had grown to crave, to imagine in my dreams ??? the one that meant, ???Someone out there likes me.??? Someone, somewhere, had heeded my pitiful cry. They hadn???t left me screaming into the dark abyss. Their click said: ???I see your smoke signal; you are not alone. You have asked for love. Dry your tears, child, because here, I give you: my heart.??????I checked my phone.Five new ???likes??? had trickled in. That made eight. If Marissa gave in and ???liked??? it, nine. Then if I ???liked??? it ??? it would be disgraceful, of course, for a time ??? both our names appearing there, like Scarlet Letters. But what great endeavor did not have its beginnings in awful, repugnant shame? And mother, she would come around. She had to. Then we???d be off to the races.Marissa and I stared at each other. We raced up the stairs, taking them three at a time, and barreled back into the room. There, we embraced our beautiful son and welcomed him into this sick, sick world.BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS ??? May Mallard, mother of eight, was killed in a hit and run at around five this morning. An early riser, Mallard was following her usual morning routine, going for a swim at the indoor pool at her local community center, when she was run down while crossing the highway which she used as a shortcut. The narrow highway crossing was illegal, but Mallard was known to use it all the time. There have been local radio reports telling drivers to watch out in the early mornings, as a 76-year-old lady continued, despite fines (unpaid) to cross at the same spot every morning.Michael, an attendant at the community center called the police at five-thirty sharp, telling them they should check the highway. ???Mrs. Mallard never missed her constitutional swim,??? he told police. Though dubious, a traffic cop ??? apparently unaware of the local knowledge of Mallard???s morning movements ??? was told to be on the lookout and soon found the body of Mallard. The policeman, a young man, was overheard saying ???I never want to see anything that smooshed again.???Mallard, known by her neighbors and friends as Mrs. Mallard despite the fact that Mr. Mallard left her right after their children were born, was famous for being one of the rare survivors of the birth of octuplets. An anonymous artist erected a monument in her honor in the Boston Public Garden during the ???70s. Though the monument wasn???t authorized by the city, a petition gained thousands of signatures and the Parks and Recreation Department decided to leave the monument intact. It depicts Mallard and her eight identical sons ??? Jack, Kack, Lack, Mack, Nack, Ouack, Pack, and Quack ??? gathered around her, clinging to her dress. An inscription at the base of the statue reads: ???Mother and Sons.???When Mallard herself was asked about the monument when it was first erected, her sons were all toddlers, and she was said by the newspaper reporter at the time to have been ???so incoherent over the telephone that one simply couldn???t understand her gabbing.??? When Mallard heard this remark, she penned a letter to the editor of that newspaper. Though the paper had to excise many of her swear words, the letter became infamous and was used by second-wave feminists who believed in motherhood not being a shackle of the patriarchy but rather a personal woman???s choice.Rather against her will, according to her sons, Mallard was made to be a figure of feminist pride. The octuplets were included in a documentary film made about unconventional siblings, and in the film, Ouack said, ???Mom never wanted anything but to make sure we didn???t dress the same. She hated that.??? Jack continued, ???She hated being put up as a pillar of feminist pride, too. She didn???t mind the statue, but in that letter she sent to that editor when we were kids?????? Pack finished his sentence: ??????she wrote something like ???you try pushing a fucking litter out of your vagina and then needing to take care of all of them while your asshole of a husband runs off because he???s scared of having so many kids??? and that was it.??? Mack added, ???Plus, we were little brats. If we weren???t made so famous with that monument?????? ??????she probably would have strangle",100
447,"d at least a few of us,??? Nack finished.Mallard ran a daycare in her home for many years, raising her own sons beside other people???s children, since it was the only way she could make money while also taking care of her children. Once they got older, she continued the daycare, but marketed it using her slight fame as an octo-mom and only took in children of the wealthy, in classes of eight. She retired in her early sixties and led a quiet life up until her untimely death. Her sons plan to perform a funeral procession through Boston Public Gardens before driving to Mount Auburn Cemetery where she will be interred.""1.	Compliment her.2.

Now this baby we???ve labored over is out and it???s time to party!That???s why we???re hosting an all-male, all-white panel tomorrow at Lily White Books in Mansfield, SC, to celebrate the anthology???s release and your contributions to it. We???d love it if some of you could come be part of the panel!Given the twelve-hour notice, however, along with our inability to compensate you in any way, and our unwillingness to compensate you even if we could, I completely understand that most of you ??? including all our woefully underrepresented contributors who do not identify as heterosexual white men ??? will not be able to participate in this seminal event, except perhaps as late-arriving, paying audience members ($5 at the door).Your practically guaranteed disinclination to participate is a shame, because, as the literary gatekeepers for this region, we???re trying to give you a once-in-a-lifetime, breakthrough-level opportunity here.But since by design you won???t be able to respond in a timely manner, worry not: We???ve already filled the five available panel slots with cutting-edge, straight Caucasian male novelists.  They agreed to this several weeks ago, actually, when we were all shooting the shit, chowing down on some barbecue and guzzling bourbon at one of Richard???s monthly cookouts, and the idea for a panel came up. We figured what the hell, let???s do this thing! So just know you???re in good hands. We trust these guys will do a wonderful job representing your experiences whether you can make it or not.As the panel chair, it is my mission to build a diverse program that welcomes and celebrates multiple perspectives. That???s why I???ve put this group of white men together. Heterogeneous in so much more than the sexual sense, these fine fellows hail from all walks of life, from counties far and wide: Some are from the country, while others are from the city. Some are academic intellectuals, while others are blue-collar workers. Some are functioning alcoholics, while others are raging alcoholics.You see, the diversity of this panel will be something to behold. I???ve even worked tirelessly to ensure that at least one panelist is not a belligerent womanizer.Look, I understand some of you in the anthology and/or folks from the disaffected politically correct masses at large will find something to critique about the supposed lack of representation on this panel, as though featuring a white neo-Confederate on the one extreme and a white fiscal conservative on the other was not diverse enough. As though featuring a white man with a soul patch alongside a white man with a disheveled beard was not diverse enough. As though featuring five white authors who have novels with cover images of junked pickup trucks in distinct, multifaceted states of rust and decay, set against background landscapes varied as fields and meadows and woodland edges, was not diverse enough.Sure, one author I???ve scheduled for the panel is an uninhibited misogynist, but I have balanced his worldview by also scheduling a no-frills, old-fashioned, keep-your-prejudices-in-your-pocket sexist. Scoff all you want, but know that I???m trying. With or without you ??? and I understand it will almost certainly be without ??? this is going to be an assemblage like none other, a grand celebration of the written word, an occasion in no way indicative of a problem that has beset the literary world for at least two millennia: White men, and only white men, pontificating at the very same conference table, pulling things from their asses beneath the very same roof, enlightening a rapt audience!Look, what more do you want? These privileged gentlemen of diverse Western European descent all have women and minor minority characters in their novels, okay? One even has a female protagonist, a complex and artfully manufactured woman whose sense of purpose and self-worth derives from the many white male characters she encounters, depends upon, and sleeps with throughout the story.And if that weren???t enough, these five down-home white guy novelists, who all happen to have contracts with major publishing houses, unabashedly and selflessly carry books by women on their nationwide book tours because they know that women writers depend on them. Criticize that, and I say you???re the one wanting to take away women???s voices by taking away the voices of their white heterosexual spokesmen. You???re the real bigot here.We hope to see you in a few hours! If you can make it, please remember to bring cash for the door and to purchase a copy of the anthology in which your work appears, which all the panelists w",100

Peterson, Co-EditorRusted, Lusted, Busted: Contemporary Southern FictionWe are gathered here today to mourn Ratchet as she is laid to rest between her mentors, Hot Mess and White Girl Wasted. It seems like just yesterday she became known as the only way to properly ridicule those who wore ill-fitting weave or subjected an entire megabus to Rihanna by way of cellphone speakers. She was, at her core, the very essence of revulsion.Other terms inspired me, but it was Ratchet who showed me how to truly influence a generation. When I visited her in those final days, she pulled me close and hoarsely whispered, ???People are tired of negative nancies like me and Negative Nancy. They???re ready for someone like you, On Fleek. Be the On Fleek you wish to see in the world.??? I will never forget her words, or her, as a word.Our good friend knew the end was near. Ratchet tweeted, ???Once you go mainstream, you turn back into a socket wrench,???  after a CNN anchor used her to describe a congressional budget negotiation. She wasn???t the first of us to be destroyed by an out-of-touch traditional media outlet, and she won???t be the last. Our thoughts and prayers go out to Dope, who has been hospitalized again, this time with a case of Being-an-Answer-on-Jeopardy. You???ve survived worse, buddy! You can beat this!This tragic death has made me consider my own mortality. How long before I go from the perfect adjective for a bedazzled big toe on Instagram to getting thrown around by political pundits complimenting one of Hillary Clinton???s aubergine pant suits? If it can happen to Da Bomb, it can happen to me. Until then, I will honor Ratchet???s memory by taking every available opportunity to check myself out???on the security monitors of bodegas that sell money orders.The dearly departed will be remembered as a titan of terminology. Even her funeral guest list is a who???s who of colloquialisms. She would be happy to see that both YOLO and Carpe Diem came to pay their respects, despite that public falling out last year. The same can be said for Swole and Buff. Even in death, she is bringing us together as a lexicon. It is in that spirit that I???d like to announce that Ratchet???s beautiful daughter, the pretentious hatemonger Ratch??, is going to be raised by her godparents, Mr. and Mrs. Basic Bitch.A future without Ratchet is an uncertain one. We do not know what phrase will fill the venomous 7-inch stilettos she leaves behind, or how we will ensure that women who venture outdoors in torn leggings are met with the appropriate amount of hostility. All we can know with any certainty is Throwing Shade, who is also in attendance, will never be the same.1. Carolina Colours2. Wolf Laurel3. Beverly Park4. Talia Wood5. Sienna West6.

I take off my glasses, make a little small talk, and then I say???Hey, so, I know this seems kind of weird or whatever, but can we turn the lights off here in your conference room? It???s daytime, so it???s still gonna be pretty light in here, but there???s a certain feeling I???m going for, and the fluorescents are kinda stepping on it. Great, thanks, okay, here we go. So the idea I want to pitch you today is basically about a SCREEEEEEEE PWWWAHNK! ???Something is out there!??? BOOOSH! CHUN??CHUN??CHUN??CHUN! ???Where???s Steven? What the hell is happening???? DUNT DUNT BUH BUH BUH! ???It won???t be long now.??? POOOOSHHH ???Carol! Help!???. Darkness. We just hear a match being struck and we???re trying to figure out what the hell is going on. The match finally ignites and we can see ???? an angry guy in a Toyota or something, like a Camry sedan or whatever, and he appears to be doing something vaguely sexual, but we can???t quite see what. You know what, actually, forget that, he???s just pensive or uncomfortable. Voice-over guy comes on: ???Imagine a place where nothing is quite what it seems.??? Cut to a family outing, a picnic by a lake, the sky goes gray, a huge menacing twister is moving toward them, the sky goes dark as night and WHOOSH??CRAAACK! Yep, lightning. We just see a flash of it, but the flash lights up a dead body, yep, a corpse in a meadow. And standing next to the body is, get ready for it: A pilot. Just a commercial airline pilot. Just standing there looking at the sky. Suddenly a woman???s voice, all sultry and everything, just goes, ???I haven???t felt a storm like this in quite sometime.??? HISSSSSSSSSSWACK! Close up on a cobra. You know the woman who just did that last soundbite? Well, she???s on a porch of some huge mansion in New Orleans, and she???s talking to a tarantula and drinking wine while thousands of venomous snakes are crawling all over the porch. She doesn???t even seem to care. She???s beautiful and she???s just staring off into the distance. Suddenly the music is speeding up CHUN DUH DADADA CHUN??CHUN BRAYYYRRRR! Silence. The voice-over guy just goes, ???The storm is you. You are the storm.??? We???re sitting there in the dark like, ???Holy shit. This movie looks awesome. Whoever wrote it is captivating and mysterious.??? Then a title dissolves up on black and it just says: Coming Soon. It dissolves out, the screen???s totally black, and we hear one guy just go, ???Carol. No.??? And then BOOOOOSHBUUUM! ???? that sound effect called ???Swoosh Low-Impact Long Reverb??? just fades out.Another successful column contest is in the books. We received over 800 entries, which we narrowed down to a final 40. This year more than ever many entries would have been worthy winners.

449," repeat.For the love of God, someone help me. Yesterday was my twenty-first birthday, marking my first year as a twenty-something and my life is now impossible to navigate. I can???t comprehend existence the way I used to and I feel inexplicably drawn to the idea of a meal that combines breakfast and lunch, served with a mimosa. I know that there are certain things a twenty-something needs in order to survive, but I can???t remember what they are. Is there a listicle? A slideshow? Anything! I need an easily digestible piece of reading material that can help me to re-learn all the everyday tasks, skills, and thought processes I can no longer remember since losing all cognizance. If it is written entirely in quotes from lovable celebrity or television characters and reapplied to fit an entirely different situation, all the better.When did it get so bad? How did I lose track of everything? Of who I am? My mother always used to say??? Oh God. What was it? She was always giving me quippy statements to frame my state of mind, but how can you frame a mind that is empty? I know I was supposed to stop and smell something, but what? And there was definitely something I shouldn???t do in instances of spilled milk, but I cannot for the life of me remember what. Don???t sing about spilled milk? Could someone please impose their opinion of what my current outlook on life should be?I need to get away and clear my head. But where would I go? I don???t know what???s out there. I???ve heard rumors of other cities and countries, but conceptualizing the idea of things and ideas that I can???t see has been hurting my head, so how would I go about choosing one to visit? And how would I get there? Is there a city that is kinder to my age bracket? A method of travel that maximizes the enjoyment for a person like me, who is only like me because we share a birth year? I may not know a lot about this society I am trying to re-enter, but it is abundantly clear that, if it applies to one twenty-something, it will apply to all of us.How much time do I have left? Am I doomed to live in this hell of lost knowledge? Will it end with my twenties? When my twenties end, will it be too late? Are there things I need to do, facts I need to know, jokes I need to tell, books I need to read before the decade comes to a close? Am I wasting my time and my life? What is my purpose? Am I special?I don???t know who I am anymore. I???ve been looking through old photographs and flipping through diaries, trying to find answers, but all I found was a framed paper declaring I had received a ???Bachelor of Arts Degree.??? I didn???t know much, but I did know that this had indescribable value. The pawn shop, however, would not give me anything for it. I went a couple of other places and, as far as I can tell, it is essentially worthless monetarily.Despite my sudden lack of knowledge and experience, I have opinions about things that everyone NEEDS TO HEAR RIGHT NOW. I feel strongly that I am an authority on politics and HBO and other things I can???t really describe due to my mentally crippling amnesia. I get very angry about these topics, but nobody seems to want to listen to what I???m sure would be eloquent arguments if I, myself, could understand them.Perhaps I will just go underground and live a quiet life of desperation. I???ve heard mumblings about a place called ???Social Media Manager.??? It seems like a nice place where all people my age go for a while. Just until things start to make sense again.Although I???ve owned guns pretty much all my life, it wasn???t until 2011 that my wife and I took a headfirst dive into handgun culture. And if you???ve been reading this column regularly, you know that the diving was a lot of fun even though the training and advice we got along the way was an absolute joke.The range, the concealed-carry instructor, the police screeners, the license board, the gun shop, the NRA, the government: every party along the way basically gave us a hearty slap on the backs and a full endorsement to go and operate lethal weapons with minimal training.Well, that???s America, we thought. Thank God for these liberties and freedoms and lacks of government interference.We became frequent customers at the shooting range near our house back in late 2010, and we were licensed to carry concealed handguns three years ago in May. Once licensed, we moved to scheduling regular weekly shooting practice.What had been just some enjoyable weekend competition, something like a ballistic equivalent to pitching horseshoes, became more serious business. I did research into good inside-the-waistband holsters; my wife bought a purse with a concealed inner pouch that would hide her .38 Airweight with its shrouded hammer.It was hot inside the range during summer because the place was basically a long, cheaply built shed that had been put up as an afterthought, and it had no climate control or air filtration. So we shot mostly on cool rainy days or in the evening. When fall came, the change in temperature was welcome relief.December 14, 2012 was the first Friday in a long time where we had a break in our work schedules. We could finally take a day off and put in some time at the range. Incredibly, almost two months had passed since we???d last shot. We were more than ready to put some holes on paper, and we???d even picked up some targets that left bright neon splashes where they got hit so we wouldn???t need to reel them in so often to check progress.But then the bottom fell out of the world again. I think I saw the first headline on a news aggregator on my computer screen, just as I was about to close the lid and start the day in earnest.???School shooting reported in Connecticut,??? it said. This is a breaking story, was all the detail it could offer beyond the headline, after identifying the town and the fact that first responders were on scene.Three hours later, my wife and I sat in silence at our kitchen table, with some sort of lunch in front of us but no appetite to even pick at it.Three handguns sat in two range bags on the counter behind us. Their roots went back to a cheap plastic BB gun that my family used for target fun in the basement, a thousand years ago when I was??? these children???s age. Or maybe the roots went back even before that, to a miniature plastic checker-gripped .45-caliber Colt pistol that fit into the pre-formed hand of my first boyhood GI Joe, a thousand years ago when I was??? these children???s age.Those had been toys. That had been playtime. And these children would never play again.Anything we could have done that day would have been a hollow, worthless gesture. We could have gathered up all nine of our guns and flung them into the deepest part of the river. We could have locked them in chains and buried them. We could have set them on fire. We could have written anguished letters to the President, to Congress, to the NRA, to the parents of the slain, to the classmates of the lost, to the hearts of the bereaved, to the soul of the nation. We could have prayed to God. We could have kept vigil at our television sets. We could have wept.Instead we went to that awful trash heap of a range in the next town, listening to the radio news all the way, hardly speaking, and we could barely look at the counter clerk because her cheerfulness was obscene. Pulling open the cheap cardboard door at the far end of the hall, we heard laughter and we saw Osama Bin Laden???s face being shot to pieces by rapid-fire rednecks who found the whole thing hilarious. The only way to drown out their infuriating laughter leaking through our ear protection was to commence firing our own weapons and imagine our",100
450," targets as the foreheads of these slobs cackling with glee while the voices of a shattered community, and the voices of a mourning nation, buckled in agony and asked the question again.Why?For the loss of one blond college student murdered during a Caribbean vacation, we???ll howl the question relentlessly for a year. For the loss of one little beauty queen from a rich family in a mountain state, we???ll ask it for more than a decade. For the one and a half million Americans killed by guns outside of war since records began to be kept in the 1930s, we ask it for a couple of days whenever the death toll is deemed excessive.Why?Obviously, the answer is neither simple nor easy. And it sure as shit will not fit neatly within the confines of a bumper sticker. For many gun owners like me, it???s conflicted and contradictory and confounding, and it will not offer an easy invocation of the Fifth Amendment???s protection against self-incrimination.By the end of that December day, the gundamentalist community had already begun to refocus the tragedy on itself, the collective victim of a coming wave of anti-firearm legislation and government tyranny that of course never came. But that narrative of patriotic martyrdom has never let up since.Which is pretty much why, in the nearly three years passed since Sandy Hook, my wife and I have taken our handguns out only twice to a range we now loathe. And why her revolver-concealing purse collects dust in her closet. And why, when our concealed-carry licenses come up for renewal, she won???t be renewing hers.I probably will renew mine. And some day, if we don???t all shoot each other in a stupid civil war waged over the right to shoot each other, I might want to look for another range that I don???t hate. Or maybe I???ll buy some land and build my own. Just me and my guns, out there in the woods somewhere, shooting bullets into a dirt backstop, thanking God for my liberty and my freedom and my lack of government interference, wondering what the fuck went so horribly wrong with the interpretation of 27 words and why we let it get that far.A middle-aged woman wheels an enormous cheese trolley into her opulent living room for her sadistic husband to enjoy, but when she lifts the dome she finds it is full of grass.- -A lanky priest is mistaken for a fishmonger and is harangued by a crone over the cost of some diseased chub.

There are days when I look at it like, ???Man, I can???t even believe this works and it???s become so popular.??? But then there are even longer nights where I just want to do the world a favor and erase the whole darned thing.I???m Tim Berners-Lee, by the way. You probably don???t recognize my name, which is wild ??? seeing as how I???m responsible for the most important breakthrough of all time. But yeah, twenty-five years ago, I invented the Internet. It???s true. Look it up. I???ve made it darned easy for you to do that.And it was fun for a while ??? The Web. We called it The Web, back then. The World Wide Web. I was on magazine covers, my wife was impressed, the Queen of England knighted me, my university included me in its newsletter, I heard from a few old friends. It was neat for??? let???s say, six months. Seven, tops.  This was the Golden Age, before it all spiraled into an endless abyss of steaming garbage.If you???ve used a computer anytime since, say, early 1990, you probably know what I mean. There???s all this stuff that I never could have have predicted ??? horrible comment sections and public shaming and unchecked monopolies that destroy industries and hacking and bullying and weird sexual nonsense and a steady stream of bad news and pointless memes and spying and new-fangled addictions and anonymous threats and the rewiring of our brains and a constant stream of advertising and scams and shams and blatant stealing and the spread of extremism and unnecessary lists and endless ranking and down-voting and diminished attention spans and the demise of newspapers and reputations ruined in an instant. Oh, and spoiler alerts to all of my favorite TV shows. I found out how Breaking Bad ended without even trying.You know??? maybe that???s an apt comparison, actually. The Internet started off as a milquetoast Walter White and has become a depraved Heisenberg. Hmm. I???m going to think about that.So yeah, things aren???t that great.I really didn???t anticipate any of this when I initiated Hypertext Transfer Protocol communication and let the Internet out of its box, forever. In retrospect, I should???ve just kept the idea to myself, or shared it with a few close friends, or made it password protected, so I had some say over who could join. But no. Nooooooooooo. I had to be a big shot. I had to compensate for not being very good at sports, or whatever.Silly me, Tim Berners-Lee. That???s a little rhyme I say about myself, sometimes.My therapist keeps telling me to stay positive, that I thought of something that democratized the flow of information, that I brought people together, that I???m responsible for jobs being created and the flourishing of ideas and leveling the world???s playing field so that everybody has an equal voice ??? and a billion other things that I???m forgetting right now. Marriages, or whatever. But I say to heck with it. To heck with it all!Email is OK, I guess. Or, it???s quick, at least. I don???t know if I like it all that much, anymore. It just kind of just stresses me out. Like, you know when you reply to somebody???s message and then they reply to your reply, immediately? And you???re like, ???Wait a minute, I just sent you an e-mail a few seconds ago! You???re not allowed to send me an e-mail and clog up my inbox again.???I actually hate email.I preferred it when my local post offi",100
451,"ce was open on Saturdays.And sure, sometimes I think I could???ve launched a couple of money-making platforms like Google, or Facebook, or Uber, or??? something. I could???ve set my family up a bit better, monetarily. I mean, these guys ??? Zuckerberg or whoever ??? they were all just babies in 1989!Maybe I don???t like the fact that nobody believes me, either. I was at this dinner party the other night and somebody innocently asked what I do for a living, and I quickly responded that I invented the Internet, and everybody just laughed. At me. For a long time. Finally, I screamed, ???Use your precious INTERNET PHONES to look up TIM BERNERS-LEE on the INTERNET! Do it! NOW!??? So they all did.And then it got extremely quiet.But I wasn???t through. I yelled, ???Is THAT enough proof for you CHUCKLEHEADS? HUH?!??? Then I turned the table over. Then I hollered, ???I???m like Edison, Ford and Johannes effing Gutenberg, all wrapped into one!??? Then I punched a hole in the wall. Then I stomped a saucer with my boot.Hopefully nobody uploads a video of my freakout.So that???s why I keep having conflicting emotions about having invented the Internet.It seemed like a good idea at the time.Silly me, Tim Berners-Lee.How many seconds of uncomfortable silence did you allow to pass whenever someone outside the program asked what you???re studying in graduate school?

You just come waltzing into town like nothing has happened, like nothing has changed. Don???t look at me like that. You???re the one who left for a year with no explanation, no warning. No note. And I???m just supposed to be okay with that?Well, I???m not. A lot has changed in the last year. I???ve moved on. I tried going vegan, did you know that? Of course you didn???t. You know why? Because you never bothered to call and check in. I had a fling with peppermint in December, but that didn???t last long. I never really got over you.Do you know what it was like for me after you disappeared? I was a wreck. I couldn???t get out of bed; there was nothing to look forward to. I started visiting the places we spent time together, on the off chance you might be there. But no matter where I went, the fact was that you were gone. Worst of all, it seems that I was the only one who noticed. Signs advertising your presence remained up. Commercials encouraging me to consume you in mass quantities flooded my television and haunted my dreams. You were everywhere and nowhere, all at the same time.If I had realized how temporary your presence in my life would be, I would have done things differently. I would have cherished the time we spent together more. I would have taken more pictures. I would have told you I loved you each and every single day. If only I knew it was all going to end, I would have planned ahead. I would have stocked up. If only.But like I said, things are different now. I???ve changed. I???m strong now. I???m not the same girl who needed you, yearned for you and cried when you weren???t around. I am an independent, self-sufficient woman, who refuses to be tied down. Especially to something that can???t handle hanging around for more than a three month period of time. So screw you, you commitment phobic piece of crap.You???ve got a lot of nerve coming back here. How dare you look me in the eye? Do you think I???m dumb? Do you think I don???t realize that since you???ve come back, you???ve flirted with every person you pass on the street, tempting them with your elusive charms and intoxicating scent? You jerk. You big jerk. I trusted you. I thought we had something special. And now you???ve gone and thrown it all away. Again. God, I???m stupid. I???m so stupid. I hate you. I really, really do.Wait. I???m sorry. Maybe I???m being too hard on you. I don???t know. I???ve put so much into this relationship already. Maybe it???s better to just try again. A blank slate, so to speak. It???s still early in the season. We still have time; we can still make it work. What do you say? How about a drink? For old time???s sake? But please, whatever you do. Don???t ever leave me again.I love you,Ilana Abby Plen- -Our squad of aspiring high school-aged music journalists???for this interview, Avery Panganiban, Ryan Wangman, Makele Clemmons, and Imaan Yousuf???spoke with Kate Grube, frontwoman of Chicago emo darlings Kittyhawk. They talked Kendrick Lamar???s songwriting, Swedish ice skating, and loving the Midwest.- - 826 CHICAGO: Hi, it???s great to meet you. I was just wondering: can you tell us about some of the things you???re working on right now?KATE: Yeah, sure.  So I???m on the wardrobe department of this great film called Southside With You, so that???s kind of what I do when I???m not playing music. My band, Kittyhawk, has been writing some new songs. We went to Europe in January, which is just the most exciting thing I???ve ever done, ever. So now, since we???ve been back for a little while, we???re just getting back in the swing of doing some playing regularly, meeting some new people.826 CHICAGO: Could you tell us some of your musical influences?KATE: Sure. Musically, I think there are a lot of things that influence us. Definitely a lot of bands from the late ???90s in the Midwest, like Lana Maria or Braid. I think we pull a lot of influences from those early emo bands. But, I mean, otherwise I think that lyrically I???m really just so into Kendrick Lamar right now. And figuring out any way to translate that into anything that I do is just??? you know??? just maybe having a great sense of the rhythm of words, and sounds, and saying something really important and meaningful, and also making it fun with a rhyth",100
452,"m you can dance to.826 CHICAGO: Who here at Pitchfork are you most excited to see? Why did you come here today?KATE: Yeah! Well, so Courtney [Barnett]???s playing right now, or just finished right now, and it???s so incredible to see her play. She???s got such a good energy, her band has such a wonderful time. When they???re playing you feel like you just wanna jump up there and be like, ???Hey, if we could just hang out for like ten minutes, I know that you wouldn???t wanna stop hanging out with me.??? You know, just make great friends. The Julie Ruin, I saw them just a little bit ago. Kathleen Hanna has been a huge influence on the way that I view the music scene and independent scenes, and just being part of a community that really cares about other people.  And making your band and your songs more than just songs that you wrote, but making it a collaborative piece among everybody in your community.826 CHICAGO: So, at what age did you start getting to music, or, more like your style of music? When did you realize that this was what you were really interested in?KATE: Well, so when I was a kid, my dad, my dad is a professional piano player.  He???s very accomplished, he plays the blues piano. When I was a kid, my parents would take me to piano lessons. And??? I don???t know??? it just, it just didn???t really click for me, maybe. It felt like something they were asking me to do. I???d go to my lesson. I was always, like, ten minutes late because I would drag my feet the whole time, it was really difficult to get me to practice. And then, I think when I was in middle school, I started listening to Ben Kweller a lot. I don???t know if you guys like that guy, but he has a couple really great songs that are written on the piano, and one day I just ???kind of??? went back to it and played an open mic at the Old Town School of Folk Music on Armitage and met some people, joined a band, and then, you know, it just sort of happened. It was like, ???Wait a minute!??? And then, of course, like, all the regret comes in, of like, ???Why didn???t I pay attention in my lessons!???? So you start learning your instrument over again at 13, or something.826 CHICAGO: You mentioned a European Tour. Do you have any favorite cities or tour memories?KATE: Oh man! Where do I start? Okay, well, I???m trying to find my favorite one.  I think there???s just maybe something about being with six of your friends crammed in a little van going all over, playing a new place every night, often new languages every couple days.  There???s just kind of like that cool human bonding thing that happens. But, I really loved Sweden. We played in Stockholm at, I think like, a cultural center. We played there.  After the show it was super cold and they had this little ice rink set up, and everybody went out and all skated around in our shoes, and we did ice stars. Everybody dragged everybody around, and I think it was just a great moment. We had so many days, like, that day my keyboard was broken, we had to take it to the Nord factory to get it repaired. I dropped my cell phone out of our van and it got run over, like, just coming off of the highway into Stockholm. We were super late for the show because of those things. I think I had been, like, waiting for a check to clear that I didn???t have yet. You know??? it just, like, was one of those days where everything happens all at once. And we played, and then just being on the ice after the show just felt like such a great relief.826 CHICAGO: How do you think that being in Chicago affects your music style?KATE: No matter where you are, you???re always going to be influenced by other bands from the area. It???s hard to say, since I feel like a lot of the bands that, at least Kittyhawk is influenced by, are regional, it???s hard to say whether or not we would have become who we were without being here. But I think being in the city of Chicago, there???s such a great mix of all different kinds of genres and all different kinds of things, and then there???s that thing I love about the Midwest, that just kind of like, Midwest values.  Like being excited to meet other people, and being friendly and encouraging, yea. That???s what I like about it here.826 CHICAGO: Okay, well, it was a pleasure to meet you, thank you for your time.KATE: It was a pleasure to be meet you too! Can we bring it in for a second?EVERYONE:  1??? 2??? 3??? Midwest!There is a woman who waits in the darkness for the same bus each morning. Another woman stands stands nearby, in front of the graffiti-covered advertisement for Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2. The women stare into the distance, searching for the lumbering public transport vehicle that will take them to campus. They wait for their future labor like two crocodiles in adjoining tanks. There is only silence.- -Another graduate student speaks to her about his work in physics. His laboratory performs the amazing feat of turning light into a solid, or something else that is lost to her in minutes. She returns to the work that consumes her morning hours, blithely ignoring the correspondence between Frankenstein and this wonder of physics. She does not ask the question, are we pieces of solid light?- -The day is spent for the most part in a glorious solitude. Like the hunter who moves silently through the woods to check his traps, she moves through the library, cautiously avoiding those whom she knows. A single conversation would ruin the beauty and vastness of her silence. Today no such conversation occurs and she is happy.- - At lunchtime she meets a graduate student friend at a vile chain restaurant. They are only redeemed from their disgusting food choices by their inflexible avoidance of the yoga studio above. As they eat the uniform food before them they discuss their dissertations and television shows they have watched on Netflix. They understand each other???s daily labors with few words. Like polar explorers, they do not need to tell each other what is the snow. They simply build a wall with it, against the elements.- -Later she tries to return to her work, but is stymied by writer???s block. Though she has named her laptop after a character from a Jane Austen novel there is no friend here but only the pitiless, ruthless gaze of an insensate machine. The screen looks back at her, unforgiving and brutal as the nature that lies forgotten outside her window.- -Each night her boyfriend introduces her to a spirit of levity. With the taste in alcohol of a young dandy, she picks up a glass of mead that comes from a bottle stamped with images of Vikings and yells, ???Let us breathe fire over the moldering bones of our enemies!??? A few years ago, her sister had a genetic test that showed they are descended from Vikings. She finds comfort in pretending that she is a Viking warrior, facing the struggles of daily life with the beautiful and strange fiction that she lays waste to her foemen on the high seas.Opens a window.Opens a window and then really oversells how nice it is.Opens a smaller, less obvious door.Says ???Did you want that open????Turns all the windows into window-sized doors.Reopens the door and just closes the screen.Moves the door to the south wall and mentions a Feng Shui class he???s taking.Remarks how a door???s peephole is kind of like a tiny window.Opens up about his dad, even though it???s clearly not the right time.Says, ???Whoops! I meant to leave before I closed that.??? Pretends like it was a joke, then awkwardly hangs around for five minutes before leaving.When I was in third grade and on my a.m. recess from Hebrew studies, I jaunty-jollied down Henry Street bouncing my spaldeen. My destination ??? Cheap Naftali???s ??",100
453,"? was across the street, next to my pastrami/corned beef deli. My mission: to acquire a couple of Israeli stamps. But before I could cross on the green, not in between, the neon sign right in front of me???a story up, two stories tall, about thirty feet from ground to apex ??? sent out its siren call. My attention deficit disordered me and now I was on to something new. I had to prove what had so quickly morphed from momentary musing to earnest belief ??? that I could toss my spaldeen up and over the sign, and catch it on the other side before it bounced. I went over the mechanics in my head, step by step, until I was certain of them. I turned my body at an angle to the sign, placed my left leg in front of my right, bent both slightly at the knees, gripped the spaldeen in my throwing hand, took a deep breath, cocked my arm, and hurled. It took only a nano after release for me to fully comprehend the hubris of my miscalculation. The ball hit the sign about a third of the way up. I watched in shock as the neon tubing crackled, broke into a billion pieces, and rained down on me. After an eternity of terror paralysis, I came to my senses. I didn???t even take the time to retrieve the red rubber instrument of my downfall, I just tore ass out of there as fast as my Keds could carry me ??? a plus-sized, baby-faced, wing??d Mercury, running for dear life.I didn???t stop running until I reached the cafeteria in the yeshiva???s basement. I was farshvitst,1  huffing and puffing so wheezily I thought I might have a fatal asthma attack before I could finish the caramelized, crinkle-cut french fries, which, along with spaghetti and fish sticks, were the only things worth eating in Mrs. Ausfresser???s Maison de Feh.The rest of the school day I sat in dread of the inevitable. It was as if I were mourning over the corpse I would soon become ??? the lay-away plan of sitting shivah.2  Surely someone had seen what I had done, had seen where I had run to. It was just a matter of time before I would have to answer for my crime.In class that day, as the teach attempted to explain long division and simplify (ha!) the mystical process of mapping a sentence,3  all I could do was keep my ears peeled, listening for the stamp, stamp, stamp of jackboots as the Polizei clomped on the marble treads of the iron stairwell up to my home room. They would call me out, cuff me, haul me off to the hoosegow, the mean-spirited catcalls of my classmates providing the soundtrack to my perp walk.The police never materialized, but that night, as I boarded the train to Hell???s Kitchen, I felt far from home free. And I was right. On this night the nest was just another anteroom in hell. Every time the shofar4  rang I expected my tale of transgression to be tattled to whichever of the parentals picked up; and the shofar wouldn???t stop ringing. With each new call I jerked about like a fish out of water, like I had stuck my tongue in an electric socket.By the fourth or fifth involuntary twitch the womb???s maternal instinct kicked in and she started asking me the same question each time I seemed about to jump out of my skin: What???s the matta, Rob-it?To which I would petulantly reply, Nuthin???, Mom, lee-mee alone.With each passing iteration of the question her tone became more hysterical, mine more defensive. It was a Slavic standoff.Knuckleheaded nine-year-old that I was on the day of the spaldeen disaster, having had a belief system best deemed Talibanic Yiddishkeit rooted into my very core, I totally bought into the deus ex panopticon model of the universe. With the same certainty I had that my aunt Debbie???s rugelach were the best on earth, even better than those to be had at Sussman???s or Gertel???s, I knew the Volcano God???s eye in the sky had seen what I had done and it was just a matter of time before my punishment would be made manifest. And so it was that, as the nuclear family gathered ???round our burning bush that evening to watch with awe, amazement, and perhaps even a smidge of disbelief as the platonic form of the Amurrican family went through the motions on The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet ??? pops in the club chair throne, womb in the wing chair of hysteria, and spawny old me supine on the couch of death ??? I was imploding with guilt, percolating closer and closer to critical mass. My heart was beating like the bongo in the belly of the boat in Ben Hur???my lub-dub-lub-dub-lub-dub speeding up like the ever-quickening tempo dictated by Quintus Arrius: Battle speed, Hortator??? Attack speed??? Ramming speed! ??? until ram I finally did, into the inescapable conclusion that the time had come today for me to tell the truth and face the consequences, that I must come correct before El Supremo smites me.My confession refluxed up from my guilt-ridden gut, exploded out of my big motormouth.The confession that poured out of me was ululatory, a monosyllabic wail, sharing in common with the Mosaic Torah of Sinai5  an absence of starts and stops. Womb and seed were fascinated and horrified by my act in equal measure, managing the Oscar-worthy performance of showing parental concern and adult impatience at the same time.While Depresso-Dad, spooked by his son???s emotional outburst, nestled himself even deeper into the fortress of solitude that was himself???s club chair, Hystero-Mom found herself in the cradle of her comfort zone; although she would???ve denied it, she was grooving enthusiastically to the beat of my yowl. She made her stab at soothing the savage beast in the only way she knew how ??? by rotating the potentiometer to twelve, screaming at me that she couldn???t understand a word I was saying, screaming at me that she couldn???t help me if she couldn???t understand me, screaming at me to explain what I was bawling about right this very second. Having lived with this level of hysteria since I was a zygote, I knew what I had to do. I took deep breaths that would have made a swami proud, regained a semblance of emotional control, and told my tale of crime and regret, all the while making it perfectly clear how very sorry I was, how very remorseful I was.I closed my eyes. I expected the gnashing of teeth, the rending of clothes, the pulling of hair, the slaps and screams of outraged parentals.That is not how it went down. After a beat or two I reopened my eyes in time to see the father-mother exchange a glance, after which the womb asked, Did anyone see you, Rob-it? Unwilling to state the obvious ??? that God had seen me ??? I went with the secular and said, No, I don???t think so.Another beat. Another glance. And then the womb said, If nobody saw you, let???s not worry about it.??????Henri-Cartier Bresson defined the decisive moment ??? a phrase he had coined ??? as the simultaneous recognition, in a fraction of a second, of the significance of an event as well as the precise organization of forms which gives that event its proper expression.??????The Island of Lost Souls recounts the scientific adventures of Dr. Moreau, evolution engineer, who performs metamorphic surgery without anesthesia on the beasts of the wild in what he chillingly, threateningly refers to as the House of Pain, the end result of which is a tribe of low-lumen ani-men, gathered together in a creepy crawl just outside the doc???s main gate, a jungular congregation who both revere and fear him.Edward Parker, the straightest man in the South Pacific, is cast ashore on this island hell, and Moreau, his ulterior motive a plot point as yet unrevealed, opens his spooky mansion to him, offering comfort, sustenance, and the companionship of Lota, whom he represents as his daughter (but who is in actuality the Panther Woman ",100
454,"whom Moreau created to play Eve in his newly minted, mad-scientist riff on the Garden of Eden).After walking in on Moreau and his assistant-with-the-criminal-past (read backstreet abortionist) anatomizing yet another George of the Jungle, Parker takes the pliable Lota by the hand and makes a break from Bio-Hell only to discover that Vivisection Village stands between them and the safety of the sea.Seeing Adam and his lab-made Eve makes the natives restless (this film being the source of that clich??). They launch a regression swarm. Just as it looks like this is the end of the line for the man and his metamorphized maiden, Moreau appears on a promontory above the tropic ghetto, a whip in one hand, a striker in the other; he one-hands the gong,6  snaps his whip, and gets the attention of his lab-made freaks. Aided by his high priest, the Sayer of the Law,7  he commences a recitation of a primitive, abbreviated moral code???the Three Commandments???that his creations must live by:DR. MOREAU: What is the law?SAYER OF THE LAW: Not to eat meat, that is the law. Are we not men?BEASTS (in unison): Are we not men?DR. MOREAU: What is the law?SAYER OF THE LAW: Not to go on all fours, that is the law. Are we not men?BEASTS (in unison): Are we not men?DR. MOREAU: What is the law?SAYER OF THE LAW: Not to spill blood, that is the law. Are we not men?BEASTS (in unison): Are we not men?Then the Sayer of the Law soulfully recites the service???s final, mournful benediction: His is the hand that made; his is the hand that heals; his is the House of Pain.The beasts are tranquilized, the Sayer of the Law slinks back to his A-frame hut, and Moreau, Parker, and the Panther Woman head back to the mad doctor???s manse, where Moreau fills Parker in on his backstory: I started with plant life in London twenty years ago??? I performed a miracle??? I stripped a hundred thousand years of slow evolution??? by a slight change in the??? germ plasm; it???s as simple as that. Following the discovery of an escaped dog much the worse for wear, Moreau had to flee London, the newspapers at my heels, aroused England crying for my blood. It was then he hightailed it to his present location, the Island of Lost Souls, where he produced my first great achievement ??? articulate speech controlled by the brain. Oh, it takes a long time and infinite patience to make them talk. With each experiment I improve upon the last; I get nearer and nearer??? Mr. Parker, do you know what it means to feel like god?The doc???s off-handed assumption of divine powers thoroughly spooks Parker.The following morning, as Parker sits by the reflecting pool reading, Moreau the matchmaker pushes the Panther Lady at him. She snuggles up against him, purrs suggestively to him, gazes upon him, her eyes tractor beams of desire, until he can no longer control himself. He scoops her up in his arms and locks lips with Lota. Although Parker regains control momentarily, for Moreau it???s plain to see that a performance of the (half-literal) beast-with-the-double-back is inevitable.But the best-laid schemes o??? mice an??? mad scientists gang aft agley.It???s paradise lost when Parker???s relentless Amurrican fianc??e, la Rubia Ruth, who???s been combing the South Pacific for her man, shows up on Lost Soul Island in a tramp steamer captained by an old salt in sway to the demon rum, and from that moment the movie cascades toward its climax: Ruth takes Parker???s room, locks the door behind her; the simian Ouran, eager to get his letch on, lopes up the limb of a tree, yanks out a bar in Ruth???s window, and hops in, his tiny, pheremonic-fogged mind ruled by his jumbo frank; Ruth screams; the Cap and Parker come running and Ouran beats a hasty retreat; Back-Alley Abortionist, who has had enough of sado-surgery and would rather do his time in a more conventional house of pain, offers to help the visitors escape; Cap volunteers to race back to his boat for reinforcements; Moreau gives Ouran a one-time dispensation from Commandment Three and instructs the anthropoid to snap Cap???s neck; Ouran does as he is told; he drags Cap???s limp body to display before his coreligionists; the Sayer of the Law attempts to perform his eponymous task, to bring the hammer of primordial righteousness down upon the head of Ouran, but Apeman insists he did it with Moreau???s blessing; there follows a spirited, if intellectually challenged, ethical debate ??? is it permissible to spill blood if He says so?; the mob whoops and roars its answer in the affirmative; by applying the principles of logic for idiots, they go even farther ??? these once-they-were-animals, now-they-are-men conclude that if Cap can die, so can Moreau; the Sayer of the Law, now fully on board, articulates the tribe???s epochal epiphany ??? He can die, law no more!; cut to chez Moreau, where Doc Baby Killer produces a gun, and he, Parker, and Ruth make good their escape; coincidental with their escape, Moreau beats the gong, snaps his whip, in an attempt to flog his restless flock into submission; thrilled, liberated by their newly gained understanding that He can die, they have moved beyond his control; terror sets in for Moreau; he tears ass back to the safety of his gated community of one, but before he can secure the gate, he???s overpowered by his creations, who cart him off to the House of Pain, where they make good on their metaphysical discovery; going one step further than Freaks, the camera rolls as the creatures change potentiality into actuality, grabbing the tools of their torturous transformation to prove the proposition ??? He can die.And therefore, Law no more.??????You might think that I would have been relieved when the womb proffered a pass for my destructive miscalculation, but you would be wrong. Make no mistake, it came as a great relief to be spared the physical and mental pain of the parental kabuki of crime and punishment that would have included (but was not necessarily limited to) Pops smacking me while yelling in Yiddish or Polish about what a decisively rotten little pischer I was, while Mom would be initially wondering what she had done wrong to have deserved a kid like me, then insisting the hospital had to have switched their true offspring for the satanic changeling that stood before them, then building to the climax of her triune pity party: the prophecy that I would be the death of her yet, the yet both defiant and accusatory, which I understood to mean that my clear and ongoing campaign to kill her, though still not successful, could not at that point in the space-time continuum yet be deemed a failure. But my relief at this escape, as welcome as it was, did in no way shrink or disappear the great abyss that had opened at my feet8  when Mom made it clear that there was no such thing as real, prescriptive rights and wrongs, and that, in fact, the only thing that could be judged a bad deed, the only thing you could absolutely not get away with, was the thing you were caught in the act of doing.And that is how I developed what could be called ethical Asperger???s.- - 1 Heavy duty sweat that can be caused by exertion, like tearing ass from the scene of the crime, or by anxiety (see Albert Brooks as the guest anchor in Broadcast News) or, as in this case, a combo of the two.2 Jews spend seven days sitting on milk crates in rent clothes while relatives from the Men in Black branch of the mishpuchah, who only materialize during periods of group grief, gobble herring, inhale marble cake, slurp schnapps, and babble nonsense about the will of god.3 I am to this day not certain that mapping a sentence was a core part of the elementary school curriculum or just something ",100
455,"I hallucinated after I inhaled a pastrami sandwich on ergot-laced deli rye. In memory, at least, it would start out peacefully enough, like the morning the Japs sneak-attacked Pearl Harbor. We would just be taking our seats after having consumed a huge lunch, which left us collectively feeling a tad logy, when Mrs. Wolpinsky would screech that she was about to teach us how to map a sentence. And that???s when shit went banzai, bombs away. Mrs. W would turn to the blackboard, which ran the width of the classroom from door to window, and chalk on the most complicated sentence imaginable, fraught with subjects, direct and indirect objects, prepositional phrases, gerunds ??? the gansa grammatical gamut. (A sentence such as this ??? In December of 1972 some friends and I gathered at the home of My Friend the Gleaner, on the corner of Bergen and Flatbush, a top-floor, thousand-room slum, that looked like the set of a German Expressionist horror movie, parked ourselves in front of the Trinitron he had salvaged from an abandoned Rockaway bungalow, and passed the Thai stick, again and again, as we watched the first-round AFC playoff game between the Oakland Raiders and the Pittsburgh Steelers that ended with the legendary immaculate reception ??? the pigskin, having caromed off the colliding carcasses of Frenchy Fuqua and Jack Tatum, was mere microns from touching the astro turf when Franco Harris scooped it up and tore ass into the end zone with but ten ticks remaining on the clock, producing glorious chaos in both Three Rivers Stadium and Park Slope Brooklyn, where our circle of way wasted potheads could not fucking believe what we had just seen.) She would then go Otto Jespersen all over our foggy little minds. She first drew one long horizontal line to which she would affix verticals and diagonals both above and below it. She would write some of the words of the sentence in and around some of these squiggles. There would be arrows, turned inward, pointing outward, then more horizontal lines above and below the original to which were added the now familiar verticals, diagonals, arrows, and dots. By the end of her disquisition, the board was a tree of words branching everywhere???it looked downright Leibniztian, only with English words in the place of Greek letters and Arabic numerals. And while Wolpinsky rattled on and on, I would be sitting in the back of the room???we were seated as we were marched, in size order???absolutely lost, experiencing the feeling that education, be it of the elementary, high, or higher variety, was just not for me. And so I therefore gave myself permission to let it pass over me as if I had put a figurative splash of blood on my mental doorway so that the Angel of Boredom and Confusion might pass me by.4 In The Yiddish Policemen???s Union, Michael Chabon created a vocabulary of hard-boiled Jew slang and assigned the word shofar (a primitive bugle fashioned from a ram???s horn) to designate the telephone.5 In addition to the granite dos and don???ts Moish brought down following his t??te-??-tete with the almighty, he also lugged down from the mount the Torah. But at the time of his descent Moish and the Chosen People were only halfway through Exodus ??? there were still three and a half books that hadn???t happened yet. The temporal paradox implicit in this was not lost on the young scholar Rob-it, and prompted him to wonder aloud why God would be handing out a crib sheet for the future. Instead of seeing my blurt as an egregious lapse of classroom etiquette punishable by a proto-plasmatic slap upside my head, the rebbe chose to use it to further his didactic agenda. He explained that it is the purview of god, and god alone, to know the future, and so, in order to keep Moses from co-opting the privileges of the deity, which would have left Yahweh with no other choice but to smite him, the scroll he handed down from his volcanic crib had all future actions of the wandering Jews spelled out as one seemingly endless word, absent diacritical marks (the Semitic linguistic equivalent of vowels), which Moses then decrypted as events transpired along the forty-year desert stroll.6 In the process becoming a short, stubby stand-in for Rank???s Gongman ??? the trademarked superhero of the titles/credits universe and a ubiquitous target of satire in the Mad magazine of my yoot.7 Bela Lugosi in what is not his most well remembered performance but might very well be his best.8 While Charlton Heston was off on his Ten Commandments walkabout, the now leaderless yids began to second-guess the whole he-is-the-one true-God spiel. They decided to hedge their theological bets. They let Edward G. Robinson (the only known Jew in a cast of thousands, cast as Dathan, the Pharaoh???s house Jew, overseer and governor of the enslaved chosen people), who had played bad angel to Moses???s good angel and used every hiccup along the way to the land of milk and honey to wax nostalgic about and urge the return to bondage, appoint himself high priest of the cult of the newly minted Golden Calf. When Charly descended with the twin tablets of Jehovah???s top ten thou shalt and thou shalt nots and witnessed the orgiastic Dance of the Idolators, he lost his mind for what he was doing and hurled the slabs at the Dionysiacs. At the moment of impact, they felt the earth move under their feet, they felt the sky come tumbling down, as a great fissure opened and swallowed them.Who???s a good boy?I can tell from the look in your eyes and the tone of your voice that you mean to imply that I am the good boy in question. You???re offering me praise and support. And I???m wagging my tail and excitedly padding my feet as if to say, ???Is it me? I hope it???s me! I???m the good boy! Yes I am!??? But you should know that is a charade.Look in my eyes. Really look into my eyes and you???ll see the truth.I am NOT a good boy, not by any definition.Hey, maybe I???m wrong. Maybe I am a good boy. Maybe I???m totally mistaken about the nature of good and evil. So sure, call me a good doggie and I won???t argue with you. It could be that I just have a guilty conscience and need to get something off my chest. I doubt it, but I suppose it could be true. Whatever the case, I should come clean. Even though you are a human who is only, by my estimate, somewhere between eighty and one hundred and seven years old, it???s way past time for you to know the truth. You need to know.I don???t really have what you would call a moral compass. And I???m not just talking about the poop. You think you know about the poop. You joke with your friends about how much I love to eat poop, that I prefer it to steak. But it???s not a joke to me. And let me take a moment to correct you: I don???t eat poop, I savor it. Mine is fine, but the cat???s poop is better. Another dog???s poop is also acceptable. I don???t discriminate. You think you have cured me of my late night foraging trips into the litter box, but I have only become more stealthy. I do it now more than ever, silently, joyfully. And then you are all too eager to let me lick your face, to let me kiss your mouth.???Ew, your doggy breath! You need a mint!??? you exclaim with joy before giving me the green chewy bone, which you believe will solve the problem of my bad breath. But it won???t. Nothing could ever. Not considering my preferred diet.But that???s just the beginning. I have done things. Oh, the things I have done. The times I have watched you with your girlfriend. The items around the house I have intentionally marked as mine and the precious items of yours I have chewed to bits. Knowing that I did both of those things not out of boredom, but by design. The sm",100

Then the rising desire to do it all over again. The cycle I can never break, that I never want to break. The doors I have scratched to feel the splinters under the pads of my paws just to fucking feel alive. The plans I have made while I watched you sleep.Check your browser history. I???ll wait. We???ll see if you still want to call me a ???good boy.??? Or will you maybe want to call the authorities? Or is it possible that you still don???t understand what I???m trying to communicate to you?

All kinds???one looked like a cat, one was a ???Hall,??? some looked valuable, some looked old. I carried a box of teapots, too. The lids rattled as we walked.???Twenty-some years ago I wouldn???t have predicted your carrying my mom???s teapots across this field with me,??? I said after a minute.Evan plays rock guitar. My band used to open for his, before ours suspended operations in the mid-nineties. I???ve always admired a song he wrote about 1960s Indianapolis 500 driver Jim Hurtubise, a man who loved the physical sport of racing and hated tinkering engineers. ???Put the wing back on the airplane/Put the man back in the car,??? Evan loudly sings. Thematically the song is kind of The Magnificient Ambersons set a half century later, relocated a few miles west to the race track. Inherently un-Nashville-ian.But what do I know? Maybe Evan???s song could get traction in Nashville???tale of a man???s man, celebrating the old ways.Still, I???m sure Evan just wants his song to be what it is: a rock tune he sings loudly. He???s not blighted with my nutty ambition to top charts.Years after our late nights in the Broad Ripple band scene, Evan became an advertising writer at the same agency I work for???we???ve spent hours together worrying about TV scripts and annual report copy. Today he???d come to the auction of my parents??? farmland and personal property partly out of polite interest in my family and partly because he likes old stuff. Now he was carrying teapots across a field.Plod, plod, plod.I???d gotten to the auction a few minutes before it started, and had to park way out in the middle. Lots of people showed up???hooray???but were gone now. My Jeep sat out by itself, a long way to carry these clinking pots that spent the previous twenty or thirty years in a display cabinet.Mom and Dad both declined to be present the day of the sale. They could have been there, but were overwhelmed by the idea of watching people walk off with their stuff.During the previous month or so my mom, my sister and I tried to save anything with special meaning, as if the house were slowly catching fire and we had time to pull out the important stuff. Even with weeks instead of minutes, the process was still as frantic and haphazard as if the house were filling with superheated air. Whatever remained was carried into the yard this morning and arranged on rows of tables.Once it was over, the contents of the house were irretrievable???as permanently gone and reduced to memories as if the place had just burnt to the cinder block foundation.Everything must go.All at once. Poof.Instead of the crackle of flame, the patter of a septuagenarian in a cowboy hat:Who???ll give me five now five now seven fifty, seven fifty, who???ll go seven fifty, c???mon boys, your wife called, said you could go seven fifty??? Seven fifty! Now ten, ten, ten, who???ll give me ten now twelve now twelve??? now fourteen??? fourteen??? fourteen???. Sold, twelve dollar, number 78.Auctions equal nostalgia: so much of what sold today was acquired in the seventies at estate sales and is now twice-auctioned. I do love that sing-speak patter. I dig the faint mustiness of indoor stuff dragged into sunlight and morning air, cigar or even pipe smoke hanging over it from old guys come to see if they could get a deal. I need a coney on creased oval paper from the white trailer through a sliding window with ladies inside who seem to be the same ladies who were in there decades ago.If I allow myself, I can be sentimental about anything.Clinky clink, said the teapot lids.My wife and I???before all this, before Mom had to move away because Dad was giving her stress-induced transient ischemic attacks, before Dad fell up the stairway and sprawled on the landing where he hit his head which erased the memory of the fall and led to him living in a nursing home, before lawyers helped us figure out complex finances???my wife and I had agreed we needed to downsize.Therefore it was uncool for me to bring home too many treasures.???Honey! Look! Boxes of teapots!???Earlier Mom had texted from South Carolina. In general she had been brave about selling almost everything she owned, only hanging onto what she felt strongly about. She did great. But today, after a bad feeling about the auctioneer???s general lack of focus on her teapot collection, she???d become aware through texting with friends that the teapots were selling too cheaply. She needed us to save some, however many we could. Evan bid on some, I circled back for others. Those we managed to save were not necessarily the ones she would have wanted from the outset, but here they were.Survivors.Clinkety pank, said the random assortment as Evan and I walked them to the Jeep. They were safe now, huddled in these boxes like an odd group of wallflowers filmed by a news crew outside some awful disco inferno, the lucky ones who???d been standing near the exits and got out before the whole place went up, huddled now together under blankets.Tragic!Pank??? pank, clink.There was a vague sense we might take them home and sell them on eBay. Maybe we will. It???s a lot of work, though, and besides???it???s hard for me to let anything go.Including the idea I might write a song someone would assign a value to and give me money for, like a teapot.I???ve always been like this.It???s not enough to write a great song about an Indy 500 driver, like Evan did. I want more and more and more people to hear it, to praise it, to remember it, to play it, to get it stuck in their heads. To buy it.As a kid I???d walked these exact fields feeling that way with a Scottie at the end of a leash, a handsome little dog leftover from when we lived in town. After she died I walked a series of rougher mutts without leashes. As I???d walked, I???d sung the dogs songs I was writing.From as early as I can remember music, I remember wanting to write music.I started a high school rock band, with the son of a construction company owner. He played bass. I played Elton-John-inflected piano. We debuted at a talent show held during sixth period at our high school???the whole gym was electric with",100
457," excitement. We killed with a raucous, wordless version of ???Travelling Band??? by CCR. It was transcendent. We brought down the house. Oh, Lord, what a feeling. Eventually we worked up an instrumental I???d written and the band won a talent show at the county seat town a few miles from our farmland school district, which I think helped recruit a charismatic plumber???s son who lived in that town and agreed to be our vocalist. He could sell ???Turn the Page??? and various Tom Petty songs. And ???Tush??? by ZZ Top. How exciting???a kid from the county seat with rock star charisma singing ???Lord, take me downtown???I???m just looking for some tush,??? while we jammed along behind him.None of my lyrics were ever finished to the point that I could imagine the plumber???s son singing them.One of the early songs went, ???Black toothpick trees/That let go of their leaves/Are all that seem real when it snows?????? I was stuck. I had no idea where that was leading. How were things other than the trees ???unreal???? I didn???t know.???The shadows dancing on the wall/Have one by one begun to fall/The people have not moved at all/Strange?????? Again, stuck. What could it mean????Colonel Scott came home one night and found he had no home/He stopped the clock, unplugged the lights and cut the telephone/He pushed a chest of drawers over up against the door/And thought of friends who he knew from the war?????? I had no idea where that was heading when I wrote it in high school, and have no idea now.I was no Taylor Swift. I couldn???t have written ???Fifteen??? at 15, or 18???or now, even, obviously, since I???m still trying to figure out how to compose a marketable country song that???s personal without appearing contrived.I still can???t make it work.I???ve always just been a yowly singer in a field with a dog and pretensions.Also teapots, on occasion.I think of Freedy Johnston.???I sold the dirt to feed the band??? is a piercing lyric from his song ???Trying To Tell You I Don???t Know.??? He grew up in Kansas, but was compelled to write and sing and rock all night. So he moved to New York. When he inherited a farm, he sold it for his music. A few years ago, Freedy came to perform in an art gallery near downtown Indianapolis, and the people staging the event had a little reading beforehand. They requested I read one of these columns, actually, which I did. I chose the scene where I awkwardly sing on a Nashville open stage after a truly gifted performer had just slayed the room. I???m told Freedy murmured to the organizer he???d had similar experiences. Nice to think we share that???Freedy is obviously more driven than I am, definitely a better singer and songwriter. I can picture him walking around a farm, though, like me, warbling songs he was making up.Then eventually selling that dirt.To feed (and provide necessary medical care for) (in my case) the folks.Dad???s still very much with us, calling every few days with complaints about the nursing home. Since neither he nor mom came to the sale, it felt like my sister and I were left alone to make like Freedy with the dirt. It???s a weird feeling.That dirt is backdrop to happy memories???the dog and the songs???but there are plenty of icky ones, like Dad under stress (I can now sympathize with mid-life pressures) angrily saying unfair things about my mom as we built hot-wire fencing to keep cows contained. I remember wanting him to shut up very badly and imagined throwing a hammer at his head.Included in the sale of the farm is that little Hallmark moment.Let???s also toss in the memory of the dead breech calf my dad blamed me for not saving, feeling I should have identified the distressed mother when I checked on the cows after school while he was at work, alerting him before summoning the large animal vet. I probably gave the herd a cursory onceover that day and went in to pound out ???Goodbye Yellow Brick Road??? on the piano that I spent most afternoons after school playing so aggressively that many of the keys broke. I learned to work around the broken keys, but it???s because of them we just left the piano inside the house for the new owner today and didn???t even try to auction it.There???s plenty of memories to leave behind. The nights the well ???lost its prime??? and I couldn???t manage to hold the flashlight where Dad wanted. Mornings mom was furious with me for making the school bus wait because I???d been ???dawdling.???I???d like to think the good memories and funny stories win, though. Let???s say they do. Practicing ???Jumping Jack Flash??? with the band in the garage, for example, the role of Jagger played by the plumber???s son. Growing up on the farm, though, I???d never had occasion to hear the Rolling Stones??? version (we had sheet music!) and I insisted on making it a keyboard-centric tune, playing that famous riff on a Fender Rhodes piano borrowed from the high school band room: ???Doont, doo, doo-dah-doo, doo-dah-doo?????? Ladies and Gentlemen, The Rolling Steely Dans!And let???s not forget hours in the sunroom listening to music, from comedy albums to hundreds of 45s???a genre-ignorant mishmash, from ???My Sharona??? to Glen Campbell???s ???Rhinestone Cowboy,??? from Blondie???s ???One Way or Another??? to Eddie Rabbit???s ???Driving My Life Away.??? Nighttime, after I did homework, I???d put big headphones on with a spiral cord attached to a big console???and even with those Radio Shack ???phones the noise of actual farm crickets was so loud it blended with the recorded crickets on the transition between ???You Never Give Me Your Money??? and ???Sun King??? on Abbey Road side two. In that room I listened to the original cast recording of The Music Man so much that I memorized all the words and sang those incredibly clever songs to the dogs when walking her/him/them, gracing them with a little Meredith Wilson when I wasn???t working on ???Black Toothpick Trees??? or failing to spot breech births or warbling Elton. ???Cash for the merchandise, cash for the merchandise??????The farm is where I first played with melody, interior rhyming and prosody???the pleasing sound of words supporting their own meaning???even as I failed to find resonant emotional truths.Maybe I???ll figure it out eventually.I???ve definitely managed to save a lot of material, these random memories from those farm days.Also teapots.Who knows what any of them are actually worth.We here at NoneMedical know what a hassle it can be to get quality healthcare when you need it.

Inflammatory statements about race ??? I know, I know, who talks about race in a creative writing MFA program? How gauche. I realize that this was not a good or cool thing to do, that your safe writing space was interrupted by an uppity Latino with a big mouth. So let me apologize for all of the statements that I made:I???m sorry for saying that the one Latin@ character you wrote in workshop was both clich??d and racist. I see now that if you write a maid character, OF COURSE she would need to be Mexican. Have you ever seen a non-Mexican maid? Ha! The concept doesn???t even make sense! And if you have a Mexican maid, she should OBVIOUSLY speak broken English. How else would the reader know that this maid character was Mexican ??? a trait that impacted the story at every turn and wasn???t just because she was a maid. And you???re right, white people in my MFA program, to tell me that it wasn???t really offensive. You would know, after all. And I should be happy that there was Latin@ representation in fiction in the first place.You were right to say that because I don???t have an accent I???m not really Latino, just tan. I was simply holding on to family pictures and stories and accented aunts and grandmothers and the way my cheekbones sit and my preference for salty, garlic-y food and my last name and family trees and you know, that sort of stuff. In fact, I am honored, HONORED, that you???d bestow the title of ???White??? upon me. It???s really what I???ve wanted for my whole life!Mea culpa! Thank you, THANK YOU, for explaining to me that White Privilege isn???t a thing. I now realize that white people have just as many problems as people of color. Just as many and basically the same kind. We???re all just Jay-Z with our 99 problems (Don???t worry! I won???t finish the line because we are all united in our fight against misogyny ??? a fight that has absolutely nothing to do with race). I mean, if there was such a thing as white privilege, would we have so many people of color in our program? (We have two. Which is a lot when you think about it. I mean, our program only has, like, 65 people in it.)Lo siento por calling you ???Cracker ass honkey gringo motherfuckers??? and suggesting that we stop accepting white people into the program until we have a higher representation of people of color. I was hungry when I said those things. And I took some time and thought about your point that I was being ???reverse racist??? and decided that you are correct in that, too. Oh, and sorry for calling the phrase reverse racism ???stupid whitey bullshit that doesn???t exist.??? Again, I was really hungry.You opened my eyes when you asked how I could call myself Latino when you, a white person, speaks more Spanish than I do. You are actually way more Latin@ than I am!

Play your cards right and maybe you???ll get invited to the Christmas photos!Finally, I???m sorry for bringing up race at all. I was just playing the race card. I was being overly sensitive. I am too pale to really be speaking for other Latin@s. Why derail our conversations about bell hooks with talk about being one of the only people of color in the room?

459,"t, impactful, epic 18 months of my life. It???s with a heady mix of sorrow, excitement and the fumes from evaporating plastics that I accept it is time to move on to the next phase: settling down on a blazing garbage dump fire.When I first told my friends I was moving, their reaction was anything but supportive. ???Are you insane?!??? they sneered. ???It???s literally garbage that???s literally on fire???? they cajoled. ???You???ll die if you live in an inferno of refuse!??? they condescended. As if anyone could live outside of New York!The fact is that we New Yorkers like to look down our noses at anyone who lives anywhere that isn???t here (and isn???t a literal pile of garbage). And don???t even get me started on the whole ???on fire??? thing! Did you know that we???ve become so accustomed to not being on fire that we have entire stations full of people whose only job is to put out fires? Just three months ago, I was so caught up in the NYC mindset, I wouldn???t have even thought twice about calling these ???fire men??? if even a small fire broke out in my apartment anytime, day or night. That???s the city that never sleeps for you.My wakeup call came one day over brunch. I was sitting there eating a six-dollar scone when I realized the bakery that made that scone sends THE VERY SAME SCONES to the incinerator that started the garbage fire. Here I was, cramped, waiting 40 minutes for a table for the privilege of paying six dollars for a scone when I could be eating the exact same thing for next to nothing, with all the space I like! If I???d just trade a table for an old drum of fish trimmings and the oppressive New York humidity for a nice, dry fire. I felt pretty dumb.And I???ve already met a ton of like-minded people who have traded it all for the simpler life of the ol??? basura en fuego (that might not be right: I picked up as much as I could from an old Spanish textbook I found there before it vaporized). There???s Dan, the landlord. He???s the kind of salt-of-the-Earth guy who doesn???t care what you do as long as you give him $20 to get into the dump. I???m not sure many New Yorkers would understand his libertarian charm. And then there???s Yuri, the guy who???s always dumping body bags full of just regular garbage. What a nut. We???re trying to get a softball team together. That???s pretty much it for now, but I hear other creative New Yorkers are flocking here with blazing speed. (That???s the kind of highbrow humor we appreciate in the valley between the tires and the organic waste.)And what if I want to raise kids one day? Can you put a price on having the space to throw a ball around with your son? Or melt down Legos with your daughter so you can finally make curved shapes? Plus, I hear the schools are top-notch.We have a saying down at the garbage fire, ???AAAAAAHHHH! NO!! It burns!!!!??? I think that about sums up how I feel about the move: ???NO!!??? about leaving but ???It burns!!!!??? about the excitement of the garbage fire. It won???t be New York, but it has plenty going for it. I think I???m gonna really come to enjoy the way it consumes my flesh. So next time you see me, forgive the satisfied look in the hollows where my eyes used to be. I???ll just be loving that sweet, free life of a literal giant, flaming pile of garbage.Experimental jazz brunchOff-brand hummusYour mom discovered emojisOffice kitchen small talk while you???re waiting for the microwave, and then you have to defend your chicken parm Lean Cuisine to the smug vegan from engineeringWet kissingWet childrenWet cheeseAn elevator ride with three improv comediansUntimely nether itchesAttending a casual get-together at your cousin???s apartment and, surprise, it???s a Jamberry partyNew HampshireMcSweeney???s Internet Tendency contributor Jesse Eisenberg???s funny new collection, Bream Gives Me Hiccups, contains several pieces that appeared on our electronic pages.

Bream Gives Me Hiccups is available to purchase at your nearest independent bookseller.- -[Originally published May 24, 2012.]- -Last night, Mom took me to Sushi Nozawa, near Matt???s house. Except she didn???t let Matt come with us and I had to leave in the middle of my favorite show because Mom said we would be late for our reservation and that I didn???t know who she had to blow on to get the reservation.At the front of Sushi Nozawa is a mean woman. When I asked Mom why the woman is so angry, Mom said it???s because she???s Japanese and that it???s cultural. The woman at school who serves lunch is also mean but she is not Japanese. Maybe it???s just serving food that makes people angry.Sushi Nozawa does not have any menus, which Mom said made it fancy. The Sushi chef is very serious and he stands behind a counter and serves the people whatever he wants. He is also mean.The first thing they brought us was a rolled up wet washcloth, which I unrolled and put on my lap because Mom always said that the first thing I have to do in a nice restaurant is put the napkin in my lap. But this napkin was hot and wet and made me feel like I peed my pants. Mom got angry and asked me if I was stupid.The mean woman then brought a little bowl of mashed up red fish bodies in a brown sauce and said that it was tuna fish, which I guess was a lie because it didn???t taste like tuna and made me want to puke right there at the table. But Mom said that I have to eat it because Sushi Nozawa was ???famous for their tuna.??? At school, there is a kid named Billy who everyone secretly calls Billy the Bully and who puts toothpaste on the teacher???s chair before she comes into the classroom. He is also famous.Mom said they have egg so I asked for two eggs, but when the mean woman brought them, they didn???t look like eggs; they looked like dirty sponges and I spit it out on the table in front of Mom, who slammed her hands on the table and made the plates rattle and so I got scared and spit out more sponge on Mom???s hands and Mom yelled at me in a weird whispery voice, saying that the only reason she took me to the restaurant is so that Dad would pay for it. Then I started crying and little bits of the gross egg came out of my nose with snot and Mom started laughing in a nice way and gave me a hug and told me to be more quiet.The mean woman brought me and Mom little plates of more gross fish bodies on rice. I asked Mom to take off the fish part so I could eat the rice. Mom said, ???Great, more for me,??? and ate my fish. I like rice because Mom said it???s like Japanese bread but it has no crusts, which is good for me because I don???t eat crusts anyway. I also like it when Mom says ???Great, more for me??? because it seems like that is her happiest expression.When the woman brought the bill, Mom smiled at her and said thank you, which was a lie, because Mom hates when people bring her the bill. When Mom and Dad were married, Mom would always pretend like she was going to pay and when Dad took the bill, which he always did, she said more lies like, ???Are you sure? Okay, wow, thanks honey.??? Now that Dad doesn???t eat with us anymore, maybe I should pretend to take the bill from Mom and say a lie like, ???Oh really? Okay, thanks Mom??? but I don???t because lies are for adults who are sad in their lives.The mean woman took the bill back without saying thank you. I guess she is not sad. But she is definitely angry.I understand why the people who work here are so angry. I guess it???s like working at a gas station, but instead of cars, they have to fill up people. And people eat slowly and talk about their stupid lives at the table and",100
460," make each other laugh but when the people who serve the food come by, they stop laughing and talking and become quiet like they don???t want to let anyone else know about their great jokes. And if the people who bring the food talk about their lives, they???re not allowed to talk about how bad it is, only how good it is, like, ???I???m doing great, how are you???? And if they say something truthful like, ""I???m doing terrible, I???m a waiter here,??? they will probably get fired and then they will be even worse. So it???s probably always a good idea to talk about things happily. But sometimes that???s impossible. That???s why I???m giving Sushi Nozawa 16 out of 2000 stars.Or at least, she could be. I don???t know! Class hasn???t started yet.See that? That???s called a cliffhanger. It gets the reader interested because they don???t know the answer, and neither do you. Examples include: ???Are you sure you love me? Are you really sure? Also, do you have a crush on Jason???? Asking questions like that is what makes you a good writer. It is also what makes your girlfriend call you clingy. Or was it too attached?That???s ambiguity. William Empson thought there were seven types of ambiguity, but I know there are 412 types, one for every day we were together.Here we have hyperbole. It involves a vast over-estimation of an object. Incidentally, that???s also how Freud defined love. For example, love will convince you that she was telling the truth when she said that she???d never had an orgasm before you.Speaking of, here???s the climax!What will I do if my ex-girlfriend is in my creative writing seminar? That???s a rhetorical question, used in apostrophe. Apostrophe is when you talk to an entity who can???t actually answer you back, like for example, a nightingale, or Psyche, or not your creative writing professor. Asking your creative writing professor if a certain somebody will be attending his class in the fall, for instance, is not an example of apostrophe because your creative writing professor can answer you back. Should answer you back. Professor Lowell?But hey, even if she is in the same class as me, even though we haven???t talked in the year since I found out she slept with Jason while they were ???studying??? abroad in Shanghai, it could be worse. Like, I could need glasses. That???s hyperbole again, except not really, because I mean it. Needing glasses must be awful. It must make you so insecure about your virility that you have to over-compensate by sleeping with someone else???s girlfriend, Jason. Needing glasses must make you bitter, bitter enough to prey on girls who probably have mixed up ideas about men anyway because their own Dads need glasses, even though Margaret???s Dad (Louis) was otherwise very nice. Needing glasses, actually, and I hope your eyesight deteriorates, too, Margaret, needing glasses must be even, somehow, worse than having your ex-girlfriend in your creative writing seminar, so, there, that???s reconciliation, which leads to catharsis, which leads to my first A in the class, am I right?1.

I???d just gotten full extension on my 23rd AMRAP set of kettlebell single-leg rotational deadlifts when most of the muscle cells in my body began exploding and that big-boy weight came crashing down on top of me crushing multiple internal organs. Don???t worry. I???m fine. In fact, news of this latest PR got me so amped I was able to rep out 100 burpees before my stitches popped and I began to bleed out again.The real workout starts when medical professionals are begging you to stop.When I first started reviewing movies, I was chained to a desk job and struggling to squeeze in 30 minutes on the elliptical with all the other self-defeating chubbers refusing to live up to their full potential. Unable to afford the paleo paste of high-protein carrion and seaweed that I thrive on today, I was still eating food. I had the kind of average body that, if you saw it, would make you want to puke.Oh thrusters! Oh muscle-ups! I stand ready to be transformed. I will bathe myself in sweat if you wash away the hated flab.So I cashed in my 401(k) to join an elite fitness community that meets in an oil-stained garage in the heavy industrial area outside of town, and started the first blog dedicated to healthy male bodies in the movies. Back then, if you wanted to watch an actor with lean muscle mass on the big screen, your options were adult theaters specializing in gay pornography and simulcasts of men???s gymnastics. Now I can be watching an indie flick about some slob who eats fast food at his desk for every meal, but if he pops his shirt off he???ll look like a dehydrated endurance athlete who just finished repping out 500 push-ups. On my best days, I like to think I helped usher in this new golden age.I want to inspire people. I want someone to look at me and say, ???Because of you I didn???t give up. Because of you I???m not gross anymore.???The review that earned me my current gig as film critic for Crossfit???s official magazine was for Les Mis??rables in 2012. Like anyone with a beating heart and a chiseled torso whose muscles piston in beautiful harmony when he runs 100-meter suicides shirtless on the beach ??? I loved Hugh Jackman???s vascular performance.  I zeroed in on the scene-stealing work of his forearms, writing, ???Here, this oft-neglected region of the body isn???t just sinew and ropy muscle, but a window into the shredded songbird???s tortured soul. Wordlessly they speak of Jean Valjean???s lonely imprisonment ??? of endless nights filled with endurance-testing bodyweight exercises and furious masturbation.???Of course, my opinions haven???t always been popular. My essay ???Why Are So Many Film Critics Blowing Their Loads Over Glamour Muscles???? had some harsh words for my peers. I was the lone vote for ???300??? as the best film of all time in the last Sight & Sound poll, and I???m still getting blowback for tweeting the day that Philip Seymour Hoffman died that Capote and Synecdoche, New York would???ve been better if they???d starred Joe Manganiello.Keep away from people who try to belittle your ambitions. Small people always do that, but the great ones have optimal muscle density.But like anyone who walks into a box strong and crawls out stronger knows ??? it???s results that matter. Jai Courtney taking home the Academy Award for Best Actor was huge for fans of powerful physical acting. His sculpted lats were the muscular heart of the American Gigolo remake, expressing Julian???s thwarted desire to transpose physical and socio-economic mobility. (Y",100
461,"ou got one right for once, Oscars!) I???m also overseeing a project for Criterion, digitally updating American classics to bring the actors??? physiques in line with modern sensibilities. Finally, Gregory Peck???s pecs will be as firm and unyielding as Atticus Finch???s moral courage.Now if you???re worrying if all this recognition will change me??? don???t. I still love going to the movies, I still love getting after that #FitLife, and I still have a body fat percentage so low I can no longer produce sperm.Whenever you want to quit your workout, just imagine yourself climaxing like a warrior king at peace with being the last of his bloodline ??? your emission as soft and dry as dandelion seeds.I also have a lot more to accomplish before I reach the ultra-fit nirvana that lies just beyond system-wide organ failure. I want to dedicate more of my column to notable women???s performances. We???ve nearly achieved a beautiful uniformity with the male actor???s physique, so it???s distressing to see such a variety of women???s body shapes and sizes in the movies today.And, of course, I will keep hitting the box every day ??? ever seeking that next PR, always preparing for whatever contingency life throws at me next.Should civilization crumble ??? seek the desert!

By the time the clouds have cleared, and the strange pink flashes have faded from the sky, the Defiant is out on the open sea, San Francisco ablaze behind it. What follows is an adventure that will change the classmates??? lives forever ??? a journey across a dangerous ocean in search of a new home, with only their instincts and each other to rely on. Can they master the ship? Can they work together, and defend themselves against the unexpected adversaries they encounter on the way? Will they ever find land? You???ll have to join their voyage to find out.A remarkable debut in the tradition of Gulliver???s Travels and Lord of the Flies, M. Quint???s The Defiant creates a world that???s all its own ??? thrilling and wholly original, filled with strange energies and superstitious survivors, and dozens of moments you won???t soon forget.Today we???re featuring an excerpt from the book, which comes out on September 29, 2015. Mac Barnett, the bestselling author of the Brixton Brothers and The Terrible Two series, calls it ???by turns exciting, dark, and moving ??? it???s a hallucinatory and mysterious take on the pirate novels I loved as a kid.??? You can order the book, which features more than 20 illustrations by Lily Padula, at the McSweeney???s Store.- - -Back on deck, Farn opened the floor for any questions. Instantly, Carlos???s hand bolted into the air.???Yes???? Farn said, and sighed. ???You. Go ahead.??????How do we know all the stuff you told us is right????For a moment, Farn looked taken aback. ???Well,??? he replied carefully, ???the Institute for Nautical Archeology issued an extensive report on the excavation and restoration of the Defiant that you are welcome to read yourself.??? He crossed his arms defensively. ???But even before that, studying these great ships has been my life???s work. Of course, examination of various documents and manuscripts can help describe the practice of Iberian shipbuilding, but regular records weren???t kept until the sixteenth century???long after the Defiant had already been lost. In this ship???s time, such information was safeguarded in the minds of skilled masters who passed on their traditions orally, from generation to generation. Their secrecy ensured that their knowledge would not be stolen by competitors. They left nothing in writing, except for?????????Hey!??? Rose called out. ???What???s Gabe looking at????Farn turned. Without anyone noticing, Gabriel had slipped away from the group again, and was now standing before the great glass box he???d passed by before. It nearly reached his chest.???Ah,??? Farn smiled back at Rose. ???Perfect segue, my dear. Let???s go have a look.???The students scrambled across the deck, eager to see what Gabriel had found. They crowded around the box, jostling each other to get a better look. And there, inside the case, resting on raised blocks, was an enormous, ancient book. It lay open at its center, a long length of deep crimson satin resting in the spine like a tongue. Long, fluid curls of ink swept and dipped across the pages, dancing along in a bold hand.Illustration by Lily Padula???What is it???? Esme breathed.???The Codex Mare.??? Farn???s grey eyes glittered as he spoke the name. ???I was?????????What???s it do???? Carlos cried. ???Why???s it in that box? Who wrote it???????Carlos, please,??? Ms. Inez said sternly. ???Let Mr. Farn finish his talk.??????I just?????????This isn???t your personal tour,??? Quincy said hotly. Ms. Inez held up a hand.???Everyone can ask questions at the end.??? She turned back to Farn. ???Please, go on.???Farn gave the teacher a tight smile, then turned to the students. ???It was Ventana himself who wrote it,??? he said. ???It???s part journal, part instructions for operation and maintenance of the Defiant. Its latter third is composed entirely of maps???from Portugal down past Africa through the South Atlantic, up across South America through the Pacific and into the New World.??????That???s here???America,??? Carlos whispered to Rose.???I know that,??? Rose snapped.???Ventana???s maps,??? Farn continued, ???chronicle which islands he found",100
462," along the way had reserves he could use???meaning food and fresh water.??? Farn tapped the glass with a crooked index finger. ???I hope you children realize what an enormous privilege it is to actually see the Codex Mare in real life. Until 1992, historians could not even say absolutely whether the Codex was real, or simply legend.??????Why not???? Rose and Baron said together.Farn let the tension build in the air for a few more seconds, then went on, his words echoing the thought running through Gabriel???s head.???It was missing for nearly four hundred years!??????Where was it???? Carlos cried out.Quincy rolled his eyes. ???Missing, moron.??????Now, now,??? Farn warned, ???that???s a fair question.??? Carlos stuck out his tongue at Quincy, but Farn ignored them both. ???There are some theories as to its whereabouts during that time. It???s believed that the Codex was secretly passed from hand to hand among Spanish sailors in the hundred years after Ventana???s death in 1468. This was done to maintain control of Ventana???s routes. After that it seems that the Portuguese and Germans had it for a time???possibly the British, too. We can infer this from the inscriptions on the back inset page, where those in possession of the Codex wrote their names. But the names stop at 1601, and there are no records of its use after that until it was discovered in 1992, in the wine cellar of an old Spanish monastery.???Standing on her tiptoes, Rose looked up from the Codex and frowned. ???I can???t understand it.??????That???s because it???s in Spanish,??? said Baron, adjusting his glasses.???But I can???t read Spanish,??? Rose grumbled.???Gabe can,??? Esme offered.Gabriel didn???t move. Silence wrapped around the deck as all eyes fell on him. Esme was just about to repeat herself when Angelica cackled, ???Muy bien.??????I wouldn???t laugh, young lady,??? Farn said, his low voice rolling across the deck. He peered down at Angelica.???Why???s that???? she mumbled, casting her eyes away from Farn???s stern look.???In Ventana???s time, there was no more coveted item than the Codex Mare. Rival explorers fought fierce battles for its possession long past Ventana???s death.???Angelica looked up cautiously at Farn.???Why???? she asked.???The Codex contains all the secrets of the great seas,??? Farn replied, his face serious and drawn with purpose.???You couldn???t sail without the Codex back then???? Carlos breathed, his nose pressed against the glass case.???Of course it was possible to sail without the Codex,??? Farn said, turning toward the younger boy. ???But explorers often perished along those dangerous journeys, drifting into deadly waters or perilous islands. Or they might have failed to find land at all, and simply starved to death. It was Ventana who blazed the path from Portugal to the Americas and back again, sailing it more times than any other explorer. He documented the route thoroughly. The Codex holds that documentation.??????The other explorers died???? Angelica???s eyes glistened and grew wide. Farn nodded gravely.???But with the Codex in their possession, they had a secret weapon: Ventana???s knowledge of the seas.???Farn let the silence that followed hang in the air a moment before shattering it with another loud clap.???Now. Navigation! Who knows how Ventana knew where he was sailing? How he found his way.??????The stars???? Quincy said tentatively.???Exactly! Yes!??? Farn did a little hop in the air and whirled toward Quincy. ???But how????Quincy gave an indifferent shrug. Farn was poised to press the question when a loud sigh broke out from behind him. He turned to find Baron, eyebrows raised, lips pursed.???They used Polaris. The North Star.

I???ve been told that people think I???m a hard or difficult professor, that I am never impressed. Well, they???re right. I never like my students, and if I do like you, you???re probably smart, but also smarter than the other smart people. Double smart.[The Kid Who Talks Too Much shuffles in his seat. He is special. He will be the one to get through to the professor.]PROFESSOR: But, that???s not going to happen. However, I still want to learn your names, even though I won???t care about anyone in here unless they???re important, and none of you will prove that to me, and if you did it???d be even more special because I???m so hard to impress. It???d be impossible. But, let???s call role. Carl Adams?CARL: Present.PROFESSOR: Kid Who Talks Too Much?KWTTM: Here.PROFESSOR: Hmm???

Not many students receive such high marks from Dr. Tripp.KWTTM: Thank you, I appreciate it.PROFESSOR: Well, we can talk more after this class, but have you seen Good Will Hunting????no, no, after class, after class, either way, great to have you, truly great.PROFESSOR: All right, let???s just dive right into the material. Does anyone know about Obscure Field of Thought or Definition That Only True Intellectuals Would Be Able to Describe With Nuance and Accuracy?[The Kid Who Talks Too Much raises his hand.]PROFESSOR: Oh, well, here will be the real test.[The Kid Who Talks Too Much provides a concise answer to the question that is thorough but not meandering. The professor nods and smiles as the Kid Who Talks Too Much continues, managing to sound endearing, curious, and not authoritative while clearly being very knowledgeable, he finishes with his own theory expanding upon these ideas.]PROFESSOR: Well??? that removes a good bit of today???s lecture (chortles). Yes, that???s it exactly. But what were you saying about your own thoughts on???KWTTM: Oh, I was just postulating that???[The Kid Who Talks Too Much elucidates on perfectly logical statement that no other author has said.]PROFESSOR: Are you suggesting that???[The professor goes on to discuss the possible new fundamental understanding of subject with awe and wonder.]KWTTM: Well, it???s just something I guess I???ve been thinking about. But, yes.PROFESSOR: I???m sorry class, but I must call in all the other Important People in the area, because what has been said will shatter our understandings of not only this topic but the entire basis of this academic institution.KWTTM: I was just answering the ques???[Every important person within a 15-mile radius comes sprinting into the room, covered in sweat.]PROFESSOR: Say it again.KWTTM: Well, I was just saying???[The Kid Who Talks Too Much repeats theory.]IMPORTANT PERSON #1: Is he saying that???PROFESSOR: Yes.IMPORTANT PERSON #2: Everything has changed.IMPORTANT PERSON #3: He has??? call the??? it???s all???IMPORTANT PERSON #1: Only the smartest person ever could do this.

I had a feeling about some of this, but it???s nice to hear other people say it.You didn???t ask me what I do, but I know you are curious because I could see it in your eyes as you walked past me, so I shall tell you my story, my new friend in a vintage Slayer shirt.I study history; well, at least I took a few courses at Oberlin b",100
464,"efore I made my way to the shores of New York City and ended up a real greenhorn in Brooklyn. I was only in college for two years, but what I learned in my studies is that there was a time when things used to be so quaint and so much easier! That time, dear sir, was the 19th century, and the place was the Pale of the Settlement! Oy vey iz mir! How magical it must have been! So cozy! And the people were real and down to earth; nothing like people today. That???s why I, Sean the beard balm maker, decided that everything in my daily life should be connected to that time and place, from the food I eat to the clothes I wear.Oh, but you want to know more about my beard balm, so I will tell you about my beard balm then. First I will say that two years ago, with a little help from my grandfather Nathan, the owner of a successful chain of gas stations ??? may he rest in peace ??? I was able to purchase a studio apartment with a small yard that I heard has quadrupled in value since I bought it. A blessing for sure, but life has not been easy for me. Yet I go on.What is my day like, you haven???t asked but I???m sure you???re curious about? Every morning I awake before the sun rises. I spend my time usually working, studying or composing letters to my father, Reb Steve, the litigator of Scarsdale. My father is a kind and learned man who went to Columbia Law, and when he makes the journey all the way to Brooklyn, I tell you he has no problem helping me out whenever I need it ??? which is about once every month or so. He sees there are no lights in my home, only candles, but he makes no judgments. He understands that in my little yard I keep chickens that I raise until they???re fat enough and then I slaughter them and use every part of them for my food save for the feathers, the claws, and the head and maybe the breast because white meat? Feh!  And it was my father who gave me the seed money to start Shlomo???s All Natural Beard Balm made from the finest oils and the schmaltz from my little chickens and sell for around thirty dollars for a 2 oz. tin that you can buy right here or on my Etsy store.Of course, my dear friend, you must be thinking, Sean the beard balm maker, you live a hard life. This is true. Out here in my little village of Williamsburg, it is hard to adapt the antiquated ways of a time that isn???t my own into the 21st century; but I do. On the Sabbath, I have worked out a deal with Brian the bartender that I should have credit and pay him after the holiest day of the week because I can???t carry money with me during that time. Although I???m not religious, I find observing traditions to be important. I barter at the farmers market despite the fact that the people working there tell me the prices are set. Ah ha! That just means they truly want to haggle, and there is nothing I love more than arguing over the price of an onion or head of garlic!Of course, there are hardships, much like the Jews of the Pale faced. For instance: I went to Michael the butcher at the local market and tried to barter two-dozen chicken necks, perhaps for some vegetables and salt. Do you know what he asked me? ???What would I do with all of those necks? Who needs necks???? Can you believe that mishegas? Who doesn???t need chicken necks? I also don???t have a refrigerator, not so much because they didn???t have them in the 19th century, but because it broke and I???m just fine keeping the fish fresh by letting them swim in my bathtub until it???s time to eat them. Even my yarmulke ??? my kippah ??? that I wear on my head for reasons I???m not totally clear on was a struggle to make since I don???t like the knitted ones. Instead, I cut apart an old pair of selvedge denim jeans that I wore in what feels like another life, I brought the rags to the dry cleaner and asked them to make me a yarmulke!I tell you, my bored looking friend, if I were a rich man I???d live so much easier! But I am living my dream to live sort of like an impoverished person from a different time, wearing heavy clothing and fur hats in the summer and freezing in the winter because the building has a faulty heating system. Even our doorman has to sit next to a space heater to keep warm. Yes, it???s a shanda on the part of the oppressive co-op board that thing isn???t fixed, but, as it is, this is the life I live here in my little Brooklyn shtetl, and it would be wonderful if you bought some of my beard balm because it???s really slow here today at the artisanal flea market where I make my living.I have a really well thought out opinion on what I???m about to write. I???m 19, but I have the wisdom and life experience of someone super old. Nothing I???m going to say is based on facts.Listen to me.I know so many things, in my heart. In middle school, I had a crush on a boy who was half Asian. Or maybe he was Colombian. Either way, now I understand race relations in the United States. My mother had two glasses of wine once on our boat, so I have witnessed domestic abuse first-hand. I understand that things are systemic, and now you know that I know the word ???systemic.??? I almost read the Economist once. I know so many things. I probably know them all.But let???s get back to the topic at hand. It???s very close to me. It happened to my sister???s friend???s cousin, so I know what it???s like to feel the effects of it ripple through society. What is it, you ask? I don???t think I need to mention it. If you were paying attention, you???d know.Once I watched a documentary about it while listening to a podcast about it and performing an interpretive dance referencing it. It was emotional.What???s important is that we can???t really do anything about it. No one knows what to do about it. I don???t know what to do about it, and neither do you. It???s important to talk about it, even though I???m not going to read about it, or attempt to learn in any capacity. It???s important I completely ignore the people who work every day to make a tangible difference in this particular area. What???s most important is for me to talk about it based on me wanting to talk about it.I have no solutions. In fact, I don???t even have any questions. But I want you to know that I know how to type.I know how to type.Like father, like son???if Phil, Sr. posts something that you like on Facebook, you have to like something Phil, Jr. posts. They have this weird, unspoken father-son rivalry going about who gets more Facebook likes, and it???s best not to play sides, since Phil, Sr. is incredibly immature and thin-skinned, and his son is pretty much just like him.???Hey, my favorite team of all time is the 1972 Miami Dolphins, they were the only undefeated team in NFL history.???This shows you aren???t some newbie who???s never watched a football game from start to finish before even though you???re a newbie who???s never watched a football game from start to finish before.- -???Hey, this team certainly isn???t the 1972 Miami Dolphins.???Use this when one of the teams makes a bad play.- -???Hey, 1972 called ??? they want the 1972 Miami Dolphins back.???This will work when one of the teams makes an even worse play.

While it is the goal of the comedian to get the audience to laugh as one, not every comedian is for everyone. As varied and specific as people???s preferences are in food or music, comedy is even more subjective.  So when a comedian comes along that most everyone enjoys and respects, it???s an astoundingly rare thing. But that is Jim Gaffigan.I first met Jim in the late 1990s when I was working as a creative executive at Studios USA (now NBC/Universal). At that time, Jim made his debut on fellow Hoosier David Letterman???s Late Show. His act was meticulously crafted, squeaky clean and showcased his gift for extended runs on subjects one might not assume would merit such expansive exploration. (He had a long piece about manatees that was a personal favorite of mine.)  CBS made a deal to develop a series for Jim through Letterman???s Worldwide Pants, as they previously had done to great success with Ray Romano. We became the studio on the project, which meant that we brought resources and creative input. The process of developing a big network sitcom is often a traffic jam of opinions and agendas, but this one felt pretty good, as traffic jams go. And in the spring of 2000, the network ordered Welcome to New York to series.During the course of making the pilot, Jim discovered that I had spent my pre-executive teens and early 20s as a working stand-up comic. From the moment of that revelation on, Jim and I became friends. You see, a bond exists between comedians similar to the kinship felt between military veterans. There???s a language and sense of common experience that only comedians share, regardless of age, background or geography. Like the well-worn ???you weren???t there??? clich?? among vets, comedians just always seem to relate more comfortably to one another than to ???civilians.??? Cut to the eve of the CBS upfront in New York. Jim and I were in attendance at a celebration at the home of Worldwide Pants executive producer Rob Burnett. Letterman even made a brief appearance at the party, although he pretty much kept to himself. Similarly, Jim and I stood huddled in a corner, never feeling entirely comfortable in our skins. So when Jim decided to duck out early to hit a few comedy clubs for stage time, I leapt at his invitation to tag along. Even as he was about to star in his own TV series, Jim still felt most at home breathing the air of New York City???s basement comedy clubs.Unfortunately Welcome to New York lasted only one season. And while it was a funny, well-produced show, it also really wasn???t about Jim. It simply cast him as a TV weatherman from Indiana who became a fish out of water on a New York based morning show. But because the character???s name was ???Jim Gaffigan,??? it seemed that this might be his one shot at having a network sitcom. Undaunted, Jim soldiered on with his life and his career. And his perspective and persona sharpened after he got married, had kids and found a niche in crafting long signature riffs on food (hot pockets, bacon, doughnuts, etc.) He also discovered his ???inside voice,??? a device that offered commentary to Jim???s material from his imagined perspective of the audience. As I have observed time and again, the best comedians only get better with time. And while Jim was a solid act when we first met, I watched in awe and admiration as he grew to become one of the nation???s finest and most beloved comedians.In 2009, after a decade and a half hiatus from performing, I got the itch to try my hand at stand-up again. And when I say ???itch??? I truly mean as in the way someone who had been rubbed head to toe in poison ivy gets an ???itch.???  It was a difficult period in my life and stand-up seemed like the cure for what ailed me. Later that year, I was invited to perform at a club in New York City and, to my great surprise, Jim was booked on the same show. To my great terror, I was scheduled to follow him. I begged to have our spots flipped, but comic-to-comic, Jim tried to talk me down, assuring me that as a clean, mild-mannered performer, he???s not a tough act to follow. I couldn???t imagine how that could be the case, as Jim was now one of the top drawing arena acts in the country. But unlike the stereotype of the hyper-competitive comedian, I knew Jim wasn???t the type to set me up to fail. So I accepted the challenge. If anything, I experienced the phenomenon of ???the Gaffigan lift,??? enjoying riding in on the wave of goodwill he created with that crowd. Following him remains one of the highlights of my brief return to stand-up.A couple of years later, I was working as a development and programming executive at the cable network IFC when I got a call from Jim???s manager, Alex Murray.  Alex said that Jim wanted to come in for a meeting. Of course I was thrilled to sit down with him, but I was incredulous. Why would someone with such massive broad appeal even contemplate coming",100
466," into our little sandbox? Don???t get me wrong, I was proud of the work we were doing. But our reach was hardly as broad as Jim???s. When we met in my office, Jim explained that he???d been through the wringer elsewhere, trying to develop a semi-autobiographical series that was true to his voice. While I understood his frustration, and would have liked nothing more than to bring a big name like Gaffigan to the channel, I felt honor-bound to tell him the truth. I encouraged Jim to continue to fight to get the show he envisioned onto the biggest stage possible, assuring him that if all else failed he could always come back to us. That counsel would be my ongoing refrain every time I saw Jim after that??? usually at some big industry event where we???d find ourselves hanging out on the sidelines, as we had so many years before.The road one travels in entertainment is rarely a straight line. Jim continued to knock on the doors of the big broadcast networks, eventually landing a deal at TV Land for his new series. I visited Jim and his wife and writing partner Jeannie on the set of the show a few months ago. He looked exhausted but happy as he devoured a bag of Auntie Anne pretzels between scenes. He and Jeannie seemed confident in the work. Now having seen the show, I understand why. A few days ago it was announced that it???s been picked up for a second season. Finally, Jim is having his moment. And boy is he ready for it.You ordered, and boom, now I gotta go ??? I???m off on my bike and I???m fast as lightning. This is how it works! I???m prepared to deliver your sandwich. I am losing feeling in my groin. I am literally losing the ability to have children as my crotch is pressed tighter and tighter to this hard icepick of a bike seat. My sneakers are on! They are non-slip and my practiced legs are pumping with an experienced motion perfected over time. I pretend I am a Zamboni as I conquer distances with ultimate speed.I???m the Jimmy John???s Delivery Boy! I am unable to skirt an abandoned gallon of Minute Maid juice someone left out by their garbage can. I love your sandwich so much. I can???t wait to deliver the sandwich to you that I love so much and I love you, too, so much, only if you love me back.No really! I???m a delivery boy and I deliver your sandwich and that???s my job! It???s what I do! Ha, alright. I am covered in Minute Maid from head to toe and I am already beginning to mourn the loss of my unborn sons, John and Midge. I catch a whir of a cat pawing a tree in my periphery. Another trash can, a lady walking on the sidewalk in a sweat suit ??? ha, the world is amazing! It???s funny that no one uses their mailboxes anymore. They???re a slow system, and hey, I know a thing or two about speed and convenience.I???m the Jimmy John???s Delivery Boy and there is a large German shepherd bounding after my bicycle! I take this moment as an opportunity to appreciate the sandwich that I am bringing to you with speed and convenience.My long hair is whipping into my eyes but I am pumping my legs with a practiced skill. There???s another dog on the next block. The dog days of summer! A golden retriever, legs upright in the middle of the street! Alright! There???s Minute Maid and blood all over my sneakers. There???s wind literally pummeling the Minute Maid onto my face. I???m prepared to deliver your sandwich. You asked this of me and I???m bringing it to you and the world is amazing and full of dogs, all the time.I???m the Jimmy John???s Delivery Boy! I took a tumble on 49th when a Cadillac Eldorado literally lambasted me in the face as it tried to avoid the two dogs!The shepherd and the retriever with the legs up are tightly pressed against the Eldorado bleeding out their tiny dog souls. The retriever is totally taxidermic. My sneakers are off! I???m on the ground with all the Minute Maid. The cat is pawing my brain and I have your sandwich. It loves me back. The sandwich is only a little squished and it is safe in my arms, cradled against my stomach. The lining of my stomach loves the sandwich back, but I would never eat the sandwich. The sandwich is for you!You are laying on your back with your legs upright in the air and you are waiting for me to bring you the sandwich. You asked for it! I think about how you are a loyal customer and you might love me back and I love you so much. I think about how Midge would have possessed many skills that would have been well suited for retail and John would have owned a Jimmy John???s restaurant. I see your tomato warbling its way to the other side of the street from what I can tell sideways on the ground and it may have waved back to signify its distance from the sandwich. I???m off my bike and I???m on the ground. This is how it works! No really! You???ll get a refund. I???ll bring you another sandwich on my bike. I???ll bike over there to your exact address. Alright! I???m shaking my tail, I???m a delivery dog, I???m the Jimmy John???s Delivery Boy! I???m loyally bringing your pup to the door. I think I???m bringing you either a German Shepherd or a Golden Doodle and I may have warbled up your order. I am covered in the mayonnaise your Golden Doodle spilled against my stomach. I am drenched in Minute Maid and it is seeping out of my brain onto the pavement in warm red strings.I???m the Jimmy John???s Delivery Boy! You asked for it!Thanks again team for taking time out of a busy Friday to get together for the quarterly review. I can???t speak for everyone, but I???m starving! Having you all watch me drone through an endless parade of sales slides sure does work up an appetite. Before we dig into this prematurely set out buffet, I???d like to take a moment to repeat everything already mentioned in this presentation.Did I mention our new priority to shift from emerging markets to focus more on adaptive capacity? I did? Twice? Excellent. I???ll repeat it again, only this time with uninterpretable MBA jargon like ???strategic brand synergy??? and ???structural technology convergence.??? By now all interest in what that even means is long gone, along with half of the ice on the beverage cart. On the subject of beverages, let???s heave out some forced laughter for the diet soda joke I???m about to throw at Diane. Fun fact about Diane, everyone: she has diabetes.Let???s revisit these earnings graphs for a third time, partially due to how proud I am of the numbers, but also because the potato salad hasn???t sat unrefrigerated long enough. It???s not every day our net profits peak the two million mark! And botulism spores need at least an hour at room temperature before they???ll colonize the mayonnaise. Could you reverse the presentation 40 slides, but do it one at a time? Great. At this point, looking at these pie charts for a fourth time is the mental equivalent of drinking our urine, but I???d like to give the office sycophants a chance to grab for relevance.Speak of the devil! Dennis, you have an irrelevant question? I???d be happy to answer it in the most roundabout way possible. I???ll start by asking you to repeat it, misinterpreting your wording, then belaboring the point until the buns on those barbecue sliders become soggy enough to lose their integrity.And speaking of lost integrity, all revenue gained from these recent sales will suspiciously disappear after management takes more than its share, not unlike like the chocolate chip cookies next to the chip basket. The income generated here will in no way improve office conditions or performance expectations. Your limited budgets will remain stagnate ??? as stagnate as that Brunswick stew that???s visibly striated after not being stirred for two hours.Whoa there, Mike!",100
467," Do I need to bring baggies of Cheerios to the next quarterly review? Unless you brought enough granola bars for everyone, let???s hold off a minute. Here???s a comment about how snacking during meetings is unprofessional, darkly peppered with hints that premature attempts at my potty training warped me into a pushy adult who associates others??? obedience with self-worth. Or maybe I just hate my dad. Who knows? Bottom line is nothing pleases me more than pressuring a room of grown adults to suffer solely because I can. So let???s put that Clif bar away for now, alright Mike? Thanks.Alright then, who else is ready to eat? Good. But before we break for lunch, let me repeat everything already said at this meeting at least twice.CRESSKILL, NEW JERSEY ??? Today we must announce the tragic death of Baby Bird, recent inductee to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame along with the rest of his band, The Snort. Bird was found in his home yesterday evening, having apparently died of a massive heart attack. His cat, hen, dog, and cow outlive him, and rumor has it that he has left provisions for each of them in his will.Born in Amherst, Massachusetts, in 1960 to Professor M. Dey of Amherst College, which then boasted a population of just over 1,000 students, Baby Bird was originally christened with his mother???s last name, though he shook it off in later years. His mother, who still teaches at Amherst, outlives him as well as his pets. The two had a famously contentious relationship. In a Rolling Stone interview with The Snort in the late 1980s, the lead guitarist, German-born and England-educated Old Car, said that she always thought there was ???beef between Babes and his mum. He said she was, whatsit??? neglectful, yeah.??? Bird, according to the reporter, refused to answer any and all questions about his mother, saying repeatedly that he didn???t have one.Professor M. Dey was almost forced to concede to a college newspaper interview after the Rolling Stone piece came out with her son on the front cover. She told the the Amherst Student: ???I was a young professor in a time when female professors were rarer than they are today. I was a single mother. My husband died while I was eight months pregnant, in May of 1960, during training ??? he was part of the first group of troops to be sent to Vietnam, an officer, and he died like an idiot, because he???d been given a live grenade rather than an empty one and used it to demonstrate the way the pin pulled out to his platoon. But I fed Baby, I clothed him, and I paid as much attention to him as I could. He never forgave me for not having a father and he never forgave me for having a job. I wasn???t the kind of mother he saw at his friends??? houses.???At eighteen, when he was to begin Amherst College, which once he got into waived tuition fees due to his mother???s professorship, Bird fled the state entirely and traveled to LA with his best friend and later bandmate, nicknamed Boat. They used the savings they had from working at the local movie theater. In Los Angeles they both met Old Car and Plane, and together the four of them formed The Snort. They were compared over time to the likes of Led Zeppelin and other early metal bands, though their sound shifted over the years as they became more interested in using electronic elements in their music.As was common at the time, all four members of the band did hard drugs that fans claimed affected their onstage performance. Bird, however, denied the allegations repeatedly, even when he was arrested for carrying a large quantity of cocaine on his person and had to spend a night in jail before the group???s manager, Phil, could come and bail him out. After that episode, however, Bird claimed to have gone clean and bought the first in a long series of pets ??? a kitten he named, in dramatic Bird fashion, Drug of Choice.The band survived into the early 2000s when they finally broke up, not due to any interpersonal issues ??? various tabloids ran heartwarming photos of the bandmates brunching at high-end restaurants on Sunday mornings ??? but simply because all of them wanted to settle down and escape the world of hard rock before it got even harder than it was. Bird was no exception, although he was working on an acoustic album when he passed away. His former bandmates say they will make sure it will be released, a final tribute to Baby Bird.It is expected that the funeral or wake will be kept private and include maximum security in order to defend Bird???s close friends from being mobbed. It is unknown whether his mother will be attending, as it is just the beginning of a new semester, and she has refused to talk to reporters.Two goats at the end of RamadanThree doves at a Black Sabbath concertThe second season of True DetectiveAdam Sandler???s Pixels (subject to approval from Congress)The final scene of Mad Men.

Yes, I understand that it???s a very catchy song and fun to sing, but I paid 65 dollars to come see you perform, so I want the full experience of hearing only you sing it.This is one of the few nights a year I get to relax and see something I like. I may never get to see you live again. So when you turn the microphone to the audience and give us a chance to sing your song, I get a little bummed out. Now, instead of paying good money to hear you sing, I???m listening to thousands of tone-deaf people I don???t know sing a song I paid you to sing. You can???t get that many people to sync up on any song; It doesn???t even sound like they???re all singing the same song; It???s just a bunch of mashed up sounds that kind of fit to the beat of the song.More than half of these people are drunk or on drugs. Do you really want to rely on them to finish off a song that helped you win the Grammy for album of the year? When you do things like that I feel like I???m at karaoke night with my co-workers, which is not a good feeling.I don???t see any other professionals or artists asking their fans to do their job for them. Picasso never turned away from his easel and said, ???Here, you paint the eyes where the mouth should be.??? Hemingway never grabbed someone and said, ???Now it???s your turn to write in brevity about what it feels like to be a Lieutenant in the ambulance corps of the Italian Army.??? And Michael Jordan sure as hell didn???t pass me the ball in Game 6 of the 1998 NBA finals with 5.6 seconds left against the Utah Jazz. They all did it on their own.Do you not have enough confidence that you can nail the chorus? That would be ridiculous to think. You???re great at what you do. I would argue that you???re one of the best. So take that microphone, hold it right up to your mouth, and sing your heart out. Leave the listening to us amateurs.Sincerely,Luke Pohjala1.

I???m simply overwhelmed by how much activity there is here. I love it! Why, yes, hello to you to sir! Just browsing, really. Wait a moment ??? what???s that over there? That thing, sir, the one that looks authentic and representative of what I believe to be your traditional cultural heritage. No, not that one; the one behind that, with the jagged edges and slightly curved handle. May I take a look? Wow, it???s just beautiful. I have literally zero idea of what this item is or could possibly be. Can you tell me if it???s handmade?This wood ??? what kind of wood is this, actually? Oh, pomegranate wood ??? I???ve heard of eating pomegranates before, but never of using their wood. It must be truly traditional. And once you have obtained this traditional pomegranate wood, what process do you use to make it into this item that I cannot for the life of me identify? I???m very interested to know not only its current form but the whole history of how it is made into what it is today, whatever it is.Oh, I think I know. Looking at it from the left side, could this be a ceremonial stick used to mark the coming of the summer solstice? It certainly looks like it would be used during the summer, rather than the winter, given the carvings and such, but I certainly wouldn???t need to tell you that. Or perhaps this is placed inside the young man???s lower lip during the coming of age ceremony before he sets out on his first hunt? You guys are the ones with the lower lip ceremonies, right? I???m pretty sure I read that somewhere.Now that I???m holding it, I see that this thing has a very nice heft; the kind of heft you could really use as a paperweight. Is it a paperweight? Do you even have paperweights in your culture? Is that a remnant of the colonial era, the need for bureaucracy? Pardon my cultural ignorance, and please accept my apology on behalf of all people who have extracted resources and livelihoods from you for hundreds of years.The design is just magnificent, truly. Did you carve it yourself, or is someone else responsible for the detailed lines on this whatever-it-is? Oh, it???s carved by someone else. Are they here? I really can???t be sure it???s authentic unless I meet the person who carved it. Your brother carved it, you say. How do I know you really have a brother? Is he not here because he???s carving things, or is he not here because he???s off playing some kind of native sporting game, like soccer? I???d love to meet him actually, how???s his English? Not good? Like how not good?Look, you seem like a nice guy. Everyone always says I???m too gullible but I like to give people the benefit of the doubt. This thing, which I still have no idea the use of which is ??? how much for one? How about a dollar and fifty cents? That seems reasonable to me for an item like this, of this size and shape and unknown cultural significance. I think you???d be hard-pressed to find another guy like me who is not just interested in a good deal but wants to truly understand what these things mean to your culture, whatever they are and whatever they are used for.What???s that in your hand? Is it a baby???s blanket made from the pelt of an ocelot? Some Westerners might judge you for trading in furs, but I???m not one to impose my foreign value systems on your culture. Wait ??? it???s just your iPhone cover. Are you using Google Translate? I didn???t realize you got service out here.Oh, it???s a comb. Like a hair comb? Oh, no, sorry, there???s been a misunderstanding. I have no interest in a comb. We all have combs! But that thing next to your left hand, that thing that looks like a many-pronged fork you could use in a zen garden ??? is that hand-carved from traditional pomegranate wood?Illustration by R.

To commemorate this milestone event in American literary history, we???ve commissioned free essays by the legendary John Hodgman and the even more legendary Neal Pollack himself. Please celebrate this seminal event with us by reading their essays, and then by buying the Anthology or at least watching a YouTube video related to it. Thank you.- -IntroductionSixteen years ago I was still a professional literary agent, and I spent most of my time at the office looking at websites.Bear in mind that looking at websites at work was still a pretty new thing to do in the year 1999. Print publication of books and magazines was still a going concern, but there was a suddenly a lot more concern than going. The internet clearly posed both an existential threat to publishing and an existential boon to the world wide web of creators who could suddenly sidestep our long gatekeeping mission of deciding who would and who would not be memorialized by smashing their words onto pulped wood.So looking at websites in the year 1999 was important work, a critical probing of an emerging new culture of ideas, and not just a way to waste time because you disliked your job and are scared to leave it, like you???re doing now. But to be honest, for me, it was also that.Then one day that year, I looked at a website called McSweeney???s, and I read a fake magazine essay by Neal Pollack called ???I Am Friends With a Working Class Black Woman.??? It???s still one of the funniest things I???ve ever encountered, and extra funny for its brash bravery. Long before the great white privilege discussions of gamergate, Neal bared the arrogance of the many white dudes who believe the world NEEDS to hear what they have to say (both in and out of journalism) and hilariously flayed it. The best satire is that which reveals an absurdity you never noticed yet instantly recognize, and is funny while doing so. And that is what Neal Pollack is: the best satire.And so I contacted Neal and asked him if I could be his literary agent, and Neal agreed, thus sealing his doom. For at that time, traditional publishing recoiled from the idea of smart humor deployed under cover of the fictional persona of a deranged, self-congratulatory blowhard, and I was neither powerful nor psychic enough to tell them: don???t be stupid! Soon there will be Stephen Colbert!And so I negotiated a hot advance of zero dollars to allow Dave Eggers and McSweeney???s to publish Neal???s Anthology in a lovingly constructed hardbound edition, with pages and silk bookmark hand woven by Icelandic elves. In Neal???s semi-self-publication, and his tirelessly innovative (and tiring) tour that followed, the Anthology embodied that cultural shift that I had looked for in websites and would define the business of making art in the next 15 years: the DIY movement; the unseating of corporate publishing and distribution; and the need to engage your audience personally, whether greeting them in a bookstore or reading to them in Katz???s deli.Neal???s publication of the Anthology would seal his doom number two, at least as far as our professional relationship would go. Inspired by his fearlessness, his inventiveness, and the fun he managed to have amidst all the sweat work, I finally owned up that I wanted to be on his side of the equation. I quit my job as an agent, and I soon developed a deranged blowhard persona of my own: that of a Former Professional Literary Agent and expert on all things ??? a voice for which I owed such an obvious debt of inspiration to Neal that I never did acknowledge it. That was a mistake, and I apologize. Neal: working with you utterly changed the directory of my work and life, and I am deeply grateful.Neal continues to be an absurdly talented and prolific humorist, journalist, and novelist. You should buy and read all his work. But there is something especially mad and essential about the Anthology, and I???m glad those internet websites I mentioned before will allow you to read it right now. Fifteen years ago, Neal Pollack was 15 years ahead of his time. That???s something that???s hard for an author to really enjoy when he???s reading to half a dozen people in the bathroom of 30th Street Station in Philadelphia in the year 2000. Now that we???re all caught up to him, he and you and I can all enjoy it together.??? John Hodgman- -Thank you, John, for that warm and affectionate introduction. It???s always nice to hear praise from lesser literary lights, as it confirms my status at the top of the hay pile. I???m especially pleased that I inspired you to pursue a career in acting, though I???m surprised you???re still at it; you were old even at the time of The Paper Chase. I enjoyed your recent guest turn as ???Wacky Nerd Inventor Love Interest #2??? on Mike and Molly, the defining sitcom of our times.And now, here we are, face to face, a couple of Silver Spoons. It???s hard for me to believe it???s been 15 years since I bestowed a favor upon an unknown young writer named Danny Eggleston, allowing him to publish a generation-defining anthology of my greatest works. Since then, Eggleston has done a tremendous job of saving the world???s children through literature and warning us about the dangers of the Internet, while my dominance has continued without even a municipal easement to stand in the way of its manifest destiny.Since 2000, I???ve published my own visionary trilogy of novels warning us about the digital menace. First came The Web Ensnares Us All, then The Book Of Dumbers, and, finally, Chastity: A Girl Of The Internet. In addition, I visited the 9-11 development site and wrote a withering essay for The New York Review Of Essays, which I later turned into a monograph that is now in the Smithsonian. (Full disclosure: I have had non-monogamous sex with every single National Book Award and Booker Prize juror this year).I???ve been to Iraq three times, once on vacation paid for by Conde Nast Traveler, and Afghanistan twice. The hotel accommodations were adequate, the food inconsistent. I wrote a prescient novel about race relations called Black Lives Matter, a phrase I coined but didn???t copyright, and was the first person in print to call for the legalization of gay stoned marriage. There was also my metafictional novel with a novel, Novel: A Novel, as well as a three-volume autobiography, written in the original Swedish, called My Bowel Movement. Perhaps you also saw the movie about my life, The Tour Never Ends? I thought Paul Rudd did a fantastic job playing the younger me, and that Channing Tatum made a nice stab at my current incarnation.And that???s just the penile tip of a decade-and-a-half of literary productivity unparalleled in my generation, or any generation. Just look at what???s happened since the Anthology. Updike: Dead. Vonnegut: Dead. Mailer: Dead. Sontag: Dead. Havel, Marquez, and some other writer: All dead. Vidal: Dead and discredited. Roth: Retired. Oates, Didion, and Ozick: Alive and withered, like Stygian witches, still proclaiming curses from their blasted heath, a problem I wrote about in my visionary book of ideas, The Rise of the Gynocrats, which spent 17 weeks on the New York Times nonfiction bestseller list and 37 weeks unread by Barbara Walters??? bedside until her maid threw it a",100
470,"way.And yet still I write on, unencumbered by age or pain, thanks to the magnificent salves cooked up every day by my beleaguered manservant Roger and a strange painting that I stare at in my basement every evening. From my perch at the top of Mount Winchester, I can still hear the eagles cry. I watch the world burn and the seals beach themselves, but always, I write, write like I have never written before, because writing is the written word, and the written word is good. I must tell the world my stories about myself. A writer is the fulcrum of the human experience. Also I need royalty checks to help fund the brandy shipments.All this will be revealed and more next year in my autobiography, A Man Full Of Himself, in which [Part I, Part II, Part III., Part IV, Part V, Part VI, Part VII, Part VIII, Part IX, Part X, Part XI, Part XII, Part XIII, and Part XIV.]- -Part XV: In Which King Gylfi of Sweden Learns about the Time When The Gods Physically Assaulted their Most Favorite and Popular Member Just for the Fun of It- -So now Thor gets back tah Asgard aftah backhandin??? that fuckin??? giant dipshit so fah r???out tah sea that yah can???t even see his dumb ass drownin??? from the top deck???ah Maersk???s triple-ee ocean linah when his dad Odin comes outtah the front doohr n??? is like, ???WHERE THE FUCK HAVE YOU BEEN?!???????N this bein??? on accoun???ah the fact that he had expressly fahbid Thor tah go fishin??? since Thor???s grades???d been suckin??? balls lately n??? on top???ah that he got caught havin??? a pahty ovah at Odin???s house the othah week when Odin was outtah town doin??? his fuckin???

Your books are everywhere, and there???s no place to keep video games or porn. Last week one of the T-Bones tripped over your copy of The Beauty Myth and almost lost a toe. Is that what you want, Chad? Do you love Judith Butler more than you love Tucker???s feet? Which is more important: examining gender performativity, or traumatizing a potentially toeless T-Bone? We???re really asking.Chad, it???s going to be Pledge Week soon. We, the brothers of Sigma Nu, are concerned that you will be a giant buzz kill during the rituals wherein we lightly haze young men in totally straight ways that have no gay subtext whatsoever. We don???t want another repeat of last year. Please don???t put PETA stickers on the pledge paddle again.For the next month or so, can???t you just talk about football or your dad???s construction company? If you???re at a loss for appropriate conversational topics, you can simply point at your own dick and smirk.

You know the drill.We recognize you have a feminine side ??? heck, we all do ??? but right now we need somebody to do keg runs, and you???re the only one who can drive a stick shift. Please just try to bury your shit and let it fester until you cry silently into your pillow every night, mourning your lost childhood vulnerability. You know, like all the other brothers do. Just until Fall Break.Or maybe just, like, we don???t know. Maybe you could hold us for a little while and tell us what good boys we are. Not that we???re asking for that. We???re just saying. We could fire up Turner Classic Movies in the Nu lounge and you could make us another pot of that carrot bisque ??? the recipe you made last semester, but maybe with a dash more curry powder this time ??? and we could all feel really warm inside and sense a growing fullness in our bellies reminiscent of the all-powerful Womb, before we lose the feeling again and go back to wallowing in our desperate hunger, our unspoken empathy with our mothers, whose waning, doomed fecundity looms over us all and casts its shadow onto the six-foot inflatable penis Tucker stole from Battle of the ???Bama Bands.That???d be kickass, too. Whatever you???re cool with, man. Either way, we need to decide on a game plan before the Greek Council meeting on Thursday. We don???t want our chapter???s event schedule to conflict with the Tau Kappa Epsilon quilting bee.1.Ginsberg howled at moonsTrue American werewolfWit and claws and teeth- -2.Karl Marx shaved his beardHair fell in equal amountsRats made bushy wigs- -3.Neither beast nor boyRubin heard beats undergroundProblems?

Mental health too, naturally, plus the demented wrongness of uploading murder selfies to social media where, dammit, auto-play video preferences force you to watch the sickness even if you didn???t want to. Let???s parse headline wording, too: mass shooting or just regular homicide? And sure enough, at least one idiot will manage to post this: ???Liberals getting what they deserve ??? welcome to Obama???s America.???But let???s not say a word about??? you know??? those things that don???t kill people.A month ago, the Washington Post published a piece titled ???Change Your Gun Laws, America??? by Fareed Zakaria. The author pointed out that the U.S. has spent nearly a trillion dollars on fighting terrorism, which has killed 74 citizens since 2001, but zero dollars on combating the 150,000-plus domestic gun deaths in the same time span.We could, Zakaria argued, do better.Comments afterward ranged from ???You???re from Pakistan ??? go back and fix that country, not ours??? to ???Shut the fuck up, Muslim.??? And then the piece went off to die in the Internet archives, where maybe some fresh",100
472,"man writers will be asked some time to read it and write an essay of their own about it. Their essays will cite the Second Amendment and claim that God wants Americans to have guns. Their professors will curse themselves for daring to hope that any original ideas could appear in the essays.For years the gun argument hasn???t changed ??? and in the wake of a live-on-TV execution, we???re not even having the argument ??? because the same old language has been used to frame it. One side says ???gun grabbers??? and the other says ???gun fanatics.??? One says ???gun control??? and the other says ???freedom.??? One shouts ???Libtards!??? and the other counters with ???Conservatives!??? (One side has work to do in the insult department.)It???s all about language and the nature of guns. For all of the weekly and even daily damage guns do to our tattered remnants of civilized society, I don???t hate my guns. There???s nothing wrong with them; they???re not evil in and of themselves. They???re kept locked and unloaded. They???re basic devices made of steel and wood and resin. They do a job ??? they push a projectile through a tube so that it lands on a designated spot somewhere in front of that tube.But ??? and I???m pretty sure that no gun owner is supposed to admit this next part ??? the guns can only do that job under my direction. So the pathetic slogan guns don???t kill people; people do should actually be people pull triggers on guns that shoot bullets that kill people. I mean, if you want to get really technical.To oversimplify, if I decide tomorrow to take one of my guns to the range and shoot bullets at targets, that???s legal use of the bullets and the gun. But if I decide to take the gun to a live TV interview and use its bullets to murder former colleagues, that???s illegal use. It???s not the gun that needs to be outlawed; it???s the illegal use that needs to be prevented, to the greatest extent possible without restricting the legal use. Even the NRA would agree with this point. Maybe.???Gun control??? shouldn???t be about guns. It should focus on effective measures to prevent the illegal use of ammunition. EMPIUA, for short. An abstract and emotionless acronym. ???Senator, we have before us a bill concerning EMPIUA.??? No guns in the statement; actual work can commence.What sort of work? Here???s an example. Let responsible gun collectors keep their machine guns, if they???re licensed to have them and go through the registration process required by law. I don???t care; I trust them to make sure those weapons never end up in criminal hands to spray bullets at innocents. But as insurance for that trust, a jail term of 10-15 years for letting a machine gun slip into the wild would be reasonable.Thieves broke into the house and stole your gun safe? Then the safe wasn???t installed correctly, or you bought an inferior safe. Either way, you???re responsible. You???re the one who insisted on owning a machine gun. A machine gun is a huge responsibility and a colossal danger to yourself and others ??? which is why it has to be registered, no matter how loudly the NRA howls about gun registration violating owner freedom ??? and it should carry an enormous penalty if you let criminals have it, even involuntarily. It has too much potential to throw too many bullets at too many people at once if someone pulls its trigger.Yeah, the language of that last sentence is pretty convoluted. It would be a lot easier just to say no civilian needs to own that massacre machine. But the NRA doesn???t allow that kind of thinking. Guns are innocent; they???re only tools to do a job. Recite; repeat. Memorize.No ???gun control??? will ever be warranted or supported in the United States of Armament. If 50 shooters go into 50 maternity wards and murder 50 babies, nothing will happen other than 50 governors and a president offering their deepest condolences and most sincere thoughts and prayers.So instead, let???s talk about murder prevention. Then see what happens when the NRA has to argue that murder prevention infringes on a gun collector???s rights, or an open-carrier???s rights, or the rights of any freedom-loving patriot who opposes murder prevention.Under the current language, if you oppose gun control then you promote gun rights. And guns are legal and constitutionally protected, so what???s the problem? But if you oppose murder prevention, then you???re a sicko who promotes homicide. You???re not a champion of anyone???s freedom or a shill for any industry. You???re just fucking evil.???Gun grabbers will be coming any second now,??? you say after viewing a live-as-it-happens televised execution, and your words sound really strong and spiteful, and gundamentalist acolytes applaud.But try this instead: ???Murder preventers will be coming any second now.???Crickets.Of course, symbolic language gestures have an uphill battle before they can change a culture that values antique words on fragile parchment over the lives of fellow citizens. Consider: the same people who abhor birth control because ???every life is sacred??? have an equal abhorrence for gun control because ???Your dead kids don???t trump my constitutional rights,??? in the immortal words of Joe the Plumber.The human brain shouldn???t be able to work like that. There should be electrical fires as contradictory neurons smash into each other on the logic board. But when you look into the eyes of a ???pro-life??? gundamentalist who won???t let himself get fooled by a cheap emotional gimmick, like a Kindergarten massacre or a morning-show murder, you see no lights on behind those eyes. There???s no recognition of two mutually canceling ideologies. Both of them are simply correct.Pro-life means anti-death if it???s an abortion. The child comes first. Constitutional rights don???t trump dead kids. The Supreme Court must reinterpret Roe v Wade immediately. Abortions kill people ??? even people the size of kidney beans.But six years after a not-aborted child is born, pro-gun means anti-life if it???s a schoolhouse execution. In that case, the gun comes first. Dead kids don???t trump constitutional rights. The Supreme Court must never reinterpret the Sacred Words. Guns don???t kill people.Both ideologies are correct to the person who holds them; that???s the nature of fundamentalism. It???s True, Therefore It Is True, and nothing can smash through the battlements defending that circular equation.So maybe murder prevention, for all of its promise, isn???t the most effective language change. Maybe there???s a wedding of words that can blend everything. Abortion opponents want to prevent the killing of innocents, and gun control advocates want to prevent the killing of innocents. Put those together and you get: People use guns to abort people.Abort: end, discontinue, eliminate, terminate.Kill: end, discontinue, eliminate, terminate.People use guns to abort people.Recite; repeat.That guy who shot those people on TV? He aborted them. He was an abortionist. He terminated their young lives.People use guns to abort people.Memorize.It???s got potential. After all, if the good Christian conservatives in Congress manage to destroy Planned Parenthood, where will they direct all of their energy next?Dear 17-year-old Doors discoverers,Well, this was probably unavoidable. You are about to think some very dumb stuff about poetry, women, and dead Native Americans. This is a tradition, or affliction, that has been passed down to at least three generations of 17-year-old white boys and then foisted upon 15-year-old-white girls for just as many decades??????girls your own age are way past this shit, stick with the sophomores. You are going to abuse the",100
473," word ???shaman??? in ways that will violate international torture conventions. You???re going to think that something important and meaningful is happening to you, even though you haven???t left your room for three days. You are going to sit at the feet of the master of total self-regard, one James Douglass Morrison, the ???Lizard King,??? and think yourself the Prince of Salamanders and heir to a throne carved from your own bullshit.This will all end in merciful disillusionment.I would like to think that you saw Apocalypse Now and encountered ???The End??? during the opening scene, and that this is just an unfortunate side effect of an otherwise positive event in your cultural development. It is much more likely that TBS is just playing that fucking Oliver Stone Doors movie over and over because they picked up the broadcast rights super cheap at some kind of film studio equivalent of the unintentionally humiliating garage sale. It was in a cardboard box next to Harvey Weinstein???s old spandex bicycle pants. But, however it came about, you now think an affected demeanor of slack-jawed ponderousness is the same thing as depth and that depth is the same thing as being sexually desirable and the only way out of this thickening forest of misconception is through. There???s no going around.And it???s going to be a dark time. Not dark in the way you are thinking of dark. Not romantic, gothy, leather-trousers dark. More your own asshole dark.Still, I want this piece to be about constructive lessons and positive advice and I think I have found a way to spin this.The Doors have one legitimate musical accomplishment. One song that rises above the self-indulgent noodling they laid down so that Morrison???s endless elaborations on how interesting he found himself could be put into a form suckers like you would pay for. They have one good song. And even that song is only seventy percent good. That song is ???LA Woman??? and the fact that it is thirty percent bad may be the most important thing about it. Let???s just get it out of that way that, compared to all its kin, it is a better written and produced song, moreover it has an actually coherent instrumentation. The opening bars feel lean but dense, like a flexing muscle. That???s all great. But it???s not what elevates the song above the masturbatory self-aggrandizement that is the rest of The Doors??? catalog.What makes this song so good is that it is actually about something besides Jim Morrison. The song is about the city of Los Angeles and Morrison wrote it when he knew he was getting ready to leave. In the song, he sings to his home, this place that is outside of himself and bigger than he, or any one person, could ever be. The song is about what it???s like to truly see something you love in the last moments before you lose it. Also, it???s specific. The way you love a place is distinct from every other kind of love you will experience in your lifetime. It is the most real Morrison ever got with his writing. Then he can???t take it and starts spouting off a ridiculous nonsense anagram of his own name. (Hey, by the way, Mr. Mojo Risin??? is an anagram of Jim Morrison. That???s today???s trivia. Unfortunately, you probably can use that knowledge to get at least as far as second base. Ugh, sophomores.) Morrison???s like a toddler unconsciously clutching his genitals in public. Sixty-five percent of the song has passed and it has been great, transcendent by the standards of The Doors, then he does that crap. And then, thankfully, the song ends with a return to our real subject?????????a city that is going to be missed and how, like a woman well beyond the reach of her suitor, the city will never notice. But that thirty percent where the song suddenly becomes the usual Morrison bullshit just drives home the point?????????and here is where we get to the thing you should actually keep after you emerge from this most embarrassing moment of your musical life?????????and that is, whatever you do going forward, whether you are a doctor or a painter or a guy who spouts off unfounded opinions on the internet, try to make it about something bigger than yourself. Try to do things in the service of loving something more than you love your own ego. If your life is a story, well a story needs to be about something and, frankly, you aren???t that interesting, so make it about something you can truly love enough that your passion will inspire others. (I???m currently writing a whole book about late night cable soft porn from the 80???s.) It may take you a long time to find the right thing (Like I did) but never stop searching. Maybe you won???t stick with the same thing your whole life, but choose carefully and deliberately.Right now, you are a 17-year-old white boy who has discovered The Doors and you are thinking that I am full of shit and true meaning comes from thinking you look good in leather pants and writing five albums about thinking that you look good in leather pants. That???s fine. But bookmark this page. Come back to it after your first post high-school girlfriend has dumped you and you think life is over and you feel anything but cool and lizard-kingy. It isn???t much guidance, but it???s the closest you???re going to get to a dead Native American shaman.Rock on,BradMe want to eat cookie, but me take photo of cookie first.- -Me get angry when peanut butter cookies not use sustainable Valencia grade peanuts.- -Me travelled to Malm?? last winter for ultimate shortbread cookie experience.- -Sometimes me think that cookies too important in my life.

Possess your soul in patience! That???s an old expression.As I was saying, we walk into the grocery store and I turn to my sister and say, ???I think that???s Dennis Kucinich!??? Well, we started following him to get a better look. I mean, you never think you???ll see a former presidential candidate in the grocery store of all places! Hm? The Beat? Oh he???s wonderful. Really knows how to get the party started. He does like to make a dramatic entrance, though. Always fashionably late.I don???t know, maybe two more minutes? Three? Look, I already said The Beat is coming and I???m starting to take offense. There???s more to a song than just that showboater, okay? Me, The Beat, The Bridge: we all work as a team.

Locate/build time machine.2. Travel back in time to kill Hitler.3. Bring Hitler???s body back to present, show it to Heather.  (She hates Hitler, will be impressed, will finally go to dinner with you.)4. Rethink plan: if you kill Hitler before he does his Hitlering, Heather will never learn about his evil; therefore, won???t be impressed if you kill him; will in fact be terrified that you???re presenting her with mustachioed corpse of seemingly innocent man.  So???5. Travel back in time to stop yourself from killing Hitler.6. Wait until Hitler???s done a tiny bit of Hitlering; then, kill Hitler, bring back body, etc. (c.f. 3, above.)7. Once Heather goes to dinner with you and is charmed and finally sees what she???s been missing out on all these years, date her.8. If Heather wants to be exclusive before you do, use time machine to travel back to before she wanted to be exclusive and swap places with past self, so that the current you can continue casually dating her unencumbered by premature expectations of commitment.9. Repeat 8 as necessary, until you???ve aged too much and/or Heather comments on your thinning hair, then reluctantly agree to committed relationship.10. But secretly use time machine to go back and sleep with your ex-girlfriends back when your past self was dating them (technically not cheating because at that point in the timeline you were in a relationship).11. Travel to future to make sure things work out between you and Heather, just to make sure you???re not wasting your time/machine.  If Future Heather is married to someone else, disguise self as kindly old man, sit beside her on train, and casually work conversation to subject of past relationships and why they didn???t work out, then travel back in time and use that information to lock it down.  But pay attention: if Future Heather is giving off signals that she???s into you in your old man disguise, keep up ruse and date her.12. See 8, but don???t worry about getting too old since she???s apparently into older men.13. Rethink plan again: If you need to continually mess with the space-time continuum and wear an old man disguise to win/retain Heather???s love, maybe she isn???t the right person for you; maybe, of all the people who have ever lived or ever will live, there???s someone else out there who???s a better match; or maybe just use time machine to see if Heather and her future husband have a hot daughter.14. If yes: To make sure Heather???s daughter also hates Hitler, get hired at her school as a history teacher and focus lessons on the horrors of World War II.15. Travel further into the future, befriend Heather???s now-adult daughter, and casually bring up the topic of Hitler.  When she expresses revulsion, make your move (step 2, followed by modified 3).16. Be careful: Future Heather may notice that her daughter???s lover looks remarkably like her coworker from the 2010???s who sat two cubicles away from her (so close, yet so far).  If so, DO NOT ADMIT THAT YOU USED A TIME TRAVEL MACHINE TO TRAVEL TO THE FUTURE TO DATE HER DAUGHTER.  Instead, casually laugh and say, ???That???s funny, but a lot of people resemble other  ??? hey, look, it???s Hitler???s corpse that I killed!???  (You held onto the body, right?)17. Tread carefully with 16; the sight of Hitler???s corpse could send Future Heather into an uncontrollable paroxysm of sexual gratitude, and it could ruin your relationship with her daughter if she falls in love with you, too.  If this happens, you???ll have only one choice???18. Go back in time to right before you met Heather and force your past self to grow ridiculous facial hair as a disguise.  (Note: NOT A HITLER MUSTACHE.)19. Proceed as planned ??? unless it turns out that Heather???s into the hirsute you, and all you needed to do to woo her was grow a beard.20. If so, probably still travel back in time to kill Hitler, unless you???re too busy banging Heather.21. But be careful: It???s possible all this meddling with the past, present, and future could somehow create a Heather/Hitler hybrid: her eyes, his haircut, her sweet voice mixed with his oratorical fury",100
475,".  If so, instead of running back to the time machine heartbroken at this karmic comeuppance, pause and consider that finding ???the one??? might be an impossible fantasy.  Maybe ???part-Hitler, part-soulmate??? is the best anyone can ask for, and you should settle for what you???ve got.22. So grab ???Heathler??? in your arms, tell her-him that you???re committed to making this work, and get ready to share a life full of laughter, love, and foiling endless time-travel assassination attempts.23.

Zambra???s latest book, My Documents, is available now. This interview was conducted via email.- -McSWEENEY???S: The first time you handed me this book, we were eating pizza at a restaurant on Valencia Street in San Francisco. You kept saying that your English was terrible, but you also kept telling perfect jokes, and I remember thinking, My god, I can???t even imagine how funny this guy is in Spanish. Then I read My Documents and found out. So I guess my question is: How are you so funny?ZAMBRA: I don???t have a funny answer to this question. But the truth is that the little English I know comes from listening to Nirvana songs, and from watching Seinfeld over and over. I???m sure a lot of the things that made you laugh were actually written by Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David.I don???t feel comfortable when I speak in English, I constantly come up against language limitations. But when I???m talking to people who are willing to listen I loosen up, and I even enjoy saying many things with few words, which is a bit like what I try to do as a writer in Spanish, only with many more words.McSWEENEY???S: This book is not a short story collection and it???s not a novel and it???s not fiction and it???s not nonfiction and it???s not memoir, but maybe, if you drew a Venn diagram with all those categories, the zone where they all intersect is where you???d find My Documents. How would you describe what this book is? Lately, I???ve just been calling it ???a book??????as you can tell???because reducing it to one of those other categories just doesn???t feel right.ZAMBRA: You???ve just described it properly??? For me, those categories have never made a lot of sense. I think that My Documents is a book of stories; some of them are closer to nonfiction and others to fiction, but it would be hard to classify them even for me. Maybe the most important decision to be made about a text is whether to write it in first or third person. I have many texts in third person that I started writing in first, and vice versa, but that decision isn???t related in either case to how ???true??? or autobiographical the text is. It???s not just that. Fiction isn???t the same thing as a lie. Sometimes you can only approach truth by fictionalizing. In some texts I like to ???inhabit??? the first-person space, so to speak, but I don???t have, regarding that, any theories. I always just try out a voice and see where it takes me. I don???t necessarily have a desire to say anything about myself. Plus, these are everyday characters, they don???t have anything spectacular to tell.Also, as a reader, whether a text is fiction or not doesn???t interest me much. Of course, some images have a force that leads us to think, ???this happened, this cannot be made up,??? but that force only shows that we like it, that we recognize the stamp of reality. I mean, it speaks more to your reading, to your own idea about what is possible, what is real, than about the ???writer???s life.???McSWEENEY???S: Nicole Krauss once described the experience of reading your work as like ???receiving a call in the middle of the night from an old friend.??? Do you agree with that? And, if so, what do you think gives your work that quality? And also, on a more personal note, why don???t you call me in the middle of the night anymore?ZAMBRA: When I read Nicole???s quote I liked it a lot, and I called her on the phone to thank her, but she didn???t answer, maybe because it was the middle of the night???To a certain extent, I miss the time when people called each other on the phone in the middle of the night, and maybe I also miss the time when there were no cell phones and a friend would show up suddenly and ring the doorbell and the evening would turn into an unexpected experience, open to adventure, free-flowing conversation, to endless confabulation. These days if someone shows up without calling first it???s almost an affront. And the first question on the phone is no longer ???how are you,??? it???s ???where are you???: I don???t care anymore how you are, what I want to know is where. As for you, Daniel, I don???t call you in the middle of the night anymore because you???ve turned down my invitation to come to Santiago too many times.McSWEENEY???S: Which stories in the book did you write first? And did you always conceive of the pieces in the book as related to each other? If not, when did you first begin to see them as connected?ZAMBRA: They are all more or less simultaneous. I had the idea to compile stories I???d written earlier, but as ???the book??? emerged, they fell out one by one, and I wrote other stories that I hadn???t planned to write. The only survivors, though in radically different versions, are ???True or False??? and ???Memories of a Personal Computer.???I???ll talk a little about some of the stories individually:???My Documents???: I started writing this story at the end of 2012, and it was with me throughout the first part of that year. I think it???s a text, above all, about the desire to fit in, which is so often in vain: first to the marching band, then the parish chorus, to a group of friends, to some kind of community, to a country. And the parallel desire, sometimes more pressing, to escape from parents, run away from everything given, everything stable. It???s a text constructed from childhood memories from the early eighties. Its tone is of someone trying to describe precisely, without cataloging the experience beforehand, without controlling it, manipulating childhood memories as little as possible, avoiding any embellishment or retrospective rhetoric. In a way, it???s a text that relates an awakening, or better yet, a personal history that sounds like pre-history, because of the great capacity for forgetting that we possess, and because of how foreign some spaces and situations sound now, at least for me, and which nevertheless, thanks to writing, we can inhabit once again.???Camilo???: I wrote this story in 2012, in Brussels. I have a wonderful memory of that week I spent writing it, based on my own memories and the memories of others. Although their biographies don???t coincide almost at all, Camilo is for me Solano N????ez, a godson of my father???s who for years was, for me, an older brother. It???s also a story about soccer and the bravery of goalies, and the trauma experienced by those of us who grew up wanting to be C??ndor Rojas. It???s also a story about exile; in fact, I wrote it just after a long afternoon I spent talking with two exiled friends.???Memories of a Personal Computer???: This story is a re-written version of an old story I wrote in 2008. It???s the story of a couple, developed with a focus on the computer they share",100
476,", at the end of the nineties, back when computers were shared. I was very interested in showing the obsolescence of that world that seemed so stable and modern at the time. It???s also a story about the stubborn persistence of the masculine, or about the obsolescence of the traditional sense of the masculine.???True or False???: This is also the re-written version of a story I wrote in 2008 or 2009, and here as well the changes are many and varied. This is above all a story, like the previous one, about masculine solitude, masculine ineptness, and most of all about a generation like mine: parents who still believe they are children.???Long Distance???: Oh, I don???t remember the history of this story very well. But I know it was based on my horrible experience as a teacher at the Itesa Institute, which swindled hundreds of students at the beginning of the year 2000, when I was 25 years old and was also working as a telephone operator at a travel insurance company.???National Institute???: These are four very different texts about that high school.???I Smoked Very Well???: This is a text created from a lot of notes I???ve taken the various times I???ve tried to quit smoking.???Thank you???: I think I wrote this in Mexico City, at the end of 2010.???The Most Chilean Man in the World???: I wrote this in Brussels at the end of 2012.???Family Life???: This story is more of a long-term project I???ve been exploring for years. It???s the story I love the most, maybe because it encapsulates all the subjects of my novels: imposture, the desire for roots, the shapes that love takes, generational disenchantment, solitude. I???ve just finished a script for the movie that Cristi??n Jim??nez and Alicia Scherson are going to film this year.???Artist???s Rendition???: This is a kind of false detective story about the limits of personal experience, about abuse, about the (im)morality of writing. It???s a very important story for me.McSWEENEY???S: As we were editing the book, you joked that it could have been titled Eleven Kinds of Loneliness. What interests you about lonely characters? And are there any consistent challenges you encounter when writing a story about a lonely protagonist?ZAMBRA: I had more stories, but I left several out, as I said, and without realizing I wanted there to be eleven, maybe because of Yates???s book, which I love, and maybe because of a Kafka story called ???Eleven Sons,??? which for me is at the center of the mystery of literature. About solitude I wouldn???t know what to say, except for some very personal things; for instance that these years have been solitary, especially the time I was writing these stories. But returning to literature, I think that solitary characters express a negation that I???m interested in. Because they aren???t characters who want to be alone, or maybe they do, but they don???t know it.McSWEENEY???S: This is the third book you???ve done with translator Megan McDowell. What do you like best about working with her, other than the fact that she often includes Michael Bolton music videos with her edits?ZAMBRA: I am truly impressed by Megan???s fanaticism for Michael Bolton. She told me that she listens to ???How Am I Supposed to Live Without You??? at least once a day.I think the experience with Megan has always been wonderful, better and better, because of her extraordinary understanding of the secrets of Chilean Spanish, which is one of the most difficult versions of Spanish to understand. And for her generosity, her willingness to engage in dialogue. Truly, the best part of 2014 was those days when Megan, you, and I spent many hours every day discussing the translations. It was an amazing moment of collaborative work.McSWEENEY???S: One of the most compelling parts of this book, I think, is the way in which you capture the human impulse to hide and conceal. For example, in the title story of the book, the main character becomes an altar boy without telling his family. Similarly, in ???Family Life,??? the main character impersonates his cousin, whose house he is looking after. And then there???s the character in ???Memories of a Personal Computer,??? who tries to write a letter to his girlfriend, Claudia, but ends up writing several drafts in which he removes content, changes adjectives, and cuts and pastes phrases. When Claudia finds these drafts, he tells her that she???s not allowed to see them because they are ???full of mistakes.??? I wonder if you could talk about the role of transparency and concealment in the book. For example, in what ways???if any???do you see it as related to the act of writing?ZAMBRA: I think that writing is more like telling the truth than lying. Or at least it???s more like revealing the tricks, the weaknesses, the masquerade. Or it???s a territory where honesty takes on a greater value, and it???s is no longer about ???confessing,??? but about showing a greater nakedness, the nakedness that no clothes could cover. The mere fact that a reader is willing to go along with that ambivalence of fiction makes fiction more productive. The most deceitful genre imaginable is autobiography; in fiction you are closer to the truth, because everything you say is, from the start, arguable. Because you are also speaking from uncertainty, from doubt, from arbitrariness.I???ve always been interested in that limit, from Bonsai on, maybe because lying and hiding is a way of validating oneself, of avoiding solitude. In a way, my generation in Chile was always trying to fake an experience we didn???t have, because we felt the pressure of not having lived the country???s great history, of being secondary characters with no real experience. And later, those of us who studied, for example, literature, had never really read. We had to pretend that we???d read, for example, Proust. That double negation: our parents telling us ???you all haven???t lived, you can???t speak because you haven???t lived,??? and the teachers telling us ???you all haven???t read, you can???t talk about literature because you haven???t read.??? I???m extremely interested in reading those tensions in the present, now that we are parents and teachers ourselves.McSWEENEY???S: When we were editing ???Long Distance,??? we had a hard time finding the right English word to describe the laughter of one character, Juan Emilio. Was it a chuckle, a guffaw, a snicker? You sent me an audio file to give me a better sense of what you meant. Can I share it with the world?ZAMBRA: ??No!McSWEENEY???S: You just published a new book in Spanish, Facs??mil, and it has an interesting and peculiar structure. What can you tell us about it? Also, what are you working on right now?ZAMBRA: Facs??mil is a book I love a lot, because it moves outside of literature. It???s fiction, but it would be hard to classify it as poetry or novel or stories, because above all it???s a test; it???s based on the Academic Aptitude Exam, the test that we all had to take in Chile in order to apply to college. I started out writing a novel about the time when we were taking the exam, which decided our fate forever, and suddenly I realized I didn???t like it, that I was writing a novel because I???m a writer and I write novels. So then I said to hell with that novel and I started to parody the questions, one by one, in multiple choice format. It???s a provocative book, it???s impossible to read it without making decisions, taking positions. I love that. It???s almost a refrain to say that the reader decides the meaning of a book, but in this case it???s unavoidable; this book has already been read in Chile in very different ways, and I???m happy about that.I am, for the first time in my life, wri",100
477,"ting three books at the same time, and I don???t know which one I???ll finish first. One is called Personal Cemeteries, and it???s about personal libraries, about the construction of an identity through the accumulation of books (and the way it can change and become an encumbrance, until you arrive at the idea that you???re living in a cemetery of books). Another is a novel called Unsent Messages that???s turning out to be very long, and the other is a deceptively funny book that???s totally different from anything I???ve done, called Chilean Poet.- -To buy a copy of My Documents, please visit our store.Who among you is bold enough to aggregate my empire?You, who are blissfully unaware of the struggles of aggregating fresh comedy.

The most moving text I found on this subject was from a surprising source ??? a retired animal actor. She gave the following speech at an annual Conference of Animal Workers in Denver in 1983. It was passed around for decades and only recently published in a collection of essays called, Animal Wit, Wisdom and Folly.- -Hi. My name is Midnight Thunderstomp, better known as ???Stormy??? from the dramatic series of the same name.I wasn???t cast in the lead role because I was the smartest or the best-looking horse at the audition. I didn???t get the part because I was the best actor. I was cast because I would do anything for sugar cubes. Anything.But this isn???t a story about my years of obediently taking direction, aka ???acting.??? This is a story of what happened when the show was canceled and how I learned to be myself and not ???Stormy.???Nothing prepared me for the shock of retirement. My new home was a gentleman???s ranch outside of Pasadena. I didn???t leave my stall for a week. I was embarrassed at not knowing how to do normal horse things: eat grass from the ground, rub my head against posts, trot, canter, whinny spontaneously. Every time a kid under the age of 10 came in the barn I thought he was going to shout at me about a brush fire or someone trapped in a well. I was a mess.The other horses snickered at me. They mistook my shyness for snobbery. The first time the stable manager came in with a handful of carrots I began stomping my hoof. She  didn???t understand that this was a conditioned response, something I???d been trained to do in order to give the illusion of knowing math.???Look who thinks she owns the barn! Well, miss prima donna, these horses are just as important as you. You???ll get your carrot when everyone else does.??? This egalitarianism didn???t prevent her from sneaking me off to a Radio Shack franchise opening the moment my new owners were out of tow",100
478,"n. Other openings followed.I should clarify: I went willingly. I was desperate for the stage, the cameras. It was the only time I felt like a coherent horse. Everything else felt like one big anticlimax.I hit bottom about six months later when I overheard some people talking about a 5K charity run at Dodger Stadium. That day I jumped a fence and made my way onto the interstate. A truck swerved to avoid hitting me and jackknifed, causing a huge traffic jam. Next thing I knew, helicopters were buzzing over me as I galloped along the shoulder. That was a first too. Galloping.I was so crazy I actually thought I could still get to Dodger Stadium. I felt a sharp sting in my left haunch and then all was darkness.I woke up on the floor of a stall in a quiet, climate-controlled stable. A friendly looking chestnut colored horse with a white stripe on his forehead gazed down at me.???Christ. What???d you do???? he asked.The pun-laden news report on the radio told him everything he needed to know. He rolled his eyes and introduced himself.  His name was Bamboo Harvester. That???s right. There I was drugged and struggling to my feet in a futuristic Los Angeles animal hospital, alone with the most famous horse actor of all time, ???Mr. Ed.???I???ll never forget his kindness that day. He spoke with a weary familiarity but his eyes were merry. It was the perfect tone to take if you wanted to soothe a younger horse who thought her life was over. I think about that a lot. That it was he who comforted me.???Rather be tied to a millstone than be retired eh???? He chuckled at this. ???I???ve been there. Maybe work a jousting tournament at a Renn-Faire?  I know.??????Have you ever made a fool of yourself on national television???? I asked.???You mean you haven???t seen my show???? he asked.I hung my head.???Bah, the world will forget! It???s only you who???ll believe the world remembers. Let me tell you something, Midnight. I used to have to bite leather every time some idiot called me ???Mr. Ed.??? Finally I had to ask myself, is it worth it? What matters is whether or not the oats taste good. Am I wrong????This was a little hard to hear while I was bracing myself to become late-night talk show fodder. But some of it got in.???Consider yourself lucky. You might have spent your whole life fighting it.???I nodded. He nuzzled me.???It won???t matter, though, since I???m going to be assassinated by the Radical Animals.???At this, Harvester was quiet for a moment.???I have a lot of respect for what Penthius Winterbottom???s done. He gave up acting at the peak of his career, changed his name, denounced pants. He???s helped a lot of animals. But let me ask you something. Do you think he???s better than you? Stronger? More ???pure??????????He has??? integrity,??? I said.The doors swished open at the end of the barn and two gowned veterinary assistants wearing masks walked up to Harvester???s stall.???Does running down the interstate mean you don???t???? he asked.As they led him away, I called out, ???Hey, Harvester, What are you in for????Without missing a beat and without turning around he called back to me, ???I forgot my lines.???Four days later, I learned he???d died from kidney failure.His funeral was a who???s who of animal actors: the reclusive has-beens sitting quietly, the desperate ones, their muzzled dyed, still trying to work the room, the superstars, like Bart the Bear, and a band of Radical Animals made up of diaper-less chimps, unkempt ponies and the wise old quarter horse Penthius Winterbottom.And then, something happened that totally eclipsed my own humiliating incident. As a high school student stepped up to the podium and began singing ???The Rose,??? a pony named Dusty Roads defecated. It was an instant, national scandal. Dusty retreated to a farm in an undisclosed location and has not been heard of since.I???d like to say a word in Dusty???s defense. The prevailing interpretation has always been that it was an act of protest against the television industry and Harvester himself, for selling out. This is absolutely untrue. At that point in his life, Dusty was beyond any sort of militancy. He???d achieved what most of us only dream of. He???d managed to reach back into his original nature and find that holy grail we all long for, his inner animal.I remember the moment clearly. The gentle thud, the steaming pile. I say again, Dusty meant no disrespect. In fact, what he did was an act of love. No, it???s okay. You can laugh, I understand. But think about what it meant. It was a total acceptance of who he was, without self-consciousness. Bamboo Harvester would have delighted at the innocence of it. He would have neighed!After Harvester???s funeral I began to build a life for myself. I have to say, being disgraced gives you a certain power. You can???t be blackmailed. Very few things make you afraid. You have nothing to lose. In the coming years I helped create ???Lassie???s Law,??? where not just the original animal but all subsequent actors playing that same role are legally entitled to receive royalties. I founded CounterProductive, a rehab center for post-career horses addicted to solving math problems. I found out I liked historical novels, baking and jumping over stuff.I???ll never forget Bamboo Harvester???s attitude about being called, ???Mr. Ed.??? No one had it worse than him. If you watch the show, check out the credits. On one side it says MR. ED and on the other side, where the actors real names are listed, it says only HIMSELF. In an interview with Barbara Walters, Harvester admitted there were times during the peak of his career when he forgot his real name and ???Who I???d ever been.???He was an incredible horse, not because of the show Mr. Ed, but in spite of it. Of course, he???d never say that. But it???s true. Even Dusty Roads can???t touch that because Harvester did the most difficult thing of all. He stayed in the world.Before he died, he specified in his will what he wanted to have written on his tombstone. There are those who see it as sardonic. There are those that see it as evidence of his having merged with his role. Not a bit of it. This was the final act of a horse who was free:Here Lies Mister Ed1949-1970???At the end of the day, God damn it I???m killing this shit???It is evening, and I???m changing a diaper.???Nuh uh, you can???t tell me NOTHING???Shhhh, I am on the phone.- -???Forever we hot, motherfucker, are you ready or not????PUT.

I don???t have some grand idea of myself, some illusion that my making it through four years of college and acquiring $40,000 in student loans (after grants and scholarships) to go to said college because I was told that was the only way to make it in life, entitles me to a comfortable, well-paying job that won???t make me long for the days of staying up until 4 am to write a final paper, living off nothing but Bagel Bites and sodas from the drink machine in the basement. I was fully prepared, nay, expecting to work some meaningless dead end job for an indeterminate amount of time, all the while trying to find a job that doesn???t make me consider the futility of life and the constant weight of poverty looming above my head every day.Of course, I went into college a much more hopeful woman, imagining all of the knowledge I would soak up and all of the respect it would afford me in the professional world. ???Oh yes,??? I imagined myself saying lightly at an office Christmas Party, a flute of champagne in my hand, the light playing off my golden dress just so, ???Yes, I have a bachelor???s degree.??? In this imagined interaction you and my other coworkers would gasp admiringly and nod approvingly ??? if only all young people were so responsible and sensible.Oh, how sweet and na??ve I was. Imagine my dismay when I casually dropped that I have a degree in my first interview outside of college and the interviewer didn???t bat an eye. ???Of course you do,??? her eyes seemed to say, ???everyone has a degree, you are not special.??? My outlook did not improve when I started specifying that I have an English degree. Now the looks were tinged with sympathy, their pursed lips and slight little head shakes saying ???you poor thing.??????So you want to be a teacher???????What are you going to do with that???????Are you a??? writer????And then, of course, the big one, the surprised, concerned exclamation: ???Well, what are you doing working here then?!???Perhaps you, my new coworker, are as gullible as I once was. Perhaps you still believe that obtaining a degree, working hard in a specialized field for four valuable years of your youth, should be able to snag a person a good job in their field. It is not.Because let me tell you, I did not wake up the day after my graduation and think, ???I believe I???ll go apply for my dream job as a business office clerk at a local furniture chain today!???I tried other things. I tried being a writer, but as much as people say that online self-publishing is a great way to get started, it doesn???t work unless you actually write something, and I found that as a 21-year-old living in my father???s basement, I didn???t have anything to say that I thought anyone would want to hear.So I tried Barnes & Noble. I thought, at least it???s being around books, at least you can help people find their new favorite author or help kids discover a love for reading. Apparently you have to be a slightly grumpy, resigned-looking middle-aged woman to do that job.I was not called in for an interview.I tried Starbucks. I figured that if I couldn???t write and I couldn???t work around books, at least I could fulfill the stereotype of the liberal arts graduate as a quirky, disenchanted barista. Apparently my degree didn???t impress them either.At one point I found a woman on Craigslist who was looking for a ghostwriter and I thought, finally, a job for me, a way for me to use my skills. I thought of the books I would likely be penning, romance or sci fi or young adult literature. When my new ???boss??? informed me that I would be writing sixteen pages of copy about foreign cities and the universities therein, I was disappointed, but no less determined that this was my big break. It was only after I had started literally copying and pasting passages from the samples that she gave me that I realized how much I fucking hated it. I wasn???t that sad when she fired me. It was nice working in bed, though.So then I found myself here, behind this counter in the middle of a furniture showroom floor, veritably chained to this ten-line switchboard, whose harsh beeping I literally hear in my dreams, being questioned by you, my well-meaning coworker, about why I am where I am.I could have explained it all to you, I could have laid out every step that has brought me to this godforsaken retail hell/office combination, but I am so tired. So instead of saying what I should have said, everything in this meaningless letter that I am sending into the void which doesn???t care about my degree or my copy-editing or critical-thinking skills, I smiled and laughed a friendly little laugh and said, ???Because I???m fucking broke with a ton of debt hanging over my head from the one thing I was told would be my key to a successful life and which I will probably spend the rest of said life paying off, and this hellhole hired me. Did you need more coffee??????? Denise ParkerThroughout my twenties, I engaged in the heterosexual lifestyle. I sang ???",100
480,"Son of a Preacher Man??? at karaoke with the best of them, even once enjoying a sandwich from Chick-fil-A.  Then last year, I fell in love with someone of the same sex. SuddenIy, I found myself recoiling from my boyfriend???s touch and getting depressed whenever I spotted an attractive woman on the subway who turned out to be a seventeen-year-old boy with an alternative lifestyle haircut. I had no choice but to see this for what it was: A sign from God that I am intended to love women.My straight phase was probably influenced by my relationship with Dad, which was amazing! I grew up really confident around boys, and shared with them a natural kinship. Given how our culture sexualizes guy-on-girl, romance was the next logical step when I came of age. What could be more comfortable than dating your BFF?In college, I loved the attention I got from being straight. While most students at my Liberal East Coast University did the routine sexual awakening and cocaine that was expected of us, I just had to create a scandal by signing up to work for the homophobic cult Dad joined when I was ten. As a sensitive prepubescent, I???d internalized their doctrine that everyone is innately heterosexual, reflexively dismissing my homoerotic tendencies as ???a straight thing??? long into adulthood. Nobody???s bougie-ass story about some acid-fueled orgy with their Yeats Seminar over winter break could compare to this shit. I always had the coolest freakin??? Dad!I know it???s not PC to say girls sometimes ???go straight??? because of ???Mommy issues,??? but for me it holds some truth. Crazy, unstable Mom refused to support me and Dad on our spiritual journey. It definitely gave me some serious trust issues with women.Some might attribute my drastic shift in preference to ???sexual fluidity.??? ???Sexual fluidity??? means different things for different people. Sometimes it means you were completely fulfilled dating men but the love of your life is a woman who you???re marrying in the fall and you don???t need labels! Sometimes it means you were an unactualized gay kid whose Dad became a Scientologist and invited you to join him on the Bridge to Total Freedom???.Female sexuality is especially fluid. That???s because of evolution. Depending on the needs of society, it can boil, freeze, or evaporate entirely. It???s science. Male sexuality is solid, like the stainless steel, titanium-cased tablets that L. Ron Hubbard engraved with his religious texts and buried beneath the deserts of New Mexico.To my friends and loved ones in the straight community, I say, ???Though you???ve lost a member, you???ve gained a stalwart ally.???  Sexual violence and oppression remain central themes of straight art and politics, along with the newer dangers of assimilation. In fact, my parents were in an openly straight marriage and, though I now have urgent questions for my Mom, at least one of them was predominantly heterosexual. Some might argue that having straight parents can ???turn you straight??? but that???s impossible. All kinds of people have a straight phase, regardless of their upbringing.  There is no ???straight agenda,??? or conspiracy to ???turn everybody straight,??? least of all in Scientology, which does not concern itself with controlling anyone???s sexual activity. Scientology is concerned only with bringing everybody on the planet up to higher levels of spiritual advancement. These higher levels of spiritual advancement are indisputably characterized by heterosexuality on the Hubbard Chart of Human Evaluation, but that???s neither here nor there. ???Ha ha ha! Remember your ???I inhabit a physical body??? phase???? we???ll laugh to one another from across the cosmos!I will miss the sense of inclusion I felt under the far-reaching label of ???straight.??? The straight community is so warm and welcoming, I didn???t even question my absence of actual physical attraction towards men, or unnamable void at the center of every romance, or all those topless women I drew in my high school notebooks to ???practice figure drawing since women???s bodies are just more aesthetic.??? Scientology is a religion that has always celebrated the artist.When asked to choose a label, I identify most with ???Retro 1950???s Repressed Lesbian Housewife??? since it gives a wink to my past life. 1950???s America, the birthplace of Scientology, is said to more or less exactly resemble what our society looked like 75 million years ago at the moment when Xenu rounded up trillions of Thetans throughout the Galactic Confederacy and sealed us into volcanoes on Planet Earth.Experimenting with heterosexuality for 28 years has been life changing. I have made discoveries about myself, many of them gay. It???s like digging up a time capsule in the backyard, but instead of old copies of Highlight???s Magazine and my Lion King CD from 1995, the time capsule is filled with stunted childhood emotions and unresolved psychological issues. Like Scientology, this knowledge has given me the tools to think more clearly, access new levels of potential, and is non-denominational???except it???s all completely free of charge!Thanks for listening so patiently. By the way, did you notice the cutie with the normcore ???80s power-executive haircut and military shirt who???s been glancing at us this whole time? OH SHIT!!!! THAT???S NOT A WOMAN!!!!

When the creek is high and the footbridge is underwater, you can be very careful and ride your bike over it. It can be fun, like splashing through a big puddle. Yeehaw!4. It is good not to get cocky when you go over the footbridge on the way back.5. When the water flows across the bridge and the sun hits it just right, it???s hard to tell where the bridge ends and the water begins. You may try to correct the direction of your wheels. You may try to do this a bit too abruptly.6. If you???re lucky, there will be a guy in his twenties, a strong guy in his twenties, walking on the path nearby.7. If you???re extra lucky, the guy will come running to help you (after yelling ""SHIIIIIIIITTTTTTTT!) when you wipe out on the bridge.8. If he is gallant, he will ignore you when you say, ???I???m fine. I???m just a dumb ass.

Your husband takes forever (three minutes) because the friend can???t find a bag to put the ice in.13. You start to flag down a woman two backyards over because you are desperate for ice and help. You wave and wave. You are sobbing. Your mud-hair is flopping in your face. She waves back.

Consider questions such as:Who am I?Why do I feel so alone?Where did my childhood go?Where am I going to put all my shoes?All fun. All the time.Whatever, USA was built on that promise. It didn???t take long to break.We thought an endless supply of Bud Light and an ???up for whatever??? attitude would keep the monsters away.Now we know better.Soon after we opened the gates to our corporate Valhalla, outsiders arrived. Duplicitous men with dangerous ideas were handed press passes, and asked to ???talk about their experiences on various social media platforms.??? These soulless goons accepted their lanyards with a smile, but within minutes were calling Whatever, USA ???as tasteless as the beer it???s promoting.???I know the citizens of Whatever, USA. They???re decent, hard-working folks just trying to create highly sharable content and increase brand engagement with Bud Light. To think of their character being dragged through the mud makes my stomach turn.For too long cowards have hidden behind keyboards, typing hideous lies, emboldened by sycophants tweeting support. I get why Bud Light???s social media team can???t respond. They???ve spent years positioning Bud Light as fun loving and inclusive, and going on the attack runs counter to that brand personality.So it falls to me.To serve justice in this town, I must conceal my identity and brand loyalties. I must shed my Bud Light pull string backpack and kick off my Bud-a-rita themed Crocs. In place of my glow-in-the-dark Bud Light Lime Ray Bans, I must wear a veil.I must become the masked vigilante of Whatever, USA.In my old life, the one I still lead by day, I was a brand ambassador for Bud Light. I tried to do good, but constantly found myself crushed by a system I couldn???t change from the inside. I worked with Bud Light???s social media team to deflect trolls, but couldn???t do anything to actually eliminate them. Unless the necessary steps were taken to keep these creeps off Bud Light???s feed, they???d keep coming back.I???d have to get my hands dirty. If you want to tango with a troll, you have to descend into the darkness below their bridge.Now I haunt the shadows where Bud Light???s enemies have taken up residence. I???m the dark angel interrupting their nightmares.I have no style guide, no approved language.If a stuck-up douchebag winces after a sip of Bud Light, I knock his teeth out. When someone questions the reason behind creating a branded utopia, I make sure it???s the last thing they see. If I see a guy wearing a Dogfish Head hat, I drop a full keg onto the snob from a hotel balcony.It isn???t always pretty.Neither is surgery. But how else do you remove a tumor?When you become a vigilante, you don???t expect the citizens you???re protecting to understand. Listening to them call your alter ego a criminal is just part of the job description. When they label you a murde",100
483,"rer, all you can do is take it on the chin.Because that???s what a hero does.That doesn???t make it easy. I saw one of our bloggers crying, claiming she was scared to go outside. I wanted to hug her tightly and tell her she had nothing to worry about as long as she continued to praise Bud Light. But I couldn???t risk my identity being revealed.The fate of this city is more important than my pride.The cops don???t get it either. They stopped by our office as a part of an ???investigation??? into a ???string of homicides,??? acting like I???m the bad guy. They???re probably on the take.Lately, the trolls have retreated to their twitter accounts and blogs and national newspapers to claim Whatever, USA is a ???Beer commercial turned into a slasher movie.??? I guess the headline ???Reluctant Hero Fights to Improve Bud Light???s Brand Equity??? wouldn???t draw as many clicks.Someday I hope to walk away. Hopefully it???s soon. I get no pleasure from this. It???s not that I want to drag a snide blogger riding a banana boat into the middle of the ocean and leave him there. I???m guided into those deep, shark infested waters by an unwavering moral compass and a commitment to the Bud Light ethos.I dream that tranquility will return to Whatever, USA. We???ll be able to shotgun beers with no bitter aftertaste. We???ll walk the streets in neon tank tops, free from rolling eyes and whispered insults. I long for that day, when this town is only filled with people who are truly up for whatever.Until then, I???ll do whatever it takes.- - -Our crack team of aspiring high school-aged music journalists???for this interview, Elliot Phillips, Aphra Price, and Cristina Cass???met with Parquet Courts on Saturday afternoon, just as  the festival was being evacuated for a torrential downpour. These creative writing students channeled their musical knowledge and interviewing skills during the following Q&A with the band.- - 826 CHICAGO: OK, can you each tell me your name and what you play in the band?ANDREW SAVAGE: My name is Andrew Savage and I am male soprano.MAX SAVAGE: I???m Max Savage, timpani.SEAN YEATON: Sean, bass, double bass.AUSTIN BROWN: I???m Austin. I???m not in the band anymore. I quit five minutes ago.826 CHICAGO: Why???d you quit?BROWN: I just don???t matter, I don???t think.826 CHICAGO: So, as you guys are kind of showing us here you have a kind of sardonic sense of humor, what do you think humor plays in your music, what role?A. SAVAGE: It???s important to be funny.826 CHICAGO: But, do you guys think there???s anything genuine, what???s kind of the message you think you???re going after wit, you know, your sarcasm and dreary outlook on modern life and such?A. SAVAGE: For example? A dreary outlook on modern life?826 CHICAGO: Like in your song ???North Dakota.??? Like one thing I noticed about that, I kind of got from that song??? kind of??? mixed messages about how you feel about suburbia, and the duller parts of the country, and out in the rural parts.  So I was trying to understand if you have some kind of, you know-A. SAVAGE: I think that song is kind of a reflection about America but not really the duller parts, I mean, it???s maybe not as exciting as some other places, North Dakota, uh  [looks into camera and points], no offense any North Dakotians out there.  Its lovely and that???s kind of the point of the song. It???s really, like all things can be beautiful, even the banal and boring things.  As far as having a sense of humor, I mean people just relate to that sort of thing you know, you got to be yourself if you???re going to be a writer. If you???re going to be a journalist writer, or if you???re going to write music, you need to be genuine and be yourself to make a connection with anybody, whether it???s your readership or listenership.826 CHICAGO: He mentioned the ???North Dakota??? song, was that inspired by a trip there or something?A. SAVAGE: Yeah, I was inspired by one time me and Austin were on tour with another band and we drove from Fargo, North Dakota to Seattle and it took three days. It was wonderful.826 CHICAGO: OK, a lot of people kind of say your sound, it takes a lot of influence from Pavement.  Now I???ve never personally felt that way but I wanted to know how you guys feel about that comparison? And what do you guys think your sound is more informed by or influenced by them?A. SAVAGE: Yeah, they???re a good band, they???re legends, but we do our own thing.M. SAVAGE: We just want to be Parquet Courts, so getting compared to other bands like Pavement, while you can take it as a compliment it gets old after a while.YEATON: What was the question, what did you ask? Pavement? Ah yeah, they???re great. We???re always at the same spot as them in the store.BROWN: We???re in the ???P??? section, ???PA,??? ???PA.??? I don???t know. Malcomus owes me a lot of money, we bet on a cricket game and he still owes me 50 bucks so I???m not a big fan of Pavement at the moment.826 CHICAGO: Who would you say some of your influences are?M. SAVAGE: Trio ???Da Da Da.???A. SAVAGE: Proto-martyr, right over there.YEATON: Uh, and you know Guns N??? Roses comes immediately to mind, so it has to be true.BROWN: Ah, I???m a big Marouane Fellaini fan.826 CHICAGO: OK, if you could work with any artist, living or dead, who would it be?BROWN: Pablo Picasso.YEATON: One of those elephants that paints with their trunk.  Any of them. All of the living ones, as many as you could get over here right now. Yeah, yeah, those guys. They???re great. The male ones and the female ones. I love what they do.M. SAVAGE: Ah man, I would go with, uh, Maurice Ravel.A. SAVAGE: Abba!826 CHICAGO: Why Abba?A. SAVAGE: ???SOS,??? ???SuperTrooper,??? ???Dancing Queen,??? ???Mama Mia?????? the list goes on.826 CHICAGO: Andrew, I heard you were having a visual art exhibit out now, can you tell us a bit about that?A. SAVAGE: Yeah, it???s a show in Brooklyn its called, Color Studies. It???s all prints.  It???s similar to show I???ll have in Germany in September.  I???m not really a printmaker but it was a print shop that is also a gallery that offered the show to me, so it was a cool new experience. New colors, colors that I never use, lots of pinks, purples, teals, stuff like that.826 CHICAGO: Do you guys feel you???re going to take your band in a new direction anytime soon, or what are you changing about your music as you???re working in the studio?A. SAVAGE: Parquet Courts is constantly going in a new direction, I think. Always.BROWN: I???d like to go in a very dry direction maybe, with a roof somewhere.826 CHICAGO: OK, thank you guys so much for coming and having this interview with us.Damn. That was a really good point. When I started this discussion, which quickly turned into an argument that I keep demanding be called a ???discussion,??? I had no idea that you felt so passionately or had such a well-reasoned stance. Not only have you been calm throughout this ordeal, but you have skillfully dealt with my flailing attempts to ???win??? by concocting straw men of your points. You also seem to be putting forth a genuine effort to understand my position while explaining yours. And, can I just say (well, not so much say but rather think to myself as you make another well-reasoned point), that you are doing an excellent job. It???s been, maybe, 15 minutes that we???ve been talk-yelling, with you mainly talking and me mainly yelling, and not only do I agree with you, but I???ve come to the conclusion I have sounded like an idiot for years about this subject.Upon realizing that I am totally wrong and you are totally right, I guess I only have one option: double the fuck down.Seeing as you have totally blocked the",100
484," roads to winning this argument through logic, I will begin with the most obvious, and classic, of techniques: attempting to switch this argument to another field. If all goes well, through either an unnoticed segue or a drilling down on a small piece of information you???ve presented, the idea of our original debate will be long gone. In just a few moments, you???ll be experiencing what I am now, wondering how you backed yourself into the corner. Well, the truth is, you didn???t! I lead you to that corner while you were trying to express how you actually feel about something. This will leave us both angry and unsure how to proceed, turning the only beneficial part about an argument ??? revealing your true feelings on something ??? into a ???Where???s Waldo??? game of semantic wrongdoing. I know you???re right, but correct opinions are complicated and take precision. In your passion you???ll miss something and I???ll lead you right into my trap.If that doesn???t work, and considering how smart you are it might not, I can always just turn this into a yelling match. I will raise my voice until you are being drowned in it. Or, instead of anger, it could be some other emotion. I could use a sad story about my childhood as a very tangential connection to this story. Either way, I???ll be moving you away from your correct opinions and towards my damaged emotions. Have fun debating that.In some ways, being wrong is actually easier. I???ve been here before and I know how to dig myself out. At this point, I???m no longer connected to my actual values, but instead the pure animalistic desire to be better than another person. You???re still playing with everything to lose. I wish I could just say you???re right ??? I really do ??? but my lizard like brain is defensive and you???ve attacked me.  I can see in your eyes how much you actually care about not only this issue, but also how much you care about me. I???m actually kind of sad for you.Also, I can just bring up some fight that we had before when I was right and make it about that. That pretty much always works.In the future, I will perhaps be calmer and admit my wrongdoing. However, more likely, I will add this moment to the large list of times I???ve been wrong and let it be erased from my memory. When you mention it again, I will pretend it never even happened. To add to this, as is my way, I will agree wholeheartedly with you and say, ???Can you imagine me saying that, that???s ridiculous!??? The rest of that night I will reference how ridiculous that would be if I said those things. I should remind you though that, right now, I am literally saying those things to your face.If we are not friends because of this, leaving me lost and unhappy, I can at least say with confidence: I won. I???m right and you: you???re wrong.You???re so wrong.And I???m right.???Abandon all carts, ye who enter here.???- -First Circle: Limbo. Trader Joe???s.Second Circle: Lust.

Ideally, your personal brand will say, ???I???m funny, smart, attractive, industrious, snarky, pleasantly idiosyncratic, refreshingly down-to-earth, and never farther than two feet from an electronic device on which I can share my every waking thought.???Q: That sounds like a lot.A: Did we say quirky? Also quirky.Q: Is building a personal brand difficult?A: Startlingly. This is partly because no one seems to agree on what brand means.1 For our purposes, brand will refer to the overall way you make people and organizations perceive you, and not the thing where you burn your initials into a cow.Q: Are personal brands different from traditional brands?A: They???re actually similar in some ways ??? here???s an example. Though they???re not people per se, major brands like Coca-Cola, Time Warner Cable, and Guy Fieri are still aiming to boost their popularity. The main difference is that they have vast resources at their disposal, including billions of dollars and political influence with a weapons smuggler known only as Zain.Q: How has personal branding evolved over the years?A: Good question. Simply put, social media has changed everything. Thanks to the rise of websites like Facebook, Twitter, and beekeepingforums.com, we now have an unprecedented array of digital platforms with which to engage the world and grow our brands.Q: Beekeeping forums?A: We know, the Internet can be confusing. Think of it this way: in 1950, an American male could build and promote his brand simply by tucking in his shirt and occasionally joking about the notion of women in the workplace. But today, people seeking to push their brands online must juggle a host of competing concerns, such as:1. Is what I???m about to post too political?2. Is what I???m about to post too narcissistic?3. Is what I???m about to post not a cogent thought but rather a picture of the meal I intend to eat?4. Maybe my profile picture is dumb.Q: Does everyone have a brand?A: Another good question ??? the answer is yes! Each time we post a thought or image, friends and strangers alike are actively forming ruthless and unchanging opinions of us, often based on our choice of clothing or the vaguely abject way we slump our shoulders since things with Carol ended.Q: Yikes.A: Indeed. Fortunately, there are a few easy tips for creating your own positive, unique brand. The first is to put your best foot forward. For instance, if your work experience isn???t relevant to the brand you want to build, don???t list it in your online profile. Instead, put something that highlights your winning personality, like ???NACHOS = LOVE!!???Q: Anything else?A: Remember, less is more. Let???s say you???re tweeting fifty times a day. Pause and ask yourself, ???Could I accomplish the same thing with forty-five???? The answer is very often yes.Q: What personal branding pitfalls, if any, should I be aware of?A: By far the most common (and severe) mistake is saying something that 100% of people do not agree with.2 Consequently, before you post anything, we recommend testing it with a series of multicultural focus groups over a six-week period.Q: Do you have any final words of advice?A: Say somewhere that you???re a social media guru. The Internet is in awe of these people.- -1 The Oxford English Dictionary defines brand as ???A particular sort or class of goods, as indicated by the trade-marks on them.??? This isn???t terribly helpful. The Oxford English Dictionary is a bad book.2 For example, ???[presidential candidate] is good,??? or ???[current event] is bad.???I do hope you watched the first Republican presidential debate of the 2016 campaign. I can???t imagine that anything we???ll see in the next eleven months will come close to it for entertainment value. The evening was a grand old free-for-all; a fight so fast and dirty it really deserved to be on Pay-Per-View. FOX News, by jettisoning the staid ???my distinguished colleague??? format of past presidential debates, produced a viewer experience akin to watching a fistfight in a Warner Brothers cartoon???a big cloud of dust punctuated by wild punches, exploding stars, and incoherent exclamations. Somewhere in the thick of it, Donald Trump planted his knee in the backs of the rest of the field, but everyone in the melee managed t",100
485,"o score a few cheap points, or at least look like a jerk: Rand Paul rolled his eyes at Chris Christie. Christie sniped at Mike Huckabee over entitlement reform. Huckabee crowed that the purpose of the military is to destroy everything we love. Ben Carson insulted all of Washington with the kind of joke I assume brain surgeons tell when they visit their kids??? third-grade classrooms for Career Day. Everyone, in short, brought their ???A??? game.Watching these redoubtable champions reminded me of two not entirely unrelated things: Those science experiments where they put too many rats in one habitat and watch them descend into cannibalism, and the ancient sport of pankration.The rats hardly need explaining, but you may be less familiar with pankration. It???s a sport that featured prominently in the Greek Olympics as far back as 648 B.C., and it combined the best elements of boxing, wrestling, and felony aggravated assault. The rules in pankration were simple; you couldn???t bite or gouge. That???s it. Everything else was legal. You could kick, you could punch, you could strangle, grapple, pinch, and pull hair. You could take your opponent down by tripping him, or by grabbing his foot when he kicked. Once he was down, you were free to hit or kick him. Pankration was practiced by Greek athletes and Greek soldiers (the Spartans amended the rules to allow biting and gouging), and the sport???s influence extended even into the realm of mythology: Hercules reportedly defeated the Nemean Lion using pankration, and Theseus was said to have killed the Minotaur with it.Well I ask you, how could anyone look at Donald Trump???s hair and not be reminded of Hercules, clad in the Nemean Lion???s golden pelt? And who doesn???t think Chris Christie makes a very convincing minotaur? He has roughly the same favorability ratings. But these similarities, striking though they may be, weren???t the only reasons my mind turned to pankration during the debate. For one thing, rule-breaking was clearly the point of the whole enterprise, starting with FOX???s format. Forced to accommodate a Republican field as wide as the plain of Marathon, the network hastily concocted a bracket system, complete with controversial seeding decisions that relegated Carly Fiorina, Rick Perry and five other non-division winners to the pre-game show. On this artificially leveled playing field, the ten anointed candidates indulged in so much rhetorical tripping, pinching, and hair-pulling that the event could have doubled as a casting call for a Three Stooges biopic.Yet, somewhat surprisingly, the most common dirty trick of the night was to attack those who weren???t present to defend themselves. FOX had decreed it would reward debaters with an extra thirty seconds of response time whenever an opponent ???called them out??? by name, an open invitation to indulge in one-on-one pissing matches. But the candidates, apart from some exasperated cross-talk and sniping, mostly declined to attack each other in any organized fashion. They preferred instead to savage President Obama and the presumed Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton. And their absolute favorite target, the one that absorbed by far the worst of the night???s cheap shots, was women, collectively. The all-male rivals on stage were united in their eagerness to deny women the most basic human rights. They asserted that women have no right to control the reproductive processes of their bodies, and no right to basic health care. They agreed that the fate of a 4-cell embryo is more important than the life of a woman. Trump added his own flourish to the policy tirades by declaring that calling women pigs, dogs, and animals is ???fun.???Just like the ancient Greeks, I thought, watching his golden coiffure gleam, lion-like, beneath the stage lights. The Greeks ascribed no legal personhood to women; in fact, Greek women were in some ways worse off than Greek slaves. Slaves could, under some circumstances, become Greek citizens. Women never could. They were regarded as property, little more than vessels for the production of heirs. And so the GOP candidates??? boasts about defunding Planned Parenthood, forcing rape victims to endure unwanted pregnancy, and allowing women to die when abortion would save their lives had an oddly classical ring to them.I???d like to think their misogyny is anachronistic. Times change, after all. Greek women weren???t allowed to train in pankration (married women couldn???t even watch the Olympic games), but it???s an active sport today, with both male and female pankratiasts. Even though it has been specifically excluded from every modern Olympic Games due to its brutality, you can find people who teach it, and some of them are women. I myself discovered pankration firsthand, via a National Women???s Martial Arts Federation training camp, where a tenth-degree black belt and a former police officer???both female???taught me how to break someone???s elbow in a groundfight. They also revived my dormant childhood expertise in pinching, and gave me whole new attitude toward finger-breaking. They taught me those skills in part so that, should anyone ever attempt to rape me, I wouldn???t have to worry about what a bunch of powerful men thought should happen afterwards. These women taught me brutality so that the catfights of blustering politicians would remain, as they ought to, irrelevant to my actual lived experience.For those who aren???t lucky enough to take a class in pankration, learning about the sport usually involves looking at a lot of vases. The ancient Greeks awarded a special vase, called a Panathenaic amphora, to champion Olympic pankratiasts, and some of these trophies have survived long enough to end up in today???s museums. From the images painted on them, you can learn many of pankration???s vital moves: how to trap a kick to throw your opponent, how to hold him in a headlock while you punch him, and even how to surrender (by raising your right index finger???an important technique to know in ancient Greece because if no one surrendered, the fight continued until someone was dead). The vases included realistic touches like bloody noses, and the watchful presence of referees holding rods used to strike an athlete if he committed a foul. It???s all very instructive.But after the GOP debate, I looked up some of the more famous surviving pankration amphorae online, and noticed for the first time what an awkward spectacle they portrayed???the nude bodies frozen in attitudes of conflict; the flat, stiff figures trampling one another, locked in unnatural, painful embraces. The athletic male figure does not map particularly well to the rounded contours of the amphora, so the fighters appear distorted, the hard angles of elbow and knee warped to ride the curves of the jar???s waist and belly and neck. It???s a curiously artificial picture of power, the action sliding erratically over the surface of the vessel.An apt metaphor for the debate, I decided, where the all-male competitors chose womankind as the surface upon which to render the spectacle of their power. No wonder they ended up looking as cartoonish and contorted as two-dimensional figures splayed across a clay pot; the very shape of the vessel they were projecting their malice upon revealed their shallowness of their beliefs.Scrolling through the images of Panathenaic amphorae, I was reminded too that the vessels weren???t created solely as a surface on which male brutality could be written and celebrated. They were designed for something much more practical: to hold olive oil. The amphora awarded to an Olympic champion was filled with oil from a sacred grove of olive trees d",100
486,"edicated to Athena, the goddess of wisdom and justice. She was also one of the Greek deities of war???the strategic, thoughtful warrior who acted as a counterweight to her brother Ares (a brainless butcher who fathered an astonishing number of illegitimate children, even by the standards of the Gods of Olympus). And Athena was, of course, the patron goddess of Athens; the Olympics were held in her honor. And that is why, when you look at a picture of male fighters on an amphora, you are in fact viewing the back of the vessel. Turn it around, and look at its front, and you???ll see an image of Athena, usually bearing a sword and shield. She always looks much more dignified, and more powerful, than the fumbling, straining men on the other side.Pankration is a fine sport, and an excellent practical skill in emergencies, but the GOP presidential contenders would do well to think about the downside of a no-holds-barred fighting style. Though undeniably fun to watch, it tends to interfere with the development and display of one???s problem-solving skills. After all, the mighty Hercules was sufficiently skilled in pankration to kill the Nemean Lion bare-handed, but he was too dumb to figure out how to skin it, until Athena took pity on him and suggested he use one of the lion???s claws.All these men who are so anxious to lead America???s citizens really ought to keep in mind that they might need advice or cooperation from women some day. Or votes???we???re allowed to be citizens now, you see. Treating us as empty vessels, defacing our gender with insults and then displaying us as trophies of your sweaty, grunt-laden victory, is not a great way to elicit our sympathy, or our respect.But if you just want to entertain us, by all means, gentlemen, keep it up. The Democratic candidates won???t do any debating until October, and they???re bound to be civilized and boring. We???d all love to see one of you throttle Trump into submission, or break some of Huckabee???s toes. Do your worst. I???ll be watching. Until football season starts, anyway.Donald Trump ???

Listen, as several of Trump???s forebears recount some of the most famous moments in history.The Death of Julius CaesarSo this is, maybe, a week after the Ides of March. I???m in Rome. I got a new coliseum there. Great coliseum. I build a lot them. Make a lot of money. Very successful.So I???m in Rome. And Brutus and his cabal ask me to say a few words about Caesar. Really, begging me to say something about him. And Brutus is an honorable guy. So, I???m like, ???Sure. Whatever.???But then right before my speech, Brutus comes up to me ??? he???s real nervous, Brutus ??? and he says, ???Whatever you do in your speech, don???t blame me for Caesar???s death.???I think, ???That???s odd.??? But, whatever. Brutus is an honorable guy.So I deliver this speech. Great speech. Tremendous speech. It???s about Caesar. He???s dead. Lot of emotions. Really brings down the house. I get rave reviews for the speech. Rave reviews. Everybody loves it.But then, weeks later, the media is saying I said these things that I never said. Awful things.I???ll give you an example: The New Rome Times, which is losing money left and right. Unreadable. Total trash. Hates the empire. But the New Rome Times says that I came to praise Caesar, which is totally false.What I said was ??? and this is a direct quote ??? ???I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.??? Not to praise him. How they get the exact opposite out of that, I don???t know. But that???s the media for you.The Last SupperI love Jesus, I do. But the guy can be long-winded. ???Blessed are these people, Blessed are those people.??? Basically, everybody???s blessed, but he???s gotta read through the whole Roman census before you find that out.Like this one night, Jesus and his crew are one table away from me. And I???m hearing him go on and on about something. Won???t stop talking about it.I can???t take it anymore. So I lean over. I say, ???Jesus, you make a nice speech and all. Kind of belabor the point; Peter???s falling asleep over here. So let me cut to the chase: Someone???s gonna betray you tonight, and it???s Judas.???Jesus gives me this look, like I???m the one who???s betrayed him.I say, ???C???mon, Jesus, it???s the worst kept secret in Jerusalem. Guy owes everybody in town money. Suddenly, he???s flashing 30 pieces of silver."" I love Jesus, but he???s probably still trying to figure out who killed Abel.Problem is, Jesus never had a sense for business. Never did. Here???s a guy who can turn water into wine ??? and I know wine. Bought a vineyard, doing terrible business, I buy it, now it???s making a profit. Yuge, yuge profit. But here???s a guy who can turn water into wine; still pays for it when he goes out.I???m like, ???Jesus, just order water!??? Or at least make Judas pay.I mean, seriously, who finds a mole in his operation, invites the guy out to dinner?Jesus, that???s who.The Third CrusadeSo, I tell the Knights Templar, ""Richard the Lionheart? Please. Should be called Richard the Lazy Bastard. Seriously. He had one thing to do. One thing. Capture Jerusalem. What???s he do? Makes peace with Saladin.???I ask Saladin about that, too. Sal???s a friend. I say, ???Sal, what the hell happened???? He says, ???Your guy???s no good. Can???t negotiate. Awful negotiator.???Never would have happened if I led the Third Crusade. I know negotiators. If they ever invent the printing press, I plan on writing a book on it.Hell, I know this one guy ??? awful guy, terrible human being ??? but he knows how to negotiate. Genghis Khan. Horrible human being. Great negotiator. I bring him in; Jerusalem is taken in two days. Tops.The American RevolutionI would have people come up to me all the time and say, ???Mr. Trump, Mr. Trump, you should lead our troops. You should have lead.??? And I should have, because I would have ended the war, Day One.I would have gone up to King George III, whom I know. I would have said, ???Georgie, we???re leaving.???He???d cry, he???d beg, he???d try to convince us to stay. I???d say, ???No, no, no. Here???s the way it works: We leave, you get nothing, that???s the deal??? And then I???d turn to the French, and I???d say, ???And you ??? Thanks for the help. Now give us a statue. A woman. But not an ugly one.???Papers would be signed the next morning.19th-Century Medical SciencePeople ask me all the time, because I love women so much. They say, ???Mr. Trump, what do we need to do to help women???? Because we have to protect their health, we have to. So I say, ???Two words ??? Wandering. Uteruses.??? Because they???re everywhere. Everywhere. Wandering over here, wandering over there. Even mention it and women go into hysterics. If I were in charge, I would bring back the uteruses. I would bring them all back. From China. From Mexico. From Japan. From wherever they wander. ???Making Uteruses Great Again,??? that would be my motto.The TitanicSo they have this board of inquiry. They ask me to appear. They beg. Plead. Say I???m the only one who can make sense of this tragedy.I show up. I don???t know what I can do, but I show up. They ask what I think happened. Everyone is saying, ???The ship hit the iceberg, the ship hit the iceberg.??? I tell them straight. I say, ???No, that???s not what happened."" I say, ""The iceberg attacked that ship.???P",100
487,"eople are stunned. They never heard anyone say this before. They start clapping, start calling my name, they love me. They love how I tell the truth. I???m the only one who tells the truth.I say, ???Look, I know icebergs. Know a lot about them. No one knows more about icebergs than me. No one. Icebergs attacked that ship, because the icebergs are at war with us.???Makes total sense. But these guys. These guys on this board. Bums. They look at me. They say, ???Whaddya mean, ???attacked???? An iceberg can???t attack a ship.???I say, ???Listen, you idiots."" I call them idiots. They???re politicians. I give them money. I call them anything I want. I say, ???Listen, you idiots. The icebergs attacked us because they think we???re weak. We???re not weak, but they think we???re weak.???They look at me. Dumbfounded. I say, ""If I were president, I would beat these icebergs.??? Because I beat icebergs all the time. All the time. I???m the icebergs??? biggest enemy, and they know this. ???I would build a wall. And that wall would keep out the icebergs. And you can believe that, because nobody builds a better wall than me. Nobody.???By now, people are clapping, hollering, saying I should run for president. I didn???t. Thought about it. Too many interests. Lotta business interests. Make a lot of money. But if I had to run, I can promise you this, I would be the greatest iceberg president of all time. All time.Buck Rogers in the 25th CenturyGuy falls asleep, wake up 500 years later, America is conquered but he still claims to be some kind of a hero.

Actually, have you ever had that occur for a cumulative length of ten. Freaking. Years. I???m sorry. I???m exaggerating a little. The figure on my screen for the average number of days a woman is in menses is only 3500. I apologize. For it to be ten years, the figure would have had to be 3650.  So again, I???m sorry about that. I was a little upset.??????When you say, ???risk of heart attack or stroke??? do you mean, like, big ones???????Fuck you.???Dear Charlton Heston???s Cold, Dead Hands,It???s time to give up that gun.I admired your knotty knuckles and cowhide callouses in The Big Country, Ben-Hur, and many others during your warm and living days. I remember thinking, ???That???s a pretty tough pair of mitts right there.??? I bet you???ve given those composting microorganisms something to think about. Let me ask you this, though: is the rifle really helping you out in your current fight? Or is it backfiring a little, maybe putting some pathogens into the mix that would never bother an unarmed hand?I know, I know??? the rifle is a symbol of militant preparedness. An armed citizenry is the best check against tyranny, right?  If a tyrant sent a zombie army to take over your graveyard, they would have to do so in the knowledge that you and your fellow gun-gripping hands would rise up and oppose them. The other dead hands are complacent cowards who don???t realize they owe their freedom to you guys ??? the minutehands. Everyone knows it was this kind of preparedness that won the day in the American Revolution of Decomposing Extremities. If you really want a militia, couldn???t you just establish an armory ??? no pun intended ??? in a centrally located and secure part of the cemetery? You could provide keys to a few trusted and well-trained hands, who would only open it in the extremely unlikely event of a government-sponsored zombie invasion.Hold on a second, you might say, the militia thing is not the only rationale behind the rifle. What if a lone wolf showed up at the cemetery at short notice, carrying a semiautomatic machine gun between its teeth? If the good guys don???t have access to a deadly weapon, then the lone wolf will run amok. The other dead hands think they are safe lying in the cemetery, but the wolf could strike anywhere.Let me follow this line of argument to its logical conclusion. I live in tornado alley and often, during tornado season, I worry because I envision a twister carrying away my house with my family and me inside.Do you think I should purchase a nuclear bomb? They always say tornadoes strike with the force of an atomic bomb. Perhaps if I was prepared to preempt the attack with equal force, my family and I would stand a better chance of survival. I could keep the detonator at my bedside. It would set my mind at ease. If I awoke to the sound of an approaching tornado, I would rush out and warn the twister not to cross my property line. I could cite my rights under the U.S. constitution. Wouldn???t America be a safer place if everyone owned an atomic bomb? No, that???s ridiculous. I mean??? why would anyone ever keep an atom bomb around the house? An atomic bomb doesn???t make sense for home security any more than a semiautomatic assault weapon with a massive magazine does.Your rifle is different. It would be perfect for hunting, and possible to store safely around the house. It???s just, well, you???re not really hunting that much these days. And you???re not around the house much. You don???t need the rifle.As I???ve said before, you???re a safe pair of hands. You stole the scene from the Ten Commandments in The Ten Commandments. But you???re also, frankly, cold. And, without putting too fine a point on it, dead. You have no business carrying a gun. Any more than a school teacher has any business carrying a gun; or a commercial pilot; or ??? for God???s sakes ??? a pastor. Asking these brave people to keep the peace with a gun is abusing their sense of responsibility for those in their care. Criticizing these brave people because they chose not to bear arms in places specifically designed to be oases of peace? I shudder to think how cold and moribund a hand would have to be to point a finger like that. Even down there in the grave, you must have recoiled at that one.I understand the gun thing was a big hobby for you. But there are others. I don???t know, handball? Pattycake?People say you???ll never let it go. But I bet you can still flex.You are cold, but not frozen in place.So drop it, Charlton Heston???s cold, dead hands. Drop the gun. Release your chokehold on the imagination of American gun owners. And don???t say: ???But I was cremated.??? You guys started this metaphor, not me.Yours sincerely,Rob CurranIf we???ve met, you???ve probably categorized me as another unfortunate victim of schizophrenia, severe ADHD, or dementia.

One of our oldest and most beloved icons died today at the age of 109. Surviving emphysema, lung cancer, and numerous heart conditions over the years, The Little Engine that Could passed away today during a tragic accident along the Metro North Harlem Line. Only one of many casualties of the accident, Engine That Could was the oldest.Born in 1906 to a Swedish reverend, Charles S. Wing, Engine that Could???s mother died soon after giving birth. Her labor took place on a Sunday, and she assured her husband that she would be fine. She was being taken care of in a modern hospital, after all. Reverend Charles was a modern man, a staunch believer in American ideals, and reconciled his beliefs with the progress of technology. That Sunday, his sermon focused on the notion that every person on earth is an engine of God???s goodness, and that each human being could, if they tried hard enough, continue to better the new, turn-of-the-century progress they found themselves witnessing. Hurrying back to the hospital after the service, he found a ???dour-faced doctor and a sympathetic midwife.??? In his collected diaries and sermons, from which this information was gleaned, he continued: ???They told me the light of my life had passed but that I had a child, not as strong as one would wish, but a healthy child with lungs that played ear-piercing tunes. When I was asked what to put on the birth certificate, I remembered my sermon, and I knew exactly what name I would give this child.???When Engine that Could was ten, Reverend Charles married a schoolteacher named Mabel. Though many at the time believed that she should become Engine that Could???s de facto mother, she ???took no credit for originating??? the ten-year-old, which earned her trust with the child.Soon after reaching the age of adulthood, Engine that Could left home in order to travel. Though city-bred through and through, having grown up in a Brooklyn brownstone and reading the Swedish newspaper Nordstjernan as well as the New York Tribune, Engine that Could heard and read so much about America???s purportedly still somewhat ???wild??? West, and decided to begin a journey to explore the United States from East to South to North to West.An early outdoors journalist, Engine that Could hiked some of the highest summits in the United States, sending missives back to Nordsjernan who published the pieces. In a kind of journalistic retrospective released by the newspaper in the 1960s of Engine that Could???s best articles and an interview, Engine that Could shared one of the methods for getting through particular rough patches during hikes: ???You just tell yourself you can do it, and you keep on telling yourself, and keep going, just to the next rock, then just to the next tree, and suddenly you???re over the hill and walking down faster than you can believe!???Although Engine that Could was agnostic, Reverend Charles continued to love and support his child until his death in 1957. Engine that Could then took some of Reverend Charles??? congregation on a short hike and gave an unofficial sermon while scattering the reverend???s ashes. The words spoken that day are fitting for The Little Engine that Could???s own death after years of continued writing about nature, hiking, and the importance of the great outdoors, even long after Engine that Could could hike anymore, and so we repeat them here: ???My father taught me the mantra I used whenever I was climbing up a hill: I think I can, I think I can, I think I can, I think I can. And then, when I???d cross over, he taught me to allow myself the joyous realization of something well done: I thought I could! I thought I could! I thought I could!??????Now, this is wild, we had to call a separate Uber for Pharrell???s big hat.??????Boy, I tell ya, this show???s moving by slower than Banjo Kazooie???s loading time.??????My Tinder date spent all my bitcoins at Jamba Juice.??????I hear that Pau Gasol???s been ???binge-watching Crank Yankers,??? if you catch my drift.??????Get this: Nick Cannon got catfished by a Bitmoji.??????#Gamergate??????Barack Obama taking a selfie while doing Zumba.

Besides, I think I read somewhere that Michael Pollan said that it???s OK to shop there as long as it???s after 6 PM.In comedy it is often said that timing is everything.  Last year on October 8th, McSweeney???s posted my unabashed love letter to an artist of tremendous stature and historical importance whose work I had always held dear: Bill Cosby.  It was also a story about how Bill had shown me??? and more importantly my family??? great kindness.  Nine days later, a video of comedian Hannibal Buress on stage calling Cosby a rapist during a performance in Bill???s native Philadelphia became a kind of ???shot heard ???round the world,??? generating widespread media attention and prompting dozens of women to come forward and tell about the horrors they had been subjected to at the hands of ???America???s Dad.???Back when I was a young stand up comedian in the mid-1980s and early-1990s, I knew a charming and personable comic named Vince Champ.  We worked the road together many times and became good friends.  I wrote a lot of material for him, including an entire monologue about the 1992 presidential race for an appearance Vince made on A&E???s An Evening at the Improv. Vince even attended the bachelor party roast that was held prior to my wedding in 1993.  Shortly thereafter, I pretty much stopped performing when I moved into TV development and Vince and I lost touch.  Then in 1997, I got a call from another comedian friend asking me if I had heard about Vince.  I guessed that he had gotten some big break as he had already done Star Search and a bunch of late night shows.  But no.  Vince had been arrested for an attempted rape.  I never saw it coming.  In the following weeks and months, the story unfolded and Vince Champ would be charged with a string of rapes on college campuses across the country.  The dates and locations of the assaults lined up with his calendar of performances. He has since been tried, sentenced, and will likely remain behind bars for the rest of his life. I have never written about Vince and have barely even spoken of him since.  The crimes were incomprehensible to me and the fact that I spent many years in Vince???s company without the slightest inkling about his unspeakable dark side, even in hindsight, troubles me to this day.  I have always seen comedy as a noble pursuit.  A calling to rescue us all from our worries and pain. And while I have seen many incarnations of the tragic face that sometimes exists underneath the comic???s mask, I didn???t know how to accept how anyone whose purpose was to bring joy and laughter could be that evil.Bill Cosby isn???t just any comedian.  He is a legend.  A hero.  An icon.  And with that stature came power and influence.  The power and influence to, in the words of his accusers, take advantage of women???s trust and admiration, drug them, sexually assault them and then control the story afterwards.  And if I???m going to be really honest with you all??? and with myself??? I had heard rumors about Bill for years.  But shockingly, even after the tragic Vince Champ ordeal, I???m ashamed to admit that I chose to dismiss them as just that.  Rumors.  Hearsay.  I suppose I just didn???t want it to be true.  But if it holds true that where there???s smoke there???s fire, I have never seen this much smoke.  And once the smoke clears, all that will be left is the scorched earth.Certainly this saga is continuing to play out and many other people way more qualified than me will continue to write about it.  And although it???s far less important than the devastation to the lives of everyone involved, friends have called me onto the carpet about my relationship to Cosby???s work.  To the affection I have felt for him in the past.  To the essay that has remained on McSweeney???s Internet Tendency.  To the signed LP cover that continued to hang on my wall.  Until very recently, I sought sanctuary in my belief that it???s sometimes necessary to separate the artist from their art.  That I could hold onto what always meant something to me and that Bill???s work and his legacy might remain unmarred.  But here???s the problem.  Especially with a comedian, the artist and the art are one and the same.  You love the art because you love the artist.  It???s not a disembodied, freestanding collection of jokes and stories.  It???s a human being who is the vessel.  The comedian is the art personified.A couple of weeks ago, New York Magazine featured a cover story where 35 of the women who have come forward to tell their stories were pictured, seated side-by-side-by-side.  Their interviews are archived, in print and on video, describing the heartless brutality they endured in excruciating detail.  At that point, the dam burst.  I wept.  I knew it was time.  I decided that I wouldn???t ask McSweeney???s to take down my pre-existing essay about Bill.  It remains a true reflection of my feelings up to that moment.  But I did feel compelled to write this follow up.  Because a few days ago, I took Cosby???s signed LP down off of my wall.  It???s over.  I can no longer bring myself to watch or listen to Bill???s work.  I have a little girl who is turning eight later this month.  And while I will always love comedy, I love my daughter more.Hello.

Smart wife say this advertising trope, although superficially empowering in its portrayal of women, is inherently condescending and demeaning to both sexes. Smart wife say the advertising industry???s habitual reliance on lazy, regressive gender stereotypes, beyond merely insulting the intelligence of consumers, actively contributes to the climate of casual sexism that pervades virtually every aspect of modern American society.Me like sound of smart wife???s fancy words, and me would agree with smart wife except me no understand what smart wife saying, because, again, me just fucking moron commercial husband.Oh well.

My Assimilation Counselor says the hive mind is absolutely mystified by my nanoprobe results. I told him, ???All part of God???s mysteries.???

But go along to get along, right?Miss y???all,L.S.- -Stardate 69028.1Richard and Denise,Got my ocular laser implant today and was bummed to discover it can???t disintegrate matter. It???s just an aid for daily PowerPoint presentations covering issues like how the myriad of biological and technical distinctiveness we???ve assimilated includes allergies that will immediately bring an end to Taco Tuesdays. Makes me wonder whose culture is adapting to serve whom. Anyway, some of the guys invited me to sneak out and ???mix shit up??? at a Romulan bar. It???s like they say, ???All assimilation and no recreation makes Borg a codified boy.???Best from your eldest.- -Stardate 69048.3Consanguineous Predecessors,I miscalculated the strength of Romulan ale by a staggering margarin, leading to the expulsion of biomass on a particularly belligerent member of Species 8472. Thankfully United Federation of Planets officials were on the premises and able to immediately initiate peacekeeping protocol and subdue the xenomorphic organism. It is a pity as my negotiations regarding inter-species propagation with a Catullan and her Risian friend seemed to be an imminent probability. I also ascertained, in quite disconcerting fashion, the Borg suit does not bio-recycle human waste as one of the older, cooler Borg advised me it would. At this point I suspect the passcode for the secret holodeck he sold me is an additional act of monkeyshine. As a punitive measure I???ve been assigned to three weeks in the maturation chamber.Yours In Pursuit.- -Stardate: 69120.1Bearers Of Similar Deoxyribonucleic Acid,I???ve emerged from the maturation chamber to exhilarating news that I advise you ensconce yourself upon the davenport to receive.

I was delighted to ???see??? them again, if only through digital photos on a computer screen.We did a lot of catching up through private messages at first, but when other classmates found us, the simplest post could generate a mega-thread of fun co-written by dozens of people. We shared vacation photos and kid photos and daily updates, joking around and making plenty of references to events from a shared past that brought instant comments and plenty of emoticons.It was like high school had never ended. It was really good.Then one day I caught a news story about legislators somewhere out west pushing to allow guns in bars. Not thinking too much about it, I posted a link to the story along with a mini-editorial along the lines of ???Hey, nothing dangerous about mixing bullets and bourbon in the Wild West, right????A brief observation and a link to a current event, just regular Facebook stuff.The next morning when I checked my account, it said that more than 200 new posts were waiting for me on my page.Working late into the night, a trio of former high school friends had gone on a copy-paste spree, papering my wall with not only the text of the Second Amendment but the gun laws of each of the 50 states, most of them so long and detailed that they required multiple posts to accommodate Facebook???s then-limit on word count. The capstone to all of the pasting was an angry screed about my foolish naivet?? and my need to get with the gun-rights program or be the first person sacrificed in the coming War Against Tyranny.I imagine they sincerely thought that I would keep all of this crap on my page for all of my actual friend ???friends??? to see, but that didn???t happen. Instead I spent the morning clicking an endless series of tiny ???x??? symbols and verifying that yes, I really did want to delete each post, permanently and without possibility of an Undo.Then I sent a group-addressed private message to the wall vandals: ???Stop by and check out my gun collection whenever you???re over this way. But stop assuming, too.???When that chore was finished, I told Facebook that it should never show any of these people another word I posted. Nor did they have permission to put anything on my page anymore. They could remain my ???friends,??? but only in names-on-a-list form. We were in all other respects done.It was like high school had never ended. It was really stupid.The next day, there were no new posts. Instead, I had hundreds of private messages. The gundamentalists had found a way around the blocked permissions. All of the gun laws were back, plus new editorials about censorship and free speech and the First Amendment coming right before the Second so it was just as sacred and not to be trifled with and who the fucking hell did I think I was, deleting the truth?Another unwanted ex",100

So I deleted them all from my contacts forever.A week later, nearly all of the other high school friends???people who had not piled on in the give-him-hell backlash???had deleted me.The gundies had taken their revenge.It was like being in middle school again. It was a pre-teen popularity contest and I was the weird kid ostracized by the cool clique. My one little hey, let???s talk about the wisdom of mixing guns with alcohol had met with nearly 500 resounding shouts of HELL NO LET???S TALK ABOUT YOUR IGNORANCE INSTEAD YOU MISERABLE GUN-HATING SHITBAG.It reminded me of a far-ago time when, at a poker table discussion with my then-girlfriend???s brothers and a few of their friends about something political, I???d said, ???I dunno, I really can???t envision that happening,??? and the table talk immediately froze while everyone turned to stare at me.???Uh, I can???t enn-vish-enn that you just actually said that,??? one of the bros said after a long silence, his eyebrow raised about as high in disapproval as an eyebrow can go, and great laughter broke out all around.I know I turned red because I could feel it; the embarrassment tingled along my scalp like a hundred crawling ants. But it burned for only a minute before I knew how to get out of the vocabulary hole I???d just dug.???Ah, fuck you and your enn-vish-enn, dumbass,??? I said, mocking the way he???d mocked me. ???Get a fucking dictionary.???The laughter around the table became a roar, and the offended party raised his beer bottle in acknowledgement of the counterstrike. We went back to playing cards and I went back to losing my money.But for the rest of that night, there was something in the way that he looked at me???or more accurately, wouldn???t look at me. Although neither of us would ever acknowledge it, and would pretend for several more years to be on friendly terms, a divide had opened up and we had become instant enemies???over a Big Word.???Gun??? has a lot fewer letters than the word I used that night, but it???s a thousand times bigger.Maybe I???ll post something about that to Facebook.

Francine, Bala Cynwyd, PA- - -??? ??? ??? ??? ???Can???t live without it!??????I started cooking with coconut oil after a not-so-great physical scared me straight. My cholesterol is down and my taste buds are still happy!?????? Grant, Rio Rancho, NM- - ??? ??? ??? ??? ???I resurrected my dead dog with coconut oil!??????I???ve always been a proponent of the manna that is coconut oil.  It???s a superfood (I like to call it Mother Nature???s Kale), a cure-all home remedy (risk-free pain management!), and the time machine of skin care supplies (studies show it has the same anti-aging power as good genes!). So, it was no real surprise when Lucithia, my best friend from adult summer camp, told me to try some coconut oil on the body of my recently deceased toy Swedish Vallhound, Gary. When Gary fell off the fire escape of my fourth-floor walk-up, I knew one thing: if I was going to resurrect him from the dead, I was not going to sacrifice my values. I would have to use something organic, chemical-free, and not tested on innocent animals like Gary. That???s when I called Lucithia, who is a registered healer who has been to India, and she told me what to do and ran over to help. So I took out my 12 pound tub of cage-free coconut oil, and brought it down to the sidewalk where the pieces of Gary???s body lay strewn on the pavement. Before touching him, I sanitized my hands with coconut oil, forgot I hadn???t eaten breakfast, ate some coconut oil, noticed my cuticles looked awful, rubbed some coconut oil on my cuticles, and then gave some coconut oil to Lucithia in a Mason Jar as a thank you gift for helping me. Lucithia set up some candles and started some basic chanting to summon the Dark Lord and I drew a chalk circle and assembled Gary???s body parts in a way that resembled what he looked like before falling four flights. To create a Wiccan cone of power, I began rubbing the pure coconut oil, which is a basic mixture of coconut oil, distilled water, silicone, glycerin, cetyl alcohol, and kerosene, into Gary???s remains???and voila! A hole opened up in the pavement, Mephistopheles rose laughing from the hellfire below, scooped up Gary???s remains, and carried him into the Underworld. In no time, Demon Gary, an odd assemblage of the body parts that were not mush from the fall, ran from up out of the fiery Hellmouth and into my arms! And as Demon Gary licked me happily, leaving large disfiguring burns and cuts all over my face with his barbed demon tongue, I said to Lucithia, ???Pass the coconut oil!????????? Cynthia, Boulder, CODear Icelandic Phallological Museum,While I am no stranger to the pleasures of gawking awkwardly at the male member, I must say: what the fuck?  Do we really need an entire museum full of dicks?  I mean, I got your dick museum right here, Iceland.  It???s called online dating.But I???ll play along with your phallological shtick (or shall I say ???rod???).  I???m a bit intrigued by your founder, who seems to have stumbled into the field of phallology.  (You know, he just fell into hundreds of dicks ???by accident.???)  According to your website, the museum???s founder began his collection after being given a pizzle and a few whale penises as a joke.  I totally understand this progression.  One minute some guy gives you a whale penis, the next you???re the proud owner of a dick museum.  Seen it a million times.  Even the most innocent interest in male genitalia is a downward spiral.  Just a few years ago, a man came up to me with some fried bull testicles.  Come on, he said, just take a little taste.  Don???t be a pussy.  After a few weeks, I???d lost my job, my friends, my home.  I spent my afternoons huddled outside of the local Spay and Neuter Clinic hoping for a payload.  Come on, Doc, Momma needs some Rottweiler balls!  I shudder at the memory.  At least your founder was able to channel his genital addiction into a positive avenue with so many social benefits.  As you note on the website, ???it is finally possible for individuals to undertake serious study into the field of phallology in an organized, scientific fashion. ??? Phew!  Finally!  For a moment there, I thought I???d have to keep doing all of my serious study on Pornhub.In addition to an extensive exhibition of male genitalia, the museum also displays ???about 350 artistic oddments and practical utensils related to the museum ??s chosen theme.???  Practical penis utensils?  Like, Martha Stewart???s ???Genital Inspirations??? line of cookware?  I mean, every time I plan a fancy dinner party, I???m always sure to set out the Dick Sporks and Semen Ladles.   Or perhaps you are referencing such pieces as the ???Trey [sic?] for Schnapps,??? which is featured proudly on your website.  While the tray???s penis-shaped handle is quite impressive, I find the entire piece a bit clich??d.  I mean, Schnapps and cocks?  Come on, Iceland, that was so last weekend.The real reason for my letter, however, is to ask the most obvious question: where all the vulvas at?  For a country with one of the smallest gender gaps, something seems suspect. Where???s the bronze cast of Susan B. Anthony???s vagina, which doubles as a ballot box? Where???s the giant Vagina Maze for children, which incorporates a really awesome slide and a mediocre ball pit (Look, Mom, I???m balls deep!)?  And where in the hell",100
492," is the Megan Trainor song about body image issues?  I understand the logistics of obtaining vaginal specimens is a bit more extensive than lopping off a dick, but amazing things are being done with rubber and silicone.  For $29.95, you can purchase Clone-a-Pussy, which will mold to the shape of vaginas big and small (as seen on Jersey Shore, another global authority on dicks and dickheads).  I can personally attest to the accuracy of these molds.  A few weeks before Christmas, my friends and I made a drunken pact to exchange molds of our vaginas in lieu of presents.  Not only did I mold my vagina for my friends, but I had the genius idea to cast ceramic bowls from that mold.  Well, Christmas came, and my ???friends??? just gave me a bunch of bullshit presents like Amazon gift cards and chocolates and shit.  No rubber vaginas to be had, which made me feel all self-conscious, so I had to pretend like I didn???t get them anything for the holiday.  I probably seemed like an asshole, but sometimes you???ve just got to say, ???Aw, man, I totally forgot it was Christmas,??? instead of saying ???Aw, man, I got you this awesome bowl in the shape of my inverted vagina so you can feel awkward while eating hummus.  Get the extra garlic kind.  It???ll be just like real life.???  My disappointing Christmas experience aside, these vagina molds could be just what your museum needs to close the blatant gender disparity.  You could display molds from hundreds of mammals???rats and jaguars and giraffes.  You could make a riveting documentary about molding a jaguar???s vagina.  Maybe one of your cameramen will die tragically during the jaguar???s struggle.  Maybe this tragic death will make for great cinema.  Maybe you???ll win an award at Sundance, and countless visitors will flock to your museum.  The opportunities are endless.  The way I see it, you???re only achieving half of your genital potential.  Think outside the box.  Or, in this case, think inside the banana box.If a room filled with silicone vaginas seems too much for your phallological tastes, at least consider allowing women a Breast and Teat Wing.  Think of the possibilities there. The mammoth milk gland of a sperm whale.  The little nubbins of Capuchin monkeys. A Conduct-Your-Own-Mammogram Exhibit. And there???s commercial potential, as well.  Chocolate milk.   Rocky Road ice cream.  Cappuccinos served in dick-shaped glasses.  You can even create your own lingo like any quality, modern-day coffee house.  I???ll take a double-shot Ron Jeremy Latte with extra Bukkake.  It???s just like ordering a drink at Starbucks: I???m not sure exactly what it means, but it sounds delicious.While I???m hopeful that you will incorporate more female-inspired exhibits in your penis museum, I also have a premonition that you will continue to ignore society???s better half.  I can already imagine how my proposed Breast and Teat Wing will progress with your board of trustees.  After a ???budget evaluation,??? the Breast and Teat Wing will be renamed the Breast Wing, which will be renamed Hooters, which will offer ???Women???s Wednesday: All You Can Eat Roast Beef! (Men Eat Free!).??? At the very least, please serve the beef in those fancy vagina bowls I made for my lame friends.  That way, every bloated customer will be forced to navigate labial folds and clitoral hoods whilst cutting through the medium-rare delights.  And when they sop up the bloody remains of beef, their buttery rolls will reveal the ceramic wink of my whispering eye. Come on, Iceland.  It???s the least you can do for women???s lib.Sincerely,Eliese Goldbach???Taking a sensual bath together can really spice things up for your and your man.

In a rare moment of mental clarity, I decided to slaughter two bald eagles with one stoned idea: I would sign myself into the loony bin and cool out for a while, at the same time avoiding the military meat grinder ??? insanity (at least of the kind I was manifesting) being kryptonite to a smoothly functioning, well-oiled killing machine.??????The seventh and eighth floors of the Klingenstein Pavilion of Mount Sinai Hospital were dedicated psych wards. I was assigned to 8 North, sharing a room with three other looney tunes. When the wackos weren???t in group or individual therapy, they enjoyed the freedom to wander the halls just like in Shock Corridor. Early on in my confinement, while strolling the Boulevard of Broken Minds trying to detect who killed Sloane in the kitchen, I happened upon Danny, from 8 South. Acid flashbacks, amphetamine-generated hallucinations, and nonspecific heebie-jeebies had landed him in the House of Bedlam. He was a landsmann. When he found out that I had no friends in town ??? they were on the outside, upstate, wearing their 24/7 ?? 365 party hats of the apocalypse ??? he invited me to join him, with his, during visiting hours.That evening I jaunty-jollied over to the 8 South commons where Danny was holding court, surrounded by friends. He saw me, smiled, and waved me over. Just as he was about to introduce me, the chick sitting closest to him, the one holding his hand, gazed up at me, locked in on me. I became trapped in her tractor-beam stare.Einstein said, When a man sits with a pretty girl for an hour, it seems like a minute. But let him sit on a hot stove for a minute, and it???s longer than any hour. I was staring at a pretty girl ??? more accurately a pretty girl was staring at me ??? but it felt more like I was sitting on a hot stove. I couldn???t tell you how much time passed, only that it felt like forever, like when you???re in a car, going too fast, and you???ve lost control: you know what???s going to happen, you know it???s not going to end well, but the universe slows to a crawl. Maybe it???s a survival mechanism, some evolutionary obverse to fight or flight ??? time dilating in order to provide a few extra milliseconds in which you may reflexively react and avert, therefore survive, the catastrophe you???re hurtling toward. But it???s likely there are no more than a handful of athletes and ninjas evolved enough to take advantage of this illusion. For the rest of us it just delays the inevitable moment of impact.She wouldn???t stop looking at me. I was getting more uptight, more confused by the second. What had I done to deserve this? What had I done wrong? Should I just turn and split, or should I try to weather the storm? Just as I was initializing the cut-and-run, she popped out of her chair ??? she was tall, statuesque even, a Greek goddess in a crocheted dress ??? and rushed me.Good old time dilation afforded me an endless moment to ponder the question ??? what the fuck was going on? Then she was upon me, wrapping her arms around me, hugging me, calling me by my name, asking me if I recognized her, which I didn???t. Danny was looking at me with a combination of surprise and anger, the rest of his tribe merely surprised, mostly amused.I was beginning to swoon. This shit was getting spooky. And she was unrelenting. I???m Fern. Don???t you remember? You lived on Suffolk Street, I lived around the corner on Grand. We used to play together, all the time.??????According to the paper of record, the Oxford English Dictionary???s earliest citation for backstory is from an AP dispatch by Jerry Buck in 1982 about the screenwriters Stephen and Elinor Karpf: They had been compiling characters and back stories for a prospective serial for several years. The OED notes that the term???s early specific meaning was a history created for a fictional character or situation, especially in a film or television series.At that moment I felt like I was one of those fictional characters, trapped in a Melodrama in Mount Sinai, in which I was either an amnesia victim or someone being gaslighted.9  I was hoping an omniscient narrator, having compiled my character???s backstory, would reveal it to me in some combo of flashback or voiceover ??? two of the symptoms that had landed me in this disorienting here and now ??? which would enable me to make sense of the Twilight Zone scene in which I found myself entangled.??????Boy Gets Girl, kicked off by the Cute Meet: When I was six, I was the junior skelly champeen of Suffolk Street. All you needed to play was chalk and some weighted bottle caps, the latter of which could not be bought in a sporting goods shop. They had to be made. Lighting up one of the womb???s Sabbath candles and letting the wax drip into the cap until it was full did the trick.But not any bottle cap would do. Competition-worthy caps had to have a flat bottom so that they could skim smoothly across the concrete. Since there was no such thing as a factory-fresh cap, all caps by definition having suffered violent trauma in the maw of a bottle opener, the arming of the skelly hero necessitated scouring the nabe to find suitable ones.One sunny afternoon, while on a bottle cap odyssey, I walked into a bodega on Clinton, south of Delancey, bee-lined to the cooler, stuck my hand down the built-in cap collector, and started fishing for caps.A girl, about my age, buying a Ring Ding, wandered over, asked, What ya doing?Finding caps. ",100
494,"For skelly.What???s skelly?I could hardly believe my ears. Where did this girl come from, Mars? But she seemed nice, and so instead of giving mean, I decided to answer her straight up. But before I could, the bodega-keeper chased me from the store.Come back when you want to buy something, he told me as he pushed me out the door.As I was slinking down the street, the girl came running.Wait up, she called.I turned. She had her Ring Ding in one hand, the other balled up in a fist.  She smiled, her mouth chocolaty and crumby, and unclenched the fist. It was filled with bottle caps. Then she pointed to one of her pockets. It was bulging with bottle caps as well. That???s how I first met Fern.From that first day on we were pretty much inseparable.??????Boy Loses Girl: One afternoon, instead of going to the Loews Delancey to see Martin and Lewis in At War with the Army, Fern and I spent our movie money on two sheets of colorful cockamamies ??? bright, beautiful, strange temporary tattoos.Since I was a latchkey kid, we went to my place to play. Water being the agent of transference enabling a cockamamie to migrate from paper to skin, it quickly became clear that this game was going to be messy and wet. Being extra-smart six-year-olds, we determined it would be best to head to the bathroom (an H2O appropriate zone), take off our clothes, get in the bathtub, turn on the water, and responsibly apply cockamamies all over each other.We were having such a good time that before long we had evolved into a singular, giggling organism ??? in latency, and yet in love ??? expertly adorning each other with temporary tattoos.After a while we had just about run out of space on our small bodies; in fact, the last virginal spots on our epidermises were around our genitals. Fern applied a roaring lion on the smooth skin right above mine; I was in the midst of applying a parrot above hers when the bathroom door opened and my mother walked in. Between the giggling and the running water, because we had been enjoying ourselves so much, we hadn???t heard the apartment door open, or even the bathroom door for that matter.My mother walked in smiling at first, reflexively, maternally; it warms the heart to hear children happily at play.Then she looked more closely, saw my hand near Fern???s I had no name for it then, and let out a bone-breaking, bloodcurdling, Fay-Wray-meets-King-Kong scream. Fern and I stopped giggling. We went quiet and still, the only sound to be heard was the bathtub???s running faucet.Mommy, what???s the matter, why did you scream that way? My hand was still right by Fern???s I had no name for it then; my mother was staring at me, anger boiling out of her eyes.Suddenly, I just knew. Mom???s anger had to do with the cockamamies, with Fern and me naked, playing with our privates. I flushed with shame. I quickly pulled my hand away, revealing the colorful parrot perched atop her I had no name for it then.We both got dressed, so ashamed we couldn???t look at each other.You have to leave, now, and don???t you ever come back, my mother hissed. Fern shrank away in horror. And don???t think I???m not going to call your mother and tell her what a naughty thing you???ve done.We were both crying.Mommy, don???t do that. Please, Mommy, don???t make her go. We didn???t mean to do anything wrong.She slapped me, hard. Stop with your cockamamie stories, Rob-it. I???m no fool. I see what was going on.Even though I was overwhelmed with fear and shame, bawling like a baby, this unconscious play on words struck me as quite funny. I started giggling through my tears. My mother didn???t get the joke. She assumed I was laughing at her, which, in a way, I suppose I was. She lost it, started slapping the crap out of me. I was covering up, screaming, crying, laughing, all at the same time.While my mother beat me, Fern beat it from my house, slamming the door behind her. I could hear her footsteps as she raced down the stairs and out my front door, could hear it slam shut behind her.??????Self-Pity is a siren luring you toward the jagged rocks with her sweet song, the chorus of which is It???s not your fault. The gist of her ditty is that you did nothing wrong. It was them, your parents, your teachers, your playmates ??? they???re the ones who were wrong, they???re the ones who damned you to this hellscape you now find yourself in; you have no reason, no cause to examine yourself; all you need do is be stoned fucking angry at them.??????My Friend the Cartoonist???s shrink brilliantly distilled the essence of what it is to be fucked up, explaining to him: neurosis is a solution that???s become a problem. My soaked-in-self-pity solution from that moment on was alienation, withdrawal, rebellion, and, finally, most importantly, drugs, all kinds of drugs: combustibles ??? reefer, hash, opium, gate-waying me to psychedelics ??? acid, mescaline, psilocybin DMT; then on to speed10  starting with pharmaceutical goof balls like Dexamil and Eskatrol (mother???s little helpers), then moving up in class to benzedrine, desoxyn, and black beauties, before finally finishing with an endless line of crystal meth; when times got tough and the supply lines got interrupted, the fallback was over-the-counter remedies for damaged souls ??? the dextromethorphan twins, Robitussin and Romilar; and for a change of pace there was always the booze cruise, slugging down Ripple and Night Train, Wolfschmidts and fruit-flavored sugar-added brandies; but in the end, as all things must end, it was skag, a tsunami of skag washing in from the Golden Triangle, an unintended consequence of the lunatic war in the Nam.This solution of mine worked really well, until it didn???t anymore; it then became a problem.Which brings this backstory up to speed (so to speak) and?????????Back to the bin for the big reveal, where Boy (sort of) Gets Girl Back: By now Fern held me in a breathtaking bear hug, detailing our shared past, a past I had no memory of, because I had purposefully, and over a long period, inhaled of the incense of forgetfuless.11Finally, in frustration, she practically screamed, The cockamamies???And that???s when it all came rushing back, that whole sad Adam-and-Eve moment: expelled from the garden, wandering the wilderness, settling into the fifth circle of hell (wrath and sullenness), before finally arriving at this ridiculously synchronous, utterly unbelievable moment.How???d you recognize me?You haven???t changed.You sure have.Do you recognize me now?I was having a hard time finding the convergence point between the image in my head of the naked, giggling six-year-old Fern, my hand on her pussy (I had a name for it by then), and the voluptuous, lubricious, all-grown-up Fern standing before me. The thought of my hand on that pussy threatened to turn my swoon into an all-out syncope.This time I consciously retreated into my Fortress of Time Dilation, tried to process it all without distortion. This chick wasn???t pissed at me, that much was clear. In fact, she seemed genuinely happy to see me. Once that was settled, my life passed before my eyes in two versions, what was and what could have been, the mirror image of Jimmy Stewart???s angel-aided vision in It???s a Wonderful Life. Only in my version, what was sucked big time; I was in the bin because I couldn???t cope with normal everyday shit. It???s what could have been that would have been the wonderful life. A profound sadness shrouded me like a hairshirt. I wanted to ball my body up into a fetus and be reborn. Absent that, I wanted to cry till I died. But I couldn???t do that either. My reptile mind took over and told me I had to maintain. So I wuz cool.Yeah. Yeah. It???s great ",100
495,"to see you.- - -1 Wavy Gravy shared a surname with the Mormon presidential hopeful of the car elevator and the binders full of women. He founded the Hog Farm Collective which built trails and fire pits and manned the free kitchen at Woodstock. And it was in Woodstock that Mr. Gravy is credited with giving the warning Do not take the brown acid. The brown acid is bad. And even though the Gravy man might defend himself as the Dadaist (Tristan Tzara?) once did (in my memory, at least, if not in fact), and I paraphrase, my words are not those of a peace treaty, they cannot be held against me, the need for any such defense is moot since that attribution simply ain???t how it went down. The real credit for the brown acid warning belongs to the slyly monickered Chip Monck, who made this announcement from the podium: To get back to the warning that I received. You may take it with however many grains of salt that you wish. That the brown acid that is circulating around us isn???t too good. It is suggested that you stay away from that. Of course it???s your own trip. So be my guest, but please be advised that there is a warning on that one, ok? But Senor Wavy???s way with an epigram is not up for debate. His Waiting for Godot-ish observation of the human condition, we???re all bozos on the bus/so might as well sit back/and enjoy the ride is perhaps his most profound, and will certainly gain him entry into the antechamber of the Bartlett???s Hall of Quotable Fame.2 Margalit Fox (whom My Friend the Film Critic rightly considers to be an artist of the obit), pointed out in her March 14, 2011 necrology that Owsley was so widely known [that] he appears in the Encyclopedia Britannica article on LSD under the apparently unironic index term ???Augustus Owsley Stanley III (American chemist),??? [and that] The Oxford English Dictionary contains an entry for the noun ???Owsley??? as???an extremely potent, high-quality type of LSD.??? Owsley was the psychedelic, autodidactic polymath, black sheep scion of a Kentucky political family (his gramps was first a congressman, then the governor of, and finally a senator from the Bluegrass State). Owsley began underground life as a sound engineer for the Grateful Dead nicknamed Bear but after LSD became a proscribed substance he found his calling as a self-taught chemist. His remarkably pure product, which rivaled pharmaceutical grade Sandoz shit, fueled the fabled Electric Kool Aid Acid Fests thrown by Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters. His various batches were so beloved they even had names ??? Blue Cheer, White Lightning, Purple Monterey (sometimes mistakenly referred to as Purple Haze which pissed Owsley off since he never wanted his product associated with anything other than crystal clarity). He moved to Australia in the 1980s, so he might survive what he believed to be a coming Ice Age that would annihilate the Northern Hemisphere (the underlying high concept that Roland Emerrich used in The Day After Tommorow to refine his evolving cinematic representations of the destruction of both LA and NYC). He died in an auto accident in 2011.3 He recruited William F. Buckley Jr. for the secret society.4 In 1960 while Ike was still the Prez and Khruschev had already threatened to bury us, had already debated modern kitchen design with Tricky Dick during his veep incarnation, but before he banged his shoe on the desk at the General Assembly in a fit of pique, the Commies shot down a U-2 spy plane piloted by Frances Gary Powers (a CIA pilot) as it flew over Soviet territory. The Bolshies went all Captain Renault on it and claimed that they were shocked, shocked to find out that there was spying going on. They luxuriated in the moral authority of it all, putting Powers on trial, and convicting him. Two years later they released him in a prisoner exchange for Rudolf Abel, a Brit-born spy convicted in the US of A in what was known as the Hollow Nickel Case because he passed his purloined microfiche to his handlers inside reamed-out coins.5 The night after the Rev. King was killed, while parts of New York and Chicago still burned, I braved the mean streets and bopped over to the Felt Forum, where I joined 5,000 fellow pucknuts to watch the Rangers, winners of the first two games of the series, lose to the Blackhawks, who would then go on to win three more games in a row; and even though my long-suffering fanship should have inured me to yet another lost season, the Blueshirts??? elimination, sad to say, left me much more bereft than the murder of MLK Jr.6 The night that President Droopy threw in the towel I was having dinner with Fern (of whom much more a little further on) in a Mexican restaurant on Greenwich Street (I think) with a name starting with El but not El Parador, which was pricey and on east 34th. When we stepped out of the place having finished off our combo plates and obligatory flan, we were swept up in a ecstatic mob working its way east, to St. Marks I suppose, their hive mind working overtime, processing Droopy???s speech and mistakenly thinking we had won, that the war would be over before morning, and that all that dope-y protesting actually amounted to more than a hill of beans in our crazy world. How very fucking wrong they were.7 See ???A Night in Berkeley.???8 On February 24, 1972, two weeks before the New Hampshire primary, the Manchester Union Leader published a letter purportedly written by Muskie of Maine that revealed him to have an animus against Americans of French-Canadian descent whom he referred to by the pejorative Canucks. Muskie felt honor- bound to defend himself. Big mistake. He made a speech in front of the newspaper???s offices, which from that day on became known simply as ???the crying speech,??? because the man blubbered like a baby. Since Amurrica cannot abide a commander in chief who???s a crybaby, Muskie???s candidacy crashed and burned. This worked out really well for Gollum, since Muskie was thought by many to pose the greatest threat to his second term. It therefore came as no surprise when the FBI revealed that the Canuck Letter was part of the dirty tricks campaign against Democrats orchestrated by CREEP, the perfectly acronym-ed Committee to Re-Elect the President, none other than that dick Nixon his own damn self.9 Gaslight gained a new definition because of the 1944 film in which Charles Boyer tries to drive his wife insane, his wife played by Ingrid Bergman, who earlier famously played Ilsa Lund to Bogey???s Rick in Casablanca, and who in 1950, after a decade of stardom in American films, went to Italy and starred in Stromboli, which led to a love affair with her director, Roberto Rossellini, while they were both married to others. The affair and then marriage to Rossellini created a shonda in the US that forced her to remain in Europe until 1956, when she made her successful Hollywood return in Anastasia. The Urban Dictionary offers this definition of gaslight ??? an increasing frequency of systematically withholding factual information from, and/or providing false information to, the victim ??? having the gradual effect of making them anxious, confused, and less able to trust their own memory and perception._10 Amphetamine was first synthesized in 1887. In 1932 Smith Kline & French, a patent medicine outfit looking to branch out into serious pharmacology, marketed a water-soluble version of amphetamine that they called Benzedrine. They sold it in inhaler form, promoting it as a bronchial dilator. Each inhaler contained 325 milligrams of speed. As soon as they removed the Do Not Overdose warning on the label the product took off. One of the more popular ways people used it to dilate their bronch",100
496,"ia was breaking the inhaler open, taking out the medicated strip, and dunking it into their morning cup of Joe. That???s how Charlie Parker took the A train. In WW II amphetamine was drafted by both the Allied and the Axis powers. They provided their soldiers with speed in order to make them more alert and more aggressive. (It was as much Benzedrine as bushido that sent those kamikaze pilots suiciding into our warships.) Hitler led by example ??? Der F??hrer was a speed freak; his personal physician shot him up with the shit several times daily. Albert Speer blamed speed for the loopy decision-making that enabled Hitler to snatch defeat out of the jaws of victory. If Speer is to be believed, and Hitler???s meth-tardation derailed the Final Solution then we must seriously consider adding speed to the good-for-the-Jews column of the ledger.11 See footnote 8 in ???Chance is the Fool???s Name for Fate Part 1: Of All the Gin Joints??????Your honor, this arson case may look open-and-shut to some people, but the jury requests another day to mull over the evidence and reexamine witness testimonies. And before you ask, this isn???t just because Paul McCartney happens to be a member of the jury and we want another day to hear more stories about the Beatles and find out what it???s like to be a living legend. The first few time extensions may have been about that, but not this one.I???ll admit that when I first found out Paul was on the jury with me, I forgot entirely about my obligations as a juror. Here was the man who caused girls all over the world to faint and guys all over the world to catch fainting girls. For me, arson took a backseat while Sir Paul drove me down Penny Lane, and, baby, could he drive my car! But now I???m all about getting down to business and making sure we figure out how that smoke detector factory burned down without a single warning.We just need an extra day to work out whether the defendant???s alibi holds water, or if we can say ???Hey Jude, go to jail!??? Sorry about that. You hang out with a Beatle for as long as I have, and the references are just here, there and everywhere. Crazy coincidence how the defendant is named Jude, too, huh? Regardless, Paul, like the rest of the jurors, is a complete professional and is handling this case with the utmost seriousness. He wants justice served. Did you know that at the ceremony where he was knighted they served the greatest quiche he???s ever had? It???s true, and hopefully so is the prosecution???s key witness??? remembrance of the events on the night of the arson.If the court is worried about having to pay each of us another $40 for our day???s work, we all agreed that we???re fine waiving the cost. You can???t put a price on making things right. Just ask Paul about his $48.6 million divorce settlement! Ha-ha! I can joke about that because Paul and I are now jury pals, but I wouldn???t repeat that around him if I were you. He???s got a temper and as a Beatle he can basically do whatever he wants. Like just walk on to a criminal jury when he isn???t even an American citizen, but you and your freshly autographed gavel know all about that.All we???re asking for is one more day. I know I shouldn???t tell you this, but we were only one vote away from a unanimous decision during our last deliberation. We were all disheartened to get so very close, but Paul stood up and announced, ???We can work it out,??? which made us all smile because it was a Beatles song but it also made sense in the context of our situation. We all then shared our favorite Beatles song and Paul let us know if we were right or wrong, like a model juror.So, what do you say, your honor? Don???t be a Yoko.Q: Is your job title ???helicopter news reporter???? A: I???ve had this question with my boss many times and he said he has no clue. After some sleuthing on LinkedIn I discovered ???photog??? is used the most and ???videographer??? is frowned upon.Q: Why is it frowned upon?A: Lots of people think it???s cheesy and it makes you sound like you???re about to film a wedding.Q: When you were growing up, could you imagine that you???d be doing this job?A: Nope. The weird thing is, when I was a kid in elementary school and junior high, I had a recurring dream that I was in a helicopter that crashed in water and people were trying to rescue me.Q: That doesn???t seem good. Do you remember your first day on the job?A: I hate to tell people this??? the very first thing I went up to film was a helicopter crash.Q: Oh man. Were the people OK?A: Both the pilot and the instructor were totally fine but the helicopter was lying on its side.Q: Did you know how to work a camera before you took this job? A: No, so I was really excited to learn! Doing aerial photography is totally different. The camera shakes a lot and the helicopter will be tilted to the left or the right???Q: Had you been in a helicopter before?A: No. It???s interesting because in an airplane the nose points up when it???s taking off, but in the helicopter, the butt portion goes up first so you???re looking down at the ground. It???s weird at first. My boyfriend refuses to go with me.Q: Could he go with you if he wanted? A: Maybe if I snuck him in with me.Q: Do you have to physically carry a camera?A: No, that would be super stressful. Basically I have a laptop on my lap???it???s like an Etch-a-Sketch???and I turn the dials to control the camera that???s on the nose of the helicopter. I have on a headset and I talk to the people in the newsroom. The newsroom will tell me to just talk about what I see.Q: What kind of things have you filmed?A: One time a family of geese shut down 80/94. They were waddling down the road and I-DOT was following them till they left the highway. Another time a coyote was running around on Lake Michigan when it was frozen.Q: How long do you film something like that until you realize you???ve filmed enough? A: The newsroom decides. Eventually the coyote went into a drainage hole.Q: What?A: He was fine. He basically just went in there to hide.Q: I assume more often you???re filming crime-type things?A: Yes. I???m looking at gunshot wounds, train accidents, fingers and arms sprayed about.When I???m done for the day I decide I???m just going to watch cat videos.Q: Is that what you have to do to de-stress?A: Yes. I don???t ever want to be desensitized by what I???m seeing so I???ll focus on the lighting or how I???m going to frame a shot. Then afterwards, I???ll make a point of thinking about it because I don???t want it creeping up on me.Q: Have you seen car chases? A: No. I so wish we did! That???s only in L.A.Q: What???s a normal day like?A: My shift is 1:30 to 10:30-ish and I???m on call from the airport. I do disasters, fires, people getting hit by cars.I pretty much just hang out at the hangar waiting for them to call me. Today we flew like four hours already.Q: What happened today?A: Let???s see??? a school bus crashed into an apartment, there was a fire in a factory, and there was a shooting on Eisenhower, which is a major highway around here.Q: So basically you???re not sure how much work you???ll do on any given day?A: Right. There were two weeks where we didn???t fly at all. And then there are times when I basically live in the helicopter.Q: What do you do with the downtime? A: I always think of what my mother said???that only boring people are bored. I???ve learned how to make a lamp, how to build my own table???Q: Have you ever gotten airsick? A: Only once. It was a really high-wind day. We had gone to the restaurant next-door to watch the Blackhawks game and we had nachos. It was winter and my pilot is one of these guys who wear shorts year-round???Q:",100
497," Does he also have a ponytail?A: No, that would be great though!Anyway, he was blasting the heat. At the time I had a broken foot with a plastic bag over it to keep the snow out. We can???t use salt on the taxiway otherwise the planes will rust??? just thought you might want to know that random fact.Anyway I took off the bag and lifted it off my foot, and then I puked into the bag. But I forgot to turn the microphone off and everyone at the news desk heard me puking.Q: Do you get recognized on the street? Do people know you as the helicopter reporter?A: No. When I first started they didn???t have the camera installed inside the helicopter so I only spoke while over the incident. They have it installed now, but I think the station forgot about that because they never use it. So??? no.Q: You seem like you enjoy this job. A: I absolutely love it. There???s a lot of freedom to it.Q: Do you have a jacket that says CHOPPER 2? A: I wish!Wear a funky hat while you???re not having sex. It will make you feel carefree and sexy.Read only the preface of the Kama Sutra. It???s a historical text and will enrich your life experiences in countless ways.Chew on some mint leaves before you don???t have sex. This will make your mouth feel refreshed and clean for all the cool air you???ll be breathing in.Try talking dirty to the sad, sad face in the mirror. Dirty talk is exciting and surprising and it echoes in the empty spaces.Rub an ice cube on your nipples before you go to bed alone. Let the melting ice form a big wet spot under you.Use a fake name while you???re fantasizing about receiving the touch of another human. Who???s that exciting flirt? It???s you!Make a game of trying to score points by successfully throwing your un-needed birth control pills through a small hoop. Reward yourself with one jumbo marshmallow every time you make it in.Every time you get aroused and do not have intercourse, put a dollar in a jar. Soon you???ll be able to go to the movies alone for free!Dear Mr. Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi al-Husseini al-Qurashi,It is with a heavy heart that I must resign from the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. I have enjoyed re-establishing Sharia law in pretty much all of Mesopotamia, but I wish to begin my one true jihad: learning improvisational comedy at the Upright Citizens Brigade.I understand this might come as something of a shock, though you should have noticed the completely acceptable, non-sexualized pictures of Matt Walsh taped to the walls of my lean-to.My time with ISIS has only strengthened my belief that I will find happiness by making ???active choices??? on slightly elevated stages in the East Village and Chelsea. Just last week, after I ridiculed a Kurdish prisoner???s acne, you said, ???Youssef, that was a sick burn. You are very quick on your feet. Praise is to God, The Most Exalted.??? While I agree that much of the praise is to God, The Most Exalted, some praise should fall squarely on my SNL-ready shoulders.I knew I had discovered my life???s purpose when my improv team, ASSSDROMEDARY 3000, was voted Best Newcomer at this year???s Intifa-Ha-Ha Comedy Showcase. I???m sure you remember the Anderson Cooper kidnapping scene. The biggest laughs came when I recorded the ransom video with my imagined iPhone in landscape instead of portrait???thereby revealing the location of our secret hideout! Now that???s what I call ???heightening!??? It was gold, Abu Bakr, gold!You???re probably asking yourself: ???Why doesn???t Youssef try sketch writing instead???? Look, watching an actor perform something you wrote is cool, I guess, but does it compare to the rush of pretending to be a pirate or a toothbrush or a Home Depot cashier in front of dozens of people on a semi-regular basis? I doubt it.If you???re worried about my future, don???t be. Everyone from Amy Poehler to Paul Scheer has used the totally secular altar of Del Close as a launching pad for their careers. You should also know that my success as an improviser will only further our mission. Do you have any idea how easy it is to demonize the West once you???ve established your ???game???? When I???m not lampooning their culture with scathing long-form ???Harold,??? I will wound them using my other devastating tactics. I will stand uncomfortably close to the infidels in their elevators. I will lecture many strangers about income inequality. I will eat Thai food in subway cars without air conditioning. I will manspread.You have been an incredible mentor and I have no doubt that you will be happy for me. That???s why you???re invited to my Improv 101 graduation show at the UCB East Theater on August 12th! Doors are at 6:00, but you never know how many of my 83 Twitter followers will show up, so try to get there by 5:45. Thanks in advance for allowing me to kill on stage and not taking matters into your own hands.Cheers,YoussefP.S. Tell Fuad that I???m changing my Hulu Plus password. If he wants to keep watching Season 2 of The Mindy Project, he can call and apologize for his hurtful heckles like the honorable weapons dealer he claims to be.P.P.S. Until I find paid work in New York, it would be so dope of you to let me run the ISIS Vine account remotely.1. You???ve just arrived in an Organic Universe and everything is the same.

As you can see, I am extremely pregnant. I drove all the way here to visit your pregnant-lady clothing store because normal-people clothes just don???t seem to fit anymore. It was rush hour in very warm weather, and I had to stop at two gas stations to pee. But I???m here now, thank goodness.There???s just one thing I want to know: Do you happen to have any clothes with horizontal stripes? You do? Everything comes in horizontal stripes, and there are absolutely no other options? Well, this must be my lucky day! You may have noticed that my waist circumference is quite substantial, and I cannot think of any pattern that would be more perfectly suited for my Weeble-shaped body than horizontal stripes. I have recently become concerned that strangers might not immediately realize that I am the world???s largest pregnant person, and I am convinced the be",100
498,"st way of drawing attention to my size would be wearing a multitude of brightly colored circles around my belly. Do any of your stripes also happen to have tape-measure markings on them? No? OK, what about a cute pair of sandals that double as scales and display your current weight? Hmm, that???s too bad. Well, feel free to pass the idea on to your corporate office. Talk about a moneymaker.Before you return to the register, could I ask you about fabric? Since the start of my pregnancy, sweating has become my number one thing to do. I sweat when I wake up, I sweat when I take a shower, I sweat when I ride the elevator to my office. The nice thing about sweating is you can do it just about anywhere. It???s my favorite hobby. Naturally, it???s important that my new wardrobe accommodate maximum sweating. What???s that you say? You only stock synthetic fabrics derived from melted down tires and old VCRs? Huzzah! Mark my words ??? the people on the www.ilovesweating.com message boards will be sooooo jealous when I post about this.Just one more question, if you have the time: I???m very concerned that the clothes in your store might not be designed with the needs of a pregnant person in mind. Ideally, I???d like to buy something made with seven times more fabric than it would take to cover a sofa. Just to be safe, it should puddle around my feet like a Christmas tree skirt, in case the baby is born suddenly while I am at work and I need to conceal him from my coworkers. I am fairly certain we???re not supposed to bring babies to work. Do you have anything like that? You do? Everything you sell is like that? My goodness, this is a fabulous store. And I???m thrilled to see that 95 percent of the items in your store are held up with spaghetti straps! This is serendipitous, because I was looking for a way to show off the hefty grandma bras I???ve been wearing recently.That reminds me, I see you have an entire wall devoted to nursing bras ??? and I also see that none of them offer any kind of support whatsoever. Why, these ???sleeping bras??? appear to just be little T-shirt hats for boobs! How fabulous. Approximately 200 percent of my weight gain this pregnancy has been in my chest region, so I???m sure these will be perfect. My original plan was to simply draw a bra on my body with a Sharpie marker and call it a day, but these options will save time ??? time I could spend sweating ??? and will be just as effective. This store is truly magical. It???s like Disneyland, but with a higher spandex ratio.Now, there???s just the small matter of payment. I expect to wear these clothes for no more than six months and then never again, so I hope they cost about the same as a used Dodge Charger. What???s that you say? They cost even more? It???s official; I may never leave this place. Thank you so much, helpful sales associate. I think you???ve answered all my questions.Do you have a restroom I can use?If time is nothing but a measurement that we constructed to better grasp ephemeral, days, months and years ??? then why does Taco Bell???s breakfast have to end at 11 am? And why did the cashier roll his eyes at me?- -If I drift off into a chasm of weightlessness and lack of thought and feeling when I sleep, how did I wake up covered in Fritos? And why is my Uber receipt so expensive? And who am I next to?- -If I am in control of my own decisions and ultimately my destiny, why did I just re-watch Parks and Recreation for the like fourth time?- - If life is meaningless, a shadow of a fleeting dream, then why do I get all these letters littered with vague threats about paying back my student loans? It doesn???t matter guys!!- - If our personalities are inauthentic because we are byproducts of our environment, then your Instagram feed of lobster rolls and sailing photos is a crock of shit. YOU DON???T EVEN OWN A BOAT, CINDY.- - At what point does death occur ??? and when it does, can you please not turn my Facebook wall into a memorial littered with shallow, grammatically incorrect memories? I didn???t like you in high school, I sure as hell don???t like you now.- - If to live is to suffer, and surviving is to find meaning in the suffering, does this explain why I have to spend precious time and money at work happy hours?- -Where does our conscience and morality come from ??? a higher power or the evolution of modern society and its ceaseless demands? And when can I tell Cindy that she really needs to lose some weight? It???s hilarious, but embarrassing to be seen with her.- - If love is but a chemical illusion that indoctrinates us to pass down our genes ??? our only glimpse at a semblance of immortality ??? why haven???t I gotten laid in a month? Every damn time I swipe right it???s a Tinder match.- -If there are no facts, only interpretations of the truth, then I deserve a purse puppy. Yes, Mom, I can handle taking care of it. And no, I???m not seeing anyone.- - If hope is the worst of all evils because it prolongs the torments of men, do I really have to go to my ten year reunion? That open bar will be the absence of hope.- - If we all are born and die alone in the universe, and you dumped me, why are you still liking my Instagrams? It???s not even sadistic at this point, just annoying.- -If the future influences the present as much as the past, then this boob job should pay for itself pretty quickly????- - If the devil is nothing but a fallen angel, then what do Victoria???s Secret models do after retirement?- - If consumerism thrives on emotional voids, then I must be empty inside because I look fucking fabulous.Haste Makes Waist???nope, that???s not an unintentional misspelling of ???waste???; it???s the slogan for my new diet pills, Haste, that will shed two to three inches of belly fat and help you ???make waist,??? as we like to say. Though they???re not yet approved by the FDA, they???re made with the finest Colombian chemicals and are ???100% safe.???1 Don???t waste any more time; let Haste Make Waist today!2- -1  Side effects of Haste include nausea, upset stomach, constipation, diarrhea, headaches, anxiety, insomnia, drowsiness, dizziness, nervousness, not being nervous enough, heart palpitations, loss of appetite or increase in appetite, weight changes, no weight change whatsoever no matter what you eat or don???t eat, cold symptoms (stuffy nose, sneezing, sore throat), fever symptoms, seemingly no symptoms but actually having a cold, dry mouth, wet mouth, decreased sex drive, impotence, difficulty having an orgasm, horniness, constant erections, or spontaneous orgasms.2 Delivery in approximately 6-8 months.Hello, Aunt Patty.We are Anonymous.Over the years, we have been watching you: the flurry of forwarded e-mails you send to all your contacts, your googling of long ago high school crushes, your unfair Yelp reviews; all of these things have caught our eye. With your constant barrage of Facebook posts, status updates, and likes now reaching unfathomable levels, the extent of your online behavior has been made clear to us. Anonymous has therefore decided that your Facebook profile should be stopped. For the good of your nieces, nephews, and mankind, we shall proceed to expel you from Facebook, and systematically dismantle your Internet presence.We recognize you, Patty, as a serious opponent. Do not expect our campaign to be completed in a short time frame. Your constant and untimely usage of emojis, your love for sharing quotes accompanied by pictures of Minions, and your paragraph-long run-on sentence complaints to the Delta Airlines Facebook page will be a challenge to fully eradicate.The intention of Anonymous is to protect information from the control of any individual",100

We do this not only for ourselves. We???re doing this for family members who want to stay informed about your life, without being harassed by ???Aunt Patty likes this??? on every single one of their pictures just mere seconds after they accepted your friend request. Anonymous is campaigning at this very moment for freedom of information exchange, freedom of expression, and free use of the Internet. But your vast, round-the-clock onslaught over the web, and the immense pride that you maintain about it, has made us question our entire position.No more liberal usage of the exclamation mark. No more sharing videos of cute animals. No more statuses featuring Buddhist proverbs that we know you don???t follow yourself. No more comments on other people???s posts that have nothing to do with the post itself. We???ve had enough.We are Anonymous, and Aunt Patty ??? you must be stopped.Dear Not-Tired-Looking Mom,In the five minutes it has taken you to locate your sliced fruit and kale chips, your five-year-old has nestled up beside you with a book while your one-year-old has begun fiddling contentedly with her own toes. In these same five minutes, my son, age one and a half, has run directly toward oncoming traffic, wrestled a rake from its perch, tipped over a scooter, upset a hornet, fallen off a step, shed blood, stomped his way through the deepest part of a muddy puddle and lapped up the foul-smelling water like a dog.In five minutes, though it has seemed much longer, you have turned the page of your novel three times while I have twice removed dog feces from my shoe, repeatedly relocated my whirling dervish from a cement precipice, spoken goofily to a piece of trash for my son???s intended benefit, raced to prevent the toppling of a coffee cup, shooed away an irate hornet, and finally lifted the thrashing body of my toddling tornado to stop the continued ingestion of the puddle, the liquid content of which is ??? I???ve figured out by now ??? 100% urine.While you have entertained your daughter???s charming question about why it is that butterflies, which flutter by, are not instead called ???flutter-byes,??? I have decided that this urine was definitely left here by another mother, someone like me, with sons and not daughters. I???ve concluded she committed this wild act of public elimination not because she is a certifiable loon, but because she could not piss in peace in her own home for fear that her son would take scissors to the sofa to ???see what???s inside??? or jump off the top stair to ???see if he could fly.???  The mother who urinated right here on this ground has also, like me, arrived at a stage in life where a belt worn over pajamas seems plenty dressed if it allows her to escort a son out of the house any sooner.Finally, resigning myself to squat stance before the mom pee puddle, I have looked to your stylish footwear unsullied by excrement or blood and wondered what it is like to have thoughts and read pages and recline in the presence of your offspring. I have sought in your unperturbed face some sign of maternal camaraderie, anything to show the mildest recognition of the sweat beading across my nose due to the number of zigzag feet I have traveled, at cartoon speed, in so few minutes. But there are your private thoughts to tend to, and the amazing questions from your five-year-old to entertain, and the delightful squeals from your stunning baby to relish.  And so I confess, on this stultifying humid day, I have wished it were not the least bit unseemly to ask to trade children. I???d only be gone for an hour or twelve. I could seriously use a trip to the bathroom.??? Ashley- Not milk (too obvious).- Something like bread, but not bread exactly; maybe bread-shaped?- Deli sandwich/pointed political commentary ??? white bread, halal meats, and kosher pickles (get it?); but no cheese, because of a lactose intolerance.- Regionally specific boxed candy from the 1980s that you either remember from your childhood or you have to look up on Wikipedia.- Two bottles of strawberry PediaSure, and a callback reference to the decision not to get milk.- A consideration of the fact that the lactose intolerance was only mentioned during the deli sandwich and not during the milk.- A bizarre non sequitur-like panty hose or shoe polish ??? something related to feet.- One bar of soap ??? for a total of eight items, a full two items shy of the expected list of ten, which leaves us room for impulse purchases at the express line and still make the ten items or less requirement.Hello! Welcome to Arbuckleandcrumb.com, the online home of Arbuckle & Crumb: Gary, Indiana???s premier erotic bakery.

That???s our job!Can you make a penis cake for my bachelor party?Arbuckle & Crumb is a family-owned and operated erotic bakery.
