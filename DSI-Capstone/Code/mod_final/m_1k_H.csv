0|Hey neighbor! That???s my naked three-year-old jumping on the trampoline in your backyard. I just happened to notice last week that he really hit it off with your two daughters and I thought  well  heck  this is it! We???ve arrived! This is the village of 9- and 11-year-old girls it will take to raise my child!When we first moved to this neighborhood I had hig|100
1|h hopes. I have always dreamed of finding that spirit of the old African proverb: ???Omwana ni wa bhone ??? which means It takes a village of pretty much anyone other than myself to raise my child  wherever we end up. Before now  I have asked myself countless times over the course of my son???s life  WTF? Where is our village? How will I manage to do this on m|100
2|y own  with only my husband and the nice ladies at the daycare to take care of little Mylo 40 hours per week? And our regular babysitter who comes every Friday and Saturday evening from 6 to 10 so Rick and I can go out for dinner and a movie? And my mother-in-law who comes every Saturday afternoon from 12 to 6 so I can have some me time? And the mother???s hel|100
3|per who comes every Sunday from 12 to 6 to take Mylo outside  away from me  while my husband enjoys his man time? And my sister who brings Mylo food when Rick and I are out of town? And the nice young people who work in the Sm??land at Ikea  where I try to go two evenings per week so I can enjoy the ambience of the furniture displays  a nice plate of meatballs|100
4|  and a cinnamon roll without having to think so much about the location of my child. ???He is in Sm??land ??? I can whisper to myself periodically  and forget about him until it is time to leave. Except one time I whispered the phrase to myself so many times it lost all meaning and I didn???t actually think about him until I got home and I noticed around bedt|100
5|ime that he wasn???t there  but that???s another story. If I had had the village then that I have now??? ah  well  it doesn???t matter anymore  now  does it? Everyone is together again and that???s what matters.Yes  dear neighbors  I have had no village to help me raise this child  with the occasional exception of the nice people from the DSS. Until now.Do you|100
6| see how Mylo so joyfully flings his body off the trampoline  and gets right back on it and does it again  and again  and again? This is the synergy of a three year old boy with 9- and 11-year old girls watching over him. It is a thing of beauty. Your daughters react with such concern ??? this is exactly what is needed in today???s world! It really does take a|100
7| village. And I hope they???ve taken their first aid courses ??? especially the bits about choking and compound fractures. I???ve found those to be the most helpful in my own experience  because as you can see  Mylo loves to jump and eat. Jump and eat  jump and eat. That???s what THAT little villager does. Oh  Mylo!Don???t worry about him peeing on the trampol|100
8|ine as he just did; it will rain soon and everything will wash away. And yes  sometimes he flings his feces but that???s only when you really pressure him to use the toilet. Just don???t pressure him  girls  and everyone and everything will theoretically be clean. But also??? if you could have him completely potty trained in the next two weeks that would be aw|100
9|esome. It really does take a village to potty train a child  don???t you agree?I love to give Mylo as many opportunities as possible to be independent. So don???t be surprised if he shows up at your door in the middle of the night wanting to climb into your beds from time to time. I told him he can???t climb into mine anymore when I???m home but of course he??|100
10|?s always welcome to check with the other villagers  as it were. How???s that for independence? Right? That???s what all that doorbell ringing was about last night. If you would just answer the door straight away  or better yet  leave it unlocked  he could just climb right in and snuggle up with one of the girls  like a wiggly warm animal.  I think of Mylo as |100
11|a cute little kitten that everyone secretly wishes would visit their homes.Also sometimes Rick has a business/leisure trip that overlaps with my own business/leisure trips so we just remember to put a box of Alphabits out for Mylo and he???s pretty good about entertaining himself for a day or two until one of us gets home. We don???t like to leave him on his o|100
12|wn for much longer than that  but sometimes something unexpected comes up and we???re delayed. This did not always go over so well in our old neighborhood  as nobody seemed to understand that it really really does take a village to raise our child except for perhaps the nice  yet grouchy  sometimes helpful  and otherwise frowny people at Child Protective Servi|100
13|ces who Omwana ni wa bhone-ed him for four months earlier this year. If there???s one thing I can say about them  it???s this: they really step up when it???s time to be the village. Surprise!So  neighbor  I???m so grateful for your albeit very small village ??? but a village nonetheless ??? of two nine and eleven-year-old daughters  who will now have the hono|100
14|r of helping me raise this child. I???ll send him over later with a rubber sheet and a box of Alphabits to get you started. Omwana ni wa bhone  amigos!           When you see something about the world that you don???t like  and that doesn???t fit with your ideas of justice  it???s important that you take a stand against it.  That???s why  when I looked at stat|100
15|s and read stories about inequality between men and women  about violence against women  and about how even in small  daily encounters  women are treated unfairly  I thought  ???This isn???t right.  I should become a nice guy.???  So that???s what I did.  And a lot has changed for me.My days of hooting at women on the street are over.  My days of hollering at |100
16|women in hospitals and at church cookouts are long gone.  I now understand that a party might be an appropriate place to strike up a conversation with a woman  but a public bus that has been hijacked and will explode if it goes slower than 55 miles per hour quite simply isn???t.  Even if the police save us  slipping her my phone number while she is talking to |100
17|reporters and quietly sobbing is inappropriateWhen a woman treats me rudely  I no longer assume it must be because of her hormones.  Instead  I take into account the fact that I am in the middle of an intersection  am dancing a jig  and have been blocking traffic for well over forty-five minutes.  The traffic-blocking jig  though full of masculine  poetic ener|100
18|gy  might have something to do with her curt tone.In the workplace  I am trying to be a better listener.  When a woman disagrees with one of my ideas  I no longer think that it must be because she is ugly  lonely  and secretly in love with me.  Instead  I consider the possibility that a competing company already executed the idea I mentioned  it poisoned eight|100
19|y-nine children  and now that company is banned in twelve states and the E.U.  Often  on days when I listen closely like this  I reward myself with a treat  like takeout from an expensive restaurant.  It isn???t a big deal ??? I have a very large salary.  I???m one of those nice guys.Romance can be a bit confusing for us nice guys.  Sometimes I hear that women|100
20| like tough  macho men who have a hint of danger about them  and other times I hear women like sensitive  kind  funny guys who would make good long-term partners.  It???s possible to ask a woman on a first date what kind of partner she???s looking for  but women tend to talk for hours nonstop if you let them  so I???ve taken to splitting the difference.  I???l|100
21|l open the door to a restaurant for a woman  then close it in her face and punch a wall.  I???ll offer to pay for the meal  then when the check comes I???ll light a napkin on fire and disappear out a bathroom window.  Sometimes I???ll text back the next day  other times it will be months and I???ll explain that I???ve changed my name and moved to Argentina.  T|100

I???ve had over twenty-five first dates in the past year.In a certain way  I understand women better than I understand men.Although women are less intelligent than men and have more frivolous interests  a nice guy like me should never point that out.  Take fashion  for instance.  Men know that you should dress in a way|100
23| that is utilitarian  modestly hip  and inexpensive.  That???s where my sweatpantsuit idea came from.  Women think you should spend every waking hour researching new trends and shopping.  Pinterest!  Websites!  Crazy  I know ??? but I don???t point out that I think it???s crazy because I???m nice.  So when my female neighbor asks me if those are mustard stains|100
24| on my sweatshirt and if the hole in my seat can perhaps be patched and if this is truly the life I imagined for myself  I don???t get angry or frustrated.  I just feel superior.  I???m a nice guy.When a nice guy like me disagrees with a woman or doesn???t like how he???s being treated  what should he do?  Women like being the center of attention  so if you po|100
25|int out how you feel uncomfortable or disrespected  they???ll likely make the discussion about how they don???t like how they???re being treated ??? and all of a sudden you???re the bad guy.  No  the best tactic is a bit of judo: use their strength???the ability to get people to feel sorry for them ??? against them.  Instead of explaining why you???re upset us|100
26|ing reasons and logic  simply start crying.  Silent  slow tears at first  and then big  heaving wails.  Their nurturing instinct will kick in  they will comfort you  and if you mention a memory of your dead father  you just won every argument for the next week.  It doesn???t matter that your father is still alive and is coming to visit for your birthday ??? wh|100
27|at matters is that he feels dead in that moment.  See  a nice guy never has to argue to get his way.But that???s not all I have to do as a nice guy.  For instance  I am single  and it is important for me to explain to others that the reason I???m single is not because I am boring  have trouble relating to women  am privately prejudiced  and use niceness as a c|100
28|over for thoughts that are hyper-sexualized and misogynistic.  No  the reason I???m single is because I am too nice!  It???s counterintuitive  so a nice guy like me needs to explain this to women in a way that is verbose and dumbed down.  Together  we can all make the world a better place for women  and the only thing we have to do is act on generalizations ba|100

In case Trump???s explicit avoidance of Subway is dredged up by the media  I???ve compiled talking points to deflect any possible questions or critiques we may encounter.1. Subway is just as unhealthy as McDonald???s.In prepa|100
380|ration for Trump???s eight-year stay in the White House  he???s been following a healthy diet. One of the best diets. If needed  his doctor will provide a note proving this. This is the reason you won???t find Trump eating Subway. It has nothing to do with the sandwich providing scale and highlighting his less-than-average hand size.If the media suggests this |100
381|is an invalid claim  as Trump has been photographed eating food even more unhealthy than Subway  refer to Talking Point 2.2. Subway???s bread contains Azodicarbonamide  the same chemical used to make yoga mats.Donald Trump will not eat anything that is also used to make yoga mats. Trump has never practiced yoga  an Indian ritual  ever in his life. If they want|100
382| to see a politician get into a pretzel-shape  ask Hillary Clinton about her email! Absolutely no reason that Trump would be scared to hold a Subway sandwich because his hands would look diminutive in comparison.If the media points out Subway???s bread no longer contains Azodicarbonamide  refer to Talking Point 3.3. Mr. Trump prefers to support local businesse|100

I pulled out a half ounce of me|100

In the lounge  authorities recovered bullet fragments from approximately a half-dozen strays. One bullet chipped the tile floor  others left holes in the wood-paneled walls. One shattered a stack of glasses. Another entered the ceiling  nicked an electrica|100

598|se I remember haggling with him about the prices  saying you know  it???s really not that much to clean up.???Before the clean-up guy arrived  Lexi and I stopped into the bar. Apart from Stephan and Shira  the place was empty. Stephan immediately asked if we were going to sue him  and we said we weren???t. (???I didn???t know him  and I wasn???t even thinking |100

Someone had placed a folded-open newspaper over the pool. These were li|100

When Lexi got her credit card and receipt from the bar  she saw she???d been charged a gratuity for leaving her card overnight. (This was an accident  Stephan later said.) Lexi also grabbed|100

I was standi|100

After Lexi and I gathered our things and went away  Shira eventually called in another employee  and the two went to work. ???I just wanted to hurry up and get done ??? said Shira. ???We moved all the tables and chairs and mopped and cleaned. We took all the liquor down and gutted behind t|100

It was stupid and weird ??? said Shira. ???But yet they would always take care of each other. If she ended up leaving  he???d pay her tab. Or vice versa ??? she said. When the two were ready to make up  ???they???d go outside and ha|100

People use and misuse  appropriate and massage her poetry to suit their needs  as I did above. Why can???t we just leave this poor poem alone?The original poem is part of a collection of 44 son|100
897|nets called Sonnets from the Portuguese. She wrote them for her husband  Robert Browning  who knew they were brilliant and urged her to publish them. She titled them as she did because the sonnets were deeply personal and she wanted people to think that they had been translated rather than written about her own marriage.Nice try  Liz. We see through your littl|100
898|e scheme.The most famous of the sonnets  number 43  is the one I butchered in those first two sentences. People read it as a breathless love poem where EBB is basically inarticulate with love. (Kind of a stupid assumption about someone who lived her whole life as a poet and also married a poet. Let???s see if we can think of two people more unlikely to be inar|100
899|ticulate??? nope.) In fact  as my brilliant (now retired) University of North Dakota professor and international EBB scholar  Sandra Donaldson  pointed out to my enthralled grad school class  EBB is very articulate in this sonnet  almost scientific. She asks  ???How do I love thee???? and then states ???Let me count the ways ??? before going on to  yes  essent|100

In a series of statements beginning with ???I love thee ??? she details her love for her husband.Aside from misreadings and bastardizations of her work  the other reasons EBB should be pissed off include our lack of attention to her political work. This is not to say that she was a politician  but she did take on important issues in her p|100

This is not|100

She wrote The Runaway Slave at Pilgrim???s Point from the perspective of a slave woman: ???So the white men brought the shame ere long / To strangle the sob of my agony.???Lastly  EBB should be pissed because after her death her husband  Robert Browning  eclipsed her fame and reputation.
