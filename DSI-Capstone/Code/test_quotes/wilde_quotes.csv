Second marriage is the triumph of hope over experience.,Ultimately the bond of all companionship whether in marriage or in friendship is conversation.,On the whole the great success of marriage in the States is due partly to the fact that no American man is ever idle and partly to the fact that no American wife is considered responsible for the quality of her husband's dinners.,Long engagements give people the opportunity of finding out each other's character before marriage which is never advisable.,They flaunt their conjugal felicity in one's face as if it were the most fascinating of sins.,Women represent the triumph of matter over mind just as men represent the triumph of mind over morals.,We have little time and lots to do lets take time for everything we do.,Literature always anticipates life. It does not copy it but moulds it to its purpose. The nineteenth century as we know it is largely an invention of Balzac.,The liar at any rate recognizes that recreation not instruction is the aim of conversation and is a far more civilized being than the blockhead who loudly expresses his disbelief in a story which is told simply for the amusement of the company.,As one knows the poet by his fine music so one can recognize the liar by his rich rhythmic utterance and in neither case will the casual inspiration of the moment suffice. Here as elsewhere practice must precede perfection.,When liberty comes with hands dabbled in blood it is hard to shake hands with her.,Cultivated leisure is the aim of man.,The mind of the thoroughly well-informed man is a dreadful thing.

They at once sought for the journalist found him developed him and made him their industrious and well-paid servant. It is greatly to be regretted for both their sakes.,There is much to be said in favor of modern journalism. By giving us the opinions of the uneducated it keeps us in touch with the ignorance of the community. By carefully chronicling the current events of contemporary life it shows us of what very little importance such events really are. By invariably discussing the unnecessary it makes us understand what things are requisite for culture and what are not.,Bad manners make a journalist.,The best way to appreciate your job is to imagine yourself without one.,Laughter is not at all a bad beginning for a friendship and it is far the best ending for one.,A man's face is his autobiography. A woman's face is her work of fiction.,Perhaps after all America never has been discovered.

Change is the one quality we can predicate of it. The systems that fail are those that rely on the permanency of human nature and not on its growth and development. The error of Louis XIV was that he thought human nature would always be the same. The result of his error was the French Revolution. It was an admirable result.,It is because Humanity has never known where it was going that it has been able to find its way.,The brotherhood of man is not a mere poet's dream: it is a most depressing and humiliating reality.,The world is a stage but the play is badly cast.,Man is made for something better than disturbing dirt.,I'm sure I don't know half the people who come to my house. Indeed from all I hear I shouldn't like to.,Anybody can make history. Only a great man can write it.,To give an accurate description of what has never occurred is not merely the proper occupation of the historian but the inalienable privilege of any man of parts and culture.,Whenever cannibals are on the brink of starvation Heaven in its infinite mercy sends them a nice plump missionary,The heart was made to be broken,I hate vulgar realism in literature.

But scandal is gossip made tedious by morality.,Scandal is gossip made tedious by morality,To be good according to the vulgar standard of goodness is obviously quite easy. It merely requires a certain amount of sordid terror a certain lack of imaginative thought and a certain low passion for middle-class respectability.,If you pretend to be good the world takes you very seriously. If you pretend to be bad it doesn't. Such is the astounding stupidity of optimism.,I see when men love women. They give them but a little of their lives. But women when they love give everything.,A true gentleman is one who is never unintentionally rude.,Put your talent into your work but your genius into your life,From the point of view of literature Mr. Kipling is a genius who drops his aspirates. From the point of view of life he is a reporter who knows vulgarity better than any one has ever known it.,Genius lasts longer than Beauty. That accounts for the fact that we all take such pains to over-educate ourselves.,Ridicule is the tribute paid to the genius by the mediocrities.,The longer I live the more keenly I feel that whatever was good enough for our fathers is not good enough for us.,There is only one real tragedy in a woman's life.

It is the only thing I know anything about.,We can forgive a man for making a useful thing as long as he does not admire it. The only excuse for making a useless thing is that one admires it intensely.,An acquaintance that begins with a compliment is sure to develop into a real friendship.,Selfishness is not living as one wishes to live it is asking others to live as one wishes to live.,I can stand brute force but brute reason is quite unbearable. There is something unfair about its use. It is hitting below the intellect.,In examinations the foolish ask questions the wise cannot answer.,Only dull people are brilliant at breakfast.,Flowers are as common in the country as people are in London.,The amount of women in London who flirt with their own husbands is perfectly scandalous. It looks so bad. It is simply washing one's clean linen in public.,Yet each man kills the thing he loves By each let this be heard Some do it with a bitter look Some with a flattering word. The coward does it with a kiss The brave man with a sword!,People who love only once in their lives are shallow people. What they call their loyalty and their fidelity I call either the lethargy of custom or their lack of imagination. Faithfulness is to the emotional life what consistency is to the life of the intellect -- simply a confession of failures.,One should not be too severe on English novels; they are the only relaxation of the intellectually unemployed.,"When they reached the end of the room he stopped and muttered some words she could not understand.

What the second duty is no one has yet discovered.,Fashion by which what is really fantastic becomes for a moment the universal.,It is only the modern that ever becomes old fashioned.,And now I am dying beyond my means. [Sipping champagne on his deathbed],I can believe anything provided it is incredible.,What a fuss people make about fidelity! Why even in love it is purely a question for physiology. It has nothing to do with our own will. Young men want to be faithful and are not; old men want to be faithless and cannot: that is all one can say.,Those who are faithful know only the trivial side of love: it is the faithless who know love's tragedies.,Misfortunes one can endure -- they come from outside they are accidents. But to suffer for one's own faults -- Ah! there is the sting of life.,We Irish are too poetical to be poets; we are a nation of brilliant failures but we are the greatest talkers since the Greeks.,Newspapers. . . give us the bald sordid disgusting facts of life. They chronicle with degrading avidity the sins of the second-rate and with the conscientiousness of the illiterate give us accurate and prosaic details. . .,Disobedience in the eyes of anyone who has read history is man's original virtue.

And for that reason strange as it may sound to you often are very difficult to interpret (understand). Great passion are for the great of souls. Great events can only be seen by people who are on a level with them. We think we can have our visions for nothing. We cannot. Even the finest and most self-sacrificing visions have to paid for. Strangely enough that is what makes them fine.,Nothing makes one so vain as being told that one is a sinner.,No artist has ethical sympathies. An ethical sympathy in an artist is an unpardonable mannerism of style.,Experience was of no ethical value. It was merely the name men gave to their mistakes.,I love acting. It is so much more real than life.,There is something tragic about the enormous number of young men there are in England at the present moment who start life with perfect profiles and end by adopting some useful profession.,Pardon me you are not engaged to any one. When you do become engaged to some one I or your father should his health permit him will inform you of the fact.

It is more fascinating than history as it is concerned simply with oneself. It is more delightful than philosophy as its subject is concrete and not abstract real and not vague. It is the only civilized form of autobiography.,On an occasion of this kind it becomes more than a moral duty to speak one's mind. It becomes a pleasure.,No publisher should ever express an opinion on the value of what he publishes. That is a matter entirely for the literary critic to decide. I can quite understand how any ordinary critic would be strongly prejudiced against a work that was accompanied by a premature and unnecessary panegyric from the publisher.
