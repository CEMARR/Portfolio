Project 3 for the DSI course was an evaluation of credit default risk using one of the datasets from the UCI Machine Learning database.

The project was itself straightforward: predict the likelihood of credit default for several thousand borrowers based on a range of factors including sex, education, balance, credit limit, and payment history. The data were messy, with an unclear, if not misleading data dictionary, and required extensive cleanup.

Ultimately, the project revealed that, on the whole it was more likely to predict non-default than default. This seems to be due largely to the imbalance between default and non-default, which make up 5% and 95% of the training data, respectively.
