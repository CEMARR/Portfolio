The Iowa Liquor Sales data set collects all the sales data from the state Iowa's package stores - sale date, inventory, vendor ID, sale price, purchase price. Having built a simple linear regression on the full year data for 2015, it was possible to build a projected model for 2016 based on the 2016 first quarter data. With Iowa's markup on liquor already at 30%, it seems untoward to raise the taxes on liquor any higher. Furthermore, it would not generate additional revenue, without also bringing new stores on line.
